the girag an experience I keep being reminded of you know that Bill Bradley story that you told you know and kind of repeating the same thing Bill Bradley was he was a terrible basketball player to start big gangly slow not not terrible but he wasn't good but he had the most relentless pursuit of improvement of anybody that I've ever read you can probably pick up the story but he you know Driss dribbling the ball you know constantly eight hours nine hours a day you know again over and over and over again and that kind of repetition you know it's it's all part of this same pattern of doing the same thing over and over again well I'm glad you bring up it is a great story it's kind of another like Freddie Roach type thing you take this he's a white guy who happens to be tall but he loves basketball he's like nine years old and I know this myself cuz I love basketball and I was a kid just the sound of the ball swishing through the net he just loved that that side of the sound that the feel of it so he had the sort of visceral love of the game but he stunk at it he was tall awkward slow there's no way he'd become good at it so he decided he was going to train himself from a very early age and I call it you know they have a concept in called deliberate practice where you learn to practice what you're not good at because we often if we're taking up archery or basketball we find something that we're good at and we tend to just repeat that and then our practice becomes very one-sided deliberate practices to practice on what you're not good at I call it resistance practice actually practicing at what is painful in enjoying the pain and that's Bill Bradley he put these special glasses on his head that prevented him from looking down so he could he would dribble on a court for ten hours or ten I was three or four hours and he couldn't look down at his feet which trained him to dribble that's the worst thing you can have fear always looking down you're not able to see where what's going on on the court so he did he did that he went on a cruise with his parents across to England and he didn't he wanted to build a practice there he brought his basketball and below-deck there were these incredibly long alleys that would go from one end of the ship to the other that were very narrow he would put on his special glasses and he would dribble back and forth in this narrow area so that he could dribble with absolute complete control he devised all of these other exercises where he could train himself to see almost behind himself or at least way over to the side on and on and on until he became so good that by the time he got into college at Princeton and then later he played for the New York Knicks in the 70s with all the great championship teams people would look at Bill Bradley Nick oh my god this guy is is a born he was born with a basketball in his hand he's naturally gifted he is so graceful he has eyes in the back of his head he could make a pass to Walt Frazier without even looking they didn't realize that he had gone through the most insanely rigorous painful deliberate form of practice ever invented by a single human at leat at a very early age and it made you know it made the game fun for him it was sure it was a lot of pain but by the time he got good and he was in high school all the girls were admiring him you know he was God invited to go to Princeton I mean it paid off and he got a huge level of pleasure and the game became incredibly fun but it was all based on these insane moments and periods of pain that he put himself through
