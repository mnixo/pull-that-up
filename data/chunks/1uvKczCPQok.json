I'm scared to ask you too many questions until we get live well good and we're live Adam green trees fresh from Australia fresh from the bush strike from the bush yeah it's been crazy so I I was thinking about it and I not even the LA part I was just thinking I went from the snowy tops of Montana got home pretty much hugged the family to death went straight to Arnhem landed in the Northern Territory of Australia complete opposite like just first thing in the morning just sweating covered in mosquitoes flat barren ground and then but no humans like a small indigenous population out there and that's it then straight from there so straight from Arnhem Land to Sydney met Kim and Sydney and then straight here to LA and flying in there's just like I don't know how many people live here too many too many there's more people here than in the entire country of Australia that's crazy and remember lots I was here and you're like you know this is the safest place on earth well the safest place in the US and there was that armed robbery or whatever there was in Calabasas there today when we flew in I went into like a cell provider to get a SIM card a dude walks in look full dodgy I knew something was about to go on the the dude that was serving me knew something was going on I kept seeing him looking over my shoulder at this guy he grabs a Bluetooth speaker and it's like pretending like he's going to go to the checkout and I'm just being polite and thinking there's something going on so let's just get him done in the out of the store then he goes through a full runner for it to destroy at the door with this Bluetooth speaker but old mate like had his runners on and chased him down and got it off him really yeah yeah and I'm like every time I come here there's something crazy going on well if you're in the wrong place the wrong time is plenty crazy going on yeah sure that there's just so many people there's so many people that's what it is yeah yeah there's no way around it but you know fairly safe [Laughter] water buffaloes I they're not fucking papers not bullshit that's crazy safer than people know when you're Adam Greentree maybe it's safer because you know what you're doing you know you know what a huh but you were telling a story on whose podcast was it uh Jay Scott's I forget whose podcast it was - you were telling the story about one of your friends that got gored later that got gored by a bull yeah yeah see that's not good did I tell you that story No so what happened he shot a scrubber telling people would have scrub bull yes how scrub bulls like just like domestic cattle but it's been out in the wilderness many many generations exactly like a real feral inbred looking they're crazy looking and they're crazy dangerous player so here's a photo of when we look I mean that looks amazing yeah it's such a cool looking animal are so much different and that's pretty much a purebred Brahman that one there's that one whoa yeah that's it that looks like so when you say it's a purebred Brahma that means uh that's that's a pretty good-looking bull if you go up the top Jamie there's a couple more at the top that red one that you just under don't yeah that's a pretty typical scrub bull there that's it that's a fellow they don't know actually in Australia stick Bowie's guy yeah he's got a tread baby that's all we hunt with is the tread but Jesus why do people do that to themselves so the problem with these animals obviously don't respect fences and they'll go on buried and interbreed with like a farmer's stock and things like that is that is that bad for the farmer style definitely yeah they'll just go straight through fences and but are you know even calm yeah he'll have a heap of calves and they want to be purebred anymore you know so they're not they're not good for Reber eating or they won't fetch the same value at the market - what is the difference in like the genetics like what do they look they look different they they look a fair bit different so that first ball that Jamie showed was like a Brahman ball then one of those scrub bulls which is just bits of friggin every sort of bull over a lot of generations will come in and interbreed with it and then sort of wrecks the herd and when when did they get released or when did they escape well it would have been with the first cattle that come into Australia so 1800 1800 yeah Wow yeah so they're just sort of morphed and become wild animals yeah in a wild balls very dangerous very dangerous yeah so what happened was Pedro shot this ball and dropped like you know dropped unconscious he thought it was dead walked up to it it jumped up like he literally got up to it and it jumped up and anyway they'd end up getting him against the tree like he ran to get up a tree he felt it hit him and it sort of lifted him up the tree he climbed up the tree this is the gross bit then he felt something warm and his legs and look down in his guts and everything hanging down over his legs but he's a tough bastard he gathered his stomach back up and sort of held it in place then the bull actually died he climbed down out of the tree and end up dying two times I think once in the air because the Royal Flying Doctors come in grabbed him because he's a long way out in the middle of nowhere and then once on the table is operating table as well Wow he survived all that and in a dying of a bloody mass heart attack so no way yeah when he was only thinking is I need 36 or 37 do you think it had anything to do with the American was related at all really yeah you would think that a guy could get past getting gored by all you push his guts back into him like that guy's not gonna get a heart attack that's life's not fair right wow that's crazy yeah Oh Thank You Jaime I think it was adjusting everyone asked me about my boots I'll get a glimpse of me whatever shoes that I'm wearing I'll shoot some awesome animal and they're like what shoes you win beer heads man that's a big thing about hunting is how many people are like crazy gear heads yeah like what you want to know what kind of bow you have what come here what's I do you run in like what and that's kind of shit of all that's really uninteresting to me maybe because I've done it for so long I sort of don't care about the gear as long as it works as good as it should you know and that's because everyone asked me to keep doing these tip things that's one I hate doing that I hate listening to them but if you're a new guy coming in to bow hunting and obviously you want to know some people love that stuff man like John Dudley's tips that he does like that he does this live Instagram and YouTube but Facebook feeds where he like take a bow apart put it back together again explain the cam systems extreme with it to extreme he's so he's my go-to guy if I don't know something that I'm doing that's I'll go straight to dudley yeah Dudley's podcast if you're into archery is called knock on his the in the knock on podcast is without a doubt the most in-depth archery podcast from not just hunting from a hunting standpoint but from just target archery how you know how important technique is I mean he's a mmm real master yeah loves yeah yeah and he's a super gearhead - hey how's your um how's your side rope toy but you know I'm crazy it's going good the sober parts easy the the hot yoga were in the home stretch today was number 13 so I got two more I'm banging them out this week I'm gonna do tomorrow on Friday and be done with it yeah because I want to get back to doing other stuff and when you do a 90 minute yoga class it's hard to lift weights or run or do anything else you don't really want to do anything else you know so I'm just gonna bang it out yeah Kim's done it once and she reckons it was like hell I think she had a big drinking session before it was in Bali and she just made some stupid promise to this Balinese woman and then this Balinese woman's ringing her up the next morning like where are you for yoga Kim just thought it was yoga though so she's like I can do yoga in my sleep and she gets here and it's like in this hot room and stuff and it made it was killing us on Bali - I would imagine is very humid humid would be muggy as hell yeah Ari was talking about that today because Ari does yoga in New York which is way more humid than it is in yeah in California Californians dry yeah so he was probably loved and I just oh yeah we went to a different place today today we went to a place that was more mild so yeah there's not as hot but um it's not it's your body gets used to it it's interesting yeah like there's a lot like you know I do that cryotherapy yeah yeah well I did it too yesterday for the first time in about three weeks I guess and it was hard yeah whereas I do it when I do it every day it's not the condition to it you just get in there and I do but it's it's quick how that conditioning goes away yeah hi did you say the pig Tufts that I brilliant dude it's pretty bad devastated them yet these are cutters no I've never killed a boar I'm going to kill the South you need to come to us try a miner I do been scared look at your Instagram feed and I see a brown snake that could kill you or a spider that can kill you or fucking saltwater crocodiles are you doing playing with crocodiles the other day we're coming in the camp dude there was a couple of I wish I captured it on video there was one that she I think it was a female anyway she must have been coming around the back of camp unnoticed so when she was heading back to the water she was literally coming straight for a camp to get back to the water and yes I that thing that photo doesn't do that thing justice that photo scares the shit out of me that's a real that's a real live monster right there how big was that fucker he's about five and a half meters well he's giant he's old you can even see it in the texture of his body he's just a real log cross five and a half meters two Americans I want to think about 15 feet America there's so a few people are being taken at this spot mostly indigenous had been grabbed at that spot over the years and when you see an ancient piece like that is a chance he's a maneater yeah yeah yeah they just ruthless like look how old do you think of 15 and a half foot crocodile is no I don't want to comment because I don't know and I'll probably get it wrong I would like to know like how long does it take them to grow 15 and a half feet so you could find that Jaime saltwater croc I'm pretty sure they leave over 100 years yeah they live a long time right no say ruthless - yeah like people who live in Florida don't get those confused with alligators yeah they're a different completely different animal so we've got the freshwater crocodile which just lives in freshwater then we've got the saltwater crocodile but he lives in both you know and and so a lot of people get that confused like how it's freshwater I'll be right the go for a swim No so the freshwater crocodiles are not as aggressive and they're not as aggressive they might get a bit territorial but they're not gonna grab you to eat you whereas the salty will grab you to eat you just look like you know they keep growing throughout their lifespan require more and more food with the amount when the amount of food is unavailable they die from starvation and the reason why you don't see a thousand year old crocodiles that are 50 feet long wow that's the law holy shit the way they died is out of starvation or is if they contract a disease oh my god they just keep growing so that's why they that's crazy are these ones in captivity because they're getting hand fed yeah probably get the biggest like that's where you'll see the biggest Crocs the Guinness Book of World Records the saltwater crocodile caught in Australia as the largest crocodile in captivity measures 17 feet 11.75 inches so basically 18 feet yep that's huge oh-ho me buddy my body angles nickels no have it he's he's a like a youtube sensation he's been capturing just about everything in Australia for the last millennium and he's he's seen a 6-meter crocodile before when there's one of these guys you don't bullshit like if he says he's seen a 6-meter crocodile he's soon a 6-minute crocodile yeah but that's just the biggest one in captivity right that's right yeah and Australia has a ton of food ton of food yeah so it's not like it doesn't starve to death this river system we went down there fishing and we probably traveled an hour down the river and a little teeny little boat I reckon we've seen 200 to 250 saltwater crocodiles in that time she's like because like they can't harvest them or they don't color me out or anything like that do their is their loss protecting them so there's as low as protecting them so that's why the place is just riddled with imatinib why are there lost protecting us there it sounds like they're interested well anything that's a night even Australia he's protected so like you guys you know how you can hunt your white-tailed deer and everything like that Australia can't hunt kangaroos you can't hunt any native so everything we're hunting is an introduced species that's a crocodile's a native so you can't hunt them there's been talk about bringing in like a program but I don't hopeful happen but that's that's so weird yeah that seems to me to be very strange like completely different system yeah yeah but well it makes sense that you guys hunt all the non-native species because they're invasive and yeah devastate the wild the land and the other wildlife mean like you guys have crazy problems with feral cats we talked about that before and you know you have pigs everywhere and named and donkeys yeah out horses even the funny ones that people don't think about like donkeys wild horses camels I think camels probably get a little bit of exposure then we've got all your typical stuff you know pigs goats we've got the 60 year species so if we didn't have any of those introduced species we would there would be no hunting in Australia so what what are they that sounds nuts like so they're only hunting just to get rid of the invasive species yeah that's correct how do they control the populations of the Kangaroos zero you can get like a permit I couldn't as a bow hunt or just a hunter couldn't get a permit but if you're a professional shooter lucky shooting for human consumption or pet meat or something like that or if you're a big landowner you can get like a tag or permits to shoot kangaroos then every now and then there be an organised column because they let them get so far out of control that they eat the ground down to dust pretty much then they lay around and die slow death of a couple of months because they lose nutrition you know there's they're weak and they don't move and it's obviously it's a bit very painful wafer and we go once it gets to that point it seems like they're like oh we need to do a coal now so and it all it is is we're spoken about these people before the Greenies you know this is these people that really don't have a good picture on it and see that a coal or a hunting program is actually better welfare for the animals because they stay healthier and in check well they yeah they don't have any predators especially exactly yeah some places got wild dogs with dingoes but that's about it yeah and how many dingoes can take out a kangaroo those kangaroos get pretty goddamn big yeah they do yeah they do they take them out they try and take down Buffalo and stuff but they know they're really yeah I don't think that very successful they'd pick off a pig or a pig little something like that instead yeah man you know it's just I just don't understand why they would not try to keep the crocodiles in check if you've seen hundreds and hundreds of crow I was like that because one of those things gonna eat what's going on here Jamie a croc showed up in front of somebody's shop and they were trying to get rid of it and that's it really don't know how a month ago well they have helmets on IV they're gonna hate about it this guy's got a gaff what is he gonna do here kind and throw a tarp on it so they call Christ like a bad idea this is Solaris they're all wearing camo but why they wearing red camel there might be the fireman I think it looks like the Kumar's record there but why do firemen wear camo what are they blended into that's already not that's a uniform you think but that helmet looks like a motorcycle helmet a different country captain diversity over here Jamie's not big that's a good sized car he's a big fucker and he's got his mouth open too like he's like bitch I'll kill you all they're scary I oh they're so different yeah like I grew up when I was not want to grew up actually but I lived there for three years I lived in Gainesville Florida and when I lived there alligators were protected they used to be protected and we should go to this place called Lake Alice and we would throw marshmallows into the water and the alligators would come up and eat the marshmallows but then they started snatching people's dogs maybe that's one lady too freaked out one snatch her dog just pull it right off her leash and she's freaked out yeah and that's re happening more and more and then the population got denser and denser one point in time they're endangered now they're infested now there's so many alligators that they have that you ever see that show swamp people yeah yeah that show where they go hunting for alligators which you know people make purses and shoes and shit out of them they get 500 tags yeah 500 so they could shoe 500 fuckin elegant yeah just ate a puppy like and healthy and the food is apparently very good yeah that the tail meat is apparently delicious I think Benny I Brian was just down there somewhere maybe a month back oh yeah you know down there and now they must set a line and hook them harvest them now taking a heap of meat obviously the air off the skins and things like that leather off the skins the meat is very good Dudley hunts him he Bo Hanson yeah every year he goes to Orlando Atlanta I'd like to yeah it'd be pretty cool well they taste good too and they're and it's a conservation thing too because it's like yeah I really do need to control their populations yeah Australia needs to get to that point what what's happening now is they're pushing into domestic waters you know like Darwin the city's like build around you know a big big river Ben let or a big water system and the guys will go swim in there and get taken all the time how all people's dogs jump in and they get taken I think I've seen a video I don't know if it was in Darwin or where it was but um some ladies filming and then you just say the back of a croc go under like a jetty and then the the face of the croc comes out and it's got a full-sized domestic dog in its jaws have you say no it was imagine saying that how creepy is that it was swimming it out like a river system I got like a seems like like some sort of aqueduct yeah yeah yeah oh yeah crazy I'm big dog they just now everyone's like you know everyone talks about there it is Bigfoot this is the one that's it yeah oh Jesus Christ [Music] God that thing is so big like fluffy that is a monster just straight up I mean what are they like I think they're more than 30 million years old yeah I think I really don't think they've changed in 30 plus million years I think they just look at everything as potentially food yes and that's where the risk is and it's the same wave farm it's the same with a big grizzly bear you know they just look at everything as Eva danger so they feel threatened and want to attack it or its food have you ever seen Jim shock ease show you know that show Uncharted they does yep I have yet Jim shock ease uncharted one of them ones he went to Africa and I think it was the Congo I think it was the Congo River is that the copy' the Congo River I don't know anyway it was a river and this native population that lived there these villagers they lived right on the river banks and they were just getting taken left and ripe a crocodile I think of everyone in the village had like an arm missing or a chunk cut other head is this it right here Jim chakra Mozambique Mozambique there we go thank you and Jim shock is just amazing yeah but these things look at what they got here one of them was feasting on some sort of an animal look at these guys they all have like a stump where their arm is in the gym and so they wanted to bring in professional hunters to try to help control the population because they were actively targeting the people that live there and these people I mean they live in a very small very primitive village and all they have is the water I mean that's that's where they're getting their water from which turning off is about to fucking make the kill shot YouTube glitches fuck oh really kept flashing what is that I needed to refresh it it was just the foam happens on YouTube on the computer or normal just normal but it's just the poor people that live there you just gotta imagine if this is your only play these people aren't traveling then have cars they don't have they're not flying anywhere this is where they live they have to build these sort of fences around these little tiny bays they build these small makeshift fences to try to protect themselves from the crocodiles when they clean their you know the cleaner food or you gather water or wash their clothes once that risk every day this is one of the reasons why I do these radical hunts because it makes you realize how good we've got it right yeah like like we just go to the top and turn the tap on we get water or if you want to share her a buff it's in the comfort of your own house these people are just trying to get water to drink and they could get snatched or people are being snatched it's no ridiculous oh yeah and that's their life and there's no other life they know yeah their ancestors have been there and their grandparents have been there their fathers have been there their mothers and now them yeah and this is life yeah that's why anytime someone complains about Australia or living in the US or whatever it's like dude look what you've got so easy isn't it crazy it's so crazy I mean I was watching your Instagram feed when you were taking water out of this Buffalo wallow and throwing it through a filter yeah and put it in now what's the big concern because all right like when I looked into the filter it might be still live on the instagrams yeah no it's normal so normal Instagram normal it's good yeah see it that way we could see so to start as I moved probably 200 Buffalo off that waterhole and like a couple of mobs of pigs that we're all like they go out and ride out into the water and try and cool off he has at least one big saltwater crocodile in there as well but I'm walking out there with that bag too clearly by yourself yeah I'm by myself do you yeah and sleeping in a little cloth house yeah I have a guys back in camp but I was just down by myself is that it this was pretty new I don't know if it was older yes I think it's it and yeah yeah yeah yeah barefoot walking up to the water with this pumps it I'm gonna look at this water look at these there's a big friggin Buffalo turd sitting right there that's all through the water yeah do not drink and then friggin dehydrate and die out there but you drink and turn water yeah but that's why I hope the filter works how these filters work how does that well they they claim to filter out 99.99999% of all the germs it's that point zero zero zero zero one it's gonna fuck yeah yeah or something on the edge of the bag that runs down you know that's probably going to get you but how often do you get beaver fever when you do I've never been I've never been sick from drinking water and the bush or eating that's any of the meat or anything like that nobody I've ever talked to then spends time in the bush gets sick how have you not gotten sick I don't know same anybody Andrea calls and he seems like a pretty hearty dude and he's like ice have you had this and I'm like nah have you had this unlike not have you had this like nice nearly died and there's like what I've had none of those and I've drank oh there was one time I was so desperate for water this is going back to when I was like so you mean actually looks alright just looks how you'd taste after filtering the water tastes like piss like piss and I'm like the filter yeah should know because the taste is obviously from something but it's still pest it's still pissed but it's probably actually really good for you drinking piss is good for him with drinking that water do you put like I see you got a mountain ops bottle do you put like something like flavoring in there just the mosque it a bit I think I'm running out at this point that was like 27 kilometer hike that died so you just deal with the taste do you just deal with and you know what you're that first e that it doesn't nearly bother you at the time well when you did that epic hunt up here in cow and we were you start in Colorado yeah and then you went to Idaho Idaho but I didn't actually hunt Idaho across through Idaho into the back of Montana yeah and I trying to find a spot with limited hunters and more elk and we were all following you on Instagram story that wasn't on those tapes that I left out of it and I'm like I'll just save this for Joe but well I got really sick like from like there was just liquid coming out of friggin everything from water I don't want admit that because a couple of people wrote a message isn't like that's a good way to get sick and I'm like I've done his heaps and rank right now on the ground right actually I eat some jerky that had been I left it in the tent and the tent got really hot like the start of the hunt it was the heat was soaring you know mm-hmm and the the jerky went a bit sweaty in that in the bag but I was starving so I'm like I'm just gonna eat it and then it was nearly like two hours later that I was like yeah and I feel real good but I'm I've never been tent down in me life and I'm just like not just keep hunting don't worry about it so but okay this is bad I probably shouldn't say it but I literally hunt for five minutes and have to pull me straight you know and then go number twos and then walk for another five minutes and be like ah fuck you know two days I think that's because I lost 17 kilos I lost ten of them in them couple of days Wow yeah what saying pounds seventeen kilos it's a lot of pounds 35 yeah you lost that much weight I had me pants will fall off me dude like wow like literally falling off me from being titling ways to falling off me so this is because you were hiking every day yeah just how I can every day I hiked over friend of miles a lot 440 miles I think it was all up 22 days that's so crazy that's limited food and you know maybe that bad jerky helped as well Oh Mike so I'm gonna start a weight-loss program Bert Kreischer my friend Bert did a yoga with today he's obsessed with you like a green she's gonna be on the podcast I heard Kim sent me a link and she's like you should have used this podcast and I listen to it and he's like I feel like I could be friends of that dude and I'm like yeah we can be friends then he put friggin on Instagram some dude trying to milk his nipples we can't be fuckin friends but he's won me back either could he done that hilarious video if you dancing the dial oh yeah yeah we did our 13th he and I did our 13th yoga class today and re and Tom were on number 14 two more to go for me one for those two guys that's awesome we're at the home stretch that's a good effort yeah nothing compared to 28 days in the bush yeah it was good I loved it I missed a lot of things like it makes you realise you know like I said how lucky we are just in life and and I've always been the person that doesn't take anything for granted anyway but it's just that you know really rings home you know the simple things so you just just went out there look you didn't necessarily have a good area that had been scouted and I definitely didn't have a good area but um met a real nice young dude actually messaged me through Instagram and at the time I could hardly get to any messages and but anyway I was one that I read and he's like look why you're in this unit he picked what unit I was in he's like come over to this area of hunted it for you know pretty much my whole life and there's a few good bulls there and you know the first day or the second day that I was in there I've seen three really good bulls and that's what kept me there because I kept thinking I'm gonna find them Bulls again and they just cleared off they just moved out of the area the whole idea of hunting Colorado was cuz last year I had a couple issues with Grizzlies in Montana and doing it solo I'm like you're you're a decade if you do that again because you've got three young kids and a beautiful wife like it's a big risk to take like I take risk but that's one that's out of my control you know grizzly going yeah yeah and so I kept trying to avoid that area and then when I wasn't finding bulls like so I end up moving out of Colorado went to Idaho and walked into the back of Montana where they're supposed to be less Grizzlies and that's where I got charged by grizzly there's a lot of Grizzlies in Montana man it's crazy they're out of control - they're just friggin like the Crocs on dry land you saw Grizzlies in Colorado like dead yet this is that this is a you'd think I've caught so much flak over that now you're positive these were grizzle 100% now what there's a black there's black bear in the same area right and I'd nearly could do the comparison because there was black bear there and it was a grizzly there I'd seen the black bear first and I'm like are there and you'll see the video like oh there's a black bear over there it's pretty cool she's got cubs so I just want to try and avoid her then looking at this our bear and I've seen Grizzlies before this thing's a completely different beast there's no mistake in the two it's not like that's just it that's a young looking grizzly that mate so now it looks like a big black bear no it's a friggin massive grizzly and compare it to a massive black bear there's still a massive height difference and everything the big raked up shoulders the big square head you have a spotting scope with you no I did not just have me binoculars and 1042 s 10 by 42 is the mavens yeah yeah so the same ones you're good you get a you got a good look at it awesome look but at that point I just figured ah shit there is Grizzlies in Colorado just a couple of people that told me oh you won't see Grizzlies there just didn't know the area right so I didn't think much of it so I did the little film through the by nose and stuff like that and like there's a big mama grizzly up there she's got Cubs I definitely want to stay away from her then I wanted to haul my ass out of that because that's it in a basin I wanted to haul my ass out of that basin I'm not sleeping that Basin for the night so I've moved on pretty quick got to the top of the ridge looked at her again she was feeding along I'm like cool then slept on the other side of the ridge then come back through there in the morning spotted her again in the morning kept walking out of there then I got reception again and then I had a heap of messages that's not supposed to be any Grizzlies in Colorado I'm like fuck I just I just blew it off as in are there is Grizzlies here shit these guys got it wrong not that it's a massive big deal and that there's not supposed to be at all when no one wants to admit that there they are they're so is it that no one wants to admit it or is it you were deep into the tree yeah that as well so you don't amount of people there's been multiple sightings in the area I don't want to say the area because next year I'm gonna go back and document it with a decent camera and everything like that I try get it for some video though yeah do I get some real good evidence and stuff like that so I haven't really spoken about a lot since then because I just got pounded with messages gone there's no Grizzlies in Colorado you idiot but don't you want to tell like wildlife biologists or someone that apparently they already know and they don't want to meet it because of the whole protected species act and everything like that what does that mean though why would they want to admit that there's bears there I think it might be a pain in the ass I don't know I don't understand didn't I but I'm keen to get to the bottom of it you know it sort of I I end up on this walking back in there again and I'm gonna try and get some good evidence but it seems to me that they would want I don't understand why they would want to deny the existence and what not even though I but a lot of people are saying this actually I think there's a website where it takes in people sightings and stuff like that and all the sightings and the last Grizzlies known in Colorado all in this mountain range that probably gives a lot of it away what's it's a nose a San Jose mountain range it is yeah yeah you know it's massive mountain Riyadh I'm not too worried all the last sightings were there and I think the last sightings were in the IEDs maybe the early 90s there was Grizzlies and when you look at a map and you look at the range it's it be nothing from the be there still right well there's Christmas also all new ones walk in there there's Grizzlies in Wyoming right yeah yeah that's connected yeah so of course they're probably there why do they think that I don't know you get up there and you have a look at this man range and it's just hundred percent grizzly country oh look at that that one there edible sighting occurred in 2006 near an independent pass officials investigated but found nothing the 1979 bear had cubs are likely dead mm-hmm that's a is that a bear right there that they got on camera that's obviously a grizzly yeah you could tell the difference I saw one in Alberta I've only seen one gracefully there if that is a colleague yeah this thing that I seen towers over that like we're talking about a fully mature mother grizzly bear so you're talking about like a 10-foot bear yeah just a huge bear like there's no mistaking it this thing would wind chills walk and you could see like she's out here like this you know like we've had when they get bigger mature you'll see they've got like a silverback on them like a grip like a gorilla you know they've got this silverback on them like this that's like the last part of the hair goes silver she's that she's that right color the right shape the right size and everything so hmm so you only saw her and her Cubs or some or her inner Cubs and then the other one there's a photo of another one that's just a cinnamon black bear and I think a lot of few people got confused and that's probably on my end from I just posted a story about a grizzly and then I had these other bear shots dr. Grizzles from 2011 it says that woolly Steamboat Springs yeah okay that's Colorado all right I nearly look at that as a cinnamon fuzzy black bear to go to I'm all wrong go go do you make that larger Jamie hmm that might be grizzly yeah but yeah you might be right though that could be a color face brown bear black bear rather it could be just looking at if it's a younger grizzly then maybe not but you know she just had this friggin massive head dude like flared out like this you know the big Ridge on the back and it would be interesting if Adam green tree was the one who proved the wrong Australia yeah but the the point is there's very few people that are going down into mountain ranges like how far back will you from the trailhead well so I've rode a really rough trail head on a mountain bike for so far then that trail pretty much disappeared out to it nothing then I hiked a fool must have been seven hours because she was like just before you know sundown so it would have been a good seven hours in the back then and that's because there was no elk that's going nonstop you know and if we watch the video run a lot of it because it was just what I call dead country you know there was not not really good looking hunting country so you'll see me sort of trotting along most of it so it was a long way back there was no human footprints up there there was nothing like that ten miles 15 miles probably see s 60 miles I think it was so the odds of people going back there on a regular basis of probably pretty slim variously yeah so they probably just don't know and know that that's one of the issues that the pair they're dealing with in BC you know and BC when you talk to the people that live there versus the people that are you know how BC is band grizzly hunting yeah the people that live in Greece BC are terrified of that now yeah so like we have to control these goddamn things like you like what they say the people that I know that live up there they say the wildlife biologists are rarely here yeah like they need and the hunters that people that live up there the Outfitters just like you need to take a like from us and the way they describe it is like there was a gritty Bowman did a podcast about this with one of the guys that lives up there that's a an outfitter and he was saying we encountered them all the time and they're hyper aggressive yeah like you you're talking about people these biologists that are rarely there there's not like any like really involved intricate census that they're doing with their you know really in-depth accounting of all the Bears it's like you got to get information from the people that lived there yeah dude they're gonna tell you there's a lot of them yep yeah well they're not smart enough to control their selves right because a lot of these people just want to sit back and just let these animals do what they want to do that's the idea they want to do in BC they think that what they can do is I mean this is speculation but they think that what they can do is let the instead of let the people control the Predators they think let the Predators eat all the game that they can and then when they don't have enough food their populations are naturally going to diminish ya know like I like the idea ain't gonna work what can happen but it could take 5060 years yeah and the problem is along now you're gonna get a lot of human death and a lot of get a lot of pets getting a lot of animals are gonna invade into the farmlands yeah it just seems to me that that's not a wise way to handle it no definitely no and it's also they're gonna have to pay money to kill problem bear yeah yeah instead of making money but they don't like look this whole Cecil the lion thing I think fucked a lot of people up you know people the idea of some evil person just going over there and shooting some beloved animal that became the narrative and everybody sort of has this idea in their head that this is what bear hunting is it's the same sort of thing we don't want that in BC ya know it's it's it really is something that needs to be discussed on both sides and I think both sides have points when it comes to like quote unquote trophy hunting you know yeah yeah I'm definitely not for one of the other no it's not like we want to wipe them off the face in a portion we just want to see these healthy a healthy population and the people that live around there a lot of them depend on moose meat and deer meat and these bear are going to decimate your populations if they don't control the populations of bear they will decimate something else is going to change yeah they're gonna decimate the the game population yeah sure I don't I actually think the areas that I hunt in Montana aren't overpopulated with Grizzlies from what I've seen they're just populate they're just populated you know that so this the the place that I end up going into in Montana isn't my usual spot you know and it wasn't supposed to be as many Grizzlies and that was you would have seen the video where I I walk over the rise and then all of a sudden we locked eyes at the same time and then she in a split second she just comes straight at me and I'll tell the story because heaps of people keep asking but I'm one of these people that I practice with whatever I'm shooting with remember when the the free daily fee suits came out it was a like a camouflage suit and I had like 3d leaves on it hanging off it and I like I got laughed at because I went to the archery range and shot in it and the first time I shot in the boat the string of the bow hit the leaves and my shot was off so it's a billy shoe yeah ghillie suit like just practice wood with whatever you using so my buddy's sheriff you know idaho he's gonna lend me a hand gun so he lends me a hand gun like dude I've never even shot a handgun you just can't get him in Australia like that so I want to practice we went out and practice and we practiced with a cheaper bullet you know and it was like a solid solid bullet it was awesome I picked it up straight away and there was no drama I was a good shot with that just trying to do a rough shot thinking if a bear ever gets you it's kind of in a rush it's not like these you know pull it pull the gun out and have a heap of time so I was practicing shooting one here and and everything like that anyway when it comes to going on the hunt he gave me some expense banty bullets and now our hollow-point was like a real flat front on it so we never shot those bullets anyway this grisly charged I pulled the gun out she stopped that 20 meters the first time like I just stayed stationary I didn't want to do any radical movements but I just yelled at her she stopped at 20 meters she turned back and went to a cub and at this point a Cubs just at the base of the tree she got there as soon as she seen that the cub was alright she just comes straight back at me again like like massive bear like racing straight at me I had the handgun so the handguns out now cuz I pulled Leigh out the first time this time she come all the way to 10 meters and I and I'll actually leave this video out just for now I'll just tell her how it went and I pulled the gun out of yelled at her again like that she stops she did a big swipe on the ground spun around went straight back to the cub again she soon as she got back to the cub this time she ran to the side like tried to flank me and it freaks me out how fast these things can move like like you seen how fast a deer can get off the mark I reckon the grizzly is faster than a deer and you think of the size of a grizzly and it can still move at the speed of a deer or faster like and she just disappears into this there's all this scrub beside me I can't see so I'm like standing there like like just waiting where's she gonna pop out because I fought the third time she's gonna shake fucking around she's gonna try and kill me the third time right you know she never showed up and I stayed there for a little while I'm like just start backing up and I that's where I've got the camera out because the other thing I'm fearful of is shooting one and not being able to justify it because you people go to jail get massive fine so I'm like I want a document this third time that she's coming I'm probably gonna pull the trigger on a document anyway i back out she sort of stalks along a little bit like watching me and stuff like that then she disappears and I walk away and then I realized the guns jammed the guns means you're in that whole time and I was like let's say shit so she did come for me like truly come for me I was fucked like there was no doubt that was a chance what was going on those hollow points with the flat face on wouldn't load up into the chamber of the gun they hit on the throat of the the revolver and won't go up in there so you'd never would have gotten off a shot I would never would have gotten off a shot oh and then I was thinking went the time that she come to ten meters because I thought she was gonna jump me it when she come that time and I was like fuck I'm surprised the gun didn't go off because I'm sure I had the finger on the trigger like I just remember thinking wait and it happened that fast that I reckon that second time she come at me when she was about the 12 or 11 meter or even when she just come past the original mark that she stopped at 20 meters I reckon I pulled the trigger and it didn't go off and I kept thinking like there's a slide lock on the gun and I kept thinking that was jammed up and it wasn't at all so those bullets just didn't fit in that gonna fit in there so you never practiced with him and also he entire time you were unarmed yet Titan was unarmed I bought I bought bear spray from Cabela's right this I man was like the world was fucking out to get me I bought bear spray from Cabela's and it's only odd and the lady didn't put in the bag and I got it there and I'm packed the bags I'm like where's the bear spray fuck I don't even have the bear spray made so I was even gonna when she was on me if I even had this chance I was either gonna pull an arrow out of the bow and just try and stab her I don't know or do you lay dead and cop it or what they say with a female grizzly you just try to lay dead because they're just trying to eliminate a threat their cubs I feel like it'd be really hard to lay dead when something scratching you up yeah I feel like it does the instinct to try and go back at it yeah well they're so goddamn powerful so that happened and I'm like you know what like I've got a hike out of there anyway I'm unarmed so I've got a hike out of there I've got to get bullets from somewhere I might as well go back to the fucking bad grizzly spot you know which at least I know there's elk there but I've been trying to not do it you know what caliber of gun is this point 45 okay yeah that's a good gun yeah but the drama started way before then because I'm like if I'm gonna do this hunt I want to have someone with me like a hunting buddy I'm not going to do that one solo anymore because of the grips because of the Grizzlies and I'd say I invited Shane Doreen here buddy Shane he was coming and then the tags in Montana got really hard to get so he couldn't get a tag then I was gonna have under on a film the hunt but I found that they couldn't film in a wilderness area so they couldn't be there and I'm just like I'm just destined the oh there by myself and it was like I already knew some shit was gonna go down you know it's like everything kept pushing me in that direction now go back to Montana you'll be right you know you're just gonna encounter a grizzly that's it so put this thing in front of your face don't put it by your neck I think I might've been like this when I started to show and you know just come back oh you're freaking out that's what's going on I think I'm hunched I'm trying to get tall because I'm talking about Grizzlies and I'm okay goose bumps just yeah I watched the video probably a week ago and it was just not of attack or anything it was just of a big grizzly and I had all them feelings rushed back to me like it was like I had a full adrenaline rush and everything dude like that my body was full pumping and I and to the point I was starting to feel uncomfortable I'm like fucking what's going on I'm like fuck I just it was just that grisly video I'm thinking about that grizzly running that me I could see her as clear as day still coming at me I remember seeing a shoulders moving dude as she was just race and I can just remember seeing a shoulders like pulsating like you know all of our hair movin and yeah fuck that yeah did you Vennela just release the podcast to podcast in a row they got charged by a big male grizzly on Kodiak they had killed an elk not on Kodiak a fog neck yeah which is my thing in these videos yes so yeah they they they just did a podcast on two podcasts in a row and they shot an elk and the afognak Islands they have Roosevelt elk which is a very large elk and they're the biggest Roosevelt Elks is a huge animal 1,400 pound animal and it's crazy thick brush and they're packing this thing out took forever right so they shot it when they left some of it there they went back to go get the the elk and a grizzly bear had obviously claimed it they didn't know and they were hanging around eating sandwiches they didn't have their guns out nothing and the bear just came running in just charged into all of them one of the guys dirt meth wound up riding by the back of the bear it is a fucking crazy story and they're talking about just a giant fair ten 11-foot grizzly bear this is you know when people like how do you believe in Bigfoot and stuff like that we don't fuckin have to there's a real live monster yeah but we just used to seen it we call it a grizzly bear okay if fuckin can eat you oh it eats everything it eats everything they just savage they're so big I don't think people understand how big they are I haven't seen a big one in the US in the wild but I saw a small one in Alberta in the wild and it scared the shit out of me all right the one that was on my elk carcass last year and we spoke about it on last year's podcast I remember thinking it's face is bigger than my whole torso do ya and and I'm just like like that should be mythical but it's fucking not it's like it's living here right now and there's states that are protecting them ya know like holy shit yeah they want to control health the populations grow I think your vote would change really quickly about protecting them if it fucking ate your dog or one of your kids or yeah I think people it would be very hard to get people to vote if it killed a dog yeah cuz people go well you know they were here first it's when they start getting into you know our friends up in Alberta John and Jen rivet they sent me some pictures recently of some bears that had moved into the area yeah because they've been pushed out of their good area by Grizzlies right yeah there's a lot of Grizzlies yeah not a Grizzlies up there and apparently they're talking about having some sort of a season on them because people are encountering them yeah on a more frequent basis but again that area where they live up in Alberta is just so dense they would it's so dense yeah trying to figure out how many bears are there where the bears are so that's a good system when they put that time and effort in the phone and the numbers like this why that the American systems the best hunting system I've ever come across because we so you do a numbers check and then you release the tags for what can be taken out of the population to keep the population healthy still it's all done by wildlife but exactly yeah there's a heap of revenue there it's awesome system you know what billions of dollars a year yeah I'm from hunting revenue in this country that go to wildlife preservation that go to conservation of habitat you know backcountry hunters and anglers has a great website where all this stuff is detailed making Rocky Mountain L Federation does the same similar thing which is they have just the detailed numbers on how much money goes into conserving these areas and even repopulating these animals and other areas yeah yeah it's a brilliant system so it you know and but there has to be that two sides because you can't go fully one way or fully the other because if it goes fully one way and we try and frickin wipe them out no one wants that right so there's got to be that middle ground there where I think what we say the green is fight for as well you know and then it's like well we you know we can afford this shoot you know 200 of those grizzly bears out of the ten thousand that live there or whatever it is crazy numbers then that's the system we want so it's healthy population to game every every single year for generations to come healthy populations of game and making sure that these giant predators don't encroach on civilization yeah that's the thing is that keeping them out once they start wiping out all the moose and all the deer and all the elk they're gonna move towards people people need to understand that this is not a game yeah you don't encounter them in Santa Monica right so people like you know you assholes just trying to kill the animals that's not that's not what these people are doing you don't understand you know like you could tell them well maybe if they maybe they've heard you like be around them and understand what the fuck this is giant 1500 pound monster yep that doesn't think like oh that dude that I'm gonna ate might have kids they justthinking food hauling my stomach and I want to fill up the Greenies would say well that elk you kill those dudes too man why these greenies out there petitioning against fucking Lions killing shit why aren't they yeah right why aren't they like lions are killing shit we were just talking just the heart of the food chain as well do well out of this whole system Courtney do Walter on the podcast I was talking to her about like people occasionally when they're running these trailers run into mountain lions we were talking about this lady who lives in Malibu who has an alpaca farm the mountain lion got in to help archives killed 11 of them and a goat just wiped him out just fuckin decimated the party yeah that was real killin and so this lady got a depredation permit to kill the mountain and she got all these death threats from people yeah everyone but it's always like do you understand that she just yeah I don't mind it's killing animals too - yeah yeah way more animals I can't understand it well it's not logical it's just emotional I think a big part of the problem with - there's two parts of the problem one a lack of real wilderness exposure like real time in the woods understanding what this whole ecosystem is really all about because it's just a predator prey ecosystem and when a hunter goes into that you're really just dipping your toes into the wild world a little bit yeah exactly then the other part of it it's movies mmm all these fucking bear movies were the Bears of your friends they talk to each other and all these anthropomorphize yeah anthropomorphism movies you know whether it's Bambi or whether you know there's not really there whereas if you got into the woods and see yourself you know it's a much better understanding and a much better experience right any more people get exposed to these movies there's talk yeah and they're your buddy then get exposed to an actual Joe charge yeah a fucking mama grizzly bear like you did yeah yeah it's a wipe Island look at that Mama Grizzly and be like I want to shoot you if you look at the video you'll actually hear me gone I really don't want to shoot this bear like she's just doing what her instinct tells her yeah I'm not even cranky otter but I don't want to fucking die right so that's a terrible way to die that'd be a horrible way to die ja the size of this table closing down on you wouldn't be good yeah well they're gonna open up a season apparently on them near near Yellowstone yeah too many situations yeah more bears yeah that's roughly there that on there and that's where I release a lot of the problem biz release products I went to an area that they didn't release problem is because I'd never see a female grizzly where I usually hunt in Montana they're all miles or all line animals at least and I can't tell and the males are less likely to charge well it seems like it yeah it seems like the males well if a male charged used to eat you yeah cuz it you know I yelled at that one on my caucus last year and he wanted to go the other way and he did he ran off and freakin disappeared and it's interesting because Montana does not have a bear season yeah these are not animals like Alaska bears avoid people like to play exactly yeah yeah because they're afraid to be in shot yeah so he like ran off I think I only yelled at him you know that one last year and he disappeared this female grizzly that was running at me I was calling her fucking mall and everything might shake a mall what's a mall I knew that was an Australian word [Laughter] Andrew Nichols who I've just spent the last week with him in the animal in Northern Territory he comes he you just be sitting in the vehicle driving along and it's all quiet and peaceful and then he would just come up with something weird like you know if if you had to bring any actor back from the dead to hunt with you for a week he woulda be fuck huh needs of trying to think about that but um then I can't have one cuz I'm like he's coming up with all this shit I'm gonna come on one I'm like over this trip we just need to come up with real Australian things sayings that are getting used anymore and mine was like tada like do you have that one like if you say bye to someone you see the same body just say tada I'm fuckin you know like say it's like a magician would say tada no it's like tada like as in see you later no Tata for now what about her right alright boy no no her a is like victory okay well mall ways like calling someone a bitch or a skank a mole you got skank yes yeah don't laugh skanks yeah so she's running at me I'm like fucking these up you fuckin mall we know and she was from here she didn't even say this but I imagine she was thinking I don't speak English he does even know what a mall like a ma la mole mcmalley I get yeah but I think it's more of like mole on your face he ll slang slang term to different ok Australia Australia New Zealand Oh in the United States usually a pejorative or self-deprecating for a woman of loose sexual moral oh shit bitch I said big slut or a prostitute damn no wonder she was pissed off Wow mall mall yeah that's probably like some old shit from America that we like we gave to you a long time we abandoned it probably so when you went and got bullets she went got bullets for the Fed went and bought bullets jump straight back into Montana but my old spot in Montana and then I only had three days at that point to trying because you know I was after a bull elk and I'd passed up a lot of younger animals and like immature or animals over that time but um I went from the hot heat to got to my usual spot in Montana and just whited out with snow for people that are hunters it is very important if you want to consider the overall health of the herd you always want to shoot the older mature animals because they bred yeah they've passed on their genetics and it also improves the health of the herd because then the younger males that's right would probably get killed yeah by the bigger males or have the potential getting killed in combat when they clashed and that's the whole reason if people don't know why they have antlers - oh yeah yeah exactly yep I think my my biggest thought in that is I just want to shoot an animal that's lived its life you know like like look if I'm desperate for me don't get me wrong I'll shoot a spike or a cow whatever but right but I'm not desperate for meeting that point of survival you know so I just feel a lot better if I shoot an animal that I'm like it's lived its life right you know and then the byproduct of that is you get a bigger animal so more meat yeah you know you get a set of antlers which is to me a memory it's like about I don't cut the head off and just walk out at the end looks like I've got a trophy and I think a lot of people think that for me it's why every speck but it's just that's a way of respect than animal today you know so it's a funny thing but yeah just shooting a big old you know and that's why I passed a lot of lot of younger animals late opportunities those one day I was right on the edge of this like like it was like a cliff but there was a rock that went out over the cliff like a bit of a pinnacle and I was actually on the pinnacle and I had this ball straight below me and he was like I think he was he was 30-something meters but because you're shooting down it's like you know that the range finders saying shooted at 16 or 17 meters right and he was just laying there had no idea I was there but just a younger ball you could see it in his face and his body and just these antlers so but it felt good to be there and then be like no and back out and then it was our afternoon I think that that grizzly went me so you know I had opportunity to shoot balls but I pretty much went 21 days without a knock to my this is the ball that I'm gonna shoot you know and I'm getting into the zone yeah that's the thing that people I think on the outside don't understand or appreciate is that it's not just about getting meat it's also about getting a mature animal and it's also about getting a mature animal because they're way more difficult exactly yeah they're way smarter bein through seasons you know they just heaps more switched on you know there are a lot smarter so you want to looks like going into a fight like you don't want to go into a fight or someone that's never done kick boxing your champion kickboxer like that's ridiculous like where's the challenge in that how are you gonna be better at doing what you're doing if you just fightin the fight that you know you're always gonna win yeah and then I say it very early in that trip I'm happy to go home without a bull but I'm not happy to give up on day three or four or sit around camp and then go home and had a ball I want to bust my ass you know I want to get to the point where I say to myself and I did it multiple times on this trip what the fuck you doing like give up this is too hard you know I want to get to that point where myself write down because I feel like that's the most you ever grow you know in any sort of hardship but you know it's like freakin campaigns running this like you know he's guest gonna find a longer marathon next time well that's what Courtney was saying that they're considering a 500 Holley My Luck run 500 icons can't even fathom that dude yeah I mean how many days would that take I can't even haven't gone a week gonna be a week of running yeah so it's just she always open it you know like I've got a I gotta pull back a little bit now like I don't like that's about the maximum that I'll do how many do 20 22 22 yeah and then there was a lot longer without the family bingos you know the flights here and the flights back right and I went I was with Yeti and I went well I did the whole Yeti thing and went to the Innovation Center and hung out of Yeti for like a couple of days me and Benny O'Brien went down to West Texas hunted some access deer I went bass fishing so there was like there was like a week and a half on that trip that probably a lot of people didn't realize that I'm without my kids and family you know that's the hard bit I could go and live out there like a freakin hermit but I got family and I freaking love them and I miss them dude yeah I mean I'm saying the Cameron like you fuck this for me because I'm sitting on the mountain like you know this is I'm in my element up there like it's out in the middle of nowhere there's no people there's no lights you know there's just wild animals running around and I'm sitting on that mountain I'm like fucking Miss Kim but don't you think that that's one of the reasons why you appreciate them even more appreciate your family so much as it is but yeah I you know I said once the Steve Rinella we did this crazy hunt and Prince of Wales and it rained every day and it was we were just drenched when you're inside your tent and the tent like I turned on my headlamp and there was just water vapor everywhere in the tent like nothing ever dried sleeping bags wet your clothes miserable but when I got home I called him up and I said man I have never felt yet I'm so happy oh the Sun is out and I'm driving and I just feel amazing I feel like I'm on a drug yeah and I called them up and I go dude I have never been happier yeah crazy I was miserable it is the better you know and you have to experience some difficulty in some hardship in order to appreciate the good times yeah yeah exactly I feel like freaking with Kim it's like we're new newlyweds all the time is probably because I'm away so but yeah every time I come home you know every time I'm away I'm thinking about I'm flat out you know I actually just renewed my vows with Kim 15 you're 15 years married 18 years together yeah I think there's something to that man I mean people you know absence makes the heart grow fonder it's a common expression I think it's totally true and I think that I I don't think life is supposed to be easy I just know it's not I think you're supposed to do some difficult shit but I think the sooner you realize that then it does seem easy like does that make sense it's like the sooner you realize that life's supposed to be fucking tough and if it's not put yourself through some tough shit then the better dude yeah then it's just that right now I feel like I've found the recipe just to be happy as hell I've been saying that the last friggin months like I don't want this to happen but I've been saying to Kim and she sort of gets teared up fucking just know I'm happy to die right now like I really mean that I'm happy to fucking die right now I want to see my kids grow and I want to see the kids have kids and I want to spend eternity eternity with that woman but I'm fucking happy to die right now I'm not happy and why do you see what do you think like because I feel like I've just lived a flower life already you know but you still enjoy it regrets yes I still enjoy I'd be happy to die because I'm fucking crazy probably i doin anything care lord need to fucking die by right that's probably not good boys Christ did you get back until that dude who gave you the 45 hey fuckface yeah yeah he was freaking they're the most nicest people it was Cayenne ed that were in oh really yeah they're the nicest people and I think ed was freaking more than me and like it's all good yeah to know that you had the good you had it out and there was nothing that I wouldn't yeah yes and then so I had to sleep there that night because I wasn't walking out in the dark and the worst thing is I'm sleeping on at the elevation that she's at and she's only about 400 meters in a direct line from my camp oh well so I manually put a shell in the chambers I had one shell and I just fucking I actually slept really good that night I don't know if there's adrenaline war where and often it wore me out more will you convinced that it was gonna fire even went that one shell in the change I would have it was so I couldn't have the magazine in there cuz it would jam on the bullet but I could drop a shell in there manually and that's a good one I had one bullet yeah Russian roulette with no cock and good I hacked AG me no I've had that night as well like sleeping with me he's probably thinking it's a mosquito fucking dick their skin is so thick yeah cuz they bite each other yeah watch that a Grizzly Man documentary one of the craziest things was watching the two Grizzlies fight they were just tear each other apart right in each other's heads and when it was over didn't look like anything neither tore us to shred my body that's had really good experience in Northwest Territories where you know there's there's black bears and Grizzlies living in the same area he's experienced the two fighting and it's never like the black bear gondola grizzly it's always the Grizzly running down the black bear he said one swipe from a grizzly bear you know a bigger blackberries one swipe from a grizzly bear and the black bear it might be dead but it's fucking disabled mate one swipe so imagine what one swipe from a grizzly would do to us you know there's a picture of campaigns and a grizzly that he shot in Alaska and he's holding up its paw its yeah the photo the bear that he shot was like 11 feet tall and he's holding up its paw and the paw is like a fucking dinner plate the area yep maybe bigger than imagine that beach slap followed by claws dude there straight accurate yeah look at the size of that thing fuck the pole look at the tape on that block yams white tea I want them you could just get that charcoal coffee yeah yeah but hate coffee must have bleach ins they are fucking enormous enormous balls but like you said I mean that really is a real live living monster yeah crazy I do I love that dude though I'm just having a joke I say he's a fucking legend he's the best yeah but I mean he no John Dudley saw a grizzly bear take out a moose with one swipe he saw it through a spotting scope he saw a grizzly bear hit a moose in the back and break it sprite could spawn they just they gained size yeah they're probably one of the few animals yeah they're like hits yes I want what chance of we got you might zero breaks the back knows who's keep my Scotland yeah they're just so big they're so good yeah big friggin living Bigfoot dude I probably fucking what Bigfoot yeah [Laughter] what's crazy is that that's a small bear compared to the short-faced bear short-nosed bear what was it was that bear that lived in the I seen the fuck short-faced bear they think they call it yeah which is bigger even than a polar bear than a Kodiak bear there's a picture of these guys standing next to a yeah that's it that's one holy shit that scary and that thing had long legs yeah that thing apparently was so fast and so ferocious that it kept people from crossing the Bering Land Bridge like that's one of the reasons why they think that people it took so long for human beings to make it to North America it pole is as big as dude Chester the bigger dude that is look how much bigger they are than anything else yeah there's a grizzly polar and then the polar is now my whole extinct full I think ten thousand years yeah I can't I think that was the find out if that's the case Jamie find out one but there's a picture of who seven facts about the extinct giant bear eleven thousand nine go back to that last page you are out please and look at that one image it's really the guy up in the right-hand corner guy touching the face oh yeah I mean that is a monster that's a monster from Avatar or from Star Wars and that's a real animal they lived alongside people for a long-ass time but see what I mean if they would just run there in in the wild still we just have a normal name form and it wouldn't be any different seeing them dude it's like the galaxy like you're used to looking out at say the Milky Way so cool fuck off have a think about that yeah that is freaky dude oh yeah I've always said that if space wasn't real like if there was a roof over the world but there was at one place where you could go you could see space everybody would want to take a trip to that oh yeah 100% yeah and it's out there for all of us to look at you just gotta get away from some of these shitty lights will you have some amazing pictures again over man image go to first is it first don't you mean image on Instagram Adam is not just an amazing bow hunter but an amazing photographer just added one that I own because when you're out there in Arnhem Land like there's no artificial there's no light pollution for a long long way so if you look closely at that picture so that the orange lights the fire but see the clouds in the background there's a fun just I can't find that we have but if you look behind that that's lightning in known clouds there they end up getting the fire the lightning and then the Milky Way blazing through there that is an amazing picture that is amazing isn't it I'm just dude I can't like I'm there and like don't go to sleep till 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning cuz I'm just laying there looking or taking photos and I'm just like what's the out there like how crazy is that that picture is incredible yeah that's incredible so that's over our heads every night that's another thing that you just sort of take for granted you know yeah and like you said the light pollution I mean we just we love cities they're nice they give you you know supermarkets and restaurants and shit but they also ruin your view of the universe totally it's not worth it it's not worth it I think what you the trade off is almost not worth yeah just don't fucking pigs now because we're so you but there's so many options out there and food and I reckon our taste buds have changed and everything well no doubt our taste buds have changed for sure because you know it's tough back then wouldn't be blend but what we if we you just ate those real simple items now it'd be bland as hell you know I think sauce on it puts ol don't need to do this and yeah you know and then yeah I just feel like we're turning in the friggin pigs because there's so many options for food out there that we just keep shoveling and we just take it all for granted as well well how good is that when I come back from this twenty two days dude I was fantasizing over foods I put the 17 kilo straight back on what were you thinking yes fucking anything like what was the one is your one thing you like as soon as Haiti burger but like a full works burger like a burger that's just packed yeah and there's a couple of places that man Kim usually got home and I was just dying like I'm about to salivate sorry I'm spent away and the time and civilization that's the thing is achieving balance yeah it's getting the balance yeah exactly yeah because the civilisation is awesome great to be able to go to a doctor yeah and when you get away from all that and you are out in the walls then let's get fully realize like fuck how good do we have it yeah like you hop in a car if air conditioning you drive from point A to point B like you know and I always think about how life must have been back in the day like it wasn't driving from point A to point B because I don't want to take can fucking a week dude yeah now you just jump in a car and go it's all temperature-controlled you stop at a service station you get fuel fucking I'm thirsty I'm gonna get a drink while I'm in there you know like that's just one one example of how crazy it is ya know when you are in the bush when you especially when you're an art emmm and you find a lot of pictographs and a lot of these yeah because there was such a huge indigenous population up there well there still is but you know you're looking at I put one up the other day it's a video it's just in the instance Tori's that Jamie won't find it but me and UCLES are looking at some paintings and then I look down and like there's a whole human remains tucked in the rocks there right wrapped in paper bark which is a Jeff Hebert bark in America a type of tree I don't think they call a paper bark because it's like that the bark literally rips off it like a soft tissue paper and so some mobs like indigenous people wouldn't realize what the indigenous people call like a group of them well you'd say drive here yeah you were talking a mob of hogs earlier yeah you said that mobs a group of indigenous that's what they call themselves right yeah that's correct yeah yeah and I don't like the term like tribe or anything that's very American for your Indians and things like so they they would say like what wouldn't and they here I wanted to really get into this because this is some stuff we talked about at my house that's right podcast last time Wow look at those pictures that's amazing yeah so they're real beautiful rice and now very I don't know if I'd call them artistic because this just seemed to be what they did you know whoever it's that dream time you would have heard about their dream time so whether it's recording their dream time you know the indigenous would do these these rock arts and sometimes they'd be carvings so if you go to like the dark Dampier archipelago in western australia which is in the Pilbara region there are all carvings in rock like literally scribed in the rock and the detail that you'd get like it's so hard to scribe in a rock they'd get this detail in this rock that was just amazing these are paintings where they'd grind up different stones and get different texture and colors and see those handprints those handprints have been put up their hands go on the wall and then they Spray it out of their mouths so they make like a little cool and essentially it's like spray painting you know but they're using their mouth those other ones would be painted on and you see some really crazy things like I reckon that's an emu that white thing if you have a good look at it there's so many paintings on there that's a picture that I took a couple of years ago now but there's so many paintings on there now that you have to stare at it for a while and then pick a different one out you know and like this he's documented so these ones aren't so I'm one of about two white fellows that have been to this area and traditional elder took his hair like a traditional loan I took us up there she couldn't go up there and the only reason we were allowed in there was because this mob of people that they don't exist anymore the last of them's passed away so it was okay to go in there so to take you into the full story weird like beating down this bush track for hours and hours and we pull up at a little creek system and she just sort of pointed it out she said look if you know if you go up to the X Cartman there and into a cave or whatever you'll see you know the artifacts and everything that's up there and this so this is untouched like crazily untouched this spot and we go in there and it's like a friggin lost city but all natural like rocks just pushed up out of the ground and then you see the mouth of the cave and a couple of paintings on it then you walk into the cave and this cave is 60 70 meters long it's probably 30 centimeters wide and the roofs probably let's say 10 meters tall and the whole way through this cave systems those paintings like you can't even how'd they even reach the top of the cave like there's no big rocks or anything sitting around anymore there's still the grinding stones there Joe where they'll grinding up the different paints you know because that's what they do they they grind it up and working into a paste to paint with that's all still sitting there and there's 30 human remains just sitting in the cave in a like in a pile there as well and so the indigenous story goes you know and this might be a part of the dream tired I want to get this bit wrong but it might be a part of the like a dream time story and how it happened but the dream time story is the kids descended off the from the cave and onto from the escapement down under the flats and the kids are told not to kill any serpents like don't kill a snake you know they are off-limits and the kids go down there and they can't find anything to eat and they find a serpent like a young snake so they grab the snake and they cut its head off and it doesn't diet keep squiggling and moving around and then so they keep chopping it up they chop it into little bits and it keeps squealing around and won't die they they bash it with a rock and a won't die keep squealing around then they throw it in a fire and the fire still doesn't kill it it's just in pain and it's squirming and squealing around then the mother serpent you know heard this commotion the kids go back up to the X Cottman into the cave but the mother serpent comes up and they never used to be a creak there and she come up with such a rage that she carved the creek through the land so this is how a lot of their Dreamtime stories go and so she carved that Creek in that were actually camped on she went up she found the people in the cave after finding her her young dead and she lit a fire all the way around him she raced him into the cave and she burned him out and she burned him to death so that you know that's that's the indigenous story the the white fella story is the indigenous and I'm not saying one's true or one's not true but I'll tell you how the story goes the white fella story is that was one of the first cattle stations in the Northern Territory of Australia and the indigenous were picking off cattle to eat you know that and they wouldn't have known any different right it's an animal and the station owners found this out they found out where the indigenous were living and they took them food as a gift but it was all laced with poison and they end up all dying in the cave so you know there's two two versions of the story obviously yeah it's the second one yeah I don't want to say because who freaking knows but well I definitely know snake isn't going around lighting fires yeah probably not but I know what you're saying yeah if you listen to enough Dreamtime stories you know and that like that were there for a long time you know yeah yeah well here that was so hot they are so good at hunting because you know a lot of people say I the indigenous didn't come up with the bow and arrow they didn't need to like why invent something you didn't need they were so good with boomerangs and Spears and you know the way that they hunted that they didn't need a bow and arrow you know that's insane so they're a beautiful race but they're still very young to Western society you know I think we spoke about this last time Jamie can you find out how old well when was like the Northern Territory of Australia really pioneered because that's the population of indigenous that we're talking about they've been thrown into this Western society you know that we've come through slowly with you know essentially they are still in the Stone Age because you know that that's all they needed we're in 1825 the area occupied today in the Northern Territory is part of the colony of New South Wales was first settled by Europeans in 1824 at fort Dundas port Essington an 1863 control of the area was given to South Australia so something that crazy it's not even 200 years old dude that's crazy yeah and so these people have been there for how many thousands of years before that let's look that up too cuz I don't want to get it wrong yeah one of the things that you were telling me that I thought was really fascinating we're just hanging out at my house was how many different languages they have yeah yeah there's like I think there's over 700 dialects and you could literally have a mob of indigenous on this part of the mainland and just a little bit further down another mob of indigenous and they wouldn't speak the same language so the Noren Northern Territory provides evidence of settlement around 60,000 years I think it's just been blown right out of the water and it's a lot longer than that now really yep recently yep just recently yeah I remember reading something that's right what's the date on that super recently like a week ago yeah yeah yeah and there's so there's now findings to suggest that Egyptians come over at some point especially these two brothers and one of the brothers is a story that goes one of the brothers is really sick and you know he had to look after him and I can't remember how it ends but you know that Egyptians had come here just because of some of the signs that they found and like the it was like a story noted down on some rocks and things like that so it's really crazy the history behind Australia when you think of it like that and when you think of how young it is here it goes Aboriginal architectural discovery in how do you say that word kakadu kakadu kakadu rewrites the history of australia Northern Territory Aboriginal people have lived in Australia a minimum of 65 thousand years a team of archaeologists has established 18,000 years longer that had been proved previously and at least five thousand years longer they'd been speculated by the most optimistic researchers Wow crazy yeah pretty crazy yeah it's a long fucking time man five thousand years there's a story about the Dampier archipelago area in the Pilbara that's what I mentioned earlier that's right near where I have my business and there's over 70,000 rock arts on the archipelago itself they still don't know the significance of it 70,000 but there's a story that goes the indigenous that lived on the mainland with so much different than the people that lived on the islands they call them the canoe people or the boat people that if those canoe or boat people ever come near the mainland the indigenous mob that lived on the mainland would clear out of there mate that get out of there because they that was so different the way they lived the way they spoke the way they looked was so different that it was like a a foreign person to him and all scared of them Jesus Christ yeah it's just amazing how many different dialects it's insane Endemol you're saying that you could just go a couple kilometers away and they spoke a totally different way yep that's correct yeah I could understand each other no I couldn't understand each other so so with my business like I've been very fortunate to work closely with a lot of indigenous people wherever it's Arnhem Land where I go hunting a lot or it's with my business because in my business I've got a joint venture with an indigenous business owner which is she's a lovely woman she's awesome and I also have a thing where I employ at least 25% indigenous local indigenous people and I actually usually blow that out to 50 percent at some times we which is awesome you know the deal is mandated by a treaty or the government not really the the mining the mining companies are work for would prefer an indigenous joint venture owner of 25 percent then what I've taken on is my through myself is just I want the 25 percent or more indigenous employees as well local indigenous people so I've been close to a lot of them and you hear a lot of their different stories but one of the things is where my business is the man the sorry the woman has the say in the relationship everything financial everything like that but just two hours away the man has it's a complete opposite and the man has the say in everything so and like that's just two hours away but anyway some of these indigenous you know have married into you know someone from two hours away like the Pilbara region and they're always like how can we move back to like Onslow where they where the man gets to say it's really funny but I'm just like but in my relationship it's whoever's the most fucking pissed off in the day against society that's interesting so if they moved then switches and that happens all the time so they just accept it yeah they just accept it yeah and the whole tribe agrees yeah that's the whole moment that never exists it probably doesn't run so smoothly there either who knows the other real and it's really hard for a lot of Westerners to understand he's oh I'll tell you one story about old old Kevin traditional owner that I go hunting out on his land he's but he's been out on camp with me for you know a couple of weeks and he hasn't had any anything but water and like bit of red meat that I've shot him and stuff like that and and fish that he's been catching for himself anyway he's got family coming out and he says you know gives him a little grocery list that they could bring from town for him anyway they bring out the groceries and like I'm thinking like he hasn't you know he hasn't had anything to really drink or you know he's just had the rule bay it's tough for a fair while they get there nothing's been taken in other bags but once I hand it to him they just start reach and whatever he's grabbed out they reach and like so he got a couple of bottles of coke and all the kids and relatives are drinking the coke and like they leave him with about this much coke he gets a pack of cigarettes all these hands go in they grab cigarettes he doesn't look at him once like he doesn't go to say no I like I haven't had a smoke for a couple of weeks or a drink for a couple of weeks doesn't even blink to it or anything just everyone takes and they just leave him with a little bit and I was thinking fuck if that was money I'd be like oh I haven't had a freaking cigarette for I don't smoke but I don't know to cigarette for a couple of weeks like ease up and it didn't bother in one bit because that's how they are but when one of them has something that he doesn't have he quite welcome to reach in and grab whatever he wants as well they say that was an issue with Native Americans as well that they didn't understand property yeah yeah done understand property and just sharing what they do yeah it's just normal yeah it was this property thing came out of the Europeans yeah and they didn't understand so they would do the same thing you know it'd take the animals or take the food and it was normal then yeah so if someone had left something some of the accounts of European settlers were talk about that how Native Americans seemed to have no understanding at all yeah why people would be upset that they would someone would take their problem yeah and you say that in the few of the movies as well that they you know they've kept that Alex but the other thing that I was gonna say is sort it's something to be like I envy it you know like we like we used to talk about going on walkabout and things like that like a lot of the guys that I would get would get their first pay and then not show up to work the next morning and like come back two months later and just walk straight into the depot like like hey boss and I'd be like I haven't seen you for a couple of months mate look what are you doing I'm here for work what no I haven't seen because I'd get their pay their paycheck and I'd just be happy and go off with it for those couple of months or whatever and they're not all like that but a lot of them would do that and it took me a long time to understand you especially being a business owner and just wanting everything to run nice and smooth that that's just how a lot of them are you know and it is something to be envious about the other thing that would happen is and the mine sites were pushing for indigenous employees at this time and I'd load them up with indigenous employees then there'd be of death you know in the family and a funeral like they won't bury their dead until everyone from the mobs there so and because some of them live so far out and bush you know it could take a week for a funeral or some funerals go for weeks and weeks months dude and these guys wouldn't show up and I'd have the client ringing me up saying you know like what's going on you guys aren't here today well if you want indigenous employees and indigenous business this is what happens in you need to understand their culture now there's been a lot of cultural awareness a lot of cultural awareness is going out there to the mine sites that now they're all understanding that as well so they know if there's a funeral on that they're not gonna have their indigenous people there anymore so the indigenous people haven't adjusted neither haven't no they have to a certain degree on some things but not a lot and I shouldn't have to Aviva right yeah but when they take off they don't get paid goes off on a walkabout and comes back two months later do you just take them back in I say now yeah we usually do so now you just cuz it's just cultural awareness I'm aware of how that culture isn't yeah that's interesting because when whenever an invasive culture moves into an indigenous culture this is this battle right yeah try to figure out who's whose lifestyle wins out yeah and that's decimated the Native Americans I think in all of the cities and more populated places in Australia it definitely hoes mmm you know but I've just been lucky enough to go into some of these remote areas where that's not the case still yeah and like I said you're looking on and you're just like I wish I could live my life like that yeah it's like they don't want they don't want some of the things that we want you know right mean yes they probably well I don't know I mean maybe they Envy some of the ways that we live as well I don't fucking think I think some of them do obviously do you yeah well I look at them out there out boss you know long when I ride out and it's just like this is the way life should be lived it's like there's no rush to do anything call get anywhere and just yeah they just living life dude well that's how you like to live - I mean you like to like just be out like when you you're at your cabin yeah it's been a tremendous amount of time at your cabin just out hunting pretty chill in there that's the thing about where you live I mean you have so many invasive species so much so many deer and pigs you can just go seize it so I do get the Hahnel law it's usually wild game constantly yeah pretty much yeah just wild pork and III Dennison I hate those like meatballs which are like a which would like a deer pig mix yeah for like three days dude breakfast lunch and dinner so good all that was awesome and it was it was a awesome experience to go out harvest that meat myself then put it on for like 60 70 people at the word yeah it was cool I'm like this is from right here like right here off the farm that's crazy yeah yeah no you're living man you need to come over dude you gotta kill all those bugs first to say that scorpion that bit me know that so because I've always been like I've actually never been bitten I've got bitten by like an orb spider on the arm once it's an orb spider they're not too bad but like this side went numb all this ID okay that's bad dude yeah but it's not like bad like it's gonna kill you real sick don't feel that way up so jerk off down there the day before the wedding yeah that's that's a garden or he's that that's the fellow they're a bit mean but they're not so they're not too bad but I've never looked up I've never looked up scorpions before because I've never been bitten by them and I've just heard a few rumors that you can get really sick from the little ones and I picked up a bit of timber while I was building like the barn that I was doing and original afford was just us Glenna that crack me and then dude this hand felt like was about 10 times the size like in 20 seconds this hand just felt like it was just swelling up it wasn't it looked fine but then you could see my veins popping out you could feel that like the poison running up my arm it come all the way up this arm sort of disappeared once it got into me chest and like I ran over to the cabin at me buddy Antonio there I'm like fucking look up scorpion bites right now like one just crack me and it's excruciating and he looked it up and he's like worst-case scenario have a cardiac arrest but it's in very limited cases so I'm like well what's the normal case and it's just excruciating pain for up to two or three days two or three days yes anyway once they got into me chest that sort of disappeared I did feel a bit nauseous and stuff like that but then 2:00 a.m. in the morning that drifted down into this leg on the opposite side like woke me up like was just killing me like you little fucker they're only this fucking big too so I can inch line pick a punch yeah about an inch long just a tiny little thing like that that didn't happen too many things that's what necrosis yeah mmm you can like it yeah it's not not freaking good but the day of the wedding while we're all getting ready me meet good friend Ben chambers was there I was over freakin building something still or whatever I was doing and I hear a bit of commotion I look over he's a frigging wrestling uh it's a spotted blue belly black snake which we've actually never had on the property before and they're really aggressive like he sort of tried to hold that of a stick so it couldn't lash back and get him like I got all these people showing up for a wedding and there's a friggin venomous snake running how venomous is a black snake I've heard that they give you a real bad migraine but they can do the same you know you can have cardiac arrest you can have a bad reaction to it so there's a lot of shit that can go on there but um mate it grabs this stick and a red-bellied black snake will whack you and then usually let go these things are notorious for grabbing you and just pumping you with venom that's what makes them the worst of the black snakes no just grab on you and keep pumping your venom and they won't they won't do a little try buy a lot of snakes do a drive-by and but anyway this is like the friggin an hour away from the wedding's starting dude he's tangling this snake up around the stick then he lets it go like further away from the cabin and when he lets it go views up a bloody brown snake and I sent your video once before of a snake spewing up another snake yeah this thing spewed up a full brown snake and then snakes are super poisonous exactly yes I probably should have left it alive because it's taken care of the brown snake population it has a taste for what kills you she left surprised I mean if it only gives you a headache yeah but most of the time like in Australia now it's like I've walked thousands of miles dude never ever had a problem that's why you need to come out boy that's not a convincing argument come come visit the farm I'll take you out to the cabin sounds good can I get an armored suit terrible idea I brought you that buffalo skull cuz I'm like you're fuckin never coming so I'm either bring you one of my buffaloes well I would come to Australia I just I'm not goin Buffalo on you guys are out of your fuckin mind you're pretty sight is that the story sighs that's a red belly there beautiful he is pissed off feet flattened in these nick out like that god it's so beautiful yeah that's a red-bellied black stain yep they're pretty harmless of they're so pretty I've actually had me head back on a stick before and I had it was curled rod up me on my head and I'll lift up and have a look in the grass and he lifted right up beside me on like I won't move like I don't want to get bit and then he just relaxed and chilled out so you just have a just lay that second from the left Jamie that looks like a spotted what is that says this says blue-bellied here but yeah and see much much of it yeah that one that bright shiny black I love it to the right yes that is a gorgeous creature it's not uncommon to see if you were them for the summer boy hunting but like I said they're really Placid so those are safe but how the fuck do you remember them do me a favor boy thanks Andrew Nichols on your Instagram yeah and and then you'll find him on YouTube then he's got this video where he captures I think it's too Brown snakes and a red-bellied black snake and he puts him down in rabbit holes and then they chase the rabbits out like trying they're trying to get shelter they chase these rabbits out and he ends up catching the rabbits it's friggin hilarious so he uses either he's like he's older videos I just seen it that one there Jamie the top one just the one of the one above it this one here he's doing something wild rabbits for snakes no that one there this dude's a freak hey hey oh shit that was a few years ago Elian he's various trying I keep saying if you keep doing this shit your fucking numbers coming up brother so these snakes are what kind of snakes they're two red-bellied black snakes so those will kill you nah they won't kill users have a bad reaction near their headache snakes and taking him well one of them's trying to do now it's getting a bit revved up yeah he's just walking he's got some serious control so when they lift up the strike he drops them down a little bit you know because I can't fight against their own weight like that in his hand what the fuck is wrong with this this is your buddy yeah he's my buddy's a bow hunter now he doesn't hunt why should he hide gym shorts dude he's just done Africa maybe a couple of years ago he chases a pride of lions off a fucking kill but chase is a pride of lions blocks them out come on where has elephants chase him down dude me out runs elephants he's 9 does he have a death wish he must have do you think he does he's got some screws loose at least did can he identify the taste of a gun yeah so he drops his snakes down the holes drops running yeah he drops him down the hall what he does he grabs a rabbit that's a Robert grab it yeah so they run into a net I'm not sure one of the other yeah I just watched him wrestle a full sized bull Buffalo what yeah he pretty much he lassoed this ball and I'm filming this is on this lawn a buffalo a water buffalo like the one

the tear a knife and like friggin Buffalo nothing of Jesus what is he doing why does he have a crocodile why is he putting a lasso around a fucking crocodile this guy's crazy figured the coconut he fed it a coconut yeah why do you feed a coconut why not like to put it in its mouth so it can't bite okay give me some volume is crazy they must be in Africa because you can't [Music] fucking like they don't understand English there's no use telling the calm down I'm not fucking eat you compare this to us humans and it's only 200 pounds per scenario and you'll soon realize why this guy deserves title as nature's boss in the mouth and he's trying to get to crack a code for him oh my god he's a star dude he's he's awesome yeah do so what does this guy do for a living fucking YouTube and stuff for I don't know some Network tickle-tickle-tickle a teeth he's actually a real Nomad to tell you the truth really yeah just lives out in the bush yeah Jesus but I mean doesn't he have to feed himself like yeah job he's he does some crazy shit he's about to do some massive Trek dude with nothing and just walk through some wild country and so one of the reasons why he was in Arnhem Land with me up north was he's trying to learn off the indigenous about a lot of the bush tucker like a lot of the food that he can find out in the bush like yams and different like fruits and stuff like that he knows all the wildlife stuff that he can eat but the indigenous has spent you know a long time trying to work out what they can and can't eat and there's heaps of things that you can eat but they've got to be boiled for a certain amount of period you can only eat to this far in to it and things like that I've watched fucking Kaka dude there's a there's a I don't know if it's a root or a type of fruit and you definitely can't eat it they crush it up and they put it in the water and it takes a little oxygen out of the water and all the fish float I've seen that in South America yeah oh yeah so imagine how long it took to work out that actually like that's crazy isn't it that's another thing that they eat in Bolivia casaba yeah it's a root that if you eat it raw it's super toxic yeah there's a whole really involved process where you have to you have to soak it and then you have to drain it very similar just cook it and then it turns it into there's actually cyanide that comes out of it yeah see if you can find a video Jamie on preparation of cassava and but this cassava is apparently Rinella was telling me about it that's what was Rinella I've read about it before but Rinella was telling me how poisonous it is that the stuff that they [Laughter] good that's like birth gay lover this looks like so um they they have these buckets around the camp Johnny you've got a pond a better video than this this case oh yeah recipes that I mean someone's preparing yeah well there's a really involved process in order to cook it yeah you even get it raw it and or you're dead you're dead you know yeah just amazing that they figured this out so you have to do all the stuff to it and prepare it and the actual buckets of liquid they were saying Grinnell was talking about how they just leave them around the camp and he was like what if what if a kid drinks them it's like they don't so she's cooking it up just get some way to anyway anyway but yeah I mean how long did it take them to figure out that if they can grind that plan up throw it in the water official how many people died eating at their cells because it looks like a fruit you know there's so many in the Australian outback that look and smell and even taste good but men they'll kill you there's no crazy when you think about the trial and error involved a figure yeah can I can't eat yeah motherfuck yeah now we've got all these books at least it takes it takes the mystery out of stuff like that even then people screw it up off at y'all all the time with mushrooms yeah I nearly did it the other day there's one that it's it's sort of taste similar to an apple but a little bit like on the sea our side if it was an unripe apple it's completely edible there's another one that looks nearly exactly the same but it drops the same pink flare out of the bottom of it's got this little spike that comes off it and so I've been walking around eating these other ones Claire didn't have hardly any food and then I'm like oh there's a freaking whole heap of me when I grab grab them and just reel me in the backpack got to this water hole cracked it open and just thought shit is at the same time and then I smelled it and straightaway it's not the same type I didn't have the same seeds or anything but how quick of a mistake to make and that one that second one that I grabbed is really friggin poisonous does it so it's like oh yeah I need to carry a bush tucker book with me but at least there's those books out here now Fugazi this one playing with yeah I've seen no I ate a fuck around good alright yeah they use them for sushi yeah apparently like the really skillful sushi chefs they slice through this thing and fillet it but what the fuck the smallest mistake in preparation could be fatal but Tokyo city's government is planning to ease restrictions that allow only highly trained and licensed chef's to serve the dish fuck all that well just have it fucking ate some normal fish yeah I'm crossing Tony crazy assholes but I think it's it's for people they like a thrill of knowing that they're eating something that could kill you yeah sounds like a fucking Montana well cuz I'll stop my end right you can you can only have limited food with you and then even though I come out of the wild you know for like I come into town and bought the bullets I didn't go to a store and be like I'm gonna load off on a heap of other food and shit that for me that was gonna wreck the trip you know so I just go into town grab the bullets yeah fucking wood I wanted to live off the land I did yeah I wanted to leave you must have brought some food with you right yeah like so the first probably the first 11 daylight pretty good what did you bring with you dehydration meals you know little energy bars just because it's everything's gotta be light you know so most everything was dehydrated or just like a light type of food as simple you know as simple as it is and then heaps of chocolate bars actually they're not that light but fuck you you need them when you're out there you need to pack that energy back on and keep going so heaps the chocolate bars and then specific ones to use or just any way you can get just whatever I can get just regular chocolate or calories yeah just calories half the chocolate bars in America I don't even know what they are and then I open them up and I'm like ah that's shit you know because I it's so different back in Australia but we do have sneakers but like we've got a mars bar you know Mars bar here it's called a Milky Way and we have Mars oh yeah I couldn't find them anywhere near me favorite oh they have Mars bars how did I am must win to the wrong store fucking dirty but I bought some milky way's which are different back in Australia as well and there's more similar to a mars bar so but yeah so the first 11 days a pretty well but I'd still if I could spare food like if I could shoot a grouse I'll eat that if I come across berries I'd eat those and I sort of had contact with April Voki who's like right in the outdoors and fly fishing and stuff she knows yeah yeah yeah and she's she's hunted with us a few times and Kim and I get along like a house on fire so it works out good so how far good a house you don't have that Sian Ava get along like a house on fire that seems like a terrible way to get along some fire you're fucking furious even come up with that yeah oh you know like jump the gun did I actually jump the gun yeah well that's a jump in the starting block jump the noise no jump the gun fire unless you're the fire cuz you're fucking burning up you gone blazing so I could look at it like that as well see we're going with that yeah so April was sort of my go-to person like if if I had reception I'd take a photo and be like can I leave this the worst thing is because sometimes she'd be busy I'd be collecting heaps of them like I'd need them she'd be like definitely not and I'll be like fuck but most things just from taste and a few things that already knew but there'd be some areas especially up high where those beers were where I've seen that grizzly and Colorado there was berries everywhere and that's obviously what the Bears were there okay yeah you ate those berries yeah just I got like friggin raspberries blueberries there's um those rose nips do you know those they don't look at a ball and they're pretty hard but they're really good for you buddy key too many of them they'll make you feel itchy itchy yeah which I never felt itchy but I didn't want to get to that point like walking around hunting they like really they make you itching it when's when's the 2:30 cracking what was the word who is the word that you use Bush something bush taka bush tucker what does that mean taka fuck you Americans need to come on this crap shut up your mold your fucking mom you can't say fucking as in ing it's got to be a in on the you know fucking you would say yen we would say I in and then put apostrophe yeah right fucking fucking yeah you gotta say tomorrow perfect you'd get wrong get used to driving on the wrong side of the road no it's the right side but yeah it was my go-to what does that mean Bush time is food so food bush tucker tacos food tuck Tucker Tucker yeah Tucker yeah let's go get some Tucker yeah let's go get some taco like we'll go and get some Tavia where that young Jamie no that is your like this is normal it is very normal for who so called bush food is any food native to Australia and use as sustenance by the original inhabitants to Aboriginal Australians but can also describe native for or Falana yeah flora or fauna so that was something did you pick up from the indigenous people no I think I'll just rise like that you know so it's just yeah phrase yeah obvious I grew up out in the bush tucker the woods Marlo is what you call kangaroo yeah they're indigenous names there Mar Lou bar Dora what is that bird that looks like it could be magpie case and what is that one then act like it what is that hasn't word yeah we luxury that's the name you yeah right yeah liebe Yuri and so the people to indigenous people they date kangaroos yeah yeah definitely kangaroos wallabies going is every kangaroo yep yeah plenty sounds like um it's a very rich red meat like a really really rich red meat good that's delicious yeah and it's super lane like there's no fat content to it or all and so do you buy it in a store you can yeah what the fuck is that man that's bullshit yeah that's not right yeah it's bullshit how is it bullshit the guys holding that fucking real crowd yeah it's not a real grub no it's like a wood cropper which they grabbed they're good Aidan oh so it's not really that big now why not like what's that Dagwood grubs there they'd be witchetty grubs they're good grubs yeah hold on so you see those of them's good grubs like you you go eat those yeah have you seen that video grubs we're not they building the cabin and I'm stripping the bark off it you'll see all those grubs and I get them and I cook them up and eat and eat them just like peanut butter mate but better they taste like peanut butter yep they do yeah really yeah probably even better than peanut butter what kind of peanut butter you guys have an Australian today pretty good what is that a honey yeah honey ant sugar ants those are good yeah those yep and if you run out of like if you're running out of tea or you know if you want a hot drink and you're out in the bush then you'd boil your water and then you'd get a heap of those in a leaf or on a leaf and you dip them in your hot water and it like makes like a nice tea but it's like sweetened already from the ant they carry like a sugary taste on them whoa so that little thing on there but is actually honey yep they have a little bubble pack Boni well it's not really honey but it tastes like honey really yeah it looks like honey though yep well what is it I'm pretty sure B that anything that can produce honey wow that's crazy though the by that's their abdomen essentially right yeah so it looks like those black things Lesley Ann is settled as a separated rather Swede yeah that's so strange so tiny strange because we don't eat it but imagine those things were grown on a farm or and harvested for mass production no different than lamb or I know with what insects do we eat none which is friggin weird why wouldn't we eat insects they for us people are starting to eat crickets yeah and frogs and but for crickets being bugs yeah you know a lot of a lot of people eat crickets these days I think Rick protein powder it's very popular in America okay not good until I kiss two people American becoming more properly they have I think they have a nice cricket protein bar that you can buy I haven't tried him yeah I've heard good things about me but I've been in Mexico and we went to this resort and when you check into your hotel room they have like a little bowl of fried crickets really yeah like with chili powder and stuff proudly strange what is that that the company and then they sell cricket oxo what's this goddamn pop-up ads so EXO me exoskeleton is the Creek I don't understand why we wouldn't ate what we shouldn't think well you not only that but vegans should eat them because it's a great way to get b12 and most people don't really care that much about bugs it's like the thing about vegan seems to be sentient animals and worrying about killing these feeling life-forms yeah yeah and if they if that's the way they feel they could be far healthier even mollusks mollusks you're a big one they don't feel shit and they're they're fucking stupid yeah like marks they say are dumber than plants yeah they're more primitive than plants the fact that they move is what freaks people out yeah does a vegan eat a Venus flytrap would they eat that yeah fucking moves to play move they just take a load on the move and quit exactly but crickets are really good source of protein so if someone wants to get animal or some sort of living proteins but particularly like the the nutrients and amino acids that you can get from that kind of protein just look into insects don't die you fucker I'm gonna stop my own insect farming to it bitch fuck this is how you become a millionaire fuck is it a tough sell we're eating little lambs well not a yep okay dry we're eating kangaroos and how about crabs and the water yeah crickets in particular taste good I'm telling you man I was grubbing on those crickets in Mexico yeah I'd like a nice chili powder on fried and like like so they collect crunchies yeah they're kind of sorry a little savory they were good like they were like I would buy them yeah that sounds good these grubs that I'm talking about a delicious draw the line full delicious it's just a full delicious that's something that the Australians say full fully or full amazing fully sick yeah fully sick yeah mad come [Laughter] cameron eyes is a mad con yeah actually some people it might have been from me saying that and they were like where can I get mad cunt sure you're a nice cunt because you're a nice cunt or a bad cunt oh when the shirt that everyone wanted I actually got one printed up but it didn't come in time I was gonna wear it here just be an arts cunt mmm it's as simple as that well you guys are very different use of the word cunt yeah cunt is like a good dude well okay anyway if you say if you say madcon that's awesome that's not a bad motherfucker but it feel like you're a fucking cunt right no have much more range with the word cunt do do I love Australians like even though you're gonna say yes or no they're always like yeah so they start with you and then they're like nah yeah no yeah yeah that's a girl like you is no one that's a good one yeah or if you're gonna say no then go no you seek you shake your head no it means that I give a fuck you pick what you want like King will be like you know should I this swimsuit you know and I'll be like no whatever the fuck I say doesn't matter anyway she's gonna get what she wants yeah you know what I've developed I developed an amazing ability to not listen when someone's talking that's what I've been doing this whole show I can hear they talk about stuff that I like especially my wife gets together with her friends they can have a conversation I could be right there I don't hear a fucking yeah came sliding in a field just here in truth fucking you're antisocial I'm like now I'm not anti-social I just don't have to talk about everything I'm quite happy sitting here quietly they think there's a very big biological difference between the way women like technology then men especially a guy like you who does so much hunting where it's very valuable to be quiet yeah I've actually had some friends say to me like that I'm very antisocial and it's like you're not interested in hanging out with versed and stuff like that and did his friends hunt yeah they do but I like hunting solo like I just but it's not like a choice that I'm like I'm not fucking taking him where I'm not inviting him or whatever but I'm just happy to do it alone so if I'm planning the trip I don't necessarily plan it around someone else's time or something like that so they think you're antisocial because they wouldn't do it well yeah and then they're a little bit like they're also like how can you just go out there by yourself like that like don't you get bored or you don't you miss talking to someone or whatever and then and it's taken me years to figure it out like why am I so comfortable being by myself or not saying the word in a crowd of people at a talk and all and you click like you know my past growing up but a lot of its been from my past growing up and like I've nailed it it's like I grew up with people that were supposed to be loved ones that didn't show love at all in fact they taught you the complete opposite instead of teaching trust they taught distrust because this is supposed to be a person that's close and treats you well and they're fucking treating you like shit so you slowly start moving away from sort of mankind in a sense where we started associating pee associating people with a negative feeling exactly and so the way that I'd get treated you know growing up was I'd be I'm better off by myself you know I'm better off safer Kim sort of wreck that now but that's what I mean how she's wrecked it but I'm yeah I grew up all those years knowing you know not to trust people and people had fuckin actually dangerous and stuff like that so I'm happy being off by myself and doing my own thing and then like I said now it's different I've got my own family and I know the complete opposite I've you know trust and love and everything like that but isn't also the hunting thing for you that when you're hunting you're just locked in on the task at hand Toa degrade definitely you don't want someone with you that's gonna mess it up no sir not no because I'm not a self that that sort of sounds a little bit selfish I don't mean it that way I don't mean it that way what I mean is that like you're focused you don't need anybody else but yeah when you're focused you don't you really don't need anybody else it's just the ten just you against the elements yeah yeah yeah I I think it's that it's pushing myself it's I love the fucking wilderness like it's just as simple as that and Jo like I always feel like like I love the society we live in and this whole system but it's not the system that I've designed for meself right like I'd love to go back fucking ten thousand years dude Jesus and be living there whatever shit Ebola indigenous to Australia would you run around for spear and boomerang dude you'd be happy with that I'll hell yeah I wouldn't be happy with that not knowing what I know though so this is the thing where Kim's fucked it for me yeah like I wish he could just be a real bitch and nasty and not good-looking and then you know it'd be like I am going walkabout right I ain't coming back a funny expression going walkabout that is a funny expression and walkabout yeah just yeah well though because I would had take him so far to get from wherever they were you know because they'd travel a lot hmm there's actually there's I think there's some hard evidence now that Indigenous Australians because there was symbols like right down on the east coast of Australia the same Zach symbols go all the way up the coast to the Northern Territory this is a five day drive by the way that the indigenous would walk that you know they drive so walk about like heaven use the walk from community so that's built by the Australian Government to house the indigenous people then they also have we call it on country but like an out community just for his mob on his land you know so Kevin's a traditional owner just for his mole on his land they would walk that would take him five days to walk it and then so if they went out on country for a while and hunted and stuff like that would say they spend another 20 or 30 days out there maybe longer then another five days walk you can see why they call it walkabout they disappeared and that's how the sayings come up when you go away for a long time is you've gone and walkabout because you they'd literally walk that distance they'd be out on country for certain them in a period and then come back so that's why I've sort of adopted as well like when I go walkabout mmm I got walkabout on Kim a fair bit the idea of driving five days that they could walk it and now these are different I mean we're talking about all the different dialects and different tribes of people know now what the hell did they do what they encountered you know sometimes I'd have that they'd be war and stuff like that between trot between mobs there'd be war and things like that because that I think that in most cases they try and avoid it and that have like their corridor that they walk through but they all had their own land what they thought of pretty much caught well I can't say they all had their own land because there's so many indigenous mobs that and there was so many differences between them that some of them were just pure nomadic you know and just do they have written language I don't know I think they've written language you can don't quote me on this was like The Dreamtime and the paintings and everything like that and everyone tells them a story what's getting lost is it's only the traditional elders that know those stories and they're got to pass it on to the next generation so this is their story this is their paintings this is how the story goes when that gets lost is when the mob essentially dies out you know or or it's not passed on down through the generations that's just so crazy that there's this enormous population of people and their stories not being told yeah it seems sad when I think about it in one sense it's saying really sad but in another sense it shouldn't matter to anyone else because it's just those people's language and their story so if they die it's gone with them anyway yeah but I mean it's still just for the historical record I think it'd be great for human just a human definitely yeah to understand that this is a really a very little understood yeah group of human beings don't you hate that the mystery is getting taken out of everything though like it's good to have all that information like go on google and find out frigging the age of the the last ice age or something like that and which is awesome but it also cancels out all the mystery like we know that there's no other sort of monster crocodile in the waters anymore because the whole world's like right at our fingertips instead of being able to have that mystery in our mind like I wonder what's out the back there you know and that's why I felt like there's no more last frontiers I love calling animal II in the last frontier in places like Northwest Territories the last frontier because there's hardly any humans out there but the truth is that's all been discovered it's all pretty much been documented by some that you got some like real wanderlust dude you got to hide in Clark type shit that's what I'm like I wish I could go back in like there's no way to discover anymore right like Stuart Macdonald who's he was an alcoholic but it was he's actually a real famous early Explorer that come into Australia and Australia was convinced all the people of Adelaide were convinced that's where the first elements were that there was an inland ocean in Australia because there's all these rivers running out from the centre of Australia and it couldn't be the opposite as you know it's all fucking desert but they walk in and out of there so many times and so many men died and MacDonald Stewart himself nearly died a couple of times from starvation and no water because they were walking into the desert in the end he was successful and he ended up walking all the way through to the top of Australia dude there's no fucking water until you get to the top of Australia how did he get so he get through it but but imagine being back then when there was all that mystery like there was that that you thinking that there was an inland ocean in Australia because of these rivers running now but those rivers are ancient rivers they're millions of years old that and for so many hundreds of thousand years I haven't even ran on top of the surface they run under the sand in the rocks those rivers so crazy to think but some of the stories is he's got an awesome book well he doesn't have an awesome book because he's long gone but there's an awesome book out and called mr. Stuart's track and there's one point because indigenous like they'd never encountered indigenous and things like that as well they're walking into the center of Australia where it was highly populated with indigenous people no white people had ever been in there no settlers before they are literally cutting the first tracks and drawing the maps dude and they they walk in the one spot and like there they have been three days or something without water like they're on the brink of death and that's they think it's like a miracle there's like a little well out there like a clay built well out in the middle of nowhere and it's got this crystal-clear water in it they keep the cattle in horses that because cattle and horses would smell the water and just go in there and trash it before the men could get there so they keep the cattle and horses that buy they go in with their own canteens and fill them up and drink and you know all the men are just getting as much water as I can then they've let the horses and cattle go so they can have a drink now the horses and cattle come in there and they trample this whole well like it ends up going back to dusk because they cave it all in they drink as much water as they can they cave it all in and the water pretty much dissipates then they ride out for three or four days and they can't find water and they've run out of the water that they collected there they turn back to there and it might have even been longer it might have been a couple of weeks might have been on the way back after not being able to go any further and they come back there and there's all these Aborigines they're dead because they bridges were the ones that would put the well in they walk days and days and they would just have a water source at the last point you know so they just go they knew water was there they drink they'd be able to make it the next three or four days to the next bit of water they get there it's fully caved in get that order there's a whole mob of indigenous people dead there they they knew they couldn't go on any further at least all the ones that were dead there knew they couldn't go on any further and they died right there and there was no water there was no well there anymore like the cattle had just trampled it man and one thing like as if that's not crazy enough but one thing that I always think about is um imagine the indigenous people coming across these who've prints like that because there's nothing in Australia you got to think they're all can't the biggest animals running around Australia were like kangaroos dude they have these little toad legs and then they come across these massive prints for the first time that have just devastated their their last drinking hole before they move on to the next place Oh crazy stories in this book so there's no way to dig down deeper to restart the well I guess not I guess at that point yes so you're already so dehydrated but you're walking to a point that you think that there's water because you build a well and then there's not anymore and not that I dairy much doubt they would have given up because there are Hardy people but whatever they tried to do obviously wasn't enough fucking white people ruin everything I hate to say we've done a lot of good wrong yeah you sound white people yeah but so see the mystery behind fucking just walking into the centre even though it's a horrible mystery to go through you know that's what I mean at least a heap of us Dana to die walking in the middle of Australia thinking I'm going to go in there fishing there's an inland ocean somewhere and they you never come across it you're out in the middle of desert but at the same time takes away from all the mystery in life you know see you look at things way different than me mmm because you have that wanderlust you go you have that I want to go out and find the hidden things yeah I don't have any of that shit yeah okay where's the water no no no show me on a map okay where what what kind of equipment do we need what are we doing do we have backup gun you and I are very different in that regard I have no desire to go to uncharted territory it's not even the race it's not the risk that's appealing what is it just a wanderlust it must be just AskMe behavior lust okay that cave system that you put a picture up before that I took photos of a lot of people have asked like where is that but for me personally I'd like to keep that undocumented because it seems once a place is known it's no different than a good fishin or a hunting spot it gets fucking ruined and that cave system for starters it's not up to me because you know that'd be up to the traditional owners to want to put that out there for people to go and look at it's not up to me so I can't share that information but for me personally I don't want that to be documented because I know as soon as the documented rubbish will show up there some decades will show up there and spray paint or scribble on will wanna write there's some shit like that some places are better off on undocumented well we the human race has got to evolve past that and that's a big order obviously yeah very tall order but god we've got to evolve past that a fucking month dude there's bad people and bad people for the done' man right but I think there's more good people now than ever before more informed people now before we just got to keep progressing yeah on the same lines and I think that progress is accelerating yeah and I would just hope that more people in the future would have more appreciation for what that is is this like this incredible historical resource so you're seeing these I mean we're talking about sixty five thousand years of people in this area who knows how old those paintings yeah you know it could be thousands of years old right I mean yes has anybody done like a carbon dating on them Ernie I'm sure that has been yeah they find those in Texas sometimes from Native Americans to find him in like caves yeah you just find a cave system and then you just encounter these pictogram and I was hunting in New Mexico we wait so I tagged out and then like I didn't want the hunt and the hunt was done sorry I didn't have any tags left I didn't want the experience to end you know that's why I said it's never ever been about you know just kill an animal it's about the whole adventure the whole package and I was with an outfitter and the guides like I tagged out what do you want to do I'm like well let's go explore and go walking still and just you know take photos of the countryside or whatever you put that all up in your blog to write in the magazine now using that one I read that actually it might be on beau-site calm okay I think I did a live one you know go up on top of this Mesa and you can see these rock like a uShip rock and you shakes which used to be like the Anasazi Indians that's how they used to have their housing and stuff like that perfect spot right up high looking down onto these big Meadows like would have been the perfect place to if other tribes were coming in you'd be able to see them and if any animals were working for moving through there to be able to see I'm just the perfect spot and we get up there and as I get to the top the first thing you find is a bunch of pottery and the Anasazi has had a certain color I think it was the white with the black riding on the pottery and the Navajos had the orange with the white riding on the pottery and there's both types sitting in this area so I don't know if there's a bit of confusion or maybe I'm lacking a bit of information there but as far as I've looked into as the Anasazi Indians and it's the whole way around they're like this must have been some major site dude I found the perfect stone broad had just sitting right there on a rock and it just rained so everything was clean like everything was clean I picked it up and like my mind boggled straight away like why how did this get here who held it did they shoot it who sharpened it the history behind it and but then so we kept walking around I found a full axe head dude like obviously the Timbers gone off the axe because it's been ever so long the Timbers just rotted in the nothing the axe had sitting there perfect we end up finding three axe heads Indian pendant you know if the perfect little hole like scribe dinner and just like crazy dude did you bring that back with you yep yeah because it was privately and I was able to able to take it you take a photo of the broad head yep I got all that document that says those fascinate me I was nearly gonna give you the broad edge and I'm like that's taken a tooth you can add the box goal like I shed a tear just parting with that buffalo skull doesn't matter the old man company last week they all made fountain tea Bert was saying today he killed [Laughter] the cat things freaks people out of Australia that dog freaks people out as well but wow no different than shooting a coyote here are a problem animal you know yeah dingoes were one of the first they believe one of the first introduced species in Australia and I come with the indigenous population at some point also they came with indigenous yeah yep so the indigenous probably got there while dogs is dingo sorry is most of them aren't dingoes anymore because there's been a wild dog population that's sort of peppered through there as well dingoes and what normal dogs like a domestic dog that's gone wild have now interbred and I I'm pretty sure the only place you can find a purebred dingo now is on Fraser Island in Australia they've got a policy or regulations that there's not allowed to be any domestic animals taken to the island at all so the populations stayed pure oh wow so you if you live there you can't have a dog but I think you can live on the island at all oh yeah it's one of those things yeah yep you have weird rules got weird rules is that you can't hunt anything native that's that's very strange to me yeah that they wouldn't just have to but you have some okay gurus right some of our currency so they're like our icon so imagine eating your bald eagle like eating your American icon probably that's why way to look at it chicken thigh we can't eat a kid noozle freaking wombats or anything like that no not that I'd probably want to but people do eat kangaroo though that's why I got infused and the indigenous cancer dingo yeah they're good-looking dog she will you know yeah Wow that'd be Fraser on dog though yeah so that's a beautiful dog that feels like you could take that thing as a puppy and raise it theirs I've got a buddy who had one have a go at his little girl like try and grab his little girl when he had it as a puppy or is not not just a wild one that come into the tent Oh headline ripping a wallaby down there so what happened he end up killing the dog he found it the next morning and not shooting it with his bow it was a wild dingo but dingo ate my baby yeah and I reckon there's some truth to that oh yeah I've seen how sure they are fishing Jesus Christ well I know eating a shark on a beach that's a fucking cool photo it's a gangster ass dog when in god blows a lot of me I wonder if someone actually call at the shop and that's another thing that people are freaking out about here in America it's the most recent freak outs people fishing and catching sharks it's Simon astride used to be able to buy mako shark it was very common dude most flake and the stuff that you're buying shark you know like when you buy like a bad bit of fish or something like that from one of them quick takeaways it does fish and chips yeah then most of that's actually flake which is just a shark really yeah yeah no no specific Australia no I probably here to do do you think they're serving a Bellagio there's heaps of them and there's a ton of them that get in the next nets that's where they go really yeah hmm tastes good what's I've eaten mako shark before and his delicious and watched swordfish like the same as anything as long as we're not friggin killing a man well you know what happens is people find out that a lot of people are killing them for fins okay I'm warning your fish and chips could actually be shark damn a baby boy this bloke is trying last night bargain okay so but I think what happened was over here the people found out about how many sharks get killed for the fins yeah shark fin soup and there was a big campaign to alert people about it and so then the people that have just barely a peripheral awareness of conservation and fishing and an animal life then they start going to charge their assholes meanwhile they're eating a cod exactly yeah I haven't substan for lunch on your salad would you eat this fish a shark called a dogfish makes it tasty taco yeah fuck out of a dogfish you'll mean it's still a fish I mean it's not a fish it's a shark but I just don't understand why people would differentiate between that and tuna how about you assholes that really love sushi back there killing all the yeah there's probably more sharks there are tuna yeah that yeah there's some pretty strict regulations in Australia the whole world needs it though like its owner know this so there's some regulations that have come into the northern territory of Australia now because you can actually shoot a magpie geese with a bow and arrow so there's magpie geese and there's some introduced turkeys like what you guys have here in the States they're the only birds that you can shoot with a bow and arrow in Australia oh really so they just brought in a season four magpie geese which really restricts a lot of the hunters taken too many which is fine I think that's probably not a bad thing but then these birds fly to other countries where there's no restrictions at all and they just fucking get hammered dude so it's like we're doing everything we can on our part but they just go somewhere else and get slaughtered anyway well with the sharks as well like there that there's a few species that are highly protected in Australia but they swim abroad and they're fair game for anyone nobody eats great whites though right yeah not that I know of but I guess people would if they're starved they would for sure I mean it's probably just fish I thought it tastes pretty good I don't think that give up too fucking easy that that's another monster living monster day oh yeah you know legit monster yeah yeah there was a instance in San Diego a few years back were these a bunch of these people were training for a triathlon and they were swimming in the ocean and one out of nowhere it just came and caught this guy in half right one of everybody else just bit him right at the waist this scary dude chopped him right in half chomp besides conserving their live shark meat can be terribly unhealthy according to CNN report from nearly 20 years ago the mercury levels and sharks can cause coordination loss blindness and even yes scientists think that sharks accumulate mercury in their body because they eat many smaller fish that's interesting why you shouldn't eat shark meat yeah it doesn't numb Marlin have a lot of mercury in it as well I don't know they say they don't like to eat Marlin yeah you know but I've heard Marlins good yeah I think a lot of those big fish especially the parade of the ones of full mercury makes sense yeah yeah I mean it's like predators in general have a lot of weird things going on with their body if you eat them you know like mountain lions give you trichinosis it's an interesting study like it says at the top of the article an estimated 100 million sharks are killed each year to feed consumer demand and then this study came from a report of 124 sharks that were tested and one-third of them came in with mercury levels that were over FDA action level of one part per million so a lot of a hundred million sharks every year 124 had a third of those were problematic so 30 sharks were problematic so 40 how many but they didn't test that many though right yeah I mean they didn't test 100 million they tested 140 were bad ooh that's not good that's not good one third it's real bad you think yeah yeah maybe they were all in one area too they could have came out of one shitty maybe area well I've told the story a hundred times but I'll say it again just quickly I had arsenic in my body from when I did a blood test and he said what are you eating and I said I eat a lot of sardines and the guy said back off the sardines we'll try it again in a couple weeks and the arsenic was gone eating two cans of sardines a day I love sardines I don't know why I like sardines I love them they're great says this to APO do not eat shark swordfish king mackerel or tile fish because they contain high levels of mercury I've heard that about tuna as well I don't know those certain areas some tuna apparently contains high levels of mercury yeah where were assholes I was reading something about fucking crabs I put it up on my Twitter that crabs are getting prozac in the water from human beings like because so many fucking nut bags are on Prozac that it's getting into the oceans to runoff and it's affecting crab behavior and making crabs reckless and I already say pretty fucking reckless right but apparently it's making them reckless here he goes Rosa put crabs in a mood to take deadly risks I mean what the fuck I mean how crazy is the human race where we are giving prozac inadvertently to fucking crabs and changing their they're at a risk apparently they're worried about the population dying off or at least being affected because these crabs are doing reckless things and it's gonna cause them to get preyed upon or you know die what the fuck man yeah crab brains on SSRIs what was that word how do you say that word Jaime flu is a class of antidepressant called SSRI our selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor meaning that indirectly boosts the amount of mood altering serotonin available to the brain it's designed to affect people's brains in a way that can alleviate depressive symptoms but past research has shown that when a person's flu ox team filled waste enters their shit and piss enters the waterways it can alter the shores crabs reproductive molting and digestive behaviors and may even cause the crabs to abandon their nocturnal schedule according to the paper Wow Morgan's a cunt we are well we're definitely a mess we're definitely a master speaking of that let's get out of here go get something yeah
