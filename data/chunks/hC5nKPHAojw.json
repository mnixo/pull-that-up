the girag and experience but one of the things that you've realized and I've realized over the course of our friendship I mean Eddie's been my best friend since I think 2000 we started hanging out in 2000 which is not exact it comes back to the story of the twister Oh we became good friends I was getting private lessons when I first started to introduce who I was a blue belt under this dude I won't say his name is a very nice guy but it's and say something negative and I was because I was getting private lessons from him all the time he was the only guy that I was rolling with and I wasn't really learning nearly as much as I thought I thought like if you're kickboxing like you say if you get a chance to work out with Rob came in it's way better to work out what Rob came in one-on-one than it is to go to a private class like he's gonna correct all your technique so I thought that would be the case with jujitsu like I will get really good going to class and he liked that Eddie was the first person to tell me and Eddie came to one of the private lessons that I was having with Silvio and we rolled around a little bit and right away he got me in a twister and I had no idea what the fuck he's doing all of a sudden he hooks my knee with his left leg and his left foot goes under his right knee and he rolls forward under his left shoulder and I'm spinning around like a top and next thing you know he's got my arm wrapped around his neck and he's fucking pulling on my neck like this I was like what the fuck did you just do like I had been doing jiu-jitsu for two years and I had no idea what the fuck you just did to me and I was like god damn and you like I'll teach other shit I was like to teach him this shit and that's how we became friends and that's also how I started smoking pot you know I was on the Marc Maron podcast the other day and this came up you know I thought that marijuana and all that stuff was for losers I thought that it just made you a loser he's just going to become unmotivated you're not going to get anything done you're gonna be a dummy just sit and watch TV that's not what I wanted man I wanted to make sure we're like our friend bud we have a good friend bud who's like super fucking go get her you know bud is a great guy he's the one who put together the TV show to build that car that Barracuda and he's also the one who did my garage like an MMA garage he's always got like a bunch of different TV shows going on and he's a fucking go get her and you and I are always like dude please just let us get you high every time with it more than anybody more than dr. drew more than anybody how many times we've been having this conversation with him and he's always like after I make my first million then he makes his first million like I'm still I'm not slow down now like he just does not want to slow down and like it ain't about slowing down man it's not about I'm not slowing down I haven't slowed down at all I work more now than I ever did before I'm here man I'm a busy mother father this is not an annoying goddamn stereotype that pot heads are lazy we get a lot of shit done dude I'm doing two podcasts a week I'm writing a book I'm writing my stand-up comedy I'm performing stand-up comedy and I'm doing stand-up I'm doing other the commentary for the number one mixed martial arts organization in the fucking world and I'm training jiu-jitsu and I'm doing kettlebells and I'm raising kids and I play pool every night and I got a surf the internet and I got a beat off there's a lot of shit going on man there's a lot of goddamn time I'm not lazy at all I squeeze it all out every day so when people say that pot heads you know that it makes you lazy it's just a stereotype man and that was a stereotype that I thought before I met you man I do sleep to about 10:45 everyday as what what time to go to bed we're talking go to bed two or three yeah that's like eight hours that's what you're supposed to get man most of these people were in bed at 10 o'clock at night that's why when they get up at 6 o'clock in the morning they're all impressed with themselves my gap bitch I slept to 130 in the afternoon but where were you at 5:00 a.m. I was writing the greatest bit I've ever written in my life okay that's why I write my best shit I was in the fucking isolation tank traveling through the universe all right that's what I was doing while you were sleeping so don't give me a hard time because my time is different in your time like somehow or another you know you you're fucking doing yoga at 5:00 a.m. so you're the king fuck you stupid it's all based on farmers anyway it is based on your right it's based on bars do you have to fucking get up early that's nonsense asleep the crazy thing is Joe and I before we started smoking weed we were totally against it we did bag on stoners and we thought it made you stupid I would talk so much shit on on stoners that at 28 that's when I found out the truth that's when I reaped the benefits of marijuana and then when I met Joe he was so funny I thought this guy's got a smoke pot he's so funny like I'd go see him you know do stand-up at the comedy store and I'm like that's that dude who trains at John Jack Machado's he trains at my school hey what's up dude I train at your school and I was like watch him do comedy and I thought it was Gretta he's got a smile yeah Eddie and I had a bunch of fortuitous meetings just out of the out of the blue before we became friends at one time Eddie's eyes aren't so good and one time we were at a at Mel's Diner and it was late at night man it was like 1 o'clock in the morning I know my cow na na yo Eddie he's like man who's just motherfucker talking to me man I'm gonna have to fight the stood in front of my chick oh that's remember that oh my god you remember that yeah you thought it was like some dude who's just fuckin with I had it throws down I'm like I thought you were cuz I was with the chick and I was saying something to the chick oh yeah you didn't hear what I was saying and you can't see that good so you couldn't see me from a distance so by the time I came up to your table yo Cruces motherfucker and you all hey dude I didn't watch news raid oh and at that point it was before fear factor so I never watched news radio and so I was like okay here he's an actor or something like I barely remember him but then when I saw you at the comedies that was by luck - you didn't come there with me you just came yeah we just did were common friend I would go see come cuz when I started smoking weed I began to appreciate comedy way more cuz I dissuading matter all of a sudden my mind figured out how to write comedy right when I started smoking weed I never understood fascinated with comedy but I never understood how they put bits together I didn't understand the setup I didn't understand the structure of comedy but as soon as I start smoking weed I'm like I know where they're doing I know what they're doing now they're doing this and they're taking that and then doing so I understood the basic form later so I just became fascinated and then I saw you and like that's that dude from my jujitsu school he's an actor and you killed me you were just you were all nothing but dick jokes and like relationship jokes chick jokes dating joke but you were killing it and then when you came you walked offstage like hey dude what's up dude I know you fucking were awesome and then we then that's when he invited me to give him a private or something that's was at you at when I was taking profits with that dude yeah and you came down to class and then and then the the pot smoking began that was it you see people that in relationships get mad at everything all day girls nitpick it guys and the guy fucking fires back and yo well you guys are not handling this so well and you guys are handling this kind of silly you don't have to do this you know that's it's hard it's hard to watch man especially people have kids dude that's when it gets hard dude that's when it gets hard I got a front I got a front it's got a kid and his wife they seem what they seem like they don't like each other they seem like they're they're both upset at each other do I know yeah I know he talks unfortunate you know it's like goddamn you guys got this beautiful situation here you like she love each other come on get it together you know what either one of them smoke weed there might be a part of the problem right I think everybody needs a little weed man a little perspective it's a little perspective enhancer you know don't you think when you smoke me like smoking weed with your girl doesn't that is that a nice thing can't the best thing right it's like you you like you chilled together you know you hang out together it feels better when you kiss each other you know it's like a super sensitivity drug you know makes you super sensitive maybe makes you really really like that

electrical circuits or going off in my whole body and then I was time traveling I would I would be on my back on the couch and then boom I'd be in front of the refrigerator and I had no recollection how I got there it was like instantly I appeared in front of the refrigerator and then boom I was in the bedroom and I couldn't remember walk it to the better it's like my short-term memory was so fucked that every few steps my whole brain just rebooted and oh my god I get here it raced all the steps up to get to that point there was no memory I mean my brain was fucked we were both fucked boo giggling but I was scared of weed after that for a while I didn't do it again for a long time that was that was a scary one yeah man I could believe that people could function and smoke weed I didn't

to say I didn't know what the fuck was going on I I needed time to think so I finally answer I go do it I'm sorry I don't know how this happened I have no idea how I ended up in the back of this car we get you know and he ended up getting a cab and at the airport Joe was so mad at me he wouldn't talk to me so pissed it was so ridiculous this is like it was the second time in a row we went travelling internationally the second time I had a babysit him was from England to this it was just like Jesus man you got to write a blog about yeah I had well it's you you're the first guy that I ever met where I used to sell you know people say oh man i black out when I get drunk but shut up it you ain't blacking out you just pretending you're blacking out because it makes it convenient well you know I've seen the Indian come out man but like I said I never used to think that it was real I used to think that people would say that they black out drunk and like come on man but I've looked into Eddie's eyes and I see gerbils I see gerbil eyes like you look at a gerbils eyes they're just black and dark and you know what's going on they're mostly nothing you know I what didn't even know Eddie was Mexican I thought he was fucking with me for like the first two years cuz at the Comedy Store you're like I'm half Mexican like no you're not I'm four Mexican or you said something like that to me he used to say he was happy yeah you said something else Japanese and half Eskimo or something like Davis one makes it half chap muscle Mexican errs yeah I used to say that when I was a teenager just because I was an idiot and I wanted to see who would believe it and I'm like wow that people believed anything did you used to do that with a lot of things you used to like to tell people crazy stories and see how far you can go with it man it still happens I mean the whole dole the whole uh why do you get into doing that man do you have a hard time not do if you look if you look at qua too and then you look at and then you look at what we did on the Joe show like with a ten-foot submitted you can put screws let me tell people or something don't know let me tell you what we did we were in Denver and I was doing stand-up Eddie and Tate and Brian and Duncan we're all hanging out and we were walking and we went through this little shopping area that what is it does six street malls and what it's called whatever the mall is whatever Street it is anyway we're going to this downtown shopping area and we see a wig store 2005 2005 wasn't and just as a goof we decided to go in this wig store and then first of all we were high as fuck and somewhere in this wig store we came up with the idea of having a fake band and that you guys were all going to wear these wigs so we are everyone bought wigs Tate had this crazy afro wig and you had this crazy wig and everyone decided that we were going to play a band called ten-foot screws and we even announced the band like as having an after-party in town so people thought that it was like a real band and Eddie goes on stage I get offstage the show's over Eddie goes on stage with this fucking wig on and sunglasses we have video of it still right now there was a whole show yeah Joe show so suck without you worship which episode is it 7 7 yeah how do people find that one just type in Joe show 7 but you know it's actually all the episodes were on your website but since you moved the servers now everything's kind of weird it was the word you probably get in too much bandwidth well the premise of it was Joe wanted to put together reality show based on him going to all these clubs across the nation and his posse and me Tate Brian donkey and Ari even Larry back then we were all Larry's our producer with yeah we were all miss it was the product that's what Joe show was he's an actual reality check origin of the word powerful when you hear me say powerful it's all because there's one dude our friend Larry so we so the show was called the Joe show you had her on your website we did about 11 or 12 episodes or something and episode 7 we were in Denver we were trying to come up with a premise and then it was it was all about we just we just formed a band so Joe's on stage and we the way we sold it was Duncan would get on stage and would say Oh who's going to the ten-foot screws show tonight so we called ten-foot screws and that was Brian's idea and so we wanted it so Duncan was getting everybody in the audience use of the fact that we got 10-foot screws backstage and they're playing a big show at the the holiday Allah dome next to me oh no oil oka it's not 6th Street in oh boy a local so people were like oh shit there's a concert tonight I didn't know about this ten-foot screws are they big so then was already there to who else's re wasn't there so Duncan was selling it like he would he was like the host he was selling it we got ten-foot screws tomorrow were gonna give away some tickets so I got a stack of half off drinks on Tuesday night I got a two stacks of him and Duncan introduced me I was the lead singer I was the total douchebag lead singer I was like just basically playing the singer of Oasis but backstage so we uh I got up on stage and said who wants these tickets to the show tomorrow backstage they were going nuts so like Paul Stanley I divided the crowd to one side I said just like Paul static okay this side let me hear the noise I could want to let me hear the noise it was wrong and then I stopped him and I go this side it was just a total Paul Stanley 1985 ripoff most bands who find that finding it if you can find that and queue it up just that part of it because when I saw everything I threw those tickets into the audience dudes were flying headfirst over tables that were scrambling only to find a cover Tuesday night half off drinks and you some crazy man wearing a wig for a man that doesn't exist yes the one that the concert let out people had a walk by backstage it was a weird the club was set up weird were never walking out next to backstage so we had the door open and dudes are walking by going where's that bad so we went we grabbed one dude and we pulled and we pulled in maybe three dudes and we pulled him closed the door now they're backstage with ten-foot screws and me and Tate or just total douche bags we're total douche bags you remember those fucking questions you guys now that I'm thinking about it was a great guy who got down on his knees yes maybe he wanted he was us down to do whatever to hang out with the band he didn't he thought we were real band so we got him to do crazy shit he just wanted to hang out with the bed so good we're gonna have to get on your knees okay you're gonna have to pray for us pray with us you know and sometimes pray before they go out thank you Jesus and he would replete thank you Jesus and you said for this digging Wells a suck it jumped up in right away and the date was he's like six foot four he was so intimidating the guy didn't want to like fire back right state sitting there looking like a monster you know he was scared and then we got girls he probably thought that you were about to try to get him to suck your dick like he really probably thought that I mean you think about it you're some fucking wacko living in Colorado you know some dude who's willing to go to some green room for some bandit he doesn't even know never heard of before some bad it doesn't even exist he's on his knees praying back and forth you in his head when you said that for this dick I'm about the sucker heap I was not all I fucked up how'd I fucked up I'll do it but damn I didn't I'm not gonna like it and that was a great episode - and then the other good episode was when we were in Boston remember in Boston and re Solari and Duncan they both sold to the audience they opened up and they said backstage were we're auditioning for the Joe Rogan life story they're gonna film and we're looking for guys to play Joe Rogan we want authentic guys from Boston so the guys in the audience are thinking oh shit they're auditioning to play for Jim play Joe Rogan I think you could do it you could do it so people lined up and we had a fake audition like I'm this bad probably shouldn't talk about this cuz I think what you did was illegal was it yeah I'm pretty sure you did totally sorry yeah we probably just didn't really happen we denied oh yeah yeah this this is all in another we mentioned we deny this we on I this we parallel you know ready Bravo does not seek to get sued at this moment in time this is all fiction Duncan was the director never had with it he'd never happened this didn't take place he can't can't be saying hello much respect to the Korean zombie Eddie Bravo was wearing a Korean zombie shirt what this means for you non MMA people there's a guy named Chan Sung Jung who's the they call him the Korean zombie that's his nickname and this weekend on Saturday night at the UFC against Leonard Garcia he pulled off the first twister ever in the UFC and the significance of course is at Eddie Bravo our guest today we invented the twister no I didn't invent it well you invent a rest setup the setup the setups yes the finishing move no and you call the rustling mode but people used to finish people within wrestling you can but did I do it your way with the S grip on the forehead I thought that was all like your your innovation to turn into a submission ah no no no people were crying I don't know if they were cranking it exactly the way I cranked it but I'm pretty sure um had you seen other people get submitted with it before you ever started doing it we would like to in high school I wrestled a couple years and then I wrestled in Santa Ana High and in ninth grade a guy named Jesse Barrios and another guy his buddy is the one who showed me I can't remember his name I couldn't even remember it for my book but Jesse Barrios is his friend Santana high school 1985 if anybody out there is from that there's Jesse Barrios friend the other leg rider on that wrestling team fuck I don't know what his name was anyways he showed it to me and both of those in in wrestling leg riding is for weak people and all that means is is we need we're so weak we need to use our legs a lot more than the big strong dudes who were wrestling and and hitting the weights and had big chests and shoulders those guys really didn't rely on their legs as much as the weak guys like me I would skip rest a weightlifting practice I was in the back of her house hiding I was I was weak even back then I was a terrible athlete I've never been a great athlete so how to rely on using my legs and I thought you know they came to me Jesse came to me and I go dude you'll be perfect for this you know because they knew I just get out just get smashed if I try to go up heads up with people so it's a pinning move and that I learned in wrestling and um I got I got pretty good at it I would that was my shit even in high school that was my that was the thing I always tried I got some cool hair stories that maybe one day uh I'll talk about him but I have some cool wrestling stories but anyways I sucked at wrestling I only had one takedown in two fucking years I sucked so I just totally relied on my writing and and using the it's actually called the guillotine it's actually not called the twister it's called the guillotine but when I started doing it in jujitsu higen Machado and Jean Jacques Machado which is called the twister because the guillotine already existed there's a lot of people out there that that think that I'd like took this wrestling move and I said I'm going to try to fool the world and change the name and say I invented it there's thousands of people that think that it's hilarious in my books from day one I I it was hold on saying you're being a little bit modest because you invented all these setups and turned it into a very high percentage finish yeah you got a lot of setups from a lot of different places yes where it became I mean doing that none of that stuff existed but this is the transition so I ended up quitting wrestling the work the work the work the work ethic you need to be a good wrestler something that is just not in my body chemistry I was not made to work really hard physically I I just hated work regular jobs I knew that's
