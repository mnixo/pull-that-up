the girag an experience my daughter loves Bible stories really I'm I'm an atheist GJ once upon a time before you tell them oh I know she knows their stories okay yeah we call him the big invisible guy and you go old-school Old Testament or do you know we do the whole thing oh yeah I'm told to the story of you know did the guy who's gonna kill his son because the big invincible guy I say man and I scream like bake him in a pie with whipped cream because you know it's a terrific I don't have a knife to the throat I mean she's she was four but she loves the big 'visible guy story sir she loves the Noah one she loves to Adam and Eve one with the snake and the Apple that's all I mean these stories that they've stood the test of time there's really some of the best stories around who was guy killed his son was Cain and Abel no no Cain and Abel were the son of Adam and Eve they were brothers yeah and they killed each other right said Isaac and Abraham I think I know Isaac and not you know okay do we have a webcam hey but yeah Abraham is gonna kill the son right yeah so thank God who's asking him to kill a son for him yeah that you know as a love test yeah just because you know that's how you know yeah if someone really loves you like you know this is why you know you give this you give this to your wife you know like I would I would murder our offspring for you and that's the whole Marquardt that really helps your wife understand how much you love her I'm just or an ex-boyfriend if you're a marine expert I would find that way to export from the beat you up I'll murder him and sell you I love you but and I'm trying to tell the stories in a neutral way right like it's I again I write my opinions on all these stories and all that but she really likes the stories and she's a huge fan of Lucifer whoa I mean Lucifer is the guy he is like her superhero you know like he is her Mighty Morphin Power Rangers she thinks he is just the coolest because he's always standing up to big invisible guy right and right because for her prayer is you know everyone standing around say oh you are the best oh you're the best oh you're the greatest I love you so much oh you're the best you know and so you know Lucifer gets kind of tired of that and leads the rebellion and all that because you know I said you know just keep saying it she's on getting tired of it's like but not gonna keep saying it because it's an eternity of saying that to the guy right and she's like oh man I'm really tired I want to sit down it's like now you know how Lucifer fucking keeps them out of it anyway so she's got this great she's this great song yeah which goes basically Lucifer was Ron Luce ofoh was right you know and Wow songs and I'm just waiting because you know in Canada there's some homeschooling which is kind of all our in schooling what we were doing but a lot of them are Christians right so we can at some point be around a bunch of Christian kids she's gonna break into this song and I'm looking forward to that moment of trying to explain that maybe she's referring to a Beatles song I don't know I completely bail on her at that point I don't know what she gets it well the real issue is you're gonna have to mingle with those Christian parents the real issue when you have children besides raising the children which is of course the primary one teaching them and everything is dealing with these other parents and seeing it's it's really weird when I see people with their kids you know see how little they interact with their kids see how like not appreciative they are of their kids how they're always distracted or bring of cellphones around the playground yeah you know like you throw your cell phone go play go into stupid McDonald's tubes and go play with your kids I know a woman who's a psychologist and she picks up her kid and she's on her phone while she's picking the kid up the kids trying to talk to her about schooling uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and she's texting it's it's you know I mean you just the kid was gone for five hours when you picking them up you're texting yeah it's it's so it's so attractive to us though so easy to do it's so easy to ignore we get so used to you know the kid being around and we get so used to her own free time that oh my daughter is really good at that sorry to drive it she's great because you know like I'm trying to teach her eye contact right because you know when she's a kid you know I don't know if they can't focus when they look at you but they tell stories like they're just watching the biggest disco light show on the planet and you're just like some leaf or something right and so I tried to remind her you know eye contact when we're talking that kind of stuff right so the other day of course and I you know I try Oh Joe I try you know and I you know but every now and then like I get donations my whole show is just donations right no ads or anything and so if you know when a donation comes in it's like whoo kibble you know like I'm like the rat with the pellet you know okay but what did they get and I got this little catching noise that comes in because I'm for anyway so you know the kitchen noise come in my daughter was telling me something really important for her and all that and and yeah she's great she's like four she's like Daddy iContact like you're absolutely right I'm so sorry how rude that was of me I apologize that's hilarious yeah it's fascinating to watch their little brains develop isn't it watch the way they interact with each other see the world and realize like that this is how a person is shaped and this is the number one problem that we have as a race is that we don't respect this process and that we also don't respect this process and strangers especially people that we know are fucked people in bad neighborhoods people in bad circumstances people in abusive families we know they're fucked and we don't we don't do anything to stop it one thing that I keep harping on is that if we have a resource whether it's oil or gold being we protect that resource and you know we we set up laws and we attach a value to it but our number one resource for sure is human beings we have created all that you see whether it's laptops or buildings or cars that's all from a human being the best way to ensure that that continues to go on is to have less losers in the world the best way to have less losers is help out kids educate kids get on the ball with them very early and do something as a society protect them primary before we go into Wars before we go into all this stupid shit that we do spying on people's fucking emails and looking into their cell phone record before you do any of that how about you protect kids first that should be of primary importance and it should be like one of those things where your kid you know wants to go out and play if you done your homework you haven't done your homework you can't play it's that fucking simple you can't have your wars unless you fix the kids okay I'm there they're so smart and I you know I was human I've had a whole bunch of experts on my show which is you talk about the native intelligence of kids like kids can start doing mathematical reasoning at seven or eight months of age they can start do using empathy at 14 months my daughter at the age of four we started playing a game called subjective versus objective you know like is this something subjective like I like ice cream or is this something objective like ice cream is made from milk and you know we pointed stuff as a subject to her objective you know I like jazz subjective or objective and she's like bang rattling them off the other day she was saying to me dad you know we've talked a lot she's always asked me about the show in fact I should have been taking notes because she's asked me all about you what's gonna be the topic and I said you know what I have no idea I know it's gonna be interesting to chat with you no idea what we're going to talk about and conversation yeah yeah she's asked all about you know where you're from and what you do and she's fascinated by mixed martial arts and all that kind of stuff and and so she's gonna ask me also be and I do some shows on economics and so we talked a little bit about that you know fiat money and all that I grab stuff out for her that she gets it really gone through the whole history of the Second World War the other thing she says you know my daddy I think I've decided what I want to do I think when I get bigger I I think I just like to work I think I want to be the government I'd love to be the government because I just I want to type whatever I wanted to my bank account and I was just like wow you just nailed the Federal Reserve like right there in a night yeah whatever I want into my bank account bank over your old logic but perfect yeah it is what it is they can print their own money yeah it's beautiful great system yeah no one I come out of the sort of libertarian world right so I mean I'm an anarchist but I come out of the libertarian world and libertarians very much as we talked about law non-aggression principle and so on and I've been fighting this this battle in the libertarian world and in other worlds as well around you know things to me as basic as spanking right oh yeah yeah I wasn't sure we touched on this we did with more on the yen about this just throw a few stats for the audience who hasn't seen it before more than 90% of parents of toddlers say they spank their child toddlers sixty sixty one percent of moms three to five year olds have spanked their child in the past week boys spanked a lot more than girls boys are also diagnosed with ADHD which is one of the symptoms of spanking a lot more than girls spanking can continue into the adolescent years thirty to forty percent of people in junior high kids in junior high still being spanked moms do spank children a lot more than fathers do even controlling for time spent with kids and all of that kind of stuff economic status doesn't have a huge amount to do with spanking but culture death so african-americans do do a lot more corporal punishment religious conservatives fundamentalist do a lot more corporal punishment and so on and this to me is is such a fundamental thing I'm very much for a philosophy that you can do philosophy that you can act on values that you can do yeah I don't like the Federal Reserve I think central banking is a Monstress cancer in the eyeball of society but I can't really do much about it other than rant and rave about it but we can't what we can do is now do some basics like stop hitting kids you know that to me is a very fundamental thing and in the libertarian community that's a challenge lot a lot of religious conservatives in the libertarian community as you know like on the on the right around Republicans that tend to be more religious people on the left the secularists less religious people but more socialist and so on and it is really tough you know to just get that basic thing across we tell kids not to hit each other and we hit kids we've all I don't know if you out that you see bad parenting sometimes when you read and you act you actually and I'll usually say something to the parents because I don't want my my a I think it's rightly to do I don't want my daughter to see me be all about the ethics and then not talk to people doing something wrong but you can see parents hit kids saying don't hit your sister mm-hmm and that the fact that they can do that without their heads exploding from this wormhole contradiction of pretzel logic is just astounding but it is something we still have a long way to go in I think we're kind of slowly getting there but we have a long way to go and just let's not hit kids yeah I think how much of the world would change if we didn't do that would I think we would be virtually unrecognizable as a culture I couldn't agree more you know I read this our article recently on my message board I don't have it in front of me so I apologize to whoever posted it but it's about a man who got stuck in the financial system of divorce and it was from his perspective he committed suicide lit himself on fire I started reading his perspective and they came to his house and you know he had his initial issue because he slapped his daughter in the mouth so hard that her mouth was bleeding and he did it because she was licking his hand she kept licking his hand so he slapped her in the mouth til her mouth was me and then everything I I stopped reading right there I'm like I don't want to know this guy and I don't I'm sad that he was so fucked up that he committed suicide but if I saw a guy slap his daughter in the face because she you know was licking his hand I would have to really suppress my urge to strangle him yeah I mean that's violence that's violence to someone who cannot defend themselves and can't leave not only it used to be there not only that it's it's fundamentally the most fucked up kind of violence because you're doing it to a developing human being who you allegedly love you're teaching them that violence is a part of life by the people that they respect the most and that it can be done to you at time when you don't agree with whatever fucking guidelines and rules they've set up like licking your hand my daughter was licking my head I'd be laughing my ass off I would think it's so funny the idea that I'd smack her in the mouth is just fucking insane but people they fall into this pattern and they don't know don't realize that violence is violence just because you're not going to hurt the kid that bad you're just gonna spank them you think it's no big deal fuck yeah it's a big deal yeah because that kid it's a horrific situation you're doing something they can't control your holding their arm you're moving their body and then this big hand comes and slaps their ass and they feel pain and they feel confused cuz you've acted out against them you've not only acted out against them you've done it aggressively yelling and slapping and like it's a terrible it's terrible precedent to set a terrible idea to plant in a child's mind and it's unnecessary it's just not necessary for you to tell me that you can't sit down and reason with your child and do it with love and the yeah they're gonna freak out and fucking flail sometimes they get mad and yell and that's cuz they're a fucking child you piece of shit you don't smack them you know you don't smack em George are you hitting your friends it's like hitting your friend on't hit anybody man well and and in particular you know the moral concentration of like black-hearted nastiness you know you hit your wife she got to date you she got to you know you had an engagement she you know she chose you and you chose her but if you hit your wife she at least had to get to test-drive you shit you know and then she can leave at any time she's an adult she's got shelters she's got whatever people will help her hope but kids they didn't choose you as parents Akal you know and they can't leave and and they have no options and I say this to my daughter you know I say umm I say I know you're not here by choice you know you didn't choose me is it I choose to have kids and you didn't choose me as a dad the way I have to parent is I want to parent like if my daughter did have a choice of any dad in the world that she would choose me like and so I imagine ice cream cookies all day long absolutely and and I reduce and and and what about feedback you know and I go to my local pizza joint half the time have to fill out why don't they give me this comment card to fill out you know how did you like the pizza you know was really good for you was it bad for you yeah they want to know they want to have a good pizza and how many times the parents do that with their kids say how am i doing you know how sim your experience of my parenting you know what's more important can slice of pizza or your relationship with your offspring you know ask them how you're doing how could today have been better what did I do that you liked what did I do that you didn't like and all that get that kind of feedback I don't it's just weird that we don't even think of doing that I think your perspective is very unique in the fact that you are stay-at-home dad you do have the resources to be able to do that it's it's really hard for a lot of people that's what you were talking about before that number is pretty crazy the twenty minutes a week I didn't know that it was that low but honestly not shocked I don't have a regular life but I've dabbled in regular life you know I've had like jobs that take me away for a long period of time during the day and I could only imagine what kind of energy you have to devote to a kid if the mother both mother and the father both leave the house all day long work an eight-hour day and then come home how much is left there's not even much time the kid's gonna be a week yeah how much energy do you have left how much focus are you putting on that kid during the day and and we have this get a couple more stats we have this idea that the moms have to be there and the dads can be there but a study conducted by dr. Kyle Pruitt found that infants between 7 and 30 months respond more favorably to being picked up by their fathers he also found a fathers parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical cognitive and emotional and behavioral development a mother's tend to reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encouraged them to manage their frustration my daughters like this sighs she's learning to do all these things and most of her friends were older because you know were nothing like youngest parents on the block and so a lot of her friends can do stuff better than she can she gets frustrated me helping her talk it through that frustration and reminding her that I didn't know how to do this stuff and you know she's trying to do racquet sports and I remember take me years to become good at racquet sports so so that's important for for kids as well I mean it's really important to remember you know that the mom and the kid they used to be the same freakin person you know like that she grew her they like the it's like my arm you know it's not like a separate thing where's dad still have a little bit more objectivity around that longer term study that this guy did to prove that her father's active involvement with his kids from birth to adolescence promotes greater emotional balance stronger curiosity a stronger sense of self assurance additional studies during the first five years of a child's life the father's role is more influential than the mothers in how the child learns to manage his or her body navigate social social circumstances in play and the last one is this the 1996 study that I was referring to before by McGill University the single most important childhood factor in developing empathy his paternal involvement in childcare the study further concluded that children who spend time alone bonding with their children more than twice per week brought up the most compassionate adults so how do they measure that has our quantifiable it seems like a weird all those statistics seem very odd it's like how do you know what caused a person to have more empathy how do you know what caused a person to be able to move better and I mean how do you how do well what they prove that again it's sort of a many-to-many relationship so they they ask the fathers you know how often were you involved and maybe they even measure them if it's sort of a live study and then they measure the compassion and then they measure a whole bunch of other things and if the other things don't change the compassion measure but then the parental involvement is what moves the needle then they assume that that's close to causal but isn't the issue also the parental involvement like say if a father is involved a lot and the kid's life he's also probably likely involved in the relationship with the wife and maybe the wife would be more happy the father and the wife would be more happy and because of that they would both be better parents it could you know it might not just be that the impact of having a man around does all these things and creates an empathy it might be the impact of having a successful family as well right right now and that certainly is true and again I didn't run the studies I assume that they've tried like whenever you question this all we tried to tease it out this way or that way they they do try to find that answer but I do think that compassion again you know I mean your marriage you've got you've got kids floating around and all that and I'm floating but they're about that they were floating at one point and then they came out through the magic chamber but I think you know I mean my wife skills as a parent are fantastic and but but there are some differences between us you know and I don't know whether it's biological or whether it's just the way we're raised or whatever but you know I encourage more risk-taking I'm encouraged you know if you fall off the horse get back up on again kind of stuff and I think that's just a kind of a natural kind of difference and I'm also more encouraging of you know my daughters like crazy friendly I keep thinking she's gonna go up to someone sometimes an unfriendly world like a cheese up to a grater you know it just kinda get shredded because you know we go places and she just goes up to kids and says hi would you like to be friends and that's cool Oh fantastic that's a dealer you know the world of the little you know oh I love it wouldn't everybody was on ecstasy that's how we would interact with each other [Music] you
