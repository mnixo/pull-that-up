and here we go all right Nick this is one of the things that scares people more than anything is the idea that we're creating something or someone's gonna create something it's gonna be smarter than us it's gonna replace us is that something we should really be concerned about I presume you're afraid to babies I'm referring to artificial intelligence yes well it's the the big fear and the big hope I think both at the same time yeah how is it the big hope well there are a lot of things wrong with the world that is not pull this up to your face all the problems we have most of them could be solved if we were smarter or if we had somebody on our side who were a lot smarter with better technology and so forth also I think if we want to imagine some really grand future where humanity or our descendants when they go out and colonize the universe I think that's likely to happen if it's gonna happen at all after we have super intelligence that then develops the technology to make that possible the real question is whether or not we would be able to harness this intelligence or whether it would dominate yeah that certainly is one question not the only you could imagine that we harness it but then use it for bad purposes as we have a lot of other technologies through history yes I think there are really two challenges we need to meet one one is to make sure we can align it with human values and then make sure that we together do something better with it than fighting worse or oppressing one another I think well what I'm worried about more than any things that human beings are going to become obsolete that we're going to invent something that's the next stage of evolution I'm really concerned with that I'm really concerned with if we look back on ancient hominids Australia Pittacus just think of some primitive ancestor of man we don't want to go back to that like that that's a terrible way to live I'm worried that what we're creating is the next thing I think we don't necessarily want at least I wouldn't be totally thrilled with with the future where humanity as it is now was was the last and final word the ultimate version beyond right I think there's a lot of room for improvement sure but not anything that is different is an improvement right so so the key would be I think to find some path forward where the best in us can continue to exist and develop to even greater levels and maybe at the end of that path it looks nothing like we do now maybe it's not two legged armed creatures running around with three pounds of thinking matter right it might be something quite different but as long as it what we value is is present there and ideally in a much higher degree than in the current world then that could count as a success yeah the idea that we're in a state of evolution that we are just like we look at ancient hominids that we are eventually going to become something more advanced or at least more complicated than we are now but what I'm worried is that biological life itself has so many limitations when we look at the evolution of Technology if you look at Moore's Law or if you just look at new cell phones like they just released a new iPhone yesterday and they talked about all these incremental increases in the ability to take photographs and wide-angle lenses in night mode and a new chip that works even faster these things there's not the word evolutions incorrect but the innovation of technology is so much more rapid than anything we could ever even imagine biologically like if we had a thing that we'd create if we created instead of artificial intelligence in terms of like some something in a chip or a computer if we created a life-form a biological life-form but this biological life-form was improving radically every year like it didn't even exist like the iPhone existed in 2007 that's what it was invented if we had something that was 12 years old but all the sudden was infinitely faster and better and smarter and wiser than it was 12 years ago the new version of it version x1 we would we would circle will be hit the brakes on this thing man how how many more generations before this thing's way smarter than us how many more generations before this thing thinks that human beings are obsolete yeah it's coming coming at us but some people think oh it's slowing down who thinks it's slowing down well don't I have it like Tyler Cowen and you're gonna Peter Thiel's sometimes goes on about the pace of innovation and not really being what it needs to be mm-hmm I mean maybe it was faster in like 1890s or but but still compared to almost all of human history it seems like a period of unprecedented rapid progress right now unprecedented I'd say so yeah I mean except for maybe a couple of decades hundred years ago when there was a lot of you know electricity the whole thing yeah no I agree I just I'm I don't think it's a concern because it's more of a curiosity I am concerned but more I look at it and go well this is see it seems inevitable that we're we're going to run into artificial intelligence but the questions are so open-ended we really don't know when we don't really don't know what form it's gonna take and we really don't know what it's going to do to us yeah I see it this not something that should be avoided neither something that we should just be completely gone how about but more like a kind of gate through which we will have to pass at some point all paths that are both possible only two really great futures I think at some point involve the development of greater than human intelligence machine intelligence and so that our focus should be on getting our act together as much as we can in whatever period of time we have before that prepare ourselves well I mean that might involve doing some some research into various technical questions as how you build these systems so that we actually understand what they are doing and they have some you know intended impact on the world it might also if we are to get our act together a little bit that I don't on the kind of global political scene a little bit more peace and love in the world would be good anymore would be nice so and and then like refraining from destroying ourselves through some other means before we even get a chance to try to needle our way through this this gate well that's certainly possible we were certainly capable of screwing it all up where is the current state of Technology now in regards to artificial intelligence and how far away do you think we are from AGI well different different people have different views on that I think the the truth of the matter is that it's very hard to have accurate views about the timelines for these things that that's you know or still involve kind of beginning breakthroughs that have to happen certainly I mean over the last eight or ten years there has been a lot of excitement away the deep learning revolution things that I mean it used to be that people thought of a is this kind of autistic savant really good at logic and counting and memorizing facts but with no no intuition and there's this deep learning evolution and when you begin to do these deep neural networks do you kind of solved perception in some sense you can have computers that can see that that can hear and that have visual intuition so so so that that has enabled the whole wide suite of applications which makes it commercially valuable which then drives a lot of investment in it which you know there's a so there's now quite a lot of momentum in in machine learning and trying to kind of stay ahead at that it's interesting that when we think about artificial intelligence and whatever potential form that's going to take if you look in films like 2001 like how like open the door Hal you know like we think of some thing that's communicating to us like like a person would and maybe is a little bit colder and doesn't doesn't share our values and has a more pragmatic view of life and death and and things when we think of intelligence though I think intelligence in our mind is almost inexorably connected to all the things that make us human like emotions and and and ambition and all these things like the reason why we innovate like we it's not really clear like why we innovate because we enjoy innovation and because we want to make the world a better place and because we want to fix some problems that we've created and we want to solve some limitations of the human body and the environment that we live in but we sort of assumed that intelligence that we create will also have some motivations well there is a fairly large class of possible structures you could do if you want to do anything that has any kind of cognitive or intellectual capacity at all a large class of those would be what we might call agent so this would be yeah systems that interact with the world in pursuit of some goal and if there are a sophisticated class of agents they they can plan ahead the sequence of actions like more primitive agents might just have reflexes but but the sophisticated aidan might have a model of the world where it can kind of think ahead before it starts doing stuff it can think what what would I need to do in order to reach this desired state and then recent backwards from that so I think it's a fairly natural it's not the only possible cognitive system you could build but it's also not these weird bizarre special case that you know it's a fairly natural thing to tame for if you are able to specify the goal something you want to achieve but you don't know how to achieve it the natural way of trying to go about that is by building the system that has this goal and is an agent and then moves around and tries different things and eventually perhaps learned to solve that task do you anticipate different types of artificial intelligence like artificial intelligence that mimics the human emotions like these do you think that people will construct something that's very similar to us in a way that we can interact with it in in common terms or do you think it will be almost like communicating with an alien so they're different scenarios here I mean I guess my guess is that the first thing that actually achieved super intelligence would not be very human-like there are different possible ways you could try to get to this level of Technology what one would be by trying to reverse-engineer the human brain mmm we have an existence in in the limit limit in case you might imagine if you just made an exact duplicate in in silicon of the human brain like every neuron had some counterpart so that that that seems technologically very difficult to do but it wouldn't require in a big theoretical breakthrough to do it you could just through if you had sufficiently good microscopy and large enough computers and in us elbow grease you couldn't kind of it but it seems to me plausible that what will work before we are able to do it that way will be some more synthetic approach work that would only be a very rough resemblance maybe with the neocortex yeah that's one of the big questions right whether or not we can replicate all the functions of the human brain in the way it functions in in like mimic it exactly or whether we could have some sort of superior method that achieves the same results that the human brain does in terms of its ability to calculate and reason and and do multiple tasks at the same time yeah and I also think that maybe once you have a sufficiently high level of this general form of intelligence then you could use that maybe to emulate or mimic things that we do differently so maybe we our cortex is quite limited so we rely a lot on earlier neurological structures that we have we have to we have to be guided by motion because we can't just calculate everything out mmm and an instinct and and it made me and if we lost all of that we would be helpless but maybe some system that had a sufficiently high level of this more abstract reasoning capability could maybe use that to substitute for things that weren't built-in in the same way that we did have you ever talked to Sam Harris about this yeah a little bit have you ever had a podcast with him oh yeah it actually he had him on in his podcast half a year ago I'll have to have to listen to it because he has the worst view of the the future and of artificial intelligence he's terrified of it and when I talked to him terrifies me and Elon Musk is right up there he also has a terrifying view of what our artificial intelligence could potentially be what do you say to those guys well I mean I I do think that that are these significant risks that will be associated with this transition to the machine intelligence era including existential risks threats to the very survival of humanity or what we care about so why are we doing this well there are a lot of things we're we're doing that may be global it would be better if we didn't do I mean just why do we build thousands of nuclear weapons all right why do we over fish the ocean yeah so no I mean if one actually asked why do different individuals work on AI research or why do different companies and governments funded I mean there a lot of explanation it's like a great scientific endeavor if you can make the Google search engine 1% better that's got to be worth like a billion dollars right off the bat it's become a kind of prestige thing now where nations want to have some sort of strategy because it's seen as this new frontier just like when you had you know steam engines and industrialization a few hundred years ago and an electricity like it's good to just open up a lot of economic opportunities you want to be in there where it's happy you are a various kind of we're going to do subsistence agriculture while in the rest of the world is moving on so there's there's a lot of its kind of over determined like you could remove some of these reasons and that would still be enough reasons for why people would be pushing forward with this one of the things that scares me the most is the idea that if we do create artificial intelligence then it will improve upon our design and create far more sophisticated versions of itself and it'll continue to do that until it's unrecognizable until it reaches literally a god-like potential mmm that I mean I forget what the real numbers were maybe you could tell us but someone had calculated some reputable source had calculated the amount of improvement that sentient artificial intelligence would be able to create inside of a small window of time like if it was allowed to innovate and then make better versions of itself and those better versions of itself were allowed to innovate and make better versions of itself you're talking with not an exponential increase of intelligence but an explosion well we don't know so it's hard enough to forecast the pace at which we will make advances in AI because we just don't know how hard the problems are that we haven't yet solved right and you know once you get the human level or a little bit above I mean who knows it could be that there is some level where to get further you need like to put in a lot of thinking time to kind of get there now what is easier to estimate is if you just look at the speed because that's just a function of the hardware that you're running it on right so so there we know that there is a lot of room in principle if you look at the physics of computation and you look at what would an optimally arranged physical system be that was optimized for computation that would be like way many many orders above what what we can do now and that then you could have arbitrarily large systems like that so from from that point of view we know that that could be things that would be like a million times faster than the human brain and with a lot more memory and stuff like that and then something if it did have a million times more power than the human brain it could create something with a million times more computational power than itself it could make better versions it could continue to innovate like if let me create something that we can we say you are I mean it is sentient it is artificial intelligence now please go innovate please go follow the same directive and improve upon your design yeah well but we don't know how how long that would take then we'll get to something we already have sort of millions of times more thinking capacity than a human has I mean we have millions of humans right so if you kind of break it down you think there's like one milestone when you have maybe an AI that could do what one human can do but then that might still be quite a lot of orders of magnitude you know until it would be equivalent of the whole human species and maybe during that time other things happened maybe we upgrade you know our own abilities in some way so there are some scenarios where it's so hard to get even to one human baseline that we kind of use this massive amount of resources just to barely create kind of you know villages yes using billions of dollars of compute right so if that's the way we get there then I mean it might take quite a while because you can't easily scale something that you've already spent billions of dollars building yeah some people think the whole thing is blown out of proportion that we're so far away from creating artificial general intelligence that resembles human beings that it's all just vaporware mm-hmm what do you say to those people well I mean what one one would be that I would want to be more precise about just how far away does it have to be in order for us to be rational to ignore it you know it might be that if something is sufficiently important and high-stakes that even if it's not going to happen in the next 5 10 20 30 years it might still be wise for you know our pool of seven billion plus people to have some people actually thinking about this ahead of time so some of these disagreements I guess this is my point or more apparent than real like this some people say it's gonna happen soon and some other people say no it's not gonna happen for a long time and then you know one person means by soon five years and another person means by a long time five years and you know it's more of different attitudes rather than different specific beliefs so so I would first want to make sure that there actually is a disagreement mmm now if there is if somebody is very confident that it's not gonna happen in hundreds and hundreds of years then I guess I would want to know their reasons for that level of confidence what what's the evidence they're looking at you know do they have some ground for for being very sure about this certainly the history of Technology prediction is not that great you can find a lot of other examples where even very eminent technologists and scientists were culture it's not gonna happen in our lifetime yeah in some cases it that actually already just happened in some other part of the world or it happened a year later so I think some some epistemic humility the way these things would be wise I was watching a talk that you were giving and you were talking about the the growth of innovation in technology and GDP over the last 100 years and you were talking about the entire history of life on Earth and what a short period of time humans have been here and then what a enduring what a short period of time what a stunning amount of innovation and how much change we've enacted on the earth and just a blink of an eye and you had the scale of GDP over you know the course over the last hundred years it's it's crazy to look because it's so difficult for us with our current perspective just being a person living going about the day-to-day life that seems so normal to put it in perspective timewise and see what an enormous amount of change is taking place in relatively an incredibly short amount of time yeah I mean we think of this as sort of the normal way for things to be the idea that the alarm wakes up in the morning and then you commute in and sit in front of the computer all day and you try not to eat too much and and that if you sort of imagine that I don't know maybe in 50 years or 100 years or at some point in the future could be very different that's like some radical hypothesis but of course this Cottam called normal condition is a huge anomaly any any which way you look at it I mean if you look at it on geological time scale the human species is very young if you look at it historically you know for you know more than 90% we were just hunter-gatherers running around and agriculture list for and the what what would the last couple of hundred years when some parts of the world have escaped the Malthusian condition where were you basically only have as much income as you need to be able to produce two children and we have the population exploited like all of this is very very very recent and in in space as well of course almost everything is ultra-high vacuum and and we live on the surface of this little special from and yet we think this is normal and everything else is weird but I think that's a complete inversion and so when you do plot if you do plot for example world GDP which is a kind of rough measure for the total amount of productive capability that we have right if you plot it over ten thousand years what you see is just a flat line and then a vertical line and you can't really see any other structure like it's it's so extreme that they agree to which humanity's productive capital so is so if I looked at this picture and we now we imagine this is now the normal this is the way it's going to be now indefinitely it just Kansas means a prima facie impossible like it certainly doesn't look like we are in a static period right now it looks like this is we're in the middle of some kind of explosion explosion and in oddly enough everyone involved in the explosion everyone that's innovating everyone is creating all this new technology they're all a part of this momentum that was created before they were even born so it does feel normal they're just a part of this whole spinning machine and they jump in they're born they go to college next thing you know they have a job and they're contributing to making new technology and then more people jump in and add on to it and there's very little perspective in terms of like the historical significance of this incredible explosion technologically when you look at what you're talking about that gigantic spike no one feels it which is one of the weirdest things about it that mean you kind of expect every year that would be a better iPhone yes not would be almost all of human history people lived and died and so absolutely no technological change and in fact you could have many many generations the very idea that there was some trajectory in the material conditions is a relatively new idea I mean people thought of history either as you know some kind of descent from a golden age or some people had a cyclical view but it was all in terms of political organization that would be kingdom and then a wise ruler would rule for a while and then like a few hundred years later you know their grand great-grandchildren would be too greedy and it would come into anarchy and then you know a few hundred years later it would come back together again yes so so it would be all these kind of the pieces moving around right but no new pieces really entering or if they did it was at such a slower rate that you didn't notice but over the eons you know they're the wheel slowly turns and you know somebody makes a slightly better wheel somebody figures out how to you know irrigate a lot better they they breed better crops and and eventually there is an us that you could have enough of a population in off prints that then create more ideas at the quickeneth rate that you get this Industrial Revolution and and that's where we are now like Elon Musk had the most terrifying description of humanity said that we are the biological bootloader for artificial intelligence mm-hmm so that's what we're here for boots are important they are important but I think there's like objectively and there's personally like objectively if you were outside of the human race and you were looking at all these various life-forms competing on this planet first for resources and for survival you would look at humanity and you go well you know clearly that's not it's not finished so there's gonna be another version of it it's like when is this version gonna take place is it gonna take place over millions and millions of years like it has historically when it comes to biological organisms or is it going to invent something that takes over from there and then that's the new thing some something that's not based on tissue something that's not based on cells and doesn't have the biological limitations that we have nor nor does it have all the emotional attachments attachments to things like breeding social dominance hierarchies all those things where no consequence to it doesn't mean anything because it's not biological yeah yeah I mean IIIi don't think millions of years have more number of decades or whatever but but it's interesting that even if we set that aside we say machine intelligence is possible for some reason let's just play without then I still think that would be very rapid change including biological change and I mean we are doing great advances making great advances in biotech as well and will increasingly be able to control what our own organisms are doing through different means and enhance human capacities through biotechnology and so so even there although it's not gonna happen overnight but over an historically very short period of time I think it would still see quite profound change just from applying bioscience to change human capacities yeah one of the technologies or one of the things that's been discussed to sort of mitigate the dangers of artificial intelligence is a potential merge some sort of symbiotic relationship with technology that you you see you hear discussed like I don't know exactly how Ilan's neural link works but it seems like a step in that direction there's some sort of a brain implant that in that interacts with an external device and this all of this increases the bandwidth for available intelligence and knowledge yeah I'm sort of skeptical that that will work I mean good that somebody tries it you know but I think it's quite technically hard to improve and normal healthy human beings say cognitive capacity are the capacities by implanting things in them and get benefits that you couldn't equally well get by having the gadget outside of the body so I I don't need to have an implant to be able to use Google right right and there are a lot of advantages to having it external you you can upgrade it very easily you can shut it off because well hopefully you could do that even within Fanta and once you start to look into the details there's are these kind of demos but then if you if you actually look at the papers often you find well and then the way these side effects and today so they had some deficit and the speech do you know like yeah infection like it is just palate is messy yes so maybe it will work better than done I expect that that could be good but otherwise I think that the the place where it will first become possible to enhance kind of human biological capacities would be through genetic selection which is technologically something very near you mean what CRISPR type lot so that would be editing right when you actually go in and change things that also is moving we don't mean by selection also this would recipe in the context of say in vitro fertilization you have usually some half-dozen or dozen embryos created during this fertility procedure which is standard ly used so rather than just the doctor kind of looking at these embryos and saying well that one looks healthier I'm going to implant that you could run some genetic tests and then use that as a predictor and select the one you think has the most desirable attributes and so this could be a trend in terms of how human beings reproduce that we instead of just randomly having sex woman gets pregnant gives birth to a child we don't know what it's gonna be what its what's gonna happen we just hope that it's a good kid instead of that you start looking at the all of various components that we can measure yeah and so I mean to some extent we already do this there are a lot of testing done for various chromosomal abnormalities that you can already check for but but our ability to to look beyond clear stark diseases that is one gene is wrong like they look at more complex trait this is increasing rapidly so obviously there are a lot of ethical issues and yeah but if I were just talking what is technologically feasible and I think that that I mean already could do a very limited amount of that today and maybe you'd get you know two or three IQ points in expectation more if you selected using current technology based on 10 embryos let us say so very small but but as genomics gets better at deciphering the genetic architecture of complex traits whether its intelligence or our personality attributes then then you would have more selection power and you could do more and then there is a number of other technologies we don't yet have but which if you did would then kind of stack with that and enable much more powerful forms of of enhancement so so so there yeah I don't think there are and any major technological hurdles really in the way just some small amount of incremental further improvement that's when you talk about doing something with genetics and human beings and selecting selecting for the superior versions and then if everybody starts doing that the ethical concerns when you start discussing that people get very nervous because I started to look at their own genetic defects and they go oh my god what if I didn't make the cut like I wouldn't be here and he started thinking about all the imperfect people that have actually contributed in some pretty spectacular ways to what our culture is and like well if everybody has perfect genes with all these things even take place like what are we doing really if we're bypassing nature and we're choosing to select for the traits and the attributes that we find to be the most positive and attractive like what are like that I think what what would happen if say some earlier age had had this ability to kind of lock in there yes you know that their prejudices or if the Victorians had had issues we would all be whatever pious and patriotic now or something yeah yeah so so so it in in general with all of these powerful technologies we we are developing that there is like I think the ideal course would be that we would first gain a bit more wisdom and then we would get all of these powerful tools but it looks like we are getting the powerful tools before we have really achieved a very high level of wisdom yeah but we haven't earned them the people that are using them are sort of where we haven't like think about the technology that all of us use how many how many pieces of technology to use in the day and how much do you actually understand any of those most people have very little understanding if I any of the things they use work they put no effort at all into creating those things but yet they've inherited the responsibility of the power that those things possess yeah I mean that's the only way we can do it it's just way too complex for any person if you had to sort of learn how to build everything ever told you use like we wouldn't get very far isn't that fascinating though when you think about human beings and all the different things we do we have very little understanding of the mechanisms behind most of what we need for day-to-day life yet we just use them because there's so many of us and so many people are understanding various parts of all these different things that together collectively we can utilize the intelligence of all these millions of people that have innovated and we with no work whatsoever just go into the Verizon store and pick up the new phone yeah I mean and not just technology but worldviews and political ideas as well it's not as if most people sit down with an empty table try to think from the basic principles of what would be the ideal configuration of the state or something like that you just kind of absorb it and go with it you float in the stream of nature and and it's amazing just how little of that actually at any point channels through your sort of conscious attention where you make some rational otherwise but like deliberate decision most you just get carried away with so but but that that again I mean if we have if this is what we have to work with then there's no other way you know otherwise I know it's there's no other way and there's no way even like you and I discussing this like discussing the the history of this incredible spike of evolution or innovation rather in technology it feet just doesn't feel like anything it feels normal so even though we can intellectualize it even though we can have this conversation talk about what an incredible time work and how terrifying it is the things are moving at such an incredibly rapid rate and no one no one's putting the brakes on it no one's thinking about the the potential pros and cons we're just pushing ahead yeah well not nobody not no I mean there are seeing people come to my research yes there's actually increase I mean when I I got interested in these things in the 90s and it was very much a fringe activity there was some internet mailing list some people exchanging ideas but but ever since then I mean there's now a small set of academic research institutes and some other that are kind of actually trying to do more systemic thinking about some of these big picture topics when did it seem like it was possible like if you got involved in it in the 90s it must have seemed like some very fringe sort of pie in the sky idea of an hour general artificial intelligence as a retard specifically about a yeah well actually the field of artificial intelligence sometimes is kind of dated to 1956 there was a conference but I mean it's somewhat normal sure but roughly that's when it got started but the pioneers even right back at the beginning thought that they would gonna be able to do all the things that the human brain does and in fact they were quite optimistic like thought maybe 10 years of something like that back then yeah many of them really even before computers no they had computers you know 56 yeah what kind of computers well as well yeah slow computers when when was the computer invented well it's one of those things I think during the the Second World War they had computers that were useful for doing stuff and before that I had kind of tabulating machines and before that I had designs for things that if there had been put together would have been able to calculate a lot of numbers and then before that they had an abacus bit kind of there's a number of like that the line from having some external tool like a notepad which you can you can calculate bigger numbers right if you can scribble on a piece of paper to a modern-day supercomputer like you did that kind of you can break it down into small steps and they happen gradually but but yeah roughly since they the the 40s or so that's when they first invented I like an electrical yeah yeah I think so even back then they thought we were only about 10 years away well some plows in in the in the mid-50s when when people started using the word artificial intelligence some of these AI researchers at a time where were quite optimistic about the timelines in fact there was some some some summer project that we're gonna have a few students or whatever and work over the summer and I thought oh maybe we can solve vision over the summer and now we've kind of Sol edition but that's like 60 years later so it can be hard to know how hard the problem is until you've actually solved it but the really interesting thing to me is that even though I can understand why they were wrong about how difficult it is because how would you know right if it's ten years of work or 100 years of work kind of hard to estimate at the outset but what is striking is that even the ones who thought it was ten years away it they didn't think of what the obvious next step would be after that like if you actually succeeded at mechanizing all the functions of the human mind that they couldn't it I think well it's obviously not going to stop there once you get human equivalents like you're going to get super intelligence but it was as if the imagination muscle had so exhausted itself thinking of this radical possibility you could have a machine that does everything that the human knows that it couldn't kind of take the next step after that or or for that matter the immense ethical and social implications even if all you could do is to replicate a human mind like in a machine that if you actually thought you were building that and you were 10 years away you'd be crazy not to spend like a lot of time thinking about how this is going to impact the world but that didn't really seem to have occurred much to them at all well sometimes it seems that people just want to do it like even with the creation of the atomic bomb I mean they they felt like they had to do it because we had to develop it before the Germans did right but there was a specific reason like you know suggest it could be fun to do right sure and so with the Manhattan Project obviously it was during wartime and maybe Hitler had a program they thought so you can easily see why that yeah it would motivate a lot of people but even even before they actually started the Manhattan product so the guy who kind of first conceived of the idea that you could make a nuclear explosion Leo Szilard he was the was a kind of eccentric physicist who conceived of the idea of a chain reaction so it's been known before that that you could split the atom and a little bit of energy came out but if you're going to split one atom at a time right you're never gonna get anything because it's too little so the idea of a chain reaction was that if you split an atom when it releases two neutrons in each of those can split another two atoms that then these four neutrons and you get an exposure an exponential blow-up and so he thought of this I forget exactly one it must have been in the third early thirties probably and he was a remarkable person because he didn't just think oh this is a fun idea I should publish it and you know get a lot of citations but he thought like what would this mean for the world like the idea this is this could be bad for civilization and so he then went to try to persuade some other of his colleagues who were also working in nuclear physics not not to pursue this not to publish on related areas and some partial success so there were some partial success were his college some some things were not published immediately it's not known all of his colleagues listened to him so of course isn't that the problem was that some people were always going to want to be the ones that sort of innovate that is the problem in those cases were you would actually prefer the innovation not to happen yes historically of course we now look back and think there are a lot of dissenters that we are now glad could have their way because a lot of cultures were quite resistant to innovation and I wanted to do the way things had always been whether it's like social innovation or technological innovation you know that the Chinese were at one point ahead in seafaring exploring and then they shot all of that down because the the Emperor at the time I guess didn't like it and so there are many examples of kind of stasis but as long as there were a lot of different places a lot of different countries a lot of different Mavericks then somebody would always do it and then once the others could see that it worked you know that could kind of copy and things move forward but of course if there is a technology you actually want not to be developed then this multipolar situation makes it very very hard to coordinate to refrain from doing that and yeah this this I think is a kind of structural problem in the current human condition that is ultimately responsible for a lot of the existential risks that we will face in this century there's this kind of failure of ability to solve global coordination problems yeah and when you think about the people that did in Oppenheimer and the people behind the Manhattan Project they were inventing this to deal with this existential threat this horrific threat from Nazi Germany this the Japanese and of the world war two you know this this idea that this evil empire is going to try to take over the world and this created the momentum and this created the motivation to develop this incredible technology that wind up making a great amount of our electricity and wound up creating enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire world many times over and we're in this strange state now or it was motivated by this horrific moment in history this evil empire that tries to take over the world and we come up with this incredible technological solution the ultimate weapon that we detonate a couple of times on some cities and then now we're in this weird state where you know we're how many years later of 80 years later and we were not doing it anymore we don't drop any bombs on people anymore but we all have them and we all have them pointed at all well yes which is a good thing quite a few but it's incredible that the motivation for this incredible technology this amazing technology was actually to deal with something that was awful yeah yeah I mean war has been a like had a way of focusing minds and stuff now I think that nuclear energy we would have had anyway maybe it would have been developed like five years or ten years later reactors are not that difficult to do so I think we could have gotten to all the good uses of nuclear technology that we have today without having to had kind of a nuclear bomb developed now you pay attention to like Boston Dynamics and all these all these different robotic creations that they've made well they seem to have a penchant for doing the relay sinister-looking but I think all robots that are you know anything that looks autonomous is kind of sinister looking you see the Japan yeah I mean like the Japanese have these like big eyed sort of rounded so it's a different China Turkish Boston Dynamics is like I want the Pentagon to give them funding or something right DARPA yeah they'll they look like they're developing terminators yeah yeah but but what I was thinking is if we do eventually come to a time where those things are going to war for us instead of us like if we get involved in robot wars our robots versus their robots and this becomes the next motivation for increased technological innovation to try to deal with superior robots by the Soviet Union or by China like these these are more things that could be threats that could push people to some crazy level of technological innovation yeah it could I mean I think there are other drivers for technological innovation as well that that seems of plenty strong sure commercial drivers let to say that we wouldn't have to rely on on war or the threat of war it's a kind of stay innovative and I mean there has been this effort to try to see if it would be possible to have some kind of ban on lethal autonomous weapons mmm just as I mean there are huge technologies that we have like there is has been a relatively successful ban on chemical and biological weapons and which have by and large been you know honored and upheld there there are kind of treaties on nuclear weapons which has limited proliferation yes there are no maybe I don't know it doesn't I don't know the exact number but it's certainly a lot better than 50 or 100 countries yes and some other weapons as well blinding lasers landmines monster munitions and so so so some people think maybe we could do something like this with lethal autonomous weapons killer BOTS that you do we is that really what humanity needs most now like another arms race to develop like a killer bot it seems arguably the answer to that is no I've I've kind of there's a lot of my friends are supported I kind of stayed a little bit on the sidelines on that particular campaign being a little unsure exactly what it is that I mean certainly I think it'd be better if we refrain from having some arms race to develop these they're not but if you start to look in more detail what what precisely is the thing that you're hoping to ban so if the idea is the autonomous bit like the robot should not be able to make its own firing decision well right if the alternative to that is there is some 19 year old guy sitting in some office building and his job is whenever the screen flashes fire now he has to press a red button mmm and then exactly the same thing happens I mean I'm not sure how much is gained by having that extra step but it is something it feels better for us for sure okay so I'm not pushing the button right but exactly what does that mean like in every particular fire decision or is it like some well you've got to attack this group of surface ships here and like here are the general parameters and you're not to fire outside this these coordinates like interstate I I don't know I mean another is the question of it would be better if I had no wars but if there is going to be a war maybe it is better if it's robot the robot or horev if there's got to be bombing like maybe you want the bombs to have high precision rather than low precision like get fewer civilian casualties and operating under artificial intelligence also depends exactly on her so I don't know I mean on the other hand you could imagine it kind of reduces the threshold for going to war if you think that you wouldn't fear any casualties maybe it would be more than I eager to do it bro or or or if it proliferates and you have these kind of mosquito sized killer BOTS that terrorists have and you know it's not not doesn't seem like a good thing to have a society we having like a facial recognition thing and then the bot flies out and you just have a kind of dystopia so yeah I think we're thinking rationally if you're thinking rationally given the overall view of the human race that we want peace and everything to be well but realistically if you were someone who is trying to attack someone militarily you'd want the best possible weapons it give you the best possible advantage and that's why we had to develop the atomic bomb first it's probably why we'll develop the or we'll try to develop the killer autonomous robot first yeah yeah I mean some guys would have it right the fair that the other is yeah so this is what it's basically a coordination problem like it's hard for any one country unilaterally to make sure that the world is is peaceful and sure and kind right it requires everybody to synchronize their actions and and then then you can have successes like we've had with some of these treaties like we've not had a big arms race in biological weapons or in chemical weapons I mean they have been that were there were cheaters even on the biological warfare program like the Soviet Union had massive efforts there but still probably less use of that and less development and if there had been no such treaty so and our just look at the amount of money being wasted every year to maintain these large Arsenal's so that we can kill one another I wonder we decide to do it like that there's gotta be a better way yeah we're getting there it's hard yeah we would hope that we would get to some point where all this would be irrelevant yeah because there's no more war yeah and so if you look at the the biggest efforts so far to make that happen so after the First World War people were really aware of that said this this sucks like war I mean look at this like a whole generation just ground up machine guns like this is gotta make sure this never happens again so they tried to do the League of nation but then didn't really invest it with very much power and then the second war Second World War happened and then again just after that it's fresh in people's memories and well never again this is it the United Nations and in Europe the European Union it's kind of both designed as ways to try to prevent this but again with kind of maybe in the case of the United Nations quite limited powers to actually enforce the agreement and there's a veto which makes it hardly fits two of the major powers that are at loggerheads so it might be that if that were worth a third big conflagration that then people would say well this time you know we've got it really we got to really put something kind of institutional solution in place that has enough enforcement power that we don't try this yet again so we don't have a second robot war so once we get to a first robot I mean it kind of memories fade right yes that's the problem so even the Cold War I mean I grew up I'm Swedish I remember we were kind of in between right and and we were taught these goals about and you could have fallout and stuff like it's like a very palpable sense that at any given point in time that could be some miscalculation or crisis or some something and and like all the way up to see senior statesmen at the time this is this were like a very real and very serious and I feel this up that memory of just how bad it is to live in that kind of hair trigger a nuclear arms race called war situation has kind of did and now we think maybe you know the world didn't blow up so maybe it wasn't so bad after all well I think that would be the wrong lesson to learn well it's a bit like you're playing Russian roulette yeah and you survived one and you say well it isn't so dangerous at all to play Russian roulette I think I'm gonna have another girl like that you gotta realize like well maybe that was the 10% chance or a 30% chance that the world would pop during the Cold War and we were lucky but it doesn't mean we want to have another one when I was in high school it was a real threat when I was in high school everyone was terrified that we were gonna go to war with Russia it was a big thing and and you talked to people from my generation about that and everybody remembers it remember that feeling that you had in high school like we there any at any day something can go wrong and we could be at war with another country that's a nuclear superpower yeah but that's all gone now like that that feeling that fear people are so confident that that's not going to happen that that's not even in people's consciousness and then a number of maneuvers are made and then you find yourself in the kind of situation where there is like honored stake and reputation and you feel you can't back down and then another thing happens and you get into this place where if you even say something kind about the other side your seem to be like you know you're a soft you're a pinky or a lion on both sides in the other side as well obviously they're gonna have the same internal dynamic and each side's has bad things about the other it makes the other side hate them even more and these things are then hard to reverse like once you find this dynamic happening it's it's kind of almost it's not too late you can try it but but it can be very hard to back out of that and so if you can prevent yourself from going down that path to begin with that that's much preferable when you see Boston Dynamics and you see those robots is there something comparable that's being developed either in the Soviet Union or in China or somewhere else in the world where there's similar type robots well I think a lot of the Boston dynamic things seems more showy than actually useful there's kind of animal like things that hop around and mmm 150 decibel or something like if I were special ops trying to sneak in like I wouldn't want this kind of big alarm but but I think a lot of action would be more in terms of flying drones maybe submarine stuff missiles that kind of stuff but are you when when you see these robots and you you you know see like the the ones that look like dogs or like insects and couldn't you imagine those things being armed with with when they are then they don't it doesn't really look showy anymore it seems pretty effective like you can't even kick those things over yeah yeah well I mean I think if it has a gun I mean it doesn't really matter whether it looks like a dog or if it's just a small flying platform sure I mean in general I think that the more with with AI and robotics like the more the cooler something looks usually technically the less impressive it is as you see these huge yeah I would say the extreme case of this is these robots that look exactly like a human like maybe like shaped like a beautiful woman or something like that and then there are complete hype and nowak you know I was at the movies obviously they do it because they don't want to film in movies but but every once in a while you have some press release I forget what the name is of this female looking robot that got citizenship in Saudi Arabia three years ago it's like a publicity stunt but but the media just laps it up Wow they've created is like it's exactly like a human like what a big breakthrough and and it's like nothing do you anticipate like when you see ex machina do you think that that's something that could be realistically that could be implemented in a hundred years or so like we really could have some form of artificial human that's indistinguishable well I think the action is not gonna lie in the the the the robotic part so much as in the brain part like I think it's the AI part and robotics only insofar as it becomes enabled by having say much better learning algorithms study so right now if you have a robot for the most part in any one of these big factories it's like a blind dumb thing that executes a pre-programmed set of motions over and over again mm-hm and if you want to change off the production you need to get in some engineers to reprogram it right but with a human you could kind of show them how to do something once or twice and then they can do it so it will be interesting to see over the next few years whether we can see some kind of progress in robotics that enable this kind of imitation learning to work well enough that you could actually start doing it in any kind of baby there are demonstrations already but but robustly not that that it would be useful and you could replace a lot of these kind of industrial robotics experts by having this so yeah so I think I mean in terms of making things look like human I think that's more for for Hollywood and and for press releases that and then the actual driver of progress then more so the actual driver of progress but someone is going to probably try to replicate a human being once the technology becomes viable and one of the more disturbing ex machina I have probably all my Nonna's yeah I just it's a little bit of a blur ease is I've seen some of these and not others and this guy lives in the very remote location yeah like a beautiful place enormous yeah yeah yeah created this beautiful girl robot a seduces that man and at the end of it she leaves him locked up in this thing and it just takes off and gets on the helicopter and flies away and the thing that's disturbing is that they it she knew how to manipulate his emotions to achieve a desired result which was him helping her escape yeah and but then once she did she had no real emotions so he's screaming and you know she had no compassion and no empathy she just hopped on the helicopter and left and they're starved to death inside that locked box and that is what scares people this idea that we're going to create something that's intelligence it has intelligence but like us but it doesn't have all the things that we have like caring right love friendship compassion the need for other human beings if you develop an autonomous robot that's really autonomous there's no need for other people that's where we get weirded out like it doesn't need us right yeah I mean I think the same with all even if it were not a robot but just a program in inside lecture but but yeah yeah and the idea that you could have something that is strategic and deceptive and so forth yes I mean but then other elements of the movie of course and in general a reason why it's bad to get your kind of map of the future from from Hollywood so if you think this is one guy presumably some genius living out in the nowhere and kind of inventing this whole system work in reality yeah it's like anything else a lot like hundreds of people programming away on their computers writing on whiteboards and sharing ideas with other people across the world it doesn't look like a human and that would often be some economic reason for doing it in the first place like not just oh we have this Promethean attitude that we want to kind of bring and I like so so all of those things don't make for such good plot lines so they just get removed but then I wonder if people actually think that is the future in terms of some kind of supervillain and some hero and it's gonna come down to these two people and they're gonna wrestle and yeah you know and it's gonna be very personalized and concrete and localized whereas a lot of things that determine what happens in the world are very spread out there are no pure crises churning away and sure yeah that was a big problem that a lot of people had but the movie was the idea that this one man could innovate at such a high level and be so far beyond everyone else is ridiculous that he's just doing it by himself on this year compound somewhere come on yeah that's that but that makes a great movie right yeah flying in the helicopter drop you off a remote location that shows you something he's created that is gonna change the whole world and it looked beautiful I mean I could imagine doing some writers you ever tweet there or something well when the iconic image of aliens from another world is this these little gray things with no sexual organs and large heads and black eyes this is the iconic thing that we imagined when we think about things from another planet I've often wondered if what we think of with in terms of like artificial life from another plant or life from another planet is that it's like an artificial creation like in our ideas that we understand that the biological limitations of the body when it comes to traveling through space the dealing with radiation death need for food things along those lines that what we would do is create some artificial thing to travel for us like we've already done on Mars right we had a rover that roams around Mars the next step would be an artificial autonomous intelligent creature that has no biological limitations like we do in terms of like its ability to absorb radiation from space and we create one of those little guys just like that would enormous head no sex organs doesn't need sex organs you know and we have this thing pilot these ships that can defy our own physical limitations in terms of what would happen to us if we had to deal with you know 1 million g-force because it's moving at some preposterous rate through space like we when we think of these things coming from another planet if we think of life on another planet if they can innovate in a similar fashion the way we do we would imagine they would create an artificial creature to do all their dirty work like why would they want to like risk their body right yeah I mean except I think creature might conjure up stuff that I mean I okay the spaceship I mean you don't have to have like build a little thing that sits and turns the steering wheel right I mean this could be automated sure and you'd imagine a technology that is spacefaring in a serious way would have nanotechnology so they have basically the ability to arbitrarily configure matter in whatever structure they want it out of like nano scale right probes and things that could shape-shift and it it's a not be that that would be this person sitting in a seat behind the steering wheel like it would just if they wanted to there could be invisible toss I'll take like nano-scale things hiding in a rock somewhere yes than just connecting with an information link up to some planetary sized computer somewhere far away which would be doing that so yeah I think that that's the way that space is most likely to get colonized it's not not going to be like with meat sacks kind of driving spaceships around and having Star Trek adventures it's gonna be some spherical frontier emanating from whatever the home planet was moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light and converting everything in its path into infrastructure of whatever type is maximally valuable for that civilization maybe computers and launchers to launch more of these space probes so that the whole wavefront can continue to propagate but we are I mean one of the things you brought up earlier is that if human beings are going to continue and we're going to propagate through the universe we're going to try to go to other places we're going we're going to try to populate other planets and are we going to do that with just robots or we're gonna try to do that biologically we're probably going to try to do it biologically and one of the things you were saying earlier is one of the things that artificial intelligence could possibly do is accelerate our ability to travel to other lands or the plants I mean we gonna try I mean in fact some people are right trying to buy what I just think that's gonna not lead to anything important until those efforts becomes obsoleted by some radical new technology wave probably triggered by machine super intelligence that then rapidly leads to something approximating technology maturity once once innovation happens at digital timescales rather than human timescales then all these things that you could imagine we doing if I had 40,000 years to work on it we would have space colonies and cures for aging and yeah all of these things right but if that thinking time happens you know digital space then that future gets telescoped and i think you fail to quickly reach a condition where you have close to optimal technology and then you can colonize the space cost-effectively you just need to send out one little probe that then can land on some resource and set up a production facility to make more probes and then it spreads exponentially everywhere and then if you want to you could then like after that initial infrastructure has happened you could transport biological human beings you know the planets if you want it to but it's not really where the action is gonna be like but what if we were concerned there's some sort of a threat to the earth like some sort of asteroid impact something coming that stage of technology averting some asteroid would be I think trivial really it would be like a gift of free energy like oh here comes an energy package great that's a funny way to look at it do you think we're gonna eventually colonize Mars well I think the the the answer is is this I think if and only if we manage to get through these key technological transitions and then I think we will colonize not just Mars but everything else that that is accessible in the universe when you talk about these things people always want to know when anything's gonna happen what's the time yes a mom my guess would be after technological maturity like after super intelligence now with Mars it's possible that there would be like a little kind of prototype colonization thing because I like people it really excited about that so if yeah so that you could imagine some little demo project happening sooner but if we're talking about something say that would survive long term even if the earth disappeared like some kind of self-sustaining yeah civilization I think that's gonna be very difficult to do until you have super intelligence and then it's gonna be trivial so you think super intelligence could potentially be what I mean that one of the applications would be to terraform Mars - yeah check out the atmosphere to make it sustainable for Biological life yeah you have the second spot yeah for example your vacation yes now I also think that at this this is a very radical context technology called maturity because we're already maybe there are additional technologies we can't even think of yet but even just what we already know about physics etc we can sort of see possible technologies that we don't yet or they were not yet able to build but we can see that they would be consistent with physics that would be stable structures yeah and already that creates a vast space of things you could do and so for example I think it would be possible at the technological maturity to upload human minds into two computers for example yeah and so that you think that's gonna happen like Ray Kurzweil stuff well I think again it would be technically possible at technical maturity to do it mmm-hmm now whether it's actually going to happen then depends a do we reach technological maturity and B do we are we interested in using our technology for that purpose at that time but if both of those same kind of reasonably possible yeah reasonably possible in most of all and especially in comparison what we've already achieved if if I had a time machine and it could jump you 1,000 years from now into the future would you do it would you jump in I mean I think you like the skies right now along yet flight this kind of already in Mianus what it was an instantaneous could I come back no well I probably wouldn't I don't know I mean I'm kind of a bit cautious with these things but at least at very least I'd want to think about it for a long time before it'll be also I have been attachments over there people I care about here and projects and maybe even opportunities to try to make some difference if if we actually are in this weird time right now different from all of earlier human history were nothing really much was happening and we're not yet where it's all out of our hands and it's super intelligence is running the show well if that actually is if that's true then that means we right now living this very weird period where our actions might have cosmological consequences if we if we affect the precise time and way in which the transitions in machine superintelligence happens we would be hugely influential and you know if you have some ambition to try to do something good in the world and that kind of can be a very exciting prospect as well like there might be no other better time to exist if your goal is to do good we might be in the golden years for in in terms of ability to have to take actions that have large consequences also this very unique transitionary period between the times of old and the times of new like we're really in the heat of the change in terms of like we you know the internet is only 20 plus years old phones are only you know cell phones at least people carrying them all the time it's only 15 plus years old this is very very new okay yeah so it's an exciting crazy time where all these changes are taking place really rapidly like if you were from the future this might be the place where you would travel to to experience what it was like to see this immense change take place almost instantaneously like if you could go back in time to a specific time in history and experience what life was like to me I think I'd probably pick ancient Egypt like during the the days of the Pharaohs I would love to see you get to choose who we are just watch yes I'm watching just to see what it looks like you know what it's like to experience life back then but if I was from the future were things what what just a curious idea what do you think it would look like like what what do you imagine yourself seeing in this I would imagine I would I mean I've really thought long and hard about the construction method the construction methods of ancient Egypt I would love to see what it looked like when they were building the pyramids like how long did it take what were they doing like how did they do it we saw no it's all really theoretical there's all these ideas of how they constructed with incredible precision and you know precision in terms of the way it's astronomically aligned to certain areas of our solar system and different constellations it's amazing I would love to have seen how they did that and what was the planning like and had they implemented and how many people did it take and how long did it take because we really I don't know it's all speculation dude think the burning of the Library of Alexandria we lost so much information and we've got you know hieroglyphs and the physical structures that are still daunting we have no idea we look at those like we they look at the Great Pyramid of Giza the the the huge one with two million plus stones in it like who made that how how'd you guys do it I mean what what did you did you draw it out first like well how did you get all the rocks there like I mean I think that would be probably the spot that I would want to go to I would want to be there in the middle of the construction of the pyramids just to watch justice so that certainly would be big like I guess tourist destinations from for travelers yeah in terms of if one is thinking I'm just saying what was going on back then we think the pyramids and that the slave trains and dialogue but of course for most Egyptians most of the time that would be picking weeds from their field or sure I think they're very to sleep for just like stuff like that yeah so the kind of the typical moment of human existence they don't even think it's slaves anymore I don't think I think they think it's skilled labor but in their diet based on the diet the utensils that they found in these camps his workers camps they think that these were highly skilled craftspeople hmm that it wasn't necessarily slaves they used to think it was slaves but now because of the bones of the food that we're eating really well and they think that well and also the the level of sophistication involved this is not something you just get kind of slaves to do yeah this seems to be that there was a population of structural engineers that there was a population of skilled construction people and that they tried to you know utilize all of these great minds that they had back then and put this thing together but it's still in history I think that's the spot that I would go to because I think it would be amazing to see so many different innovative times I mean it would amaze it be amazing to to be alive during the time of Genghis Khan or you know to be alive during some of the some of the wars of thousand two thousand years ago just to see what it was like on but the pyramids would be the big one but I think if I was in the future some weird dystopian future where artificial intelligence runs everything and and human beings are you know linked to some sort of neurological implant that connects us all together and we long for the days of biological independence and we would like to see what was it like when they first started inventing phones what was it like when the internet was first opened up for people what was it like when people saw when when when someone had someone like you on a podcast and was talking about potential artificial intelligence and where it could lead us and what could the most interesting time is now time yeah that's what's cool about it to me is it we seem to be in this this really Goldilocks period of great change where we're still human but we're worried about privacy we're concerned our phones are listening to us we're concerned about surveillance dates and you know put people put stickers over the laptop camera we see it coming but it hasn't quite hit us yet we're just seeing the problems that are associated with this increased level of technology in our lives which is yeah that that is a strange thing if we add up all these pieces it doesn't fit doesn't is very really special position yeah and you wonder hmm it's a little bit too much of a coincidence I mean it might be the case but yeah it does put some strain on it when you say a little too much of a quail dance house so I mean I guess the intuitive way of thinking about it like what way like what what are the chances that just by chance you would happen to be living in the most interesting time in history being like a celebrity like whatever like well that's pretty low prior probability likely for me well from you are mean for for it but for all of us really and so that could just be I mean I if there's a lottery somebody's gonna have the ticket right yeah but more or yeah or or or we are wrong about this whole picture and there is some very different structure in place that's which would make our experience is more typical that's what I was getting to yeah all right so I gathered yeah so how much have you considered the possibility of a simulation well a lot I mean I I developed the simulation argument yes back in the early 2000 and so yeah but I mean I know that you developed this argument and I know that you've spent a great deal of time working on this but personally the way you view the world how much how much how much does it play into your vision of what reality is well it's hard to say I mean for the majority of my time I'm not actively thinking about that I'm just like you know living and now I have this weird that my work is actually to think about big-picture questions so it kind of comes in through my work as well when you're trying to make sense of our position our possible future prospects the levers which we might have available to affect the world what what would be a good and bad way of pulling those levers then then you have to try to put all of these constraints and considerations together and in that context I think it's important I think if you are just going about your daily existence then it might not really be very useful or relevant to constantly like to bring in hypotheses about the nature of our reality stuff like that because for most of the things you're doing on a day to day basis like they work the same whether it's inside a simulation or in basement level physical reality like you still need to get your car keys out you still need it right so in some sense it kind of factors out and is irrelevant for many practical intents and purposes what do you remember when you started to contemplate the possibility of a simulation no I I mean I remember when when the simulation argument occurred to me says which is less it's not just I mean it's as far as long as I can remember it like yeah I mean maybe possibility like oh it could all be a dream it could be a simulation but but but that there is this specific argument that that kind of narrows down the range of possibilities and where the simulation hypothesis is then one of only three kind of options what are the three options well one is that there is almost all civilizations at our current stage of technology development go extinct before reaching technological maturity that's like option one kind of would be design technological maturity well say having developed at least all those technologies that we already have good reason to think are physically possible so that would include the technology to build extremely large and powerful computers on which you could run detailed computer simulations of conscious individuals so that that kind of kind of would be a pessimistic height like if that's if if almost all civilizations is our stage failed to get there that's bad news right because then we'll fail as well almost certainly that's one possible yeah so that's option one option two is that there is a very strong convergence among all technologically mature civilizations in that they all lose interest in creating ancestor simulations or these kinds of detailed computer simulations of conscious people like their historical predecessors or variations so maybe they have all of these computers that could do it but for whatever reason they all decide not to do it maybe there's an ethical imperative not to do it or some other I mean we don't really know much about these posthuman creatures and what they want to do and don't want to do so host human well I'd imagine that by the time they have the technology to do this yes they would also have enhanced themselves in many different ways right and so perhaps enhancing their ability to recognize the consequences yeah of creating yeah that would almost certainly have cognitively enhanced themselves for example well is the concept of downloading consciousness into a computer it almost ensures that there's going to be some type of simulation if you're if you have the ability to download consciousness into a computer once it's contained into this computer when what it what is what's to stop it from existing there as long as there's power and as long as these chips are firing and electricity is being transferred data's being moved back and forth you would essentially be in some sort of a simulation well I mean if you have the capability to do that also the motive it would have to simulate something that resembles some sort of a biological interface otherwise it's not going to know what to do right yeah so so so we have these kind of virtual reality environments now that are imperfect but improving yeah and you could kind of mean imagine that they get better and better and then you'll have a perfect virtual reality environment but imagine also that your brain instead of sitting in a box with big headphones and some glasses on like that the brain itself also could be part of the simulation the matrix well I think in the matrix there are biological humans outside that plug in right right but if you could include in the simulation just as you have maybe simulated coffee mugs and cars and cetera you could have simulated brains that if and and so it here is one assumption coming in from outside the simulation argument and one can talk about it separately but it's the idea that I call it's the substrate independence thesis that you could in principle have conscious experiences implemented on different substrate it doesn't have to be carbon atoms as as is the case with the human brain it could be silicon atoms and that what creates conscious experiences is some kind of structural feature of the computation that is being performed rather than the material that is used to underpin it so in that case you could have a simulation with detailed simulations of brains in it where maybe every neuron and synapse is simulated and then those brains would be conscious possibility number two well no it's a possibility number two is that these posthumous just are not at all interested in doing it and not just that some of them don't they would like of all these civilizations that reach technology maturity that is kind of pretty uniformly just don't do that and what's number three that we are in a simulation the simulation hypothesis and we're you lean well I I generally had to punt on the question of precise probabilities there I mean I think it would be a probability thing right yes it assigns some to each but yeah I've refrained from giving a very precise number part partly because I mean if I said some particular number it would get colder and it would create this maybe sense of false precision mm-hm the argument doesn't allow you to derive this the probabilities XYZ it's just that at least one of these three has to obtain so yeah so that that narrows it down not because you might think you know what do we know the future is big you could just make up any story and we have no evidence for but but it seems that there actually if you start to think everything through quite tight constraints on what probabilistically coherent views you could have and it's kind of hard even to find one overall hypothesis that fits this and and various other considerations that that we think we know the idea would be that if there is one day the ability to create a simulation that it would be indiscernible from reality itself that if like say if we are not in a simulation yet if this is just biological life we're just extremely fortunate to be in this Goldilocks period but we're working on virtual reality in terms of like oculus and all these companies are creating these consumer based virtual reality things that are getting better and better and really kind of interesting that you gotta imagine that twenty years ago there was nothing like that twenty years from now it might be indiscernible you might you might be able to create a virtual reality that's impossible to to discern from the reality that we're currently experienced or are maybe twenty thousand years at 20 million years like the the argument makes no assumption at all about how long real tech yeah but one day yeah if things continue to improve computational power the ability to replicate experiences and even feedback in terms of like biological feedback touch and feel and smell if they figure out a way to do that one day they will have an artificial reality that's indiscernible from reality itself and if that is the case how do we know if we're in it right that that is roughly the gist of it now as I said I think if you simulate the brain also you have a cheaper overall system then if you have a biological component in the center it was surrounded by a virtual reality gear and so you could for a given cost I think create many more ancestor simulations with simulated brains in the rather than biological brains with VR gear so most in indie snorers where there would be a lot of simulations most of those nars which would be the the kind of where everything is digital because it's just cheaper with mature technology to do it that way this is one of the biggest for lack of a better terms mind Fox when you really stop and think about reality itself that if we are living in a simulation like what what is it and why and where does it go and how do I respond how do I move forward if I really do believe this is a simulation what am I doing here yeah those are big questions huge questions not some of them arise Eve if we're not in a simulation yeah and aren't there people that have done some strange impossible understand calculations that designed to determine whether or not there's a likelihood of us being involved in a simulation currently yeah I I think it slightly misses the point so the I think so there are these attempt to try to figure out the computational requirements that would be required if you wanted to simulate some physical system with perfect precision so if we have some human a brain a room let's say and we want to dissimulate every little part every atom every subatomic particle the whole quantum wave function what would be the computational load of that and would it be possible to build a computer powerful enough that you could actually do this now I think the way that this misses the point is that it's not necessary to simulate all the details of this environment that you want to create in an ancestry simulation you would only have to simulate it insofar as it is perceptible to the observer inside the simulation so if if some post human civilization wanted to create a Joe Rogan doing a podcast simulation that need to simulate Joe Rogan's brain because that's where the experiences happen and then whatever parts of the environment that you are able to perceive so surface appearances may be off the table and walls may be they would need to simulate me as well or at least a good enough simulacrum that I could sort of spit out words that would sound like they came from a real human right I don't know now we're getting quite good with this GPT to like this kind of AI that just spews out words with I don't know whether anyway so see you that but but but like what what is happening inside this table right now is completely relevant you have no idea of knowing whether they're even or atoms Terra now you could take a big electron microscope and look at finer structure and then then you could take an atomic force microscope and you could see individual atoms even and you could perform all kinds of measurements and it might be important that if you did that you wouldn't see anything weird because physicists do these experiments and they don't see anything weird but then you could kind of fill in those details like if and when somebody were performing those experiments that would be vastly cheaper than continuously running all of this and so this is the way a lot of computer games are designed today that they have a certain rendering distance like you only like actually simulate the virtual world when when the character goes close enough that you could see and so I might in these kind of super intelligent post-humans during this obviously that would have figured that out and a lot of other optimizations so these in other words these calculations are experiments I think don't really tell on the hypothesis without assigning a probability to either one of those three scenarios what makes you think when you if you do stop and think I think we're in simulation what what are the things that are convincing to you well it would mainly go through the the simulation argument that if it had extended I think the alternative two hypotheses are improbable then that would kind of shift the probability mass on the third remaining is it really only three so the Intel the ones are we that human beings go extinct well and other civilizations at our stage in the cosmos or whatever yes hey this is strong yeah strong filter that they either go extinct or they decide not to pursue all this interest yeah or it becomes a simulation this is that really the only think the only three live options now so you can IIIi can kind of unfold the argument a little bit more and look more granular so suppose that the first two options are false so some non-trivial fraction of civilizations at our stage do get through and some non-trivial fraction of those are still interested then I think you can convincingly show that by using just a small portion of the resources they could create very many simulations and you can show that or argue for that by comparing the computational power of systems that we know are physically possible to build we can't currently build them but we could see that you could build them with nanotech and if you have planetary sized you know resources on the one hand and on the other hand estimates of how much compute power it would take to simulate a human brain and you find that a mature civilization would have many many orders of magnitude more so that even if they just used one percent of their compute power of one planet for one minute they could still run you know thousands and thousands and thousands of these simulations and and they might have billions of planets and they might last for billions of here so so the numbers are quite extreme it seems so then then what you get is this implication that if the first two options are false it would follow that there would be many many more simulated experiences of our kind and that would be original experiences of our account so the idea is that if we continue to innovate if human beings or intelligent life in the cosmos continues to innovate that creating a simulation is almost inevitable no no I mean the second might be that we decide not and others with the same capability but what if they don't decide not to what if they don't decide to not to if we the first option if human beings do figure out a way to not die and stay stay innovative and we don't have any sort of natural disasters or man-made created disasters then step two if we don't we don't decide to not pursue this if we continue to pursue all various forms of technological innovation including simulations that it becomes inevitable if we get past those two first options it becomes inevitable that we pursue it well so if they have the capacity then they will do it and the motive desire to yeah so that then they would they create hugely many of these so not just one simulation right but because it's so cheap at the technological maturity if you have a cosmic Empire of resources it it doesn't have to have a very big desire to do this they might just think well you know well that was the big question that Ilan said he would ask artificial intelligence said what's beyond the simulation okay that's the real question if this is a simulation if there's many many simulations running currently what's beyond the simulation well yeah you might be curious about that I mean I think the more important question would be like what do we all things considered have the most recent to do in our situation like what would it be wise for us to do is that like some way that we can be helpful or have the best life or whatever is ridiculous to even consider maybe it's beyond us what the question of what is outside yes well I mean I don't think it's ridiculous to consider I think it might be beyond us but maybe we would be able to form some abstract conception of what it is I mean in fact if if we if there is the path to believing the simulation hypothesis is the simulation argument and I mean we have a bunch of structure there that gives us some idea like that would be some advanced civilization that they would have developed a lot of technology over time including computer technology ability to do virtual reality very well we'd imagine probably they would have used that technology for a whole host of other purposes as well you wouldn't just get that technology and you know not be able to create a train or something like I said okay they'd probably be super intelligence and have the ability to colonize the universe and do a whole host of other things and then for one reason or another they would have decided to use some of the resources to create simulations and inside one of those simulations perhaps our experiences would be taking place saw in uniquely you could more speculatively fill in more but but I still think that fundamentally our ability to crack this whole thing would be very limited and there might be other considerations that we are oblivious to that would I mean if you think about the simulation argument is it quite recent right so it's like it's only it's less than 20 years old sorry if you think that suppose it's correct for the sake of argument then up to this point everybody was missing something like hugely important and fundamental yeah right very smart people hundreds of years like just looked like this this massive piece right in the center but what's the chances that we now have figured out the last big missing piece presumably that must be some father big giant realization that is like beyond those currently so I think having some yeah I mean that that looks kind of possible but maybe there are further big discoveries or revelations that that would kind of maybe not falsify the simulation but maybe change the interpretation like do something that is hard to know in advance what that would be now is the concept that if there is a simulation that all the historical record is simulated as well well or when did it take in well this is their different options there right and there might be many different simulations that configure differently that could be once that run for a very long time once that run for a short period of time once that simulate everything and everybody others that just focus on some particular scene or person you could like just a vast space of possibilities there and which ones of those would be most likely it's really hard to save much about because it would depend on the reasons for creating these simulations like what would the interests of these hypothetical post-humans be have you ever had a conversation with a pragmatic capable person who really understands what you're saying and but they disagree about the even the possibility of a simulation and it must have occurred but it doesn't tend to be the place where the conversation usually goes the conversation usually go I mean III mean I move in kind of unrepresentative circles so I think amongst the folk I interact with a lot I think a common reaction is that it's possible and still there is some uncertainty because these things are always hard to figure out but we should assign it some probability but I'm not saying that would be the typical reaction if you kind of did a Gallup survey or something like that I mean another common thing is I guess too miss interpreted in some way or another and there are different versions of that so one would be this idea that in order for the simulation hypothesis to be true it has to be possible to simulate everything around us to perfect microscopic detail which we discussed earlier right then some people might not immediately get this idea that the brain itself could be part of the simulation so they imagined it would be plugged in with like a big cable and if you just somehow could reach behind you and like that would be so that that would be another possible common misconception I guess then I think common thing is to conflate this simulation hypothesis with the simulation argument that the simulation hypothesis is we are in a simulation the argument is that one of these three options is true only one of which is the simulation hypothesis so like some conflation there happens how do you factor dreams into the simulation hypothesis well I think they are irrelevant to it that is that whether or not we are in a simulation people presumably would still have dreams and other reasons and explanations for what that's what happened so our aims even if you're in the simulation why not so some people so I sometimes get these kind of random email from coders that like that's like oh well you know yes thank you us from our theories very interesting and I found proof and like hall when I looked in my bathroom mirror I saw pixels like the random things like there is people varying degrees I mean maybe we're all crazy but yeah but I think that those things are not evidence in generally speaking you would expect if we're not in a simulation there still to be various people who claim to perceive various things sometimes people have a loose nation sometimes to misremember sometimes to make stuff up like you just imagine would be so the most likely explanation for those things is not even even if you are in a simulation the most likely explanation for those thing is not that it was a glitch in the simulation is that one of these normal psychological phenomenon took place right so yeah I would not be inclined to think that this would be an explanation if somebody has those kind of experiences it's probably not because we are innocent even if the simulation hypothesis is true it's probably not the explanation the concept of creativity how does that play into a simulation if you're if during the simulation you're coming up with these unique creative thoughts are these unique creative thoughts your own or these unique creative thoughts stimulated by the simulation and I think they could that would be our own in the sense that it would be our brain that was producing them something else would have produced your brain but obviously there's some incredible influences on your brain if you're involved in some sort of an external stimulation that's true in physical reality as well sure so it's like not know but it's still your brain I think it would be as much potentially as much your own in the simulation as it would be outside the simulation I mean unless the simulators had for whatever reason set it up with the view that they for some reason they just wanted to have all this is wrong and coming up with this particular idea and I've kind of configured the initial conditions and just the right way to achieve that maybe then when you come up with it maybe it's less your achievement than the people who set up the initial conditions but other than that I think kind of be similar in because the reason I asked that is all ideas but everything that gets created all innovation initially comes from some sort of a point of someone figuring something out or coming up with a creative idea all of it like everything they see in the external world like everything from televisions to automobiles was an idea and then somebody implemented that idea or groups of people implemented the technology involved in that idea and then eventually it came to fruition if you're in a simulation how much of that is being externally introduced into your consciousness by the simulation and is it pushing inhalation in a certain jury I don't know I mean you could imagine both kinds of simulations like simulations where you just set up the initial conditions and let it run to see what happens right and others where maybe you want to just simulate this / - you like this particular historical counterfactual like what would have happened like if Napoleon had been defeated like maybe that's our simulation but in some specific thing there you could imagine either or both of those types of ways of doing it but your simulation hypothesis we if we're in it it's running now is it running and we independently interact with the simulation or is the simulation introducing ideas into our minds that then come to fruition inside the simulation is that how things get done like if we are in a simulation right and if during the simulation someone has created a new iPhone like why are they doing that if other other people in the simulation or is this simulation entirely unique to the individual is each individual involved in a different coexisting simulation right so they the I think the the kind of simulation that it would be clearest the clearest case for why that would be possible would be one where all people would be simulated that you proceed and for each brain yeah that is it because then you could get the realistic behavior out of the brain if you simulated a whole brain at the sufficient level of detail so everyone you interact with is also acceleration well that that type of simulation should certainly be possible then it's more of an open question whether it would also be possible to create simulations where there was say only one person conscious and the others were just like simulacra yeah I like that I like the acted like humans but there's nothing inside right so these would be in philosopher's parlance zombies that is like a technical term but it means in in one philosophers discuss it's somebody who acts exactly like a human but with no conscious experience now whether those things are possible or not is an open and question do you consider that every when you're communicating with people they ever stop denying like this every day I mean as a card to me but not not not regular I don't know yeah does it that but if it does it ever get your head were you like this might not be real like this person might not be a real person this might be a simulation right I mean I guess there two things to be says one is that you'd probably have some probability distribution over all these different kinds of situations that you could be in maybe all of those situations are simulated in different frequencies and stuff different numbers of times that is so there would be some probability distribution there that would be the first thought that in reality are always kind of uncertain the second would be that even if you were in that kind of simulation it might still be that behaviorally what you should do is exactly the same as if you were in the other simulation so it might not have that much day-to-day implications do you think there's psychological benefits for interacting with life as if it's a simulation from no I don't think that would be an advantage I mean maybe maybe this in some case re what an alleviation of existential a maybe but who knows if it could also I guess if if you sort of interpreted in the wrong way maybe lead you to feel more alienated or something like that I don't know but I think to a first approximation the same things that would be work well and make a lot of sense to do in in physical reality would be also our best bets in a simulated reality that's where it gets really weird like if it's a simulation but you must behave in each and every instance as if it's not if you know if you were given a you like if you had a test you could take like a pregnancy test when you went to the CVS and you know you you pee on a strip I tells you guess what Nick this shit isn't real you're in a simulation a hundred percent proven absolutely positive you know from now on from this moment on that everything you interact with is some sort of a creation it's not real but it is real because you're having the same exact experience as if it was real why you proceed um yeah I I think that might be very subtle reprioritization that that would happen what would you do but personally well I I don't know the full answer to that I think there are certain possibilities that look kind of far-fetched if we are not in the simulation that become like more realistic if we are like I mean so so what one obvious one it's like if in simulation could be shut off like if the computer where the simulation is running is if the plug is pong right right and so we think physical universe has been normal and I said it can't just suddenly pop out of existence there's a conservation of energy and momentum and so forth but a simulated universe that that seems like something that could happen it doesn't mean it is likely to happen or it doesn't say anything about what time frame but at least these like interests as a possibility where it was not there before other things as well become more maybe similar to various theological possibilities that like afterlife and stuff like that and in fact it kind of maybe through a very different path leads to some similar destinations as as as people through thinking about theology and stuff have arrived at in that that would mean it's kind of different I think there is no logically necessary connection you but there are some kind of structural parallels analogs between the situation of a simulated creature - there you know simulators and and I created entity to their crater that that are interesting although kind of different so so that might be kind of comparisons there that you could make that would give you some like possible ways of proceeding it seems like paralysis by analysis so you just sit there and think about it like at least I would yeah I would almost wind up not being able to do anything or not being able to act or move or think wow that that seems kind of likely to be suboptimal right sub-optimal for sure yeah so yeah but it's uh the the concept is so prevalent and it's so common and it's interesting how much it has just over the last yeah 10 15 years how long the idea has what's this like really radical thing when it started and I know you have all these kind of figures that kind of almost like in on Poisson just kind of yeah throws it off and yeah I I it's interesting how ideas can migrate from some kind of extreme radical fringe and some like decade or two later they're just kind of almost common sense nothing that is well we have a great ability to get used to things I mean this comes back to our discussion about the pace of technological progress it seems like the normal way for things to be we are very adaptable creatures right you can adjust to almost everything and we have no kind of external reference point really and mostly these judgments are based on what we think other people think so if it looks like if some high status individual Elon Musk or whatever talk seems to take the simulation argument seriously then people think it's a sensible idea and it only takes like one or two or three of those like people that that that are highly regarded and suddenly it becomes normalized is there any one highly regarded that openly dismisses as possibility that must be but I'm not sure they would bothered to go on the record specifically like I guess the people who are dismissive of it wouldn't maybe even bother to address it there was something um trying to think yeah and I'm drawing a blank of whether there's a specific particular person I could I would love to hear the argument against yeah I would love to see here's someone like you or Elon interact with them mm-hmm and try to like you know volley back in for I these ideas yeah that could be interesting yeah you see you've never had like some sort of a debate with someone openly dismisses well like a big public debate I don't know even private yeah I don't know I mean I've it was kind of a long time since I when I first put this article out I I guess I had more conversations about the argument itself what was the reaction when you first put it out there's a lot of attention right I mean pretty much right off the bat including public it I mean it was published in some academic journal philosophical quarterly but yeah it quickly drew a lot of a ton and then it's kind of come in waves like every other every year or so this tip should be like some new group of something you either a new generation or some new community that hears about it for the first time and it kind of gets a new wave of attention but in parallel to these waves there's also this is chronic trend towards it's becoming more part of the mainstream conversation and seeming kind of less far out there yeah and I think yeah that may be partly just if the idea make like maybe if there were some big flaw in the idea it would have been discovered by now so if it's been around for a while it makes it a little bit more credible it might also be slightly assisted by just technical progress if you see virtual reality getting better and stuff it becomes maybe easier to imagine how it could become so good one day that yeah it's great perfectly flawless that was good I was gonna introduce that as option for is option for the possibility that one day we could conceivably create some sort of an amazing simulation but it hasn't been done yet and this is why it's become this topic of conversation is that there's some need for concern because you extrapolate technology and you think about where it's going now and where it's headed there could conceivably be one day where this exists should we consider this and deal with it now well so I'd say that that would be highly unlikely in that if the third say if the first two are wrong right then there are many many more simulated ones than non simulated ones will be over the course of all of history over the course of our history but without has but so then the question is given that you know that by the end of time that will have been let's say just a million simulations and one original history sure and that all of these simulated people and the original history people all have subjectively indistinguishable experiences you can't from the inside tell the difference right then what given that the assumption would it be rational for you to believe should you think you're one of the exceptional ones or should you think you're one you know amongst the the larger set the simulated ones or should you think that it just has not happened yet just but that would be equivalent to saying that you would be one of the non simulated ones you're talking about in the universe in yeah even just you could look at the narrower case of just the earth let's just look in the narrow case it was the earth yeah in the narrow case of just the earth if the historical record is accurate if it's not a simulation then it seems very reasonable that we're just dealing with incremental increases in technology that's pretty stunning and pretty pretty profound currently but that we haven't experienced a simulation yet is now that's how it looks right sure yeah but that's also how it would look if you were in a simulation yes but it's also how would look if you're not in this simulation yeah that's also a possibility to know right yeah but for most people who for whom it looks like that it would be the case that they would be simulated why well by assumption if if there are all these simulations created well not yet well right why do you don't know what time you don't know what time it is in external right so why we assumed something so unbelievably fantastic when just life itself is preposterous there's life itself just being a human being on a planet you know this planet spending a thousand miles an hour Earling through infinity that in itself is fairly preposterous if it didn't exist but it does exist and we know that we at least we're all agreeing upon a certain historical record we're agreeing upon Oppenheimer the Manhattan Project world war one world war two we're agreeing on Korea and Vietnam we're agreeing on Reagan and Kennedy we're agreeing on all these things historically if we are all agreeing that there's this sort of historical process we were all agreeing I remember when the first iPhone was invented I remember when the first computer I remember when this I remember the internet why would we assume that there's a simulation we could assume that there's a possibility of a simulation but why would you assume the simulation hasn't occurred why wouldn't we assume the simulation hasn't occurred yet right I mean say it it is a possibility that we would be in the first time second yes of all of these like it's not any more likely if we'd well I'd say no I mean we so it comes down then to this field which is tricky or problematic called anthropic so this is about how to assign probabilities in situations where you have uncertainty about who you are what time it is where you are so if you Madden for example all of these people who would exist in this scenario having to place bets on whether they are simulated or not and you think about two possible different ways of reasoning about this so one is you assume you're a randomly selected individual from all these individuals and you bet accordingly we're normally so well didn't yeah so then you would bet you're one of the simulated ones because like a randomly selected ones if most are simulated most lottery tickets are why are we assuming that most are simulated this where I'm getting confused well because if we eliminated by the end of time by the end of this is like a Titleist why already when it hasn't existed yet like well I'm I'm like let's say for the sake of argument because I don't really have an opinion on this you pro or con I'm open the air but if I was gonna argue about pragmatic reality the the the practicality of biological existence as a person that has a finite lifespan you're born you die you're here right now and we're a part of this just long line of humanity that's created all these incredible things it's led up to civilization that's led up to this moment right now where you and I are talking into these microphones and it's being broadcasted everywhere why isn't it likely that a simulation hasn't occurred yet that we are in the process of innovating and one day could potentially experience the simulation but why are you not factoring in the possibility or the probability that that hasn't taken place yet yeah I mean so it's in there but if you imagine that people has followed this general principle of assuming that they would be the ones in the original history before the simulations had happened right then almost all of them would turn out to be wrong and they would lose their bets once a simulation has action right I mean if you look if you kind of integrate over you know the unit but there's no evidence that the simulation is taking place but there is evidence that you're alive I don't have a mother you have a well I mean those those things could be true in the simulation as well I mean it could be but doesn't that pipedream simulation right I mean say a lot of simulations might run for a long time and have a mattress yeah yeah but we know that if someone shoots you you'll die we know if you eat food you get full we know these things mm-hmm these things could be objective facts these kidnaped I think they're TRAI yes all right now why would we assume why why would a simulation be the most likely scenario when we've experienced at least we believe we've experienced all this innovation in our lifetime we see moving towards a certain direction why wouldn't we assume that that hasn't taken place yet yeah I think to try to argue for the premise that conditional on there being first an initial segment of non simulated Joe Rogan experiences and then a lot of other segments of simulated ones yes that conditional on that being the way the world in totality looks you should think you're one of the simulated ones why well to argue for that I think then you need to roll in this piece of probability theory called an tropics which I alluded to and yes just to pull one little element out of there to kind of create some initial possibility for this if you think in terms of rational betting strategies for this population of Joe Rogan experiences the ones that would lead to the overall maximal amount of winning would be if you all thought you're probably one of the simulated segments if you had the general reasoning rule that in this kind of situation you should think that you're the initial segment of non simulated Rogan then the great preponderance of these simulated experiences would lose their bets but there's no evidence of a simulation well I'd say that there is indirect evidence insofar as there is evidence against these two alternatives the what the two alternatives being that they do universal life goes extinct before they create any sort of simulation or that they agree to not I'll create a simulation but what about if they're gonna create a simulation there has to be a time before the simulation is created why wouldn't you assume that that time is now currently happening when you've got a historical record of all the innovation that's leading up to today if we understand I think the historical record would be there in the simulation but there but why would it have to be there in a simulation and not be there in reality well I mean it could be there in the simulation if it's a kind of simulation the original yeah if it's a fantasy simulation then you know maybe it wouldn't be there right but it could be reality it doesn't have to be a sign I mean sometimes it would be both right I mean that would be one Joe Rogan experience in the real original history and then like maybe a million that I say in simulated realities later but if you think about your actions that kind of can't distinguish between these different possible locations in space-time where you could be most of the impact of your decisions will come from impacting all of these million-dollar organ instances but this simulation has been proven to exist which it hasn't been we we have at least in terms of what we all agree we're proven to have biological lives we breed we sleep we eat we travel on planes all these things are those things are true yeah I mean I'd say those are are true probably even if I are in a simulation right but why would you assume we're in a simulate this is where I'm doc yeah because why wouldn't you assume that a simulation is one day possible there's no proof or no evidence that makes any sense to me that there is currently any simulation right I mean it's a matter of probabilities and the numbers games right is it uh that's okay reality yeah but what would point to the possibility that it's more probable that we were in a simulation this is what escapes me okay so I could mention some possibilities that we know it says so the most obvious like in mind a big window pops up in front of you saying you're in the simulation more inclusive right yes right so short of that you would have weaker probabilistic evidence insofar as you had evidence against the two alternatives so for example if you if you got some evidence that suggested it was less likely that all civilizations at our stage go extinct before maturity let's say we get our act together we eliminate nuclear weapons we you know we become prudent and we check all the asteroids nothing is some collision course with our study that kind of tend to lower the probability of the first right okay so that we tend to shift probability over on the remaining alternatives let's suppose that we moved closer ourselves to becoming posthuman we develop more advanced computers and VR and like we're getting close to this point ourselves and we still remain really interested in running ancestor simulations we think this is what we really want to spend our resources on as soon as we can make it work that that would move probability over from the second alternative like it's less likely that there is this strong convergence among all post human technology mature civilizations if we ourselves are almost posthuman and we still have this interest in creating ancestor simulations so that which have probability over to the remaining alternative take the extreme case of this like imagine if we you know a thousand years from now have built our own planetary size computer that can run these simulations and we are just about to switch it on and it will create the simulation of precisely people like ourselves and as we move towards the big button to sort of initiate this like then the probability of the first two hypotheses basically goes to zero and then we would have to conclude with near certainty that we are ourselves in a simulation as we push this button to create a million simulations once we achieve that state but we have now achieved that stage why would we not assume that we are in the actual state that we currently experience well we shouldn't assume which we should assume that we are ignorant as to which of these different time slices we are which of these different rogon experiences is the present one we just can't tell from the inside which one it is yeah I mean if if you had if you could see like some objective clock and and say that well as as yet the clock is so early that no simulations have happened and obviously you could conclude that you're in the original history but if we can't see that clock outside the window if there is no window in this simulation to look out then it would look the same and then I'd say we have no way of telling which of the different instances we are and one of them might be that there is no simulation and that we're moving towards that simulation that one day might be technically a one in a million not really so one in a million is that life is what experience right now one in numeric conditional on the other those other alternatives being wrong let's let's let's say that human beings haven't blown themselves up yet let's say that human beings haven't come up with the there is no need to make the decision to not activate the simulation because the simulation hasn't been invented yet isn't that also a possibility is it also a possibility that the actual timeline of technological innovation that we all agree on is real and that we're experiencing this as real live human beings not in a simulation that one day the simulation could potentially take place but has not yet isn't that also a possibility yeah yeah let me sure it's just a question of how probable that is given the why isn't it super probable because we're experiencing it well I mean it would be a very unusual situation for somebody with your experiences to be in what about your experiences for my expressively the same same there yeah it would be extremely unusual but there's your seven billion unusual expression taneous lee but i would you see me think there were like say a million simulations right then you know that would be a million times more but why would there be any simulations why would there not just be 7 billion people experiencing life right yeah that mean then that would have to be something that prevents these simulations from furthering create this is where you lose me yeah so I think maybe the difference is I tend to think in terms of the world as a four dimensional structure with time being one dimension right okay I'm sorry just so you think in the totality of existence that will have happened by the end of time you look at all the different experiences that match your current experience okay given these various assumptions the vast majority of those would be simulated why well the various assumptions being that option one and two are false basic what about option my option yeah so that in your option the vast majority of all these experiences that will ever have existed will also be simulated if I understand your no no my option is that nothing's happened yet yeah but they will have been maybe but not yet right but it's all I understand your option is that if you look at the universe at the end of time and we'll look back that would be a lot of simulated versions of you and then one already know long that's a think you might be the original one no I'm not even considering that what I'm saying is we may just be here that there is no simulation and that maybe it will take place but maybe it will not right but you have to pick which of those versions you are which of those scenarios you are considering that is the there is the scenario I'm considering the scenario I'm considering is we are just here we are actually a lot what happens after like so I want this in order to say what happened in the past what happens now and what will happen in the future well we don't always going to happen in the future right that's that's right so we can consider both options right yes one option where there are no simulations created later right then I would say that means one of the first two alternatives but another option is there could be a simulation created later but it has not taken place that there will be simulation is later is that it's a possibility but it has not happened right but that there will be later that's that's one possibility and so then I say if that's the world that we are looking at then most experiences of your kind exist inside the simulation I still don't understand that why can it not have happened yet well it could depends on which of these experiences is your present moment in that scenario right so that there's going to be a million of them plus an initial one you can tell from maybe there will be a million of them but there's right now no evidence that there's going to be no evidence that there is no evidence that it's ever even going to be possible technologically we think there could be but it hasn't happened yet so why would you assume that we are in a simulation currently when there's no evidence whatsoever that it's even possible to create a simulation maybe there is some alternative way of trying to explain I understand I'm taking like suppose I'm sorry I'm just thinking maybe we could think of some simpler thought experiment which has nothing to do with simulations and stuff but imagine if I'm making this up as I go along so we'll see if it actually works but you are taking into a room and then you're awake there for one hour and then a coin is tossed and if it lands heads then the experiment ends and you exit the room and everything is normal again but if it lands tails then you're given an amnesia drug and then you're walking up in the room again you think you're there for the first time because you don't remember having been there before right and then this is repeated ten times so we have a world where either there is one one hour experience of you in the room or else it's a world with ten jorgen experiences in the room we do not be sort of amnesia in-between right but when you're in the room now you find yourself in this room you're wondering hmm is this the first time I'm in this room it could be but it could also be that later on and I was just given an amnesiac okay so the question now is when you wake up in this room you have to assign probabilities to these different places you could be in time and maybe have to bet or or make some decision that depends on where you are so what I guess I could ask you like so if you wake up in this room what what what do you think the probability should be that the coin that you're like at time one versus at some later time well what is the probability that I'm actually here versus what is the probability that's highly unlikely scenario that I keep getting drugged over and over again every hour we assumed that like in you're certain that that the setup is such that there was this mad scientist who had the means to do this and he was gonna flip this coin right so we assuming that that's you're sure about that either way the only thing you're unsure about is how the coin landed okay well if that was a scenario where I knew that there was a possibility of a mad scientist and I could wake up over and over again that seems like a recipe for insanity well it's a philosophical thought experiment it's a way we can abstract away from my ability and I'll get back to is there's no evidence at all that we're in a simulation so why wouldn't we assume that the most likely scenario is taking place which is we are just existing and life is as it seems strange so okay so if if you don't want to do this thought experiment so incredibly limited distill right the probability theory apart from the wider simulation but I guess I could also ask you if if we were to move closer to this point where we ourselves can create simulations if we survive we become a multiplanetary we would build planetary sized computers yeah how would your probability in this simulation hypothesis change as we kind of develop it well will change based on the evidence of some profound technological innovation that actually we would allow someone to create a simulation it's indistinguishable from reality but I would rather assume that reality itself currently is just that because it seems to be isn't that Occam's razor isn't that the simplest answer this is reality this is wood you are here you absolutely here one day there may be a simulation it has not happened yet yeah I think it's not that comes Razer in that it would require you to postulate that you are this very unusual and special observer amongst all the observers that will exist but why is that but everyone is unusual in their own way that's true but there's no there's no clones there's no one person that's a version that's living the same exact life in a million different scenarios but but in this respect if there are all these simulations then most of these people are not special in this way that most of them are simulated and only adulation right have many simulations well if there's no simulation well then of seven if there are no simulations and there will ever be any simulations done well who saying there never will be well so this since since we don't know what time it is now in external reality right and we therefore can't tell from looking at our evidence where we are in in a world where either there is just an original history and then it ends or there is a world with an original history and then a lot of simulations we need to think about how to assign probabilities given each of these two scenarios right and so then we have a situation that is somewhat analogous to this one with the amnesia room where you have sort of some number of episodes and so the question is in those types of situations how do you allocate probability over the different hypotheses about how the world is structured and this kind of betting argument is one type of argument that you can try to reduce to kind of get some grip on that and another is by looking at various applications in in in in cosmology and stuff where you have multiverse theories and which say the universe is very big maybe there are many other universes maybe there are a lot of observers maybe all possible observers exist out there in different configuration how how do you drive probabilistic prediction from that like it seems like whatever you observe would be observed by somebody so how could you test that kind of theory and this same kind of entropic reasoning that I want to use in the context of the simulation argument also plays a role I think in deriving observational predictions from these kinds of cosmological theories where you need to assume something like you are most likely a typical observer from amongst the observers that will ever have existed or so I would suggest now III should admit as an asterisk that this field of anthropic reasoning is tricky and not fully settled yet and there are things there that we don't yet fully understand but still the particular application of anthropic reasoning that is relevant for the simulation argument I think is one of the relatively less problematic ones so that conditional on there being by the end of time a large number of simulated Kerr organs and only one original one I think conditional and that hypothesis it would seem that most of your probability should be on being one of the simulated ones but I'm not sure I have any other ways of know I can understand what you're saying I completely understand what you're saying but I don't know why you're not willing to take into account the possibility that it hasn't occurred yet yes I mean the way I see it is that I have taken that into account and it receives the same probability that I'm that initial segment as I would give to any of the other nick bostrom segments that all have the same evidence see that's where we differ because I would give much more probability to the fact that we are existing right now in the current state as we experience it in real life Carbon life no simulation but that potentially one day there could be a simulation which leads us to look at the possibilities and look at the probabilities that it's already occurred all right so what about this suppose it is the case that all right so what we think happen is was a big bang planets formed and then some billions of year later we evolves and here we are now right suppose some physicists told you that well the universe is very big and early on in the universe very very rare occasions there was a big gas cloud in an infinite universe this will happen somewhere right where just by chance there was a kind of Joe Rogan's like brain coming together for a minute and then dissolved in the gas right and yeah if you haven't even it universe it's gotta happen somewhere it's but there's gonna be many many fewer your organ brains in such situations then will exist later on on planets because evolution helps funnel probability into these kinds of organized structures right so if some physicist told you that well this this is the structure of our part space-time like there are like a few very very rare spontaneously materialized brains from gas clouds early in the universe and then there are the normal Rogen's is much later and and of course many many more normal ones the normal ones happen in one out of every you know 10 ^ 50 plants whereas the weird ones happen in 1 out of 10 to the power normal vs. weird how so how are you well the normal ones are ones that have evolved on planets and had the mother and different beans in different planets ok I only have one planet okay well I mean actually there are a lot of planets in the universe and that's gonna be a lot of territory that has life right these are this is this is pure speculation but this is a thought experiment in fact actually probably is much as relative espect most likely there's some other planets out there well dude I think the fact that it matches relatives I think irrelevant to the point I want to make but so if this turn out to be the way the world works a few weird ones happening from gas clouds and then the vast majority are just normal people living on a planet would you similarly say given that model that you should think it might just as well be one of these gas cloud ones because after all it the other ones might not have and yet what have I lost you you lost me sorry yeah anyway I think that this would be a structurally similar situation where there would be a few exceptional early living versions that that would be very small in numbers compared to the later ones and if they allow themselves the same kind of reasoning where they would say well the other ones may or may not come to exist later on planets I have no reason to believe I'm one of the planet living ones then it seems that in this model of the universe you should think you know one of these early gas cloud ones and as I as I said I mean this looks like it probably actually is the the world we're living in in that it looks like it's infinitely big and that would have been a few do Rogen's spontaneously generated very early from random processes they're going to be very few numbers compared to ones that have you know recent on planets so that by taking the path you want to take with relation to the simulation argument I wonder if you would not then be committed to thinking that you would be like in in fact that Boltzmann brain in in a gas cloud super early in the universe I still don't understand what you're saying what I'm saying is that we scientists agree if you believe in science and if you believe in the discoveries that so far people have all currently agreed to we've agreed that clouds are formed and that planets are created and that all the matter comes from inside of the explosions of a star and that it takes multiple times for this to coalesce before we can develop carbon-based life forms all that stuff with science to currently agrees on right and then we believe in single celled organisms become multi-celled organisms through random mutation and natural selection we get evolution and that we agree that we have come to a point now where technology has hit this gigantic spike that you described earlier so human beings have created all this new innovation why wouldn't we assume that all this is actually too taking place right now with no simulation yeah I mean the simulation argument is this the the answer to that but with the qualification that a the simulation argument doesn't even purport to prove the simulation hypothesis because there's Charles relatives mm-hmm be that even if the simulation hypothesis is true in many versions of it it would actually be the case that in the simulation all of these things have taken place and the simulation might go back a long time and it might be a reality tracking simulation maybe these same things also happened before outside the simulation I understand but or all these things have actually happened and there is no simulation yet mmm yeah that's possible too there's nothing really probable well I think I mean to me it seems probable only if at least one of the other alternatives is true or I mean I I admit that there is also this general possibility which is always there that I'm confused about some big thing like of avala maybe the simulation argument is wrong in some way like I'm just looking at the track record of science and philosophy we find where sometimes wrong so I attach some probability to that but but if we were working within the parameters of what currently seems to me to be the case that we would be the first civilization in a universe where there will later be many many simulations seems yeah unlikely for those exact reasons and that if we are the first it's probably because one of the alternatives is true so it's a mind-blower neck the more you sit and think about the more you ponder these concepts and I'm you know I'm not on one side or the other it's scary but it's also amazing and what else is too that we haven't figured out yet if if we come back in 50 years even just with human beings thinking about stuff and I think I have this concept of a crucial consideration I alluded it a little bit earlier but it's um the idea of some some argument or data or insight that if only we got it would radically change our mind about our overall scheme of priorities not just change the precise way in which we go about something but kind of totally reorient ourselves like an example would be if you are an atheist and you have some big conversion experience and some of your life feels very different right you had what we're doing before you were basically wasting your time and now you found what it's all about but that could be sort of slightly smaller versions of this and I wonder what the chances are that we have discovered all crucial considerations now because it looks like at least up until very recently we hadn't in that there are these important considerations that seems to whether it's AI like if this stuff about AI is true like maybe that's the one most important thing that we should be focusing on and the rest is kind of frittering away our time as a civilization we should be focused on AI alignment so we can see that it looks like all earlier ages up until very recently were oblivious to at least one crucial consideration in the forest I wanted to have maximum positive impact on the world that just didn't know what the thing was to focus on and it also seems kind of unlikely that we just now have found the last one if that just seems kind of get given that we keep discovering these up until quite recently we're probably missing out on on one or more likely several more crucial considerations and if that's the case then it means that we are fundamentally in the dark you know we were basically clueless in we might try to improve the world but we are overlooking maybe several factors each one of which would make us totally change our mind about how to go about this and so it's less of a problem I think if your goal is just to lead your normal life and be happy a happy family and you know because that there we have a lot more evidence and it doesn't seem to keep changing every few years like we still know I have good relationships you know don't ruin your body don't jump in front of trains like these are yeah it's tried and tested yes right but if your goal is to somehow steer humanity's future in such a way that you maximize expected utility there it seems our best guesses keep jumping around every few years and and we haven't kind of settled down into some stable conception of that they're gonna have to process conversation for a long time but I appreciate it and thank you for being here man no that's really good too very fascinating yeah yeah thank you thank you very much kid if people would like to read into your stuff working where can they get it Nick Bostrom become probably the best starting point okay thank you my brain is broken by everybody [Music]
