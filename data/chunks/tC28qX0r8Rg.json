ourselves kettlebells no scarves yeah mom against old dudes with scarves like a big Randy Couture fee on its scar he's been wearing a scarf lately and I just want to talk to him does he really yeah Randy Couture's was such a bad motherfucker to turn around as my wife who cares like I'm ballet being a leotard and I'd still be like stay away from yeah he could go out to clubs with a legitimate albatross around his neck you wouldn't care so he in which did you see Matt McConaughey in Magic Mike no I missed that I never met anybody wanted to have sex with themselves more that guy really can Oh God I mean he I guarantee jerks officers highlight-reel he basically has just stock footage of him stretching and nutation his character or Matt McConnell talking about Matt McConaughey the human how do you want ladies an actor's like magic it's like why don't you take that role one day and take that role you took that role so you can wear outfits and go and go that's what doesn't I've never saw okay well now I have to go I'll do it it's a bigger wish we were talking about the commercials whoo sorry sorry sorry sorry cuz I need to know about this cuz I saw the ad for that I got a little panicky oh no yeah day that I was like what's going on here what is this hey Tatum O'Neal or whatever the guys name tater that he's also handsome fellow he couldn't look better Oh handsomest guy I hung out with him in Vegas for a weekend women literally start just ovulating in his presence and he's a great guy they must panic there's certain types of comedy where you know you and I were talking also about how what a privilege it is to feel it to be a headliner and to be someone who gets to perform all the country yeah it's amazing look sometimes I look at I was in Miami like Fort Lauderdale and I just you know it was I did you know I got I'm at one point I just had him going you know pretty strong and I just looked at I was like I felt like the luckiest human being in the fucking world that's why when I watch Matt McConaughey in fucking Magic Mike in his fucking leather chest girdle and his fucking hot pants and any and he's coming off yeah did it hey hey yo ker boy come fuck and do ten minutes of stand-up you fucking idiot I don't jump off stage like I just did an hour and a half across somebody hug me hard so I guess you're Wells this animosity of course I'm just I'm attracted to him all right Express I mean I hate him I mean I hate him I mean I don't know set you in Malibu no I was just thinking about how you know you're you're an actor and you you have five scenes in a movie and feel like whoa you were great in that movie it you're collectively are probably doing 10 or 15 minutes of actual activity whereas when you do stand-up you're out there for you know it's just a different it's just a different thing feels it feels well why would you care though that he wants something who doesn't hate him so much it doesn't matter what's going on no I just saw the movie and I was just I was just looking I'm going to you're just you took this movie just so you could wear those outfits he gave me a biggest boner didn't he he did if I was if I was gay I would definitely he's a very attractive man would you choose every shit Mike Oh Channing Tatum really it's my boy you can't he's got he's got best genetics he's got thick lips I got nice skin the eyes on the cat eyes seems confident too he's a great guy he's got a big car sense of humor Jesus were both really something Joe Rogan's a broad gallon gas it gets talked about Channing Tatum's cos oh did you want you just a baby that just came out of you just went I bet he's got a big best gun a big cock did you uh did you watch the app the actual whole movie yeah because I wanted to annoy myself more and more although I thought the movie was good and I love you a little eggs I like Channing Tatum I mean I had my hands that movie looks so gay and I'm flipping through the channels I was slipping through the channels and I saw it it popped up and I went whoa change it quick but like you know how you're flipping through like you're previewing the next preview now I get am at a hotel was chilling in a hotel and there's like I was like this is okay gotta get it up like dudes were like gyrating back and forth which by the way I don't think women like that I think that motion is really just isolated someone riding dicks I don't think that I know gyrating like the way a guys doing women like thrusting they like to get fuck they don't they want you you're going you dick riding circle man dick riding sweaty circle moon McConaughey's doing he's got a fucking a leather thong and he's doing back bends and shipping and but the character I was watching I was it what bothered me was I was watching I go you know as an actor if I took that role there's a lot I'd do that role maybe but I wouldn't because there's not a lot to do like he played it just one shut the fuck up bitch she would take that role at a goddamn heart I got you and Channing Tatum in your underwear yeah that guy would be your boyfriend you'd be carried around like he was crossing the the wedding no I would look like I have fucking rickets next to that guy's yeah I want to be would do the movie with him no dude you would do it so shut the fuck up he's given it Matthew McConaughey a hard time and you're doing the movie maybe he just wanted to meet Channing Tatum - you know what man Matthew I'm sorry brother I don't mean to put you down you got enough guy yeah I hear but I hear he's a very nice guy yeah here's a nice car doesn't mean he's not really vain and not an annoying Mellisa man he's playing a part how could you like if you judge me based on the movie zookeeper you douche bag of fucking convinced in Malibu he does yeah with a shirt off no he doesn't yeh does if I see you and you're doing push-ups in front of Pavilion in Malibu I'm gonna take your back that's right I'm gonna take you back and I'm gonna get the hooks in my throat just kick him in the ribs me I'm just gonna hold he can scream all you want you shouldn't have been doing push-ups he's not allowed to do that off with a knapsack on with a knapsack on a bandana while tourists take pictures of you is that what who's doing yeah that annoys me he wanted to be really fit for this movie maybe it was like something he was working on like what kind of exhibitionist could he become because he was playing a part in a movie man did you murder he kabocha look think about look what would what's-his-name does when he does um Daniel day-lewis when he gets an immersed in a role he's like mean he's unbelievably immersive maybe that's what Matthew McConaughey was just being a douche bag don't agree he's playing a douchebag in the movie and that's douche bag activity the role wasn't so much of a douche bag the role is more of I just think he's supposed to be the club owner but you'll see what I mean would it be okay if he did push-ups in a we're in place where nobody could say like say if there was like his there was like some grass in front of his car and nobody could say any drop down for a quick fifth no here's the bomb okay what that's what bothers me yes there I am but here's what bothers me if you work out just for the sake of vanity and then and then and then it would I when I see what you're doing is just you're just sculpting or for it to be a peacock I understand I get I get staying in shape there's something about it if it's not for something functional it was not for something like that you're doing I immediately I'm just saying you can do it you're not my friend that's all I said yeah my friend why is that what about a guy who's just doing like bench presses and curls never touches the legs just want to look good in a tight shirt but he's doing it you know what you know you know why I like that why I got no problem with that he's doing it so he can go out and get laid on a Saturday night fucking-a god bless you what do you think Matthew McConaughey is doing when he's wearing leather underwear doing us so he can fucking get the the dailies and jerk off to himself okay that's why he's fucking doing it and there's a difference when I see Matt McConaughey doing a roll like that Magic Mike all I'm seeing something masturbatory I watched Channing Tatum he's trying to do something he's actually playing a character who's fucking conflicted about being a 30 year old stripper and it's fucking great McConaughey is is it's a masturbatory performance he's watching himself he's not trying to do anything he's not trying to express any well that's not that's he's what it's not trying to play I mean the guy is shown a pretty broad range of great in the world television no Miriam I don't want to marry him but he was really good in contact the hell's going on he was alright he was good in contact I enjoyed him I thought he was sensitive on me without town seemed like the type of guy that would fall in love with Jodie Foster that was a long time ago um who the fuck would why did you watch that I don't know what happened to you I was dropped on your head by renting this you see lives count 100 mrs. Callen wanted to watch all right he's teeth blame you Wow I might have to get Thai and watch it but I'll probably get really scared I'll probably have to get my god Mike you get a little jealous you better be inside of a pussy when you watch it really time I don't have that kind of stamina or desire or cosmetic or will that's why you need to fuck I got tricked early on in life but I figured it out now I'm fine just beating off and then going about my business you
