the Joe Rogan experience and so yeah so finally in and all this time you know data in the UFC is saying we want been asking we won't Ben Askren I'm ranked number seven in the world or what you know somewhere around there twelve and L and so I remember I was going to the Asian food source I was gonna be some tonka soup and the Orang called me said you're released full full you're released you can go I per se I appreciate that so Friday morning it's Thursday night Friday morning it's in November sometime maybe mid November morning they fax over the release my management faxes it to UFC headquarters and I'll sudden that afternoon there's a you know like little scrum where rosettes and data questions and the Dana says we're not interested in Ben Askren and I said why what just happened there right because for the last three months they're saying we were inserted weren't sure where is Jenn now I finally produced this full release from Bellator that I got and now they're not interested and so I said wow I just got caught in the middle of this and was there a reason given well so ok so then Monday is so then I say F that I buy my I bought a plane ticket to Vegas for Monday so that was Friday that happens I say fuck that I'm going to Vegas I'm taking this shit you know so uh Monday I buy my plane ticket to Vegas I fly out to Vegas do UFC headquarters I met with Lorenzo Dana was on the little speakerphone Deeley and they offered me a super contract but it would be confidential and I would have to fight one fight for the world series of fighting which is like well that's bizarre why yeah it is n fight for the world series a bunny the exact relationship with the world series of the world is like a feeder organization at that time something yeah I mean yeah I see Mauro and mirai's just engaging both those get from champs over there Deana see I think the relationship was very hazy between the old world series of fighting in the UFC because there was also people that want the other way right Andrei Arlovski gets dropped from the FC he goes to World Series Anthony Johnson boom all these people you know so they say one fight one fight well let's hear the fighting we will pay Zuppa will pay you would you do one fight ok I say let that's effed up but okay I said I don't think anyone's gonna go for it but I'll do it so I leave and about six hours later I got a phone call says that deal is no longer available we're not gonna make you an offer yeah so Wow and you have money why well I saw here's my guess I've never got to sit face to face today and say what was your problem with me I think there's four things my mind number one he didn't really like me stemming from I called him out on the steroid thing you know where he said it's impossible and this is where I disagree it's impossible to test all UFC athletes I said well that's not true you sada does it all over the world for all kinds of athletes right you can do it it's just expensive but let's just call what it is you're a private business you don't have to do drug testing it's obviously they do it now salute now yeah do it through you sadhus yeah we're totally right yeah so I was corrected now but that was you know when Dana is wrong in an argument and he's got this huge army that follows him and he said I'd rather hey I think his quote was backwards I'd rather watch fly's fucked than Ben Askren fight you know I think he said something like ambien takes Ben Askren egos asleep yeah so the personal attack started right so that that's number one but uh you know it's that thing yeah you know you're experiencing this thing that she can't do she the wife is not a comedian that's another thing I think comics also have a bond that I feel like the outside person can never totally understand never yeah well just the way we joke around with each other yeah like you've just the things you and I have said to each other yeah if we said these things in an office like holy shit lots of human resources would both go to jail yeah I think you'd go to jail more than me I'm the worst but thank god that NBC lost that those friends writers made a lot of progress for us because what isn't okay so there was this famous lawsuit on friends the writers assistant sued the writers in the writers room because they were saying something about the actresses or saying like fucking them with twigs or I think something crazy yeah and they sued the writers assistant sued the writers for sexual harassment and said I had to hear all this disgusting shit and the writers won because they said it was part of our creative process well it is it certainly is and especially with comedians we have said ridiculous shit to each other Ellis yeah I mean like well we just like guys first of all like Alan Adalia mean we've said ridiculous shit like about each other off like SEC like about how I'd fuck you do do it fuck you first of all and we will do that to each other because it's how we make each other laugh that we need something really extreme you wanna you wanna before the fight came like they you doin the you sided drug testing roses walking back through the hallway with her official and she crossed paths with you wanna and all by herself and you wanna do it yeah she's like in a different tone of voice to like the weirdest like she doesn't seem like herself first time I mean I'm sure she's getting in fight mode or whatever and she's like breaking in her gloves she's like and that give her like the was though you know and she gave me what's up and they she was like um it's like she asked me something like did you buy the ticket her I was like like do you believe him or do you believe in him or something like that do you believe him did you buy the ticket yeah and then she walked off and is saying and I was just like even in the no way in you know and the way is like all kinds of weird mindfuck II shit came back to the locker room now we're ready all week we've been deflecting shit we've been deflecting shit now Rose is a very emotional person intemperate like she's we got to keep rolling keep rolling straight because she comes in with the wrong look on her face oh something's wrong she goes off and does the drug test it comes back and when she sat down she sits down and says we have we have to have a meeting now that's cold we have to have a meeting his code for shut it down everybody get the fuck out we were bouncing we have to have a meeting is like kind of another way of saying start to count down with leaving okay we have to have a meeting and when she said that the way she said it I write everything came over me like oh fuck what happened and then when she said would you honor said in the back what do you want to told the do you believe him did you buy the ticket and then left without any explanation yo when groped when Rose said that to me my fucking head exploded it and all I could say was oh shit I don't want to have to fucking think about this all night why don't you stop being religious I started in high school and stopped in graduate school so it was you started being religious in high school yeah so it wasn't something your family introduced my parents were pretty secular they they weren't anti religious at what that wasn't a thing then but this is 1971 when I was in high school in the in the sort of Nisan born-again movement was starting and there was no religious affiliation it was just like it's me and Jesus that's it it's just you and you and the Lord there's a lot of these very charismatic hip young preachers that are doing sort of a thing like that where they they don't even have their own church to like rent time in the church and I have nice these meetings where it's not it's just nondenominational and I just talk about God and yeah they get a lot of people fired up yep and you know the place I went to this place called the barn in La Crescenta where I grew up and you know they played guitar and that is one of the problems with utopia the 19th century utopian experiments they always turned into this you know free sex for the leader well it always seems like whenever there's a man that's in a position where people start worshipping him right you know and then they start hanging on his every word he's like I started to start fucking some of these people well I do I cover Jim Jones and you know the way I raised it is that no one joins a cult they join a group that they think is gonna do good save the world can help me improve my life improve the lives of others and there's pictures online you can see of Jim Jones with Jerry Brown Governor Jerry Brown yeah its first round and you know they were man in the soup kitchens he was very liberal open to African Americans being part of the church in San Francisco there gays women you know was a really cutting edge pioneering thing and at the time it seemed like yeah that that's a cool thing I'm gonna join this group that taught me but you know the people that did this in the 50s and 60s when he was coming up and then into the 70s and then then yeah he started having sex and then drugs and then you know the feds started kind of poking around taxes and that's when they went to South America speaking wish I think this week is the spike special it's now the paramount Network on wake up awake okay this isn't that yeah right now I think it's like Sunday yeah I think it's a six-part series or something along those lines see that's an interesting yeah I'm absolutely convinced most of these guys believe what they say and maybe they're bullshitters at the start or they only partially believe but they repeat their rhetoric their followers give them positive reinforcement they come to believe it and you know David Koresh he was you know I right down the barrel he totally believes willing to die for his beliefs and he also was having sex with everybody yes [Laughter] [Applause]
