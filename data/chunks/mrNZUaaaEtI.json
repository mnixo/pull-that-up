Owen Smith hey how you feeling I feel good man I'm I'm excited we cheer serious man come on man I love ya we just tested on um yes negative it's apparently it's been some controversy about this so just let me write let everybody know right away there's no shortage of antibody tests what we're using there's no shortage of them people saying why are people on the front lines a lot of people it's just misunderstanding and confusion these tests there's no shortage of I understand some people in some places have a hard time getting access to the test that's not the case here so I've taken upon myself to test everybody as they come into the studio this is not taking away from anybody that's on the front lines it's not taking tests away from any medical workers the test that they would use for them particularly the act they're using swabs I mean look man those fucking people that are working in those hospitals and the medical workers those people are legit heroes yes you know and if I found out that there was something we were doing that was somehow another taking away from their ability to be tested I would never do it you know so people got upset apparently because well also people writing articles about things because there's you know it's like it's a hot topic right in their home - yeah I get it you know but when I posted that donnell and I were rona free people like somewhat someone posted some story whether it was hilarious did I go out of my way to not read comments and there's motherfuckers are writing stories where they're taking comments from Instagram and using them as quotes just some random Magoo that's posting something in this one of them said we were a low-key flexing that we had tests yes that's just someone just looking to use the term logo flexing and they don't have any place for its label Loki flexing he's got a corona test so it's a it's a test that tests you for antibodies and you'e laughing at my face the entire time thinking of their also something that I shared with you earlier today there was a new study that Jamie T V could pull up that study it is out of I think it's out of UCLA is that what it's out of its it says early antibody tests indicate far more cases and a much lower mortality rate right so they think there's at least 400,000 people have been infected in in California so the mortality rate is way way lower than they previously thought it was at least in California you know it obviously varies this is a crazy disease it's crazy it doesn't make any sense it varies depending upon what your physical condition whether or not you've been smoking whether or not there's apparently a great benefit to exercising regularly even while you have it if you catch it exercising mmm but then there was this fucking crazy thing what does that guy's name the Fox thing okay put up will do the first I find it's LA Times it's got the subscription blocker on oh these sons of bitches here I'll send you another one there's a there's one on la comm I belong the LA Times I can give you my look at you I support journalism I do like movies there I could get it I just don't have the time for that here it goes early antibody test fit of indicates far more kovat 19 cases lower mortality rate there's a decrease in the number of deaths the study indicates that there could be hundreds of thousands of people could be infected without knowing it that's what's so weird about it let me ask you this question though can you explain mortality rates like yes the amount of people that get it how many of them died so if it's a high mortality rate is it Yeah right like Ebola right vicious mortality rate yes really but Reap rabies the worst 100% rabies is like 99.99% the only time they if they catch it before the the symptom set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms look if you just get rabies you don't get over it unless every black person I know always crosses the street when you see a random dog communities and people don't have their dogs to go it's okay safe like take your word for this this nobody loves dogs more than me I love dogs but random dogs like you never know what someone did to that dog you know you never know how people treat that dog yeah and I've had a bunch of sketchy dogs have had dogs that I got from the pound that was super sketchy jesus knew I came home once one of my dogs killed my other dog oh my living room and my living room was a goddamn crime scene I've had some I've had some bad experiences with dogs when I was a kid we adopted a dog that had two Stamper a Doberman and he stood he started like his eyes were like glazed over he's a snarling barking oh my ho Jesus Christ I couldn't yeah we I grew up in apartment so we we couldn't have dogs and then uh so I had a cat named taco my dad gave him to me and I went to go visit him in the Bahamas he gave me a cat I think he knew it would piss my mom off growing up cake from the Conliffe bakery that they that they have over there and end in a cat my mom was pissed see if you can find this conversation Jaime that there it's so and it's it says they're joking but it also has a question that says out there joke no but that's mediate says there J right yeah every other website is not saying they're joking it doesn't sound like they're joking I think they're trying to come up with some sort of a cover for it but let's let's play what what he said it's John Roberts who is a correspondent for Fox and then who is the other guy the other guy who works for the New York Times Doug mills he's a photographer Doug okay so now let's it says apparently joking I doesn't sound like you're joking play play what it says because John let me explain it here John Roberts comes in and it's gonna play an ad before this Jamie so kill the volume John Roberts comes in and when he comes in he's not wearing a mask and he tells the other gentleman you could take the mask off and he tells them about this LA study go ahead play it here everybody USC Anana County Public Health there's 7,000 cases in California so here's here's what's weird about that one that guy says well we've all been vaccinated here anyway right now maybe he was joking maybe he's got a weird sense of humor long joke it's a weird joke weird yeah now they have done some trial vaccines there are some vaccines that are in trial there was a woman in Seattle she was the first person to get tested and I sent this stuff to Matt Staggs earlier today and he sent something to me there there have been several different there's 70 coronavirus vaccines right now that are under development with three in human trials okay so there there have been some things going on right now and the first person treated with the corona virus is in Seattle there's an article about that what she's talking about getting tested but yeah this this guy saying we've all been vaccinated like I don't know what that means it's hard to tell people people have weird sense of humor right like if you listen to comics right and if you took some of the shit that we say like we say ridiculous shit all the time and we get used to it right maybe they say ridiculous shit too I don't so they're dealing with right now right but the other guy coming in saying you don't have to wear a mask so Roberts comes in with no mask on yeah it says you don't need a mask to take the mask off yeah well that study's weird man because okay maybe maybe I believe the mortality rate is correct I believe that it's way less deadly than they thought it was but they had to prepare for something that they thought was gonna be real deadly because it's real deadly in Italy so but the question is like there's so many questions why is it so deadly in Italy is it because they're older people is it because they smoke why is it so deadly New York City like is it because they're stacked on top of each other is it oh definitely definitely definitely that hash them something to know distancing their also okay so I you know have a office and I get Luber eats and when it's things start to pop in my each driver was an older black man he's walking like mad close to me like it was up he goes black people can't get this right so I get the thing I'm gonna part of me was like okay but alright why am I taking advice from is this the uber driver guy then a personal friend of mine his dad will also know black ski trip he started this black ski organization and they went to Idaho and they came back and a lot of the they were older gentleman but a lot of them got infected with the virus to of since passed away from it so they and their son is it's in the it's in the LA Times it's the first article his son did a day by day social media post to try to turn the the narrative that black folks you can catch this this is what's happened to my dad he was like 61 I want to say and so I I so that's why I was very nervous in the face when we when we took the test it's like I want to have the confidence that that man had walking in the room but I'm also very I'm more of safe than sorry then the I can't wait to be a dead space you could take your mask oh you don't I mean I mean I I you know there's I have two young children I'm just like I'm yeah I'm just I'm more of the caution side but I'm not telling anyone but they should believe when I believe but just for me I'm just like I'm hearing about what it does to you like just just hang about what it does to your lungs and how to expand it makes it hard for air to get through when you need a ventilator and in all it that you like what a feelings collapse which is what happened to one of these gentlemen and and it's just it's it's a wrap but up but it is like I don't know I I don't know the specifics of how anything else plays out but I am also hearing from the other side of people who are who are like fairly you know within my six degrees who are succumbing to it so I'm just like uh you know that's great and but I I um I'm not there yet like you I mean like I think Lee so I am more like first of all anybody can catch it but second of all I think that if your immune system has any holes in it that shit gets in right and and it can fuck you up look at Michael yo Michael yo is a healthy guy he's strong he lifts weights all the time right he's relatively young and he's 45 right you know Michael he was in good shape he's not overweight yes are you see real bad oh I didn't know that hospitalized for a week said he thought he was gonna die he scared the fuck out him right when when I heard it was him oh you know he was texting me said I would call you right now but I can't talk I was like wow yeah man cuz of what it well it like physically does and so when I was going to the grocery store like that that's when I was the most horrified because that's when you kind of get a temperature of how everyone is and so when I went early on people like you six feet away like people with joking and then there was something happened and people started kind of taking it as serious as you know yeah people could in and yeah I mean I'm just I have a very cautious mom I'm just a safe I'm I'm the most reckless on stage but that's true about you yeah I never thought about it that way like you're like a real safe guy off stage yeah man yeah man and it's just I I've seen it could almost be like a funny movie right every time one of my friends go fuck it man I'm just gonna live in the moment pow what happened to Tommy Tommy God gotta be careful I yet I mean it's just like I have so many just stories or memories from my childhood people man fuck you gotta live for now gone you don't I mean so it's just like and I you know so I'm back and I'm back and forth on that moment so when I saw him walk in that guy looked like he was in shape he worked out and there are a lot of people in Trader Joe's lines like him you know I mean like when you're standing line is that you don't need a man like those people and it's just like it's not for me man I don't know what I don't want to bring anything home to my young kids so if it was just me in the crib I would be trying to get last days puss yeah but I'm married happily married so my brain I'm not I am super cautious it's like single single people are fucked right now right if you live by yourself an apartment you're not allowed to leave you can't go to work anymore so you're crazy you can't fucking if you fuck someone it better be just one person yeah real careful yeah y'all go together It's A Wrap that's your person it bothers me this the restrictions on personal liberties I think it's good I think I'm very here's like here's what I'm happy about I'm happy that so many people have done the social distancing thing and quarantined and kept away yeah almost everybody I know every most everybody knows just staying home my kids are home doing home school all my friends kids are home doing home school they're staying home from work everyone staying home and we we don't go anywhere you know I come here I go home that's it that's my life just stay put stay put just let let the fucking dust settle yeah it's great in that way but it's also scary for all these fucking people that have businesses it's scarier for people that have compromised immune systems oh my gosh this is the weirdest time of our lives yeah I think but we were talking earlier I think that the planet needs this break yeah because as soon as we stayed in for like a week it started raining in LA has the best air quality in all of the world right just stay in the house for yeah I mean it's kind of crazy and is it is weird man oh I'm curious to see what happens when the other side of this but like our industry is far cuz you got a life a tort I was supposed to pop off yeah like that kind of stuff is just like I have a sold-out show in Vancouver last night in an arena couldn't do it we moved it to October literally that's the last of the worries my health is fine I'm worried about health more than anything right and I'm worried about the economy I'm worried about people that like my friend Adam Perry Lang who owns APL restaurants like my favorite steakhouse in LA yeah he's he's spending most of his time cooking for hospital workers and bringing food to them so that's giving him a sense of purpose but through all this and they're doing like curbside pickup or people can order food online it's an amazing steakhouse but they might not they might not make it and I was texting with him last night he I'm gonna get him on the podcast soon he was saying that for his friends in the restaurant industry it's so grave it's like everyone is barely hanging on and they might drop off left and right mean we might lose half our restaurants oh yeah you know did you hear about what happened when they did the small business loan and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse got it and none of the waiters got it none of them just go straight straight to the business they think the idea is look if you give it to the waiters and the business goes under the waiters won't have a job when the business comes back so they keep the business open the waiters will have a job when everything comes back we just need more we need to figure out you know these people have to be able to work and if they can't work we got to figure out a way to sustain them and I don't know nobody's ever figured this out before nobody's ever had to do this well they they burn through that small business loan shit in like that yeah they were saying this because it was supposed to be for companies 500 employees or less but Bill Gates Jeff Bezos timestep but which are doing yeah how much money would Jeff Bezos have left if he gave everybody $1,000 listen he would he would be everybody everybody in this country in this country attending 20 million dollars he gave everybody a thousand do the math Jamie I'm gonna say how many more on is that billions of well it's a thousand million is a billion so be 300 billion so you'd be broke we'd be broke paper broke instantly crazy imagine if you did that just became a hippie sir give up been an asshole it's like people don't remember Bill Gates the old Bill Gates right people see Bill Gates now I see Bill Gates now and I see guy was wearing an outfit here's an outfit yeah it's like he's got a like spider-man like he puts on a spider Malick this is my really nice rich guy thing got a sweater bitch it's a hundred degrees outside why you got that sweater with a shirt underneath it it's secretly ventilated and yeah did you ever have a t-shirt on does Bill Gates a movie show I heard he had a house where when you walk into a room it recognizes like how you like the temperature like you're a band yes pen yeah it would change the temperature it would make coffee that you like and I was like my I was single when I heard about this I think I wish I had that because that's how the girl no it was over this code changed the sentence artwork flips over right right but I mean yeah he called this though he called Iowa we weren't ready to man Demick like years ago 15 2015 yeah yes well he set it up he's the mastermind one of the Incredibles like the bad guy and he goes I'm just confused by his outfit cuz it's like he's dressing up like mr. Rogers on purpose he wants you to think of him in a different way he's a savage man most ruthless motherfucker when he was running Microsoft that's why Microsoft guts are you right they were take no prisoners businessmen yes take no prisoners yeah he's but he's pretending like he's you know I kind of loved that shit though like when people cuz you just have to know how to look for it right yeah like like I don't trust anybody that doesn't cuss on stage you know it's like come on man that's a button-up tee shirt with a collar everything has a collar though but that's a long time ago that looks like about 15 years old it's a nice career though hey dad look at that crew why is Lulu does like the Forrest Gump after me where's that connected like so dumb a lot of money and use like I'll

yeah cooks who does dishes can't care can you load a dishwasher can't complain stupid shit man I feel like we've talked about this all day oh how do you deal with it cuz you ain't going nowhere right it's like the big one is one bathroom oh if you if you if you only have enough money for one bathroom you shouldn't be in a relationship or you gotta really know each other like you spent so many nights yeah together like so many weekends together you stay at her place or she stays at your place I want that one bathroom yeah this is a reality when you walk in the bathroom right after a girl takes our fucking rank shit and if it's cold out then you gotta open up the window and you're like oh good lord so you're sitting there smelling her shit freezing yes trying to take your own shit on top of her shit that y'all not gonna make it you need to make it two bathrooms yeah yeah depends from me I like it depends on the chemistry of the person yeah there's some people that things will set you off I mean like I can't but then there's another people that there's you like them so much that little thing ain't shit the same thing well you know some dates I'm sure you went on when you were single where a girl just did one little stupid thing like this is over yes yes yes but like if you really were into her that same thing like whatever she's having a rough day now I was fucked up I'll be nice to it out thing and then they out yeah yeah man certain things you just you know for me or something yeah people that insult you people they like you and then they try to like put you down and try to fuck with you man just like they're doing it to try to like diminish you there's some sort of a weird way like and they're not even funny right oh but sometimes people grew up like that yeah their mom and their dad did that to each other and so they don't know how to behave no in a relationship and that's what that's the definition of love love it like to you yeah and if it doesn't match what it looks like to you y'all ain't gonna make it exactly the UM yeah man I was all over the place with that like I've had I'm in my dated this one girl she smoked a lot of weed right mom didn't mind that but she also smoked cigarettes so I was like damn pick one night and I wish it was just a weed so that's usually i'ma quit when I'm 30 27 now I got a way out so I couldn't like it then that's weird but I was still okay cuz she was she was fun this is like the closest he was mad fun and then she had like student loan financial shield on top of it I was like I'm out [Laughter] but real talk she got it together when she got on the other side of 30 and itchy yeah we're friendly now but I still it was a gamble like I gotta ya know I had financial shit I'll tell you that her debt becomes your debt she was like she was a a cereal degree person I she had like degrees so her shit was high it wasn't like oh dude that is the biggest goddamn scam going cuz no matter what happens in your life you have to pay back those student loans yeah if you owe money to any and you can go bankrupt you know trying to bankrupt and you don't have to pay back your business folds you can go bankrupt but Sallie Mae is like I don't give a fuck you owe student loans you're paying now thirteen yeah pay - do you know there's people today that have Social Security docked for their student loans imagine you're at the end of the game and your Social Security taking your Social Security to pay off some bullshit debt for a loan that didn't do you any good because here you are collecting Social Security broke is fog right and they take spending on it it probably took a good-sized chunk oh yeah oh yeah hey if you're just gonna die and that's gonna help you die quicker who's gonna be thinking about it at the park tried to feed the pigeons makes a degree yeah man I paid my shit off I was so happy and I don't really use it I kind of use it and what was your degree I was finance so you say finance if you have money just finance doing and I and I studied Japanese for like a year really yeah man I was gonna go over there and I'm a director named Christine Swanson she just directed The Clark Sisters uh movie that came out on lifetime did over like 11 million million views her and her husband Mike Swanson they were they were dating at Notre Dame at the time they were like you should take two like they were like sit down and like looking me and checking with me and just go you should do this and I would do it so they what I used to take Japanese and I started taking Japanese and I liked it I really enjoyed and I learned I was getting like these culture classes because I was gonna go over there and I and I I'm an asshole so I would like mimic the teacher but I was literally but she enjoyed because I was actually saying it natively so I wasn't being like a dick because I enjoy like I just notice how she was saying it no one else was saying it so I'm gonna just say it like her so she would be like on come on well you know be like ah like I would like lean into it you know you know you know this guy sukashi just named like you would just like what's going on these days you've been busy like it's just like and so how well are you good at this I got into it because it's also like it's I was just fascinated by why Japanese literacy rate was like so much higher than ours is because their alphabet they have three alphabets and so there's this hit Agana katakana and kanji and kanji is what everybody gets tattoos of so I was just fascinated with like the art of it and shit and so what's the difference in three um so katakana is more syllabic like it's like how you speak so so I could write your name and cut in katakana I think yeah yeah yeah I'm rusty so I could have messed up just now you got it and I'm also drinking a little scotch but uh what am i doing you whiskey whiskey image image but um but uh but and so one is one is per syllable so you can take like American words and write that in Japanese and in the Japanese person go oh that's how they pronounce names right so so if your name is I don't know d'Artagnan you could do that in Japan you know they were good night know and then um and if but but kanji one kanji could mean several different things so you have to know in in the context in which you're using it and I'm left-handed so I naturally would look at stuff from right to left and that's how they read oh this way so their books go the opposite way and so I was kind of like in my son can't say like the letter L right now everything is W so I'm like he's like naturally like he should be learning Chinese or Japanese now I think just because the way is his tongue and stuff is forming he's he'll be like yo you know and I'm like we will make fun you know kids do that all kids but I'm like maybe so but when I was learning it I I just got really into it because it took like a lot of like detail to like figure it out and it started sticking with me and then I started doing comedy in college and I started on the weekends I would drive to like Des Moines Iowa and do a funny bone and come back you know and they were like you still won't go to Japan I was like now I know it like I found what I was going to do so I just didn't I never went so I I kind of that's a trip I've always wanted to take and see how much of it like comes back to me cuz I was I was pretty good at it and I loved and then and then I started learning Chinese and Chinese is it's mono syllabic so like Niihau ma is a low but if you say Nihao ma like that like i called you a horse but it was just say yes like it's like me how like you how you say it's like very specific in how you say things so one is hello the other one is it's a low but niyama said that way is but anyhow my mom and like drag it down my kids used to watch me how Kyle and yeah I think that's hey hello whiny how ma instead of just me how you could say me how and that's the thing he was anyhow what is the difference in me how Annie home ah that's just what I learned in more formal yeah and is yeah yes you learn everything is you learn that's the only thing I don't like about learning languages in school you learn you you'd never learn how you speak you know you always learn how you would write a letter and how you would be like you know grammatically correct right but so now like people are doing these things but you just learn what you need to know because I feel like humans we only we all say like the same twenty pieces of like bullshit you know what I mean like if you could learn that you can probably learn eight languages if you could just figure out you know we're all getting into right the fun with the bitches can I drink you know but always where are the bathrooms may I see a menu as what are your pronouns yeah yeah yeah I'm they'd that obey them did they have a them in Japanese um it was um my goodness now I'm gonna get reamed because I'm rusty on it but it was like how would how would I say this they did have it but it was the way honestly i the sentence structure the way my three-year-old speaks is the way you would structure a sentence in Japanese he would say he won't say the subject in the verb all the time sometimes he would put the verb last because he'll be so excited so he'll put adjective adjective like so bottle great good you know the you see it like and that's kind of like how you would say I'm like this to dislike in my head I'm like that's how you would speak so if I was to say something in Japanese I would say I saw what they were asked what's my name and I would go hold on what is my name in Japanese it's no one's know it's oh it's only no but I'm something sniff it's like you can't say you can but it's like sue me sue desc so me so destiny destiny that's kind so that's what that's car that sky makes it a question at the end is at the end so you put you put that at the end deaths neigh is a period so you would say so it's like you're saying so it is right would you say so if I go so Disney that means it is good soda sky I'm asking is it good oh that's what just in an end and it depends on what part of Japan you are how you leaning into the death scene but your name wouldn't be Smith sue me sue sue me sue me smell yes and so when you were right sue me sue you know they would say they would change Smith because it's Smith but it's sue me sue how they pronounce it it's sue me sue me sue sue me sue Smith and it's suus is spelled TSU so it's not I think I'm rusty this was over 20 years ago so you would have to change the way your name sounds that's so strange to me so Destin eight it was it will be my name they were asked sue me sue yes we saw some Oh make them say Smith don't don't give in the noise that you make that means you it was amazing Oh things are open my mind learning Japanese for you're studying it for like a year year and a half and in economics learning economics how did that help you it was because it's like a science and it's like a cause-and-effect and so it's the same way I approach my bits you know what I mean it's like economy like if this happens then it affects all this shit and it's all tied to the one thing you can't judge which is human behavior right so you don't know what people are going to do people try to kind of try to control it all the time because it has direct effects on the stock market on how you can make money it's like so like something like the girl when when the coronavirus dropped I was like I know this is gonna fuck up all these things mmm and then seeing how people react to all these things being taken away fascinates me you know I mean it's like but that is that is what economics is because when you're thinking about stuff you always go well what if a pandemic happened well our system where are the holes in our current system but when people are just being intellectuals about it and just like talking about it is sounds boring you're like but when this shit is happening in real time this is what the Economist talked about all this I think it's like it's if this then then what but it's just a deeper thing and so it's the same kind of way when you take a bit where you just go what if I'm talking about there's anything you just you just go I'm at home so I was watching something where oh my son loves this cartoon called what's name is this cartoon he watches blaze it sounds like they but it's blaze in a monster machine and they had like this one it's a the the episode it was a giant meatball rolling down the town destroying the town and they had this one I was clearly like black rollerblading like monster truck with an afro going get down get groovy get down get meatball meatball and then the meatballs over them my son loves that right so what I thought I'd be with him is now I pretend that that guy was on the phone with somebody else and I'm like hey Steve what you're doing I'm just rollerblading get down yeah and then and then so now my son doesn't like getting meatball Steve no Steve get out of there so then we pretend that we have to break the news to Steve's family that he got ran over by Johnny boy [Laughter] that we work with Steve and he's about to go rollerblading for lunch you know I mean so it's just it's the economy Stephen role bein you know that's kind of played nobody does it you know it's nice outside and then he gets pummeled by the meatball so it's like everybody who knew Steve how did he feel about Steve so it that's kind of like what a ripple effects the ripple effects and then and that's kind of like how I would I would think of bits in my head sometimes and then are you paying attention to how economists are looking at the future sometimes like right now like with me I don't even I haven't read any prognostications other than it's bad Great Depression yeah although all of that is true I mean well where I get lost is when they just stop talking about like injecting money and fixing things you know with money I'm not I'm not I'm lost in that I'm more I'm more into like the personal like what happens to us like like how do we I'm fascinated with that shit like the human nature of was you know gonna happen like how would things gonna change on the other side of this right right shake hands are you gonna be you know you know right how many people are gonna keep wearing masks keep wearing masks and then like I was I had a a classic like racial thing happened to me yesterday I was with my son three years old and it's uh this guy was working out with his shirt off in the park this is big guy he looked kind of like ridiculous and my he said weights yeah yeah he had two dumbbells no shirt on he's just Lawrence in the park just doing these dumb workouts and um me and my son see him but my son is he knows about the social - tree man he's on his little scooter I'm on my bike to keep up with him because he's fast as hell and then when we're coming back well I'm walking my bike and my son has this scooter and we see there's like either BMW or Audi we see the doodoo lights go on and I don't think anything ever - now look and it's the guy and he's like doing it like right in front of us like you don't I mean so it's classing like do you think imma break into his car with my son or like you had all day to lock your car man like you could have just done it when you didn't see us and so like a part of me was like why you he was like doing it so he could so I could see he was doing you know I'm trying to say like I'm walking and he's like like literally like locking his door and it to me it felt like because I had on a mask I had on a mask in here and I was reading stories about how most black folks are afraid to wear masks cuz we look like yo so part of me was like scared this motherfucker that's cool but what the partner was like wearing with my son like I was like do I engage with him but don't let it go like what do you do and I let it go because I was with my son and it just felt it just felt ridiculous I was like but I feel like we're reverting back to like those paranoid things too like all man black dude in the mask you know like my thing and it was like a like what point where I proven in I'm not gonna change him you know what what do I do so I just my son didn't even see it I would not have seen it if he wasn't so just like clumsy and odd with it like it just felt like cuz we had passed him several times he could have he could have locked this car when we were gone you know just done it and just kept and moving but it was like it it was like letting you know yeah yeah that's what it felt like to me I think people are losing their minds yeah I think so I think that's a lot of what time yeah yeah their behavior patterns are all off because they're so under duress and stress you know there's a lot of people that are acting real strange sometimes you know I'll call people up just say hi yeah you know how you doing you hanging in there and there's a lot of people just seem real weirded out you know what it gets me man is that night yeah gets me at night yeah cuz it's during the day I'm like everything's fucked up but you know we're maintaining I have faith in human nature I have faith in society that will pull together but at nighttime I'll have any fucking faith that's me not perform in either man does that have any definitely that but it's also at night there's something about the darkness where I'm like I just you know and I do a lot of my really fucked up thinking with everyone else in my house asleep and yeah you know yeah that's when I that's when I spark up that's when I write my best shit to it was when everyone's asleep yeah be so when everyone's asleep I'm sitting around thinking like man what if this keeps going sideways what if we get a for what if the grid goes down what if the earthquake hits what if the fucking volcano under Yellowstone blows what if this what if I asteroid hits what if a worse disease catches on what if there's a war between US and China over this bullshit there's a crazy letter that Germany wrote to China yesterday crazy the head of Germany wrote some letter directly to the head guy in China talking about the only reason why you're in power is because of surveillance and what have you done to the world like what you know what you guys have done because you because of your disgusting pride and you you've hidden the facts from people you've tried to distort the reality and because of that hundreds of thousands of people are going to die it was deep I was reading this letter like you never read a letter like that where a one world leader is shitting on another world leader was it no wasn't there a head guy in the the oh the head guy in Germany is a woman right Angela Merkel right who is it editor of a prominent German newspaper okay well yeah the articles that's right it's correct you know because date China never they don't admit any fault ever whenever anything goes wrong they cover everything up and there's so many people that criticize the government in China they just wind up getting ghosted they just disappear they vanish yeah they'd never hear from them again no no one knows what to do I mean that's that's how they run things over there what scares me is that if we give in to that kind of like they have apps on their phone right now that give them a social score you know so like if you jaywalk you lose points oh yeah I've heard about yeah oh yeah and the guy yeah some guy said his social score is really bad in people it's almost like Minority Report cuz they're almost like a mirror yeah yeah like that it's it's scary you know if we give in to that kind of surveillance over here there's a real dark end to all that stuff there's a real dark end the the bright side is like oh well maybe everybody keep a shit together and be nice or maybe the government will be watching every goddamn thing you do all day long and hold that over you and then they'll use that in order to gain more political power that's just as possible and more likely or if they of your social score is like manipulated or wrong the downside is a lack of freedom and that's the whole reason why the United States is so innovative the whole reason is is this this we have this spirit over here this spirit of freedom I know we can do more we can get more shit done we can we can come up with ideas we celebrate this sort of creative the the sort of creative spirit that we think of when we think of the United States we think of freedom we think of creativity there's so much innovation done over here the moment you start clamping down on people and taking away freedom you're also going to take away that creativity you're also going to take away that innovative thought mentality you're gonna make people scared and you're gonna do it just so that you can control them and it's fuck it's the worst like one of the one of the things about the United States that makes it so great is that we have the ability to criticize our government we have the ability to talk shit and that keeps people in check even Trump like even Trump like as much as he hates it he has toned down a lot of his rhetoric because of the criticism that he's faced you know and that's it's important it's very important yeah I mean he has the that's one thing this virus is making everybody have to do their job mm-hm like you realize like a lot of his people were like acting in positions like they weren't really truly vested if you're acting in it but like it's making everyone have to actually do their job wondering if he would do it again all over again if he knew how hard it would be and how much we get shit on I don't you know I don't know I think it was so funny when he presented to me was like it was like like the hot new nightclub you know what I mean and like everybody was in there you know what it's like like a nightclub and you could pretend to be who you want to be and you could just you know the mean and watered-down expensive drinks and it's just all happening then the coronavirus comes and that's like when the lights come on in the club and you get to see you know our fucked-up shit really is mm-hmm and and so cuz when the coal country just kind of like said I was gonna go with Joe Biden regardless of how lucid you feel he is or how sharp you think he is when the whole country was like was gonna go Joe you just made me think like Trump is like a fancy a nice resort like hotel and who doesn't wanna stay in a nice hotel right he's like I'm rich from this and everyone's like I want to do that but after a while you get tired of spending 21 dollars for Internet and forty dollars for pancakes and you just want to go home and Joe was kind of feeling it felt like he represents home you know I mean like Peter like I feel like people Joe Biden to me feels like a schoolhouse in a third world country that's gonna collapse and kill all the kids it's cool house is made by people who skirted all the rules of how to of construction he saw old dude with dementia but I think he's gonna be propped up by so many different people who wanna vote like President Obama's gonna come out and endorse so many president to come out and take over okay but if he doesn't you got Joe Biden who's the leader of the country who can't form sentences listen man there's 320 million people in this country telling me that's the best the Democratic Party can do that's crazy no that's what I'm saying I'm what I'm saying is I feel like to everyone he was nted home that's what I'm saying because he's familiar he wasn't standing next to the guy that we all felt more comfortable with especially in situations like this did you see Obama's endorsement video I didn't his straight up gas lighting just gas a retainment up you can find it I don't know if we could play is it long or is it doesn't believe a goddamn word look he knows Biden is doomed he knows he's doomed so you think he's gonna lose it's not a matter of whether or not I think he's gonna lose I do think he's gonna lose but even if I thought he was gonna win he shouldn't do the job he there's no way he can take the pressure of that position with the cognitive decline that he's already showing but there's no buts you just want the Democratic Party to be back in control I get it no no I wish missing and I wish like I say man like when yeah and when you're in a nightclub you don't care stuff's going down right right but when you come out I don't understand this nightclub and you lost an analogy damn trying to give you an example to me just the way that Trump is handling having any kind of criticism you get anything is unsettling it's like dude just calm down man like you got to break you're right you're in charge it's kind of like I was talking to Keith Robinson he had this amazing point I don't know it just made me laugh he said there should be some type of test you have to pass to become president because for any other thing you have to take a test so you have to have degrees or whatever but to be in charge of everybody else and you're in charge and you control the nukes everything and it's like a backwards thing and so that guy who's in charge of everybody else is just it's like man I just wish he didn't cause so much just wasn't the way he he was you know I mean I wish he could just take who he's always been that's my point is so changed at all once he got into office and people did expect him to yeah he's always been the guy that if anybody says anything about him he talks mad shit about that yes never lied to Zeo Donnell or whoever it is that he's been infused with right he's never lied to you in the way and so it's like you respect all of that but it's just like in times like this one is requires some empathy many requires you to look in the camera and say I feel for the people that I not give me credit it's like don't do to give me credit stuff now is good credit stuff is ridiculous and so I feel like so what I'm saying is I feel like having Joe come up there and play those notes it feels like people how everyone just all of a sudden overnight goes joe biden's our guy it felt like I just I think it's like when Mariah Carey was on pills and she couldn't sing the national anthem because she forgot the words this is a fucking way man that can't be President he can't talk he can't hold a sentence you give him a couple minutes on CNN and he can't keep it together but like after a year in office dealing with international politics the economy the environment all these different things but what I'm saying is he's gonna have people so did Obama but look how old he got how quickly by Obama's brilliant Obama's a brilliant articulate guy yeah sorry getting gray hair his skin starts ass because he was actually reading the memos this is crazy right that's my point my man sharp as an aide Biden starts reading those things he'll be dead in a week and then who's gonna be the vice president Elizabeth Warren who they're gonna put in there no they're probably I don't know who they gonna pick as like they said he wants to pick a woman of color so he said a woman of color for the Supreme Court said for the vice president he should he should should he or shouldn't pick the best person he used to pick the best person who will probably be a woman of color why would it be a woman of color though the most would it be because they're underrepresented and it would be a good thing for the country or would it be a good thing for the country because it's the best person for the job both that both best person for the best person for the job I feel could be a woman of color in anybody's country could also be a woman of color it could be because a lot of policies kind of stopped before consulting with people of color and a woman of color can see hey what we leaving out this group let's figure this out yeah but what if it's a male of color who's better qualified for the job out but that's not my point what is what all the qualifications for this job is what I just said there's no test you have to take it's just a popularity contest well if that's the case in what but nobody's firewoman of colored B would be what why would you want a woman of color I think everyone would just feel better woman of color in charge hmm I I feel like what the Chelsea Handler's say when she did her whole thing remember she just she just did a whole thing about something on Netflix and she was like whee and she went on Ellen and said we need to start listen in the women of color like it was like yeah he probably should I think I'm not the right person to be talking about this but I feel like you know they say Stacey Abrams is in the running and I don't think she'd be a bad choice but I've watched how she just puts things in context and she is very smart and very sharp and she is not thrown like she would be extremely qualified well I'll tell you who could actually be a resident who Michelle Obama she's not going to do it no but if she wanted to do it she could be President why do you think she could do it first of all she's brilliant she's articulate she's well-known she's she's a powerful person like she speaks really well right she obviously was for for rather two terms she was the first lady so she's accustomed to the public eye she's accustomed to speaking publicly if dude if she stepped up and decided she would run for president I think she'd win by a landslide because the possibility constant maybe not beat Trump I should say but win the Democratic nominee by a landslide I really think you think she would lose as well though I don't know I don't know how it works it's complicated right especially when you're dealing with electoral college like look Trump lost the popular vote but he won the electoral college vote right and that's why they say Joe Biden was the best bit because Joe Biden so Pennsylvania it was a swing state and Joe Biden is the only person out of the Democratic nominees who did not say he was against fracking he was like you can't you can't be again you can't you can't do it all at once and then they they had they had the clip of the fracking protest and he's like Oh vote for somebody else man like I was like Oh vote for somebody else and so Trump they they were saying that Trump does not feel like he could beat Joe in Pennsylvania because that's what jokes from and he also supports he has in with you know the coal miners in the fracking industry just like you know Trump so when it comes to his electoral college votes Trump doesn't know it knows he can't beat him that's why I'll hints the whole Ukrainian get some dirt on I'm just a now something's happening something that was kind of like the narrative of that and so when it comes to electorial votes that whole Midwest game that whole Michigan Michigan is a Biden is right there and that's what I'm saying like the people yes man oh no I don't know what what's gonna happen once people start hearing him talk on the campaign trail but I don't you know I don't know how I don't know how brilliant articulate Trump is like I don't know I think I think everyone as far as brilliance it's a matter of being able to control crowds and have these exciting rallies he does arenas dude he does sold-out arenas and he kills I know listen I'm not this is not projected Lee I know you want a Democrat to win right and you want a woman of color to be the vice president I would love that I would love for I'm not saying I would love for things to feel like their I don't want to say back to normal but I would just love to feel like when the president not that it's not like those horrible question nasty questions Christian you should yeah it's it's bad in those ways but what I'm talking about is his ability to excite his base and the ability to get people behind him he's a unprecedent ability in depending upon how he handles this coronavirus crisis they could swing left or right it really depends entirely upon who Biden picks because you remember when george w was president it really was like president dick cheney right dick cheney was in that fucking vampire underground bunker yeah getting fresh blood pumped into him every day and calling all the shots do you remember there was one point in time where cheney was consistently in the bunker he was in the bunker for like weeks at a time they were saying he's in it they even told us he was in a bunker but just in case anything happens like why isn't bush in a fucking bunker he's the president Dick Cheney was out there calling the shots mister it was one of the most transparent times and you see the connection between industry and government where you have a guy who was the former CEO of Halliburton a company that rebuilds countries after we blow them up getting no bid contracts to rebuild a country that we blew up while he's making the decisions to blow up these countries no it's crazy it was crazy it was crazy and like you couldn't stop it right but if someone comes along and some powerful speaker someone who you really mean there's there's several choices apparently and if they pick someone and I'm sure they're grooming someone right now who you get excited about you go okay this person this person could step up even if Biden lost or if Biden lost it right or Biden died which is also possible bro there's a there's a photo of him that was on the New York Times yesterday well you can see like where they gave him the fucking the face look he's he's talking and he's like skin is unnaturally pulled up and and back it's like oh Christ man maybe 20 years ago maybe 20 years ago but not now this is crazy a man I don't know it was like when he was talking about all the stuff he would have done if this crossed his desk like you know and just just just like just having an awareness of how the government works well what well the what was it the pandemic agency was closed down him up in trouble but I loved about Trump he was on he's like nobody thought just what happened like he literally he's like get rid of him but then there's there's like all types of protocols and you find out where the money is for this like Joe had it a just a knowledge of where all that stuff was hmm and I feel like Trump talks to his lawyers like what can I do look I didn't sure what can I do we're gonna do and he just goes you know then he takes his stance based on what he is known he's know he's gonna be protected legally Brian he doesn't equate that he's president of all of us you know what I mean so I just feel like that's what's missing and he is incapable of doing that I know when pence had the mic and pants was getting popular it ate at Trump he's like made me come into these how does that guy get popular how does first of all you want to talk about a vice prime with that guy's voice sounds like oh well people were just happy to hear somebody I'm not yelling back if he was like we're gonna go have by the end of the week did you ever see there's a woman who has one of them pink pussy hats on and there's a bunch of people that are yelling impeach Trump impeach Trump and she's running like yay president pens probably like job if Trump gets impeached says oh she's like yeah maybe we should not impeach him like yeah maybe yeah yeah oh so funny become so emotional right like and and and and I feel like Trump's a businessman so he he's not approaching this if any emotion and it's just it fucks with people because they like yeah you know well the good thing that he did was block travel from China that's a good thing that's probably saved thousands of lives really did a lot of people were saying you're crazy for doing that but there's also there's so many fucking people that have been one but then it's also saying that he actually didn't they were saying that people this was still coming from China so what do you mean he actually didn't I don't know I just heard that's what I'm saying I was saying conflicting but they definitely blocked he blocked travel yeah but they were saying people were still coming well maybe some people had loopholes because of diplomatic reasons right business reasons or whatever but they did look man there was a video that Eddie Bravo had on his page of Nancy Pelosi in February telling people to go out and go to Chinatown there's no worries just go out mingle and then they confronted her Chris Wallace confronted her on Fox News you know who's she's bullshitting her way out of this while she was blaming the president it look everybody got this wrong everybody got it wrong yeah everybody did four hundred thirty thousand people have traveled from China to us since the corona virus surfaced right but went but the chronovisor surfaced and this is just a this I think this is just an article about what yeah I understand that the articles recent but this is an article about when the corona virus surface which was in January that's just letting put it know how many surfaced here made it over to America but that's not how many people came to America this is since Chinese officials disclosed to outbreak on New Year's Eve and two months after presidential also house restrictions forty forty thousand since the president's impose restrictions he's been pressed so what kind of restrictions were those the bulk of the travelers who were of multiple nationalities arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fucked by Corona hi baby so is like talking about right now they flew directly from rueland have you seen all the shit that points to the fact that this came from a lab well you know what's so funny I was talking that I can't say anything but they were like this is a chemical thing that just got out of hand they were like they fucked up well they were working on how to mitigate viruses that's what they were doing they were working on and they had viruses in this lab in wuhan and they think it came out and that's one of the reasons why they think China immediately blamed it on the wet market they said whenever China blames it on something always look deeper there are a ton there's a ton of scientists that are pointing to that there's one French virologist Jamie I'll send you this there's a French biologist who identified HIV and this French biologist was looking at this disease and he was like this is not a disease that came from nature no this is a disease that came from a lab did you see that that Facebook video where the this some series on Netflix what is it it's a series on Netflix that takes place in China that like two or three years ago they called the corona virus and he like played the thing really yeah it was like episode 13 season 3 or something like that of this show Jesus Christ man they knew this stuff was happening well people knew that it was always a possibility I'm in this text thread but it's here now and it's just like the reset of like oh that's nothing that's interesting like what is doing to our TV industry like it feels like everything has become YouTube you know trying to do you right now everybody is the thing is they're trying to do it but they're not adapting right they're not adapting to the fact they got no artists so they're doing these wack-ass monologues you know who's doing it well who bill maher yeah bill Macatee isn't having fun with it he's having a great time he's also he has here at French virologist I'll send you this right now Jamie hold on Bill Maher has some great fucking rants I mean these are tweeted twice to him that where I said Bravo yes are you playing it on my phone no where does it sound coming from I just said it to you yeah his fucking shit has been great yeah hilarious and also you know he's he's pushing all the buttons you know he's he's doing comedy he's doing like real edgy comedy while he's pointing out how crazy this all is I appreciate him right now he said guy who's on the left that I really I really liked the fact that he doesn't give in to all the craziness he doesn't give in to the the lunacy of left-wing policies he still he's still like rational yeah about it all although clearly left-wing biased he's still rational yeah but it still goes with comedy but it was one yeah I watched I don't know man I like him a lot and I watch the butts coming i watch snow cuz i watch some of his stuff and i feel like it's two things you should have me on his show basically because he's always he would have you on the show he's always talking about kids you know what the fuck you're talking about and he's always talking about but but but i love i love how he attacks it like he knows but it's like best that's your shit yeah that's not it or he'll be talking about he did this whole rant about why can't we call it the China disease and yeah that's tough and I was listening to a Chinese American on on the daily just talking about her experience of feeling like being an Asian American here was always like a probationary experience as long as I did the right things and stayed out the way people left me alone but when this came up just her going outside people like you fucking Chinese you know in and it's kind of like so is to me I love watching him because it's because it's also these blind spots that he just his whole rant was really about stop these wet markets you can do it he didn't have to do thee well here's the other side of it just when they called it the Chinese virus they don't call anything a virus based on the country they would call it the Wuhan virus just like they called Lyme disease Lyme disease that was one of the examples that I used or like you know SARS or MERS or some Middle Eastern respiratory didn't make that point he didn't they call it the one right he was and that's what the problem is yeah the problem is that he's trying to do comedy and he's trying to make a point at the same time and really the right way would be call it the Wuhan yes if they called but when they called it Co vid 19 then it becomes the whole world's problems that's one of the difference between that what that journalist in Germany was saying to the head of China you know he was saying that and then the the Chinese guy was saying hey this is the whole world's problems the whole world's pandemic but yeah kinda but it did come from a fucking if it did if it did come from a lab you know right we should call it the lab created Wuhan virus there you go but it's more specific here it is inaccurately claims the novel coronavirus is man-made and contains genetic material from HIV okay so this guy is Nobel laureate Luc montagnier speak French I didn't get there so um how do we know that this guy's correct it says series nomic analysis and can make that a little bare it says indicates the virus has a natural origin it was not engineered the so called unique protein sequence insertions found the two towns of 19 corner rods can be found in many other organisms not just HIV but that doesn't mean it's organic or natural in origin see I think that we are right now in this period of conflicting information and you're going to get it bouncing back and forth from protic on but I've read multiple sources that seem and from respected scientists to seem to indicate that there's a distinct possibility that came from that lab one of the things they're saying is the actual bats that the sequence the genome when they when they when they found the genetics for this virus the bats that tested you know that where this originated from were the same exact same exact location is the bats that they do research on in this lab and the lab is four miles away I mean it's not it's not outside the realm of possible writing and we're in the wheelhouse yeah obviously I'm a moron I don't know shit about viruses other than what I read but when China says all definitely a wet market nothing to see here so that's a great point look deeper yeah I don't know I mean maybe it was a wet market it wasn't a wet market right yeah well the wet markets are fucking gross you know it is but that's also a sad thing about you're trying to feed a billion people and you're feeding them wildlife you know a lot of what they're eating is wildlife their equivalents like squirrels and yeah exactly yeah just they're eating whatever they they can eat that you know pigeons were brought over here as food from where from other countries from Europe I believe you know palm trees yes no they're not native at all the California crazy la is posit Ruiz like Cub Swanson he's got fights in UFC yeah he's got SoCal tattooed on stomach with two palm trees it's like it's almost it's like once you blow stuff you can't unknow it and it's like sometimes I know it's a weird one palm trees or a weird one like what how many do they bring over here yeah this seal all the palm trees yeah yeah that's oh that's a weird plan yeah they'd normally in climates with hurricanes and shit cuz they could withstand they would stand the fuck out of some wind Yeah right most last time you saw a palm tree the fellow they just take it yeah wind yeah they're not worried about wind at all no how crazy is that that a plant evolved to be able to handle the winds right right and so my brain is working like you know the palm trees I couldn't stand it you know it's on hey man you better win to come in dude I love Hawaii I love how he tastes like fuck you no one's coming here man stay out stay out stay out we got some beautiful islands we're just gonna sit tight and heat fish for a couple weeks yeah yeah go find an Applebee's oh I know fucking Fridays none of that I proposed to my wife in Maui did you really best best times of my life I love it there oh yeah I go to Hawaii every year to bow on oh yeah the night yeah man yeah one tenth of my meat that I eat is from a year comes from Hawaii nice dough it was crazy I will say to anybody listening if you're not married yet keep a nice file two photographs of before y'all had kids cuz I sent my wife a picture of us in Hawaii and it like metered week she's just like everybody feels like that yeah like everybody's like a prisoner yeah yeah so you see how Ellen got in trouble for saying that what did she say she said it's actually a hilarious joke she goes I feel like I'm in prison she goes I've been wearing the same clothes for 10 days everyone's gay that's funny but then people like Ellen needs to be educated about the realities of prison like yeah but also it's just a joke ok this you can't jokes can't coexist with the need to be factual at every turn they can't leave this is not gonna it's yes you're right you're right she should be sensitive about but how do you know that she's not also sensitive about incarceration and look incarceration is fucked up it's fucked up and I don't know what the solution is but I do know that it's not gonna rehabilitate anybody I mean if you get rehabilitated while you're in prison all the people that I know that have been in prison there that's up to you you know they'll offer you classes but you're dealing with so much chaos while you're in there and so much so much danger and so much so much fucked-up shit like if you get rehabilitated because that you're a strong law fuck yeah you're a strong motherfucker but there's people that like one of my favorite examples is Bernard Hopkins Bernard Hopkins who was one of the greatest boxers of all time and also one of the ones who had the longest career of all time I mean at leat world-class level was beaten world-class fighters deep into his 40s yeah fought his last fight I think it was 51 Bernard Hopkins did a stint in jail and when he came out one of the things that the one of the guys in the jail one of the guards said you'll be back mmm and he's like the fuck I will and his discipline was legendary you know he's never wanted to be back the executioner asked so friend of mine Dan and green he did a documentary about it's a group of guys in Philly called the executioner's and it's fascinating documentary and he I think he either took the name or adopted it or whatever but not how comes it from them yeah it was a bunch of cats from you know troubled area but they found boxing and and started having success as the executioner's they would wear the masks in the ring and all of that and no show not kind of like adopted in and well you know he abandoned it later on his career because people are trying to figure out why he's so good this late in life so he became the alien yep so it's bhop alien on instagram you guys like people like how the fuck are you beating the shit out of everybody when you're late for yes yeah he's like I'm an alien yeah who decided the key was just super technical and discipline and never never did dumb things inside the ring just did everything technically and always erred on the side of defense he was his defense was impassable that's how I lived life offstage you know a great example of that is like the difference between Roy Jones jr. in his prime who I think is one of the greatest of all time if not the greatest like Roy Jones jr. in his prime was fuckin untouchable but then when Roy got a little older and a little slower Bernard and him fought twice like they thought once and Roy beat him by decision and they fought later on when Bernard was actually older than Roy and Bernard beat Roy by decision pre decisively because Bernards fundamentals and his technical ability was rock solid whereas Roy never Feldman not I'll say never threw a jab but rarely threw a jab would leap in with a left hook yeah because his left hook was so preposterous like he could get away with crazy shit hands down moving away he's the only fighter on record for compa box that went an entire round of a championship fight without having one punch landed I am to help crazy that is whoa against a world champion against Vinny Pazienza they fought an entire round where Pazienza didn't land one punch fuck I will quit I would if I was Vinny he would never quit Vinny Pazienza would never fucking could he would die before he would quit and he almost did I beat the fuck out of him and when Roy was stopping him Roy dropped him was beating his ass and looked at the referee he was like police stop right and the referee was like keep fighting he's like okay and he went big bang and then put him away but he's like I didn't have to do that right thank you letting him know like this fight is over man this fights over let's stop this Scott lunch man I'm not gonna get the name out one what I did in Chicago too used to be a spot on the north side where on Thursday nights they put a boxing ring on the entire the floor right and when you walk in if you have beef or somebody you could sign up and you and you would go and it was all these like thugs and these gang dudes and whatever try to fight and you were seeing how out of shape people were like in real time like in the ring and then they would always end it with a professional or like an amateur professional you could see you can try to fight him if you want and that's when you would see the importance of fucking technique because you would have all these these dudes who look like they could put in work but man I do what just stand in just jab jab like but it was so solid he would never get tired just just be knocking these dudes and you would all you would stand on a second and if what happens is people start fighting really hard like the first 30 seconds and they got bend it and then throw punches so you could throw lemons at him and it was like a night we would do it every Thursday and go and that's when I that's when I first started getting into oh shit technique is everything like it's every deaf professional would just step up there and just like not be fazed and I'm talking about on the street if you saw any of these guys you would be fucking with that dude right but he knew after 45 seconds they can't it's a rap they're gonna be winded they're gonna be tired and any Suzu next it was amazing to watch and when you talk about that guy didn't land a punch in it God and he's a world champion I mean he's in an elite boxer and just hanging right Jones jr. was Roy Jones jr. when he was at his best was people forget man they get yeah there was an on song which said the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones yeah and people forget there was a time and Roy had a song about it it's called y'all must have forgot to forgot you know what's crazy is that I was just thinking about that in terms of like our business like because my wife and I we were trying to recall an old TV show and we couldn't really figure out the details of it but being in like writers rooms and said you know how much people pined over certain things and arguments happening all this sittings just trying to get a show on the air and then 20 years later like no one remembers like what is so important to us today you know and right it's like it's like they got this Jordan dock coming back on again so people are like oh shit Jordan was this is a new Jordan documentary and followed them for Jordan said you're not gonna like me after this yeah yeah he didn't give a fuck he's like that's who I was that's how you went that's how you win six yeah well I've always said that like greatness and madness our next-door neighbors yeah and they borrow each other's sugar that's my saying put that on a t-shirt that's that's true every great person I've ever met is mad mad cuz in order to get to that place further than anybody goes you you got to be out of your fucking mind and you have to have a drive inside you that's different you gotta be able to sacrifice relationships and public perception and and and even your own well-being yes there's people that get to those points those people are just they're not and maybe it's not a good idea to get to those points because you only live in those points for ten years right and then after that you got to live with yourself yes and it's hard for a lot of people to heal you know who's healed Oh Mike time yes I love him love him love he said you know he's he how he's healed wanna seriously yeah you want to smoke some Mike Tyson weave right now hold on you bullshit but man my kids gonna be like daddy why are you so Mike Tyson yet I do it is amazing say give us that cool gold box over there all if you can see in the corner oh thank you otherwise we which we share their joy tested positive it seems like a bad I tested negative excuse me I'm pot I mean in a good way sorry you tested tested negative I'm sorry I meant like even though you're good seems like in poor form to share a joint is nice mm-hmm weird ugh lighter what happened is lighter Jamie you've been here firing up joints from behind my back thank you sir mm-hmm but Mike Tyson was in his prime the ultimate destroyer and the ultimate a guy who was completely focused only on greatness but then after a while you know after his you know his career was over and he had to settle in and realize who was now he doesn't even like working out and what he said to me was that he goes I don't I don't want to feed my ego mm-hmm he goes if I start working out again I'll start feeding my ego that self-awareness like a muhfucka like that's why I don't have a six-pack [Laughter] don't don't give up your joke but that joke that you do is brilliant it's one of my favorite jokes thank you man yeah man that six-pack joke is genius okay I think I'm gonna release that we got to do something oh and we got to let people know yeah I mean I've been telling people as much as I can you're one of the best comics alive that's a fact you man I gotta tell you man notebooks came out really good Joe I worked my ass off on that shit you'd have been laughing that mean I did stop-motion photography so like the graphics when you'll see I want to do like this paper crumpling a nun crumpling to show like you know names and all that stuff so I want my kids and my first leave I set up stop-motion photography and crumpet - paper - oh wow you did all yourself all myself put it in and then I had a hell of a direct oliver editor matt sylph in big shout out to my man Matt's what are you using to set all that up I have a tripod that leans long cuz I've always I like I like cooking and um I was going to do like food videos but for my family to show them like shit that I'm making I don't want to be on the internet doing it like but I but I do want to so when I make stuff people sometimes think oh how did you do that would you make sure I would challenge down now I will send him pictures and beep son yeah that's right he cooks a lot of things about - what kind of food do you go I would do so I would do I went on this whole bit this whole like I wouldn't make shit so I would make my smoothies are incredible I would make my own almond milk and all that shit and people how do you how are you doing that shit so I would do that and then I would make like my breakfast foods are crazy like my wife loves like I put that together I make shit from scratch because I'm a from scratch like waffles pancakes yeah I could I could table goes in and right now like looking your thing and be like okay you need you know saying I can hook that shit up whatever man whatever and you know whatever it is but at all but I'm I'm big on plating and making it look good it's it so you're chef and disguise and he never cooked any wild game no man no I don't you got out but I just got to see it once and then I'll get so many ideas cuz I guarantee you I could take a recipe that you love and just even like hiding it you'd be like damn I anything over that way okay I'm doing that shit and so I was gonna do sometimes I my wife would take a picture I'll take a picture and like send it to my mom and my mom is like competitive as fuck how'd you do that did you put the thing on the thing and I get it from them they're like they're foodies before it was foodies like my sissy could bite a piece of dessert and be like they didn't you send him in like seal like she can taste that shit and I would watch I grew up watching that so I like doing it so so I basically I bought a tripod before but I was able to use that for the stop-motion photography so I did that for all the lower third titles and all of that stuff and I had to realize that cooking is an art I have I had to change my perceptions and I didn't realize that I had a misconceived idea a misperception I didn't understand that until I watched Anthony Bourdain's TV show the first one No Reservations yeah and when I watched that show and his enthusiasm and passion for four great chefs and great cuisine and I think a lot of it also was like that he was enthusiastic about other people's work yeah and then I was realizing like this okay this guy is not just a chef himself where she was but also like a fan of the art form and so all the great masters like he would go to their places all over the world and and and film with them and eat with them and cook with them and drink with them and then I realized like oh this is a this is an art form that you don't it doesn't last very long and you eat it still an art form yeah but it's an art form it's like like drawing right like your son's 3 when your son draws yes like it's cool to see someone draw something but it's also different than you know whatever Leonardo da Vinci yeah you know whatever some someone who's amazing at it like you go oh there's levels there's many many many many many many many levels even to food there's like some food that's just I'm hungry I just need to eat right but then I guess what happened was civilization got settled into the fact there was enough time which we can getting raided by barbarians and fighting off saber-toothed cats ok ok ok what if I make it pretty like what if I add bit of this everything and then the putting a little fucking balsamic drizzle on it look at that little sprig parsley rosemary yeah yeah look what you did and then they started turning what was like an essential thing into an art experience yeah well because you you eat with all five of your senses right first you you hear it cooking right then you smell it you may know shit is one thing all right then you see it and that's the whole plating of it right what's the other two senses you taste to taste it last yeah see you here what's the other one feel you touch it and you touch it Oh short text touch it and you go and so so it is it's a dance man it's the whole and I love that I love that whole aspect of it for a while I I had gotten into plant-based stuff it's a sea and in so it's like a fun thing when you can basically make versions of your old comfort foods mm-hmm I would be like hey oh I would make stuff without like a specific ingredient like do a substitute thing and it tastes great or look great or whatever it is so so that's it that's the stuff that I was into man hmm but I also like flipping like weed my wife and I did joke about doing us a psycho doctoring it up like we'll just take like it would take I don't know what sake like I don't know canned chili but then slice it up so when you eat it it's like this it could be like a $25 bowl of chili now you know what I mean doctoring stuff up is like my thing too I could take a frozen pizza and do some shit to it and you'd be like you know it's cool to me to that food is so specific to the culture like I went to Thailand for the first time ever last year yeah and you know we actually took a Thai cooking class at this one place and so you got to understand like how they do things like just very little dairy like everything is like coconut milk and these different spices and curries and the way they cook and it's like you're like oh this is so recognizable as opposed like Mexican which is so recognizable to Mexico the Molay and chorizo and all the different styles of creating Mexican food yeah well um for a while I did raw food raw well we did raw food it was fantastic it was the best say bout basically best to ever felt in my life yeah just rock vegetables it's g1z seeds no I didn't do burro meat but but I went down this deep dive I was learning how to make dishes and every meal has four things a fatty acid a salt and the sweet so even if you don't eat raw food I was just like looking at plates like so if you get calamari right the fried and that's the fat you know what I mean and then the salt is obviously the salt and the batter and a salt you put on it the sweet is the dipping sauce but they always give you a lime wedge only why they do that and that's the acid so every meal should have those four components and then you just learn like how you tease the tongue and stuff that you do that like stimulate the tongue and excited and so what I learned when I did the raw food thing is that I don't love barbecue potato chips I love the seasoning that's on this break so you can take anything not anything but you don't I mean something chippy asked in but if you can conjure up those same seasonings I won't miss barbecue bro I will fuck bagger vinegar chips sea salt and vinegar yeah fuck those chips hums got the best ones I've seen I feel like I can't stop yeah like I'm in the trance I'm a vinegar and salt eating trance I'm like barbecue save you like but I would eat anything it's like that shit by itself that's where the sum is equal is way greater than the the sum of the parts the total is weight we because like salt by itself is okay vinegar by itself that's fine chips by themselves vinegar almonds have you had those I'm scared these are my brand watches yeah blue diamond oh yeah he's the shit out of these but I know there's all kinds of spices in here that need right what am i eating this but it's probably look this this is the liven I can't read this without my glasses on but that list of ingredients two men follow me not just almond look at all that shit look at all that shit those are the sriracha almonds which are goddamn delicious yeah but I the first ones a little weird to be corn mouth dextran that's the first ingredient no no I mean like the first one that's a little funny oh it's the almonds vegetable oil sugar salt corn all day yes he sugar is a high number that's not good either yeah really better off raw raw almonds yeah that's what I live with yeah wrong as a dope how many grams of sugar grams how big is a serving though like how many servings oh yeah why do they do surveys like this it says 28 nuts so that's six servings eat six servings metal of grams because I eat six servings a lot of calories too when you find out how many calories are in almonds you're like whoa six grams of protein yeah yeah it's good for you oh but you know it's bad for the fucking environment do you care if you care about the environment you're not supposed to growing a plant here that could never survive without being drowned that's what almonds are these motherfuckers just suck up all those are their whores so they're they're mean they kill all the other plants like fuck you try to make nuts I don't know I'm just kidding but they're drinking all the water he bitches birthday they're like that somebody pointed that out like if you really care about the environment you wouldn't be buying autos from other countries oh yeah like what do you do where's that avocado coming from how's it getting here by truck you're supposed to be eating what's around you and you're supposed to live where shit grows oh that's right right yeah just drove here 500 miles with your food their car to us we are at world hunger if you people live where the food is we got deserts in America - we just don't live it on my asshole yeah do that line alone a lot of our food comes from California yeah yeah the farmland between here and San Francisco is crazy Republican go up there you see these you know anti-abortion bill boards and pro Trump billboards and oh my goodness it's like a different world it's so crazy because it's the world of the people who have to work from fucking dawn till like 7:00 p.m. and then they crash they go back to the farm again they're always trying to keep it together yeah fuck man when it comes to like farmers there's one thing you get a lot of you get a lot of religion and some I'm not it's not a value judgment it's just but you get a lot of religion and you get a lot of Republicans you get a lot of that it's not that common that you get a little far there's certainly some organic farmers that are like real progressive liberal people that understand the importance of growing your own food but like mass farmers like when farmers are growing corn to feed cows like that those kind of farmers it's nothing wrong with that they need them that those fuckers are a lot of those people are Republican you got to wonder like maybe it's just like the party of the people that really bust their ass and they they want that they want that that hard-working farmer ethic is like there's no room for bullshit in that life if you got to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and feed the chickens and milk the cows and then do shit all day long and you're barely paying your bills you don't want to hear any bullshit you don't want to hear any bullshit and so I think a lot of them are Republicans because Republican stands for like there's no bullshit perspective on life that they think the Democrats want to hand out their money and take too much of the taxes but it's because of their reality that's because the reality that's particularly grueling occupation these people have taken on you know it's it's almost like a mistake of perspective you know they don't they don't have opportunity to see things openly like see the whole world and see where their their position is like they have a uniquely difficult position they might think the whole world is like that but it's not necessarily like you just chose something that's a preposterous endeavor I mean I mean that in an admirable way I'm a good miring farmers work ethic if you took a regular person's you or me who's never worked like that ever and say hey Alan you enjoy gonna get up at five o'clock in the morning you gonna feed the chickens and milk today man and you're barely gonna make any money and you're gonna have crazy loans and you're gonna need to accessorized yep no manuals so much depression and suicide and when their farms collapse man it's fucking devastating and there's some people who could do it too some people would do it and they become very successful and then some people do it and love it and swear by it I mean there's a whole spectrum but that that has got to test you and if you think about how crazy that is that that's not more lucrative like what is more valuable to us than our why do we treat them that way exactly it's like what else is more valuable our teachers who are so valuable yes what a fucked up society backwards what why does more about this number one is stay alive that's number one how do you do that you need for folk a the V like food we should take so bad one-percent East's yes this is the thing there's some fruit they literally bring you fruit and you give them paper and you get their fruit and it sustains you but they struggling and then number two is teachers know because once you're here you got to learn something what do you what do we do it our teachers we take them we pay them dog shit we stick them in front of 50 kids barely paying attention and you just hope to make an impact on like I'm sure you have a few teachers like that said a thing yeah at one point time you're like okay like this teachers do make a difference yeah mr. friedenberg you'll never you'll never be able to draw a woman until you've had a woman that's a Bill Withers line wow that sounds like a song yeah mr. friedenberg god damn yeah I had one guy who was a Vietnam vet was a heavy guy he was heavy and he was in middle school when I was in I was in the Mary Curley middle school in Jamaica Jamaica plains which is uh at the time it was a real sketchy neighborhood outside of Boston suburb not a suburb of Boston but you know inner city we moved there from Florida and that was the only place we could afford when I was kid and this is like seventeen year old kids in my seventh grade class was so ridiculous I'm not exaggerating man yeah it was maybe eighth grade I don't forget but there was just one teacher anyway he was a science teacher and he would grow his own radishes and he kept saying like all I need is radishes and salt and that's my lunch and I grew my lunch and I'm not thinking like wow this guy's out there growing his lunch even out here in the city but this is the big thing he said to me he goes you ever want to hurt your head he goes just go outside and look up at space and realize how big it is trying to imagine something that has no end if you really want to hurt your brain just try to imagine that space has no end that fucked me up dude I was like 13 yes like oh my god he's right what there's no end and I swear to God that became a big part of this shift and how I started viewing the world there's like two things that started happening when I was a kid one is that I moved around a lot so I never had friends because I never had friends I had to form my own opinions on things I couldn't just adopt the opinions of the neighborhood I had to form my own opinion so I almost always travel into all these different places and then - was that teacher saying to me that there's no end and I remember thinking that when I was a kid like holy shit and then the two conclusions that I won there are no grown-ups it's not real like I was realizing like I'm gonna one day be one of them what this is nonsense they don't know what their cuz you see enough like faulty behavior in adults you see enough alcoholism like us I saw a lot of alcoholism and drug abuse when I was doing construction my steps I was an architect okay he got me gigs on jobs and construction sites that's what I would do for summer that's how I would make money and you get to be friends with some of these guys and some of them had like real potential like there's just one dude he was a he was a drummer and a music I think mostly just a drummer I think he played guitar two in a band and he was a really funny guy his name was Robbie funny interesting guy but he just struggled with the fucking booze in the bottle and I became friends with him when I was like 16 17 and he was in his 30s man and he couldn't get his shit together he would like do good for a little stretch and then he would fall apart but I remember I liked him so much I was like he's so funny and when he's got his shit together he's he's just a fucking cool guy and then I would see him drunk and I remember thinking that when I was 17 like oz poor guy he's tripping on his own dick he's just fucking his way through the but it was like for me it was important to realize that you could be a guy who was like a funny nice guy that I really like but also do the dumbest things possible and derail your life so I was thinking like what is missing in this guy that he's doing this like why do people keep doing that particularly with things that are just undeniably devastating like hard drugs and things along those lines where you literally could die every night and you're still shooting up like what keeps you doing that and it's like a lack of structure for a lot of them it's a little loud I was thinking that when I was like a lot of them are adrift and some of them it's a chemical thing some of them for sure addiction is they're more inclined chemically but it seemed like some of them was just like a lack of structure and discipline and if they just had rules like here's rule number one you don't shoot heroin into your dick because you're your Smith yeah and this is Smith's don't shoot heroin into the dicks okay all right yeah some people they grew up with parents that didn't lay down any rules man and they never developed they never developed like a line they can't be that farmer yeah those fucking farmers who get up 6 a.m. that knows no bullshit motherfuckers at work hard every day every day and then there's people that just like they barely show up I'm sick today I can't make it in I think of it that way they don't have anything hanging over their head yeah you know especially when you're young Billy Gardell used to say when you're single you're a Democrat no no no no you know when senior they just get a house you're Republican yeah so I want you to own some shit you're gonna want to keep it in this way yeah that's sort of true but that's not always I mean I'm not a Republican um I can't I consider myself left on almost every issue yeah except for maybe the second amendment and this is one where I saw people falter I saw a lot of my liberal friends fall apart I've wanted to come to Joe Joe how do I get a gun oh when it went down Joe calls it wasn't that we disagreed even is it like they never one friend his wife would never let him have a gun and the moment this went down she says you have to get a gun she said to him you have to get a Silurian she turned 180 degrees and this is what I've always say like I think people can go dark on you man the world could get evil the when when scarcity becomes a thing I mean there's a reason why there's so many apocalyptic movies and it never works out great you know these Mad Max movies it's not like that would be way better fish we speared would it's a great idea in theory but you what if you break your leg you want to dive an infection on the beach so how many people hit you up asking a lot like almost probably a dozen close to did you help baby I would say genuinely at least seven or eight it was to know I said listen you you're gonna go down a road Manley I'm not gonna help you get a gun you got to go to a gun store those giant line yeah wait in line bitch go read it read online know how to get a gun like this is I'm not supporting your panic buying of firearms you got to learn how to use it to that's the part that you don't have to learn how to use a gun like I've taken several lessons many many lessons now you you have to learn how to use a gun correctly you have to learn how to yeah I've had rifle lessons of it pistol lessons it's a it's a very dangerous thing to just have around if you don't have any experience with it it's tricky but but the inclination to get one is what I've been telling people about all along like you think the world is safer than it is mmm the world's not that safe it's just safe right now we hit a real good spot man you and I were born in an amazing time how could you imagine we were born in the time where people are getting it together right we're not together all the way but still we're getting it together yeah we're getting it together so in a sense like one of the things you were saying earlier about wanting a woman of color to be vice president here's what that would indicate this is what I think Wow one of the best things but this is what I said the best thing about the Obama presidency and let everybody know okay well this racism is all bullshit because here's a guy who made it to the fucking White House and this is a guy who's articulate and he's brilliant and he's a perfect statesman whether or not you like his policies or not like that's a great representative of who we can be so drop it there's no inferior race it's just people who have an opportunity people who don't and cultures and where they're where they develop in advance and what kind of environment they grow up and we're all one thing we're all one thing true but but the but when one group decides to change the rules and keep moving the goalposts and keep doing so they can keep whatever they have that's everybody in power that's what I'm saying yeah yeah every culture has but in this country it's every job everything everything but in but in this country it you know racism it's not it's not bullshit like this it's not a real thing I mean it's bullshit like it's a dumb thing to still hold on to okay let's be clear here no no thank you for being so calm and correcting if I really thought that stupid no I'm not saying the racism is bullshit I'm saying no it you can't defend it any more there's nothing there there's nothing there oh yeah if you just decide that an individual is in a category because of how much melanin or where they're from that's crazy now that's a something - Joe no one has a stronger work ethic been a racist no one's trying to work ethic than the Jamaican listen to me but no you know how hard these cats work to change the rules in North if they just did half of that the other way everything would be beautiful you understand I'm trying to tell you like you know it's my favorite one what lazy Mexican do you know how crazy that is you see these Mexicans out there picking strawberries for like 13 cents an hour you know I mean how much are they making what do they pay them there's so many automated workers how many people walk here from Mexico how many people rameshan is working on farms and bust their ass doing the hardest jobs possible waiting outside Home Depot to do anything you want them to do that's crazy that's hilarious before that the same thing happened to black folks too though sure the slavery and after slavery but he called us lazy in this like word well that's not the the darkest aspects had never been addressed from slavery's what where you where you start from so if you if there's a community in this there's a community that has definitely been suppressed by racism like there was a guy uh what is woods what's his name the the the Baltimore police detective that we had on Michael woods that's right who was a he was a detective in Baltimore or a police officer in Baltimore I don't was he a detective I don't know who's a police officer anyway he found an old piece of paper that was a detail of like the the crime report and was all the exact same crimes from 1970 something as he was experiencing the exact same place that crazy the exact same crimes and it was like oh shit and for him it was just a relevation like oh this is and then you found out about redlining we all weren't allowed came up with that like seriously like well and 2nded think of the work ethic he took to evil who came up with well people that were trying to suppress people that were freed from slavery right so even imagine right even if you weren't a slave owner if you condone slavery if you were around in 1864 I know I gotta think it's a good thing and then all sudden they let them out you're like oh shit what happened and then they tried to suppress him so they try to keep in it and but we're still experiencing that today now when people talk about like reparations being a good idea or a bad idea the most important thing would be to fix all the spots that we absolutely know were affected by slavering there's not a small number of them there's a large number of them in these communities continue to be in a suppressed state even though they are free they can go out and some of them do escape and they get great careers some people do get out of bad neighborhoods but that you're asking people to do a way more difficult thing then if you growing up in Brentwood and most people talk about you know slavery and now but nobody talks about like the the moment after slavery where they started doing the Black Codes right so so like so you're technically free right but then they would make it illegal for you to hunt and fish for your own food or and then you couldn't look for a job outside of your town like it was like all these things that was basically in it and then they made ordering illegal you know that means yeah it's like if we can get you to jail then we can treat you like a slave again it was like this could you imagine like so you only had to work for one person still I still get paid shitty wages yeah as opposed to I want to work wherever I want to work it's illegal then I'm I won't work I just drove on food you can't do that like and the federal government didn't you know make the states deal with it I'm gonna do a movie about that shit but I don't know if anybody hundred movies should be done you know I got balls deep in in Native American history a couple months back and it freaked me out I I dread I started off with this book that my friend Steve Rinella wrote on American Buffalo and I read that and a lot of it had to do with like Native Americans hunting the Buffalo and then I did read this book Empire the summer moon it was on the Comanches and the holy shit and then I just started getting I read like at least five of them over most of them I listened to well fascinated to them on audio the story stands out to you the most the Comanches yeah bro they ranch it they ranch it all through Texas and Oklahoma they killed everybody they this is how devious people were at the time they would give people giant chunks of land they say you could have a giant truck oh you're in Comanche country so they would give them this land it would go there its slaughter but they would like slowly they were trying to like use them as like human cannon fodder to slowly move the the you know the line of what America owned and push into Comanche country but they it took hundreds of years the Comanches from like the 1600s did the a teachers were dominant they were they were so terrifying they all they ate was buffalo they're wild motherfuckers who didn't hardly create any art they have they figured out horseback riding and they figured out horseback riding better than any of the other Native Americans and they figured out how to shoot arrows off their horses and they figured out how to raise horses so their whole thing was about giant packs of horses and they can conduct all of their fighting off these horses and the the white dudes only had muskets back they had one shot right and then you had a filled up forever and the Comanches figured out there's a dude named Lars Anderson who actually like sort of recreated what they were able to do back then and he's an archery guy and the Comanches would take arrows in between all their fingers and so as they were riding a horse chasing dudes down all the white guys would get off the horses and and bang that's how they fire their rifles the Comanches would shoot from their horses with all their arrows stuck on their fingers they'd go one two three four thunk they could shoot like an arrow a half a second crazy they would hang off the side of the horse and used horses a shield question under its neck as though and they were worthless mass ruthless what they did what they did to other Indians what they did to white settlers and it's all depicted in just dark gory detail were you're like oh my god Dave I mean but you gotta realize what was imagine trying to survive back in Oklahoma 1700 when you just ride around your horse with you got spics that have sharp rocks that you've chipped at the end of them to go kill deer and buffalo and shit and that's what you need to make your baby stay alive and then you get raided by other Indians who want to fuck your woman and take all your shit dude I got so crazy about it I got so crazy about it that I I had I had to take a break all right for a while when I got that painting the painting you saw that's got Greg Overton he's this master the command of American stuff I think that's a crow I actually didn't ask him but somebody else told me look at that this is how these fuckers do it this guy hanging that guy looks like a Mongol but he is he might marry soft in your bellies Paige he might be Native well it might be Danny bellows but it's also the way like all their stuff their hats and their clothing and stuff looks more like Mongolian but the Mongols were famous for being able to do that and that was even before you know anything was recorded about the Native Americans there had to be to be able to do that well their bows their bows would take a hundred and sixty pounds to pull what yeah yeah so you're saying it was like pulling a hundred sixty-five a hundred and sixty pounds yeah to give you an example my bow yeah that I shoot with is 82 pounds it's really hard to poke oh shoot yeah that's like doing that pull-downs exactly it's really hard to talk so use but that is twice as powerful and mine's a compound bow so it's on like these came right so as you pull it it gets easier at the end it's easier to hold there that's hilarious man I just had like what if you made a sound every time you pulled because it's hard like gym noises if you ever see that one is it Planet Fitness don't let you make noises we're not discrimination of all time they mean had discrimination they discriminate against us meatheads yes if I'm lifting bro I'm making noises okay you can't hit that maybe you shouldn't open a fucking gym this is what I do when I'm really trying to get something yes make noises cuz I'm a man this is like alarm drops weights or judges you want people that are gonna quit that's what they want they want people that are gonna buy a membership go there for a month and that's people that are dedicated right dedicated people grunt big grunt they drop weight yeah they feel it they also put pizza on Fridays I've heard oh do they yeah they put pizza out yeah pizza will go is it like like what kind of pizza like pizza like pepperoni and cheese people are you serious so ridiculous what is that uh there's a plant-based crust that's actually actually made pizza crust from scratch it's fun man did solaris misunderstand that you thought i was saying that racism is bullshit doesn't no I just wanted to that's gonna be taken out of context you yeah that's what I'm saying that's why that's why we're back I didn't I just it's a there's it's it's bad for everybody but it's also like it's a part of a pattern of human behavior that's bad and that pattern is lumping people into a category and not accepting the uniqueness of the individual like as soon as you put someone in a cat any kind of category put people in and you don't accept the uniqueness of the individual you create the potential for some sort of tribal difference between each other that wouldn't ordinarily exist like we start thinking of someone as oh this guy from yeah this guy's from this place - this guy's from that place I think of them in this way or they do this so I think of them that way like I'll have a problem in that I have a problem when you go because I think of you that way you you you don't get to do this that's yes big is weird for sure think of me what you want out here but when you just go I don't want anything and you know I was gonna say we still have sir but there's certain like aspects of certain cultures you can't deny think like Italians yeah like I'm mostly Italian and they are the most stereotypical fucking people alive like it's East Coast Italians are exactly like The Sopranos there's just varying levels I was a homo right now was killing it family he could be presidency that's a guy who could be President that's a guy who exhibits all the leadership skill and and understands that this is a terrible thing and sacrifices have to be made and there's mistakes that have been made and we're gonna have to correct those mistakes and do the right thing going forward and we're gonna have to figure out how to get through this and that's the imagine being a guy who's a president or a mayor or a governor who's dealing with this right now like we as much as we shit on all of them we have to we have to respect that they're trying to help us and they're you know I think they're trying to help us this my perspective when I see whether or not I agree that we should be shut down for X amount of months I don't know when we should reopen I'm not an expert I don't know jack-shit but I do appreciate when someone like our governor like seems like a leader and his on television and he's making the choice and he's making a choice based on wanting more people to be able to stay alive yeah I'm all fit I'm off more than or two that's all those things are great for all of us you know but I just I hate the fact that there's Democrats and that there's Republicans I hate it I hate the fact that there's these groups it just leaves open this like I had a friend he's a really nice guy and when we were on this we worked together on the set and he was so into Apple oh so in the Apple products yeah he was talking about when the new Apple laptops comes out we're gonna shove it in Microsoft's face and it was like all this team shit I was like bro you got team shit for the operating system of your computer that's how that's how we are man it doesn't have to be of something that's important because politics are important right the way we treat each other is important policy is important the way the standards of how we accept the leader of this great nation the way communicates all that stuff is important right that is real but it's also to break it down at two sides is so dumb it opens up the possibility for tribalism oh this thing is like fucking iPhone versus Android people already stab each other yeah yes at my son's school they won't they won't let you wear superhero stuff because it can create cliques because if you like I'm DC versus Marvel when I was a comic book head it was all about Marvel Comics versus T I was a Marvel guy my friends for DC guys and they were fucking losers this but that's just a natural part of human beings we have to yeah I have to that will still be like you wear glasses I don't last yeah it's also I'm from Jersey I'm from Boston you know all that shit it's like come on human nature it's it might be cute but to hang on to it if you if you get some benefit out of it if you're proud to be for Brooklyn that's great but you're just a person and this this is the only way to look at each other the only way to look at each other is based on the individual and it's just hard to do it's natural to separate people by political biases by what part of the country they're from it's natural it's fucking it's a part but we don't have to do it anymore we don't have to it's a trap there's a trap that Rob's you of your active and it lumps you in with a bunch of other assholes you know like there's some women that like all girl power doubt you know like listen there's a lot of girls that are amazing but there's a lot of girls that will you don't want them on your team you know bad shit you know what Casey Anthony on your team let's just stop this all girl all boys shit let's stop all left alright it's all fucking nonsense and we we haven't figured it out yet for some reason we're still dependent upon two parties we're still dependent about amount two philosophies conservative or liberal different parts of the country oh these are red states like oh Christ when I was a kid it's a fucking trap it's all a trap it's trouble - what's the alternative though moron that's the thing like so what's the what's the alternative I think multiple parties I believe Holland doesn't Holland have like seven political parties or some shit was that working out well they have legal weed or they tolerated weed long for us used to be able to buy mushrooms at cafes oh shit why did I stop I think people start tripping too hard I do mushrooms or time went on his dues couch no give them that platform that's a rough that's crazy but so that's another example of like what do you do like because people are so people are so not that's my only question like when when atheists say you shouldn't believe in God even that he was right like you can't yeah I know you're right you you can't tell people what to believe the the the thing about atheism versus religion is like what is the overall benefit do you if you get an overall benefit out of believing in a higher power and it forces you to act in a more harmonious way so you sure that's not good because there's a lot of religious people that because of those religious principles they live very ethical and moral lives so is it an overall net benefit for them to be involved in a religion it seems like there's an argument that it could be but then is there also an argument for being objective about some of those stories that seem crazy like guys coming back from the dead and walking on water and yeah when I went to Notre Dame we had it we all had to take theology class and we had a nun who told us that everything in the Bible is a symbol it was a symbol someone is owed they're just saying it no one lived to be a hundred that just means what they have to say is important like 72 virgins do you know that idea of when you blow yourself up yeah it's not doesn't really really simple yes it means like a million version psycho I would say I get a hundred million billion yeah it's a lot it's saying that that's an important yes yeah I'm foot important belief or tenant and that resonate I understood that and um so that's how I perceive it as far as like it's not a literal thing which kind of makes it kind of cool you know you know just as an artistic choice cuz like oh cuz like in notebooks some people were upset that I did some I will go to black and white and then go to color but the reason for doing that is whenever we talked about the past we would go to black and white in like a dream exactly I just made that choice and because initially I wanted it to all be in black and white but we just we just did it as a running gun thing so we weren't thinking about the lighting and making sure was and so when we looked at the color footage like some of it was all over the place - it was like let's do the black and white for the past thing so it was yeah because while the correction is also like expensive so it was like let's try to keep the cost down as well so that's why that was the choice so if you go back you know smoke one and watch it again you'll see whenever we talk about anything in the past it's all black it's black and white back in the color when its present dude what's it gonna be like going onstage and you haven't gone on stage in a month oh my god I was just thinking how weird is that gonna be everybody gonna see him like open my curds what's the longest stretch you've ever gone without to instruct can't even I that's a damn oh I know I can tell you eight months but it was one was really early I bombed so hard a must but it called me back and I went back up tray I was 19 I was 19 and didn't excel in on our stage I was 20 and I was funny again and it was back in oh good and that was my that was my I wanna get off again if it for eight months but as but as a professional the longest I've ever gone I couldn't I would say I would be lying if I tried to think of I don't know because I those shows are gonna be lets do you know crazy the common stores gonna be when this motherfucker opens up again do you know how crazy it's gonna be it's gonna be crazy I broke my phone basically from the text on wind calm I told I was gonna try that out man it was good shit though and so I it still exists I've talked to those people all the time and it's been great beautiful castle hike yeah it's pretty powerful one guy told me the other day he uses my clips to help the morale of his troops and they're like floored me like woah yeah man and I've been sending them like I sent them notebooks first and so they got to see it they got to see the trailer first and I was getting feedback and stuff it was cool people think it's a robot is really mean that's nice but yeah it was dope it worked out thank you beautiful it set up some dates and then I know yeah well we talked about ask me what are you coming here with Joe you come here yeah we're gonna do some hopefully when we're allowed to I have a couple dates booked at the end of the year I don't even know if they're gonna be able to do them I'm supposed to be at the forum and November 1st yeah I don't know I want to do that when we I don't even know if it's real it's down the street but I think that the governor has said 2021 for concerts and shit that make sense I don't know and they say it might be like maybe people separated I'm gonna be so mad if all you need is vitamin C I know right he's so mad doctor comes out like ten years from now it's like if everybody took just four thousand milligrams of vitamin C it day that's all you need there's no viruses and you good 4,000 grams of vitamin C and don't be a dick I don't know what stops it like what what can strengthen your immune system and what can't you know do you know yeah is that real well as an expert I would say I would say I don't know about your immune system because that's kind of like your pelvis like you can't strengthen a shit it's just immune system oh yeah oh yes I think you're strengthened by you can strengthen your pelvis like the bones themselves do that fuck exercise strengthen your pelvis listen if she's 150 yeah but if she's like 380 yeah that's too bad I can't do it she's got to give up sugar and carbs right I think you're sending the immune system by what you put in your body especially over 40 I think um like when I was doing raw food I didn't get sick at all at all why'd you stop got social socially it's tough no forgot being sick when boys were teasing me like yo it take you 48 hours to make a pancakes I still have it hydrate fruit and stuff for my kids but did you have to when you were doing that did you have to in any way like supplement your protein were you eating like pee no because that's the myth that's the whole thing is it's all what you choose to believe about protein but they were like you can get protein from greens so yes I was certainly can so that was that no you can get protein from you just don't get the same amount no but then there's a question of like how much protein do you really need that's the big debate yeah big debate yeah it's kind of like what bacon the member when bacon was like dying and then they somebody came up with me make it like you have to have it on burgers and it did didn't it so what they did then bacon like K Maggie well they were people weren't really messing with it then ate well people thought bacon was bad for you for a long time bats were bad for you and so like the idea of having bacon is delicious but it's gonna kill you like you're gonna have a heart attack choking on that piece of bacon everybody thought that um there was a that dr. Shaun Baker had that carnivore MD guy he he wrote something about a study there was there something about a study that was released on people who don't eat meat in the correlation between mental disorders and their issues in sadness there's some I don't know if I might have made part of that up but there's something about it like people who just who don't eat meat that have some mental issues say you take on do you find that Jamie the stress of the it wasn't bro I'm just talking about science where people eat and what people believe are very personal things right oh yeah right and politics you wanna clear a room yeah right and that crazy but the eat part is recent is recent right everybody ate everything vegan up until 30 years ago everybody everything yeah well but that's because I believe we didn't have to we had a smaller population so to stretch it you don't know like the milk my mom drank is not the same milk they'll be drinking so because you gotta feed more people more people that drinking milk so that's part of it for sure another part of is they want to make more money yes they want to be able to make more milk be able to pump it out quicker pump it out quicker I'm gonna tell you man class mice to drive all over the country I never saw two cows fuckin ever I always see cows don't see him fucking and everybody eating I was like that can't all be calm and came out making enough on the most ridiculous science like I drove by never saw anybody fuckin it's not real really hurt the flatten that's nice planet to me yes meat and mental health a systemic review of absent ation depression anxiety and related phobias so what'd you think yeah okay the majority studies especially if higher-quality studies show that those who avoided meat consumption had significantly higher rates or risk of depression anxiety and or self-harm behaviors there was mixed evidence for temporal relations but study designs and a lack of rigor precluded inferences of casual relations yeah one study does not support meat avoidance as a strategy to benefit psychological health well yeah because our study room you beat you said you beat yourself up you have you do feel guilty if you ever live a little a whole life of eating meat and then you try not to eat meat and then you go then you go crazy no I don't know I was doing a whole crazy part but I get you feeling guilty in it's tough to change your diet yeah is is not eating that way is not supported it's starting to get more supported but eating raw you mean that's not nobody really says that but like eating vegan yeah vegan the whole vegan industry to be on meat world and it's nice the way they f PS made a P protein like all of that stuff is like like the stock went through the roof yeah yeah the thing the thing that freaks me out the most about the animal kingdom is not just that we are able to justify stuffing as many as we can into a warehouse and yeah and making them shit on top of each other and then eating them and that that's just one crazy thing about it the other crazy thing about it is what they do to each other yeah man I'm I'm obsessed with wildlife videos like wild my videos were animals are eating every day every day I watch a cheetah take out some kind of a gazelle or a crocodile ate someone's dog I watched the other day in Australia the dog pulled up on this foot these people are screaming at the top of their lungs and the crocodile gets their dogs snap and just drag them into the water and they are fucking screaming and crying I am fascinated by those fascinates you about this thing well it's what we're doing it's fucked up for sure yeah but what they're doing each other's fucked up too it's just a different kind of fucked up they're fucked up is instantaneous right if you need an animal they find it they bite it with their face they dragon in the water you didn't swallow it and that's their fucked up and we just kind of accept that as a part of nature right our fucked up is weird our fucked up is we've figured out metal and boxes and we figured out cages when we've stuffed that chicken in this fucking little box and make them shit on the other chicken and we figured it out we figured out how to do whatever the fuck we want if you want eggs for a dollar a dozen that's what it's gonna take in order for this company to make any fucking money so they just they figured out how to do it you know when I saw this video it's sort of really making sense to me I saw this video of baboons that were raising puppies yeah bro it's crazy these these baboons that steal these dogs and then keep these puppies they keep them near by the camp because the puppies will bark whenever things are coming close so they feed them they keep them nearby and they basically have pets so these baboons this crazy video these babies was just grabbing this puppy by it's like they're rough with them you know they don't have any idea of compassion right so they don't give a fuck they're banging this puppy off rocks and shit dragging them behind him and then just set him the puppy's like trying to get away and just like sit the fuck down and he gives them some food and the baboons just hanging out with this puppy and then raises it and then uses these dogs that they stole to guard the perimeter yes yeah so aminals do we like why didn't it just eat the puppy right no because it wanted a pet animals do weird shit too like the the with their there's just a bunch of systems that are trying to compete against other systems like the cysts the deer system versus the mountain lion system the deer system is we just got to keep fucking and keep moving big things and if they fuck too much and there's too many of them and now that we're done we gotta just keep fucking and keep moving and the mountain lion system is everyday I gotta kill a deer with my face right every day I got a fine one I got a sneak up and get close enough this fast ass thing with swords growing out of his head to grab them by the neck and drag them down into the woods these systems they're all horrific outcomes right predator and prey systems there all of them are horrific all of them are horrific is just a new kind of horrific we also like outlive all those oh yeah live the fuck out them so we no real guilt yeah you kill someone when you're four do you really even understand what you just did right and your life expectancy is seven right four-year-old lion has probably killed a million things tiger thing did you watch it [Music] another time not during a quarantine I need it to be okay for me to like enjoy it but it seemed hilarious cuz they were open up but with the with the call saying that that ladies you're gonna want to prosecute that lady out yeah all right just it's just wore me out man way to way out yeah it wore me out so I thinking when happier times I'll totally be hauled in today I'm serious like I literally it's in my queue I'm going back it's just it's a good show for the apocalypse yeah yeah yeah yeah because it represents the folly of human beings what we could be at our most preposterous you know I mean gay guy who raises Tiger very straight guys the algae method shoot guns one guy accidentally shoots himself in the head the other guy decides that he's not gay what but this is madness that is a wild ass show of real people and you you really couldn't make something like that fake you maybe like the Coen brothers could do it you know the old brother where art thou type deal think you kind of make it kind of create somebody like Joe exciting but it's almost like better because it's real it's better yeah she's better if it was you but I couldn't happen yeah and the other guy who runs the sex cult and and then Carol and her husband our husbands dressed up with a rope around his neck he went missing I hate it I hate this guy we miss it no big deal I mean definitely didn't do it something she feeds me to cats every fucking day he was worth millions whatever whatever Carol fucking basket yeah god damn what a show do you think you could marry somebody whose first husband oh my god sign up for that well the kind of guy that would be into that there's some guys that would be into that they're similar to like girls who like get into serial killers oh right there's girls that are really they they like email serial killers and they're in love with them they want to marry him after the court oh yeah like right like no EPROM out there I think there's a weird obsession with this it's a small percentage of the people after I've got high and thought about this yes I think it has to doing about it for the first time now would I with back in the day if you were a murderer if you were like and if you could befriend a murderer like you would you would be more protected oh that's interesting yeah is you know someone has done it before they won't talk out of something we need well that's what women are I think a lot of women are really terrified of is if confronted with the real adversity how will their man hold up if you're a woman you ain't 90 pounds and you have a husband that's twice your size like literally a hundred and eighty pounds normal that happens all the time but if he's a bitch and he folds and you're like left they're like oh my god like no one's gonna stop anything from happening me or stop anything we're saying rude things to me and five you're not protected and this mean people out there right if you're a woman you stumble into some mean people that are saying rude lurid shit to you no one's there to protect you and you got to walk back to your car and you're wondering holy fuck I get no that sounds like a fun game show did you marry a bitches husband because a lot of divorces we just dudes out there that don't even know that they're bitches cuz they haven't really been tested they don't know and I think most people believe they're gonna do way better than they will in real times of struggle I think most people believe they're gonna do way better than they actually will because we actually boxing ring in the club but that's a different thing right that's like a guy with technique yeah if you got a guy would technique in front of you and you know not a boxer fuck you got like a few seconds to get lucky as you charge and maybe might clinch and throw a punch two cracks and hurt them it's possibly be maybe it's more likely gonna get boxed up yeah yeah and jiu-jitsu is even worse and jiu-jitsu it's a hundred percent because there's no lucky shots you can't break a bone practicing yeah I broke my foot my rib my hand my nose is destroyed yeah I broke my nose so many times that my nose was useless it was useless it didn't work I only had like one quarter of one nostril that was open and I had a nasally tone to be I didn't realize I was listening to and watching an old fear factor once other than my horrifying choice of wardrobe and inescapable accent that I still had I was doing how nasally my voice was because I couldn't breathe out of my nose it was useless broke so rib I had two ACL surgeries both knees that's that's it though that's not too bad when you if you do like jujitsu ins particularly like most people just accept the fact that there's a possibility of injury it's like it could happen you could go a year without getting injured or right it's not like going and taking a yoga class we pretty safe it's too much random wild shits happened and why people are trying to kill each other I was gonna set up what you did see you'd be great at it would I be so big how tall you six five long ass arms do you choke the fuck out of people all the leverage yeah yeah the leverage from your arms and your legs would be so spectacular how would it transform me as a human being oh you would lose a lot of weight and you a shit ton of confidence yeah you just have to go about it very technically they think that I when I started I was I was younger and dumber okay and I went at it like aggressively like I went at other martial arts when I was younger I just want to do them as hard as I could as fast I could what jujitsu really it's about technique and the more strength you have one of the problems is you could substitute technique for that strength like the best jujitsu players the guys to learn from the best are the guys were small humans they're smaller people like 80 Bravo is a smaller guy it's when the reasons is such a great instructor Hoyer Gracie is another of famous super technical jujitsu guy was a smaller guy there's like a series of guys like that all over the country and Jeff Glover's another one these smaller guys because they're smaller they have to rely on this spectacular technique so you learn from them so you never really want to rely on your strength it's it's it it'll stop you from getting better and in fact it'll stop you from achieving like the perfect the right technical level so you just keep getting better and better at it and then when you get to a certain point like if you're gonna fight with a guy like a while fighting a guy if a guy just knows how to throw a punch and he's fast and he's a strong guy he might punch you and he might fuck you up it might happen it can happen whenever you're throwing knuckles with people especially in a chaotic environment it's it's possible here's what's not possible I don't care who you if you don't know how to grapple at all and someone like hoist Gracie clinches you and drags you to the ground you're a fuck's Ville your fucks Ville 100% of the times 100 one zero zero your fucks Ville your fucks Ville he's gonna choke you a hundred percent one and he'll do that to people that know jiu-jitsu so when you get to a point like a guy like Hicks and Gracie or my instructor John Jacques Machado he can do that to people that are experts in jiu-jitsu so there's like so many levels it's a crazy thing to learn and you're built for it man being so tall and long yeah also you're a smart dude who like you say you like economics he's like figure well if this happens and that yeah yeah jiu-jitsu is just like that yeah Hellsing Gracie was another famous jiu-jitsu practitioner he was asked to describe jiu-jitsu any slide I'm on a paraphrase this I might fuck it up he said he said it was basically like I move and then you move and then I move and then you move forever forever description so if you realize how good helsing is that it becomes a terrifying expression because it's like eventually I'm gonna get you bitch yes fuck up you're gonna get tired you're gonna be using too much strength and you're gonna get exhausted just like those boxers so we're throwing punches and they get tired and the other guy would piece them up but it's gonna be even more horrific because you're never gonna be able to accomplish anything you're just gonna slowly wear out you guys just gonna keep attacking you and you keep pushing them off you and he's gonna keep attacking you and you keep exploding and he's gonna keep attacking it and eventually and then he's just gonna dominate you he's just gonna control you you'd be great at it dude it'd be good for you yeah it'd be really good for you all right what I have to be in there with kids when I first act here's how strong jujitsu is there was a woman named she still exists name's Felicia oh she's a friend of mine she's a black belt from jean-jacques Machado's she's super technical and she weighs Felicia's very strong which weighs about maybe 135 pounds and there was a guy named Seymour butts - Seymour butts with the porn star who had a TV show on Showtime and he had this idea pretty bold of him really he's brave to do this you just decided I'm gonna do like a jujitsu match well I've never taken jujitsu before but I'm gonna spar with a woman and see what happens and this girl just fucked she but she it was she's a leet man she's really good she good yeah she teaches people yeah she also works for the California State Athletic Commission so I get to see her at UFC events often times in there in California she's awesome but she's super technical so this guy has he was doomed he just didn't know he was a guy he's in really good shape he's young and fit and pretty good body just joking leglock at home and I don't know what she did do I remember how many times she tapped him or what she did it with but it was like arm bars and triangles but again that would happen to any man who didn't know anything and went with her so even though she's a woman yeah just the technical expertise it overcomes strength it's so for a guy like you who's a very cerebral person who's like these sort of puzzles and figures things out it's one of the reasons why your comedy is so good you're an excellent at like economy of words and setting things up in a mysterious way and then dropping punch eyes that's jiu-jitsu it's they're similar I like that I think there's a lot of things like that in this life they're similar yeah there's little things that you you learn like little ways to move around things that advance through these these games and systems and you can apply that to all these other different things and you could apply a team into comedy yeah that's what I was I was just thinking like we were talking about another approach but that's that's that's what I got from notebooks to just how everybody approaches we have the same goal to make somebody laugh but we approach it differently yeah something that's so enticing to me like how everyone approaches the craft in their own way I was super awkward when I first started out because I didn't have any background really in anything performing arts related or even music yeah you know so I was super awkward and how to how to present myself and how to dress and you know how to act in yeah yeah because people who have knowledge of that they do have a different level of execution yeah and and and like I know people who can sing they say things in like a more memorable way like just remember it but they're not technically trying to sing yeah you know like you remember their phrases or their hooks or whatever it is you know because this is like a musicality to their performance you just you know that's a thing you figure out - yeah is that it's not just and this is something with podcasts I think as well it's not just the words it there's something to how you say the words and some people are not good at that so you don't think of it as being an important part of the kind of ignore it because you're concentrating on writing or you're concentrating on whatever your look but there's a there's a thing in how you say the word that gets into people's brains better yes then if you're clunky you know and you I've been clunky we've all been clunky when you listen to old recordings you know there's moments we like what's it's a lot of times because you're trying to figure out the best way to do it on the spot in real life and that shit takes especially with a complicated bit it should take a long time to work out the details especially with yeah yeah the more personal you are - yeah but when you get it I don't want to say this bit either your bit your bit about your son fucking it's one of those bits where you just go god dammit when someone builds a beautiful house you just go oh shit look at that Wow we got to do something with it man when when when everything gets rolling again I think we all need to realize like hey you can't wait for shit no cuz this can happen now that we know that this could happen he doesn't even feel real here we are we know it's real right we know it's real we know you just got an antibody test we know we can't really go anywhere we can't go to restaurants everything's closed no comedy we know it's real but it still doesn't feel real doesn't feel real that's how weird life is yeah in the moment baby you don't know what's next you don't know what snacks in the moment in the moment welcome to in the moment with Owen and Joe welcome says through fundings please contact website fronted a moment into the moment there's a that's a style of radio that you would get I was when I was delivering newspapers I would listen to all things King was all things - yeah he was something on NPR and National Public Radio and they were so calm yeah the way they were talk yeah it was so calm I don't know if was All Things Considered if I listen to that later I feel like that was way later but it was a whatever it's it whatever those old school I talk radio that's what I knew I was ready to get married when I like listen in the talk radio what I want to hear people talk I'm ready for a wife bro nobody gets more riled up than white dudes who listen to conservative talk radio those Michael Savage fans those kind of guys Rush Limbaugh let's think about how that happened like how did that room how did that one genre yeah that hardcore right-wing like did that go real angry it's like angry oh it's like oh yeah yeah yeah it's like a genre of music like you know how there's like hardcore rap yeah there's metal yeah you know there's like this right-wing talk yeah it's like yes right it kind of is and let me talk to like energy are here welcome welcome to our show yeah we're gonna tell you about a new scientific experiment that shows that there are no such thing as genders their right wing to gender is a construct yeah there's a way that they talk there's a calmness to the way they explain things and lay things out that make you seem like there's no I'm beg you to ambiguity there's no question whether or not they're right yeah and here's why and then they always has for money yes coronavirus did not come from a lab it's a dangerous conspiracy and here's what's why we talked to and they always have an expert are you sure I like it man I'm coming I'm into it I feel good I'm into because I grew up listening to my favorite is like hip-hop stations cuz they're always very excited right put your hands up like all right and I love that energy too but then you get to age like I just wanted some people just talking just to talk normal voice yeah she's talk normal quiet I want to fuck you voice yeah that's what that really is I want to fuck you voice but I'm I'm low-key about it hello yes hello yes I love wine I would do if I had to so MPI would you do it what I do I be guest you know purposely do like an onion version of NPR I love it because I I'm a sucker I'm all in all animals are equal yeah oh we've talked to some animals yes we feel like they're all equal I do want to do a parody of of an NPR show because they because now they plays like dramatic music and shit when they tell stories like and you'll be listening to it and then I'm like in then no no I'm confusing with the daily radio lab and NPR show was radio lab put together by NPR Daily Show made a dramatic music oh yeah and then Whitney just told me about the daily she said she's posted so he's great here are three things you need to know what's likely WNYC WNYC was the fake radio station of news radio yeah me too when I was when that news radios had come New York Public Radio so national public mmm it's so tiny and PR but it's something like that it's some kind of public rated cousins yeah that's that's a great show you're listening radio lab no holy shit I said I get angry at Bryan Callen cuz he would tell me something as if he had liked gotten it from a book you gotta go bitch I listened to that same radio lab hit me with some scientific facts about what happened in World War two I go I listen to radio lab to bitch stop damn it yeah I know Brian why you pretending right / to be smart I say read and I really mean listen right yeah I was wondering I was gonna ask you that can you say that technically I do a lie it's a lie it's a dirty lie in there I read this book I never cracked the fucking page this is the book on Charles Manson the CIA this guy Tom O'Neill yeah yeah I had him on the podcast last week bro this guy spent 20 years researching this book 20 years 20 it's it's the craziest story just of how the book are created but the story itself is bonkers they think that Charles Manson was a CIA asset and that they had let him get away with being released from parole being he was on parole and he got arrested just let him out of jail like multiple times and they had this the same LSD studies they were running Haight Ashbury in San Francisco he went to that same clinic the people that did mind-control that there were a part of MKULTRA that were feeding people LSD and trying to control their mind I manipulate their psychology they're all connected to him and they kept letting him go they want they were studying him they wanted to see they wanted to diminish the hippie movement and they want to study what it's like when you get some fucking madman who's spent half of his life in penitentiary and you give my ton of LSD and then him fuck all the hippies he wants holy shit dude it's a nutty book man oh it was not T and he details at all like stuff there's more than 50 pages of references at the end of this book citations and references Zhou likes heavily documented it's crazy is it gonna be a movie that one fuck you up Jamie that would fuck a listing to the book I'm chapter 2:11 12 I just got there all the MKULTRA stuff she is crazy it's crazy did you get through the one where he was discussing about the guy who they think they fed LSD to and programmed him to go kill that kid oh did you get to that one he talked about it on the podcast I might have been I might be right there yeah fuck dude that's crazy they did all kinds of experiments on people in the 60s and 70s they just tried shit on people man we were showing a video of these British soldiers from 1964 yeah but they gave acid to and they just let them run around the field with fucking guns and they're laughing and falling down and giggling shit you can watch the video there's a video it's online the fuck would a sit I have yeah I mean but I'm not taking it with a gun no with a bunch of other troops no not only that like you're relying on those guys to keep it together on how good is this Mike Tyson weed is amazing this is the stone Owen Smith look at you I know maybe it's legal it's legal when we're in California oh my god oh no tell me you're not breaking the law it's the same as having whiskey isn't it funny it's like the whiskey part no problem soon as you bust out the weed like wow they do it really good it's really good so what's your estimation when we're gonna get out of this you gotta guess next year next year because nothing is gonna be out and then the resurgence mm-hmm be a second wave yeah yeah next year I feel like this time next year that dude who said we have all been vaccinated there what's that mean I wish I knew was he talking him I wish I knew he was joking around or not I mean he might have been yeah I'm pretty adamant that he wasn't but I'm an idiot he might've been joking around it didn't sound like he was getting around it something he had a command of it in it didn't sound like he was joking around but I don't know that dude's personality right that might be that thing that he does you know I mean like countin does a lot of that Hey sake jokes that sound like statements it does not all the time you know he's a funny I mean you know like you said though too because like what's next you know is there gonna be a gap between what this is it was next yeah um provided that there is nothing next I feel like next year just because we even know how they're talking about how you can go to concerts but just you're up six six feet apart right and that's not gonna stop about the end of this year that's gonna be something that you know unless they do come up with a vaccine or some sort of a really really efficient treatment right like some sort of statement yeah and and but I do think it I mean they're hinting at saying it helps if you're healthier if you do work out and all the things that we as a collective society should have been doing right may start to take precedence so but I feel like as far as what our livelihood is concerned about performing in front of people again I feel like next year because it's two-sided it's us wanting to be on stage and in the audience for the safe being in Jesus that something is wrong next year I think how many people are gonna fall apart how are Comets gonna make a living a guys who are doing the road like metal acts that's a great question I know man like we don't know yet right now everybody's sort of floating right yeah it's been a month and everybody's like whoa yeah everyone's just sort of floating like what what happens those people that were they had a system they were doing good then all sudden the rug gets pulled out from under them I do have some answers what they need to do brother Joe yeah I think they sector checking it you can I don't know man people that have you ever been contacted about doing anything online being funny online those things are preposterous I don't I want to donate I'll give you money right I know they're trying to raise money I'll just give you money clusterfuck I'd love to do a show once we were back I'll do shows for free I'd be happy to do that yeah be happy to do a bunch of shows I want to be eight as well as like donate I heard yeah I'd love to be able to if someone had a problem I'd love to be able to sell out the comedy story yeah give them that money yeah it's a nice feeling too cuz there shows that you do where you it benefits people there's an extra nice feeling so you get the nice feeling of the show yeah doing your bits the bits make everybody laugh yeah oh that nice feeling and then you get the nice feeling of that all went to a good thing feels great man charity shows like my favorite shows because of this the way they make you feel yeah like this is cool we all got together made some money for this charity and had fun and then it helps the money goes to a good cause yeah we should do a lot of those men I'm down I'm down to do them all the time yeah we should do them I should probably probably figure out one to do a week once we get cracking again yeah and just do one a week that's just a benefit for for something we'll figure something out yeah the day I could sell out something off my name that's not gonna be far as soon as people see ya you're in a weird position man well you have this incredible act but people don't know it's it's a sneaky thing because once you pop the hardest part it's being funny like you've got that yeah it's like you just spent so much time writing you know yeah well you spend so much time where you're in the machine and not just fully dedicated different out there as a comic what if somebody wants to but if the network wants to pick up notebooks should I do it oh should I stay on YouTube if they want to give you money do it okay it's like there's enough money but you could definitely do whatever you want if it's on YouTube and it should probably make some money once people become more aware of it people start downloading a lot of them too funny man it's like it's also everybody's got something yeah from when they started and everyone cash and it's good for people to see that you know people that you see with like our full Netflix special now at one point time were terrible garbage but that's how you get better at it you got to keep doing it and there's no other way around it that's one of the things that I like about it is in a lot of ways comedies a real meritocracy yes like if people laugh if they enjoy your stuff absolutely then it works and then it continues and you keep people keep coming to your shows and you keep having fun yeah there's a reward to that kind of a thing especially when you don't have any collaborators just putting it together yourself yeah but now we'll appreciate it more yeah that's very true I appreciate it I just hope that clubs will be here when everything said and done you know that's the real scary thing is how many of these businesses are gonna go under exists yeah yeah well plan on doing a lot of free shows all right let's run man always brother always yeah Oh Owen Smith TV on subscribe it shows
