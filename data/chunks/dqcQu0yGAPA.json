do-do-do-do-do three-two-one ladies and gentlemen Owen Benjamin how are you brother good thanks for having me thanks for coming here man I appreciate it we were just talking about kind of being outside of the the bubble of the big cities and yeah I'm living in a nice calm place you know like all now yeah like there's jeans oh that's the move man it's the move cuz you could visit you could visit this crazy fucked-up place yeah that's what that's why when you are when you asked me to do this I was like yeah I'm excited to visit LA and then I'll go back to like you know my brother and my family and a mountain in a lake yeah that's the way to do it if you could do it that way that's the way to do it yeah see it's like there's some real benefits to living in a city but there's also some real benefits to being outside of it I think that you could figure out some sort of 50/50 thing like you're doing like visit and then bolt that's the move yeah it's also kind of altruistic like 3,000 people like I'd go back and forth between here and there and I'm like if someone dies like everyone ships in if they can't afford it like that's it it works so well in small groups yeah you know and then the bigger the group the more it gets a little dicey it's a totally different way of living I feel like living in a small group is you know as long as it's a good group yeah stuck with a bad group and that's a real issue - some crazy meth heads that live down the street and they like to shoot things up in the middle of the night well that's part of your little small group and again I delivered papers to those guys when I was a kid did you do the car thing or the bike thing bike and walk oh yeah someone stole my bike so I like to walk him see develop some serious fucking core muscles carrying around all those newspapers do you have a wagon or just do the bag thing no I I did the bag thing I used to carry my dog is strong dude yeah for real if you think about that like people put sandbags on or weight vests on rather and they do all kinds of exercises and it's like 40 pounds well if you're like an adult 40 pounds is like a good amount of weight to do like chin ups and push ups and stuff with a weight vest on yeah if you're a kid yeah how old were you 9 to 13 dude think how weak you are when you're 9 and someone's strapping down newspapers on you yeah that was chubby too I bet it made you strong as fuck it definitely helped me get into puberty yeah for sure and also how it's like people do that for exercise you know like farmers walks you ever seen farm oh yeah totally they put like a bar bum barbar bell Kings Hill work put a dumbbell in each hand and just walk or kettlebell and just carry it just walk just carry the weight of the world it also makes you emotionally strong to like benign and like have to knock on a door like a pimp Wow bring me a dollar that's right you got to collect I was always a giant issue collection yeah I only had a couple people that had to collect from by the time that I had started delivering newspapers they figured out how to do like these withdrawals from people's accounts like you know they would pay for it in advance yeah somehow they like get it like a bank account withdrawal or something I didn't have to build them that was my point right but a couple people I didn't you have these little tan envelopes you'd have to leave the tan towel and they put the money in the envelope it was so weird so it was all so outdated yeah it was it was like 19th century newspaper delivery and also like ah if someone said they left it and and you know that they didn't like someone else took it and then we put it on a 9 year old it was like it was intense to have to argue them down and be like now you do have to pay me I have overhead you know I got my own guys and there's here's a little tip for people I don't I don't want to be that dick but if someone asks if you put the newspaper inside their door you kind of have to do it you gotta do it that's a real drag if you're driving because if you're driving what you want to do is you want to just shuck that sucker down the either the pathway or in the driveway and keep moving boom you've got a lot of newspapers son keep moving keep moving if you gotta get business volume business you know and there'd be like you know well we'll take care of you on Christmas I'm like - that's not there's no way it can be worth it it's like way more it's cold out I gotta get out of the car I gotta carry it I gotta go all the way up your walkway open your door that shit takes time if you had to do that with every house it'd be impossible impossible and also cuz the winners and we didn't have plastic you know I was in a very outdated system you didn't have plastic for the bags now whoa that's amazing that doesn't even make sense no it was it was a badly run newspaper we had plastic sometimes but sometimes we just had rubber bands like there was a like it depend on the weather he didn't always have plastic but then they moved to plastic like later New York Times always had plastic and it was blue I took a New York Times route just because there was extra prestige and delivering the New York Times in my mind that's hilarious no I'm not USA Today anymore bro well I knew this guy who's really smart who also delivered newspapers he was like a whole community of people that delivered newspapers business one dot one guy I remember this dude he's very very smart guy he was a music composer and he drove a Hyundai he was explaining to me how much engineering in time the the the South Korea have gone into before they created this automobile yeah believe me he's like these will be so reliable like if Koreans are gonna put out a car it's gonna be the shit like they are not gonna fuck it up and this dude delivered newspapers and he'd had the New York Times it's part of a sophisticated guy he's into classical music he knows a lot about North Korea's relation see yeah I didn't know shit I was like well how does this guy know so much yeah I just knew like dinosaurs and sharks like I would just constantly read about dinosaurs I got good name every dinosaur but I didn't know anything about the New York Times did you see that new one that they found the Titanic Soros no that sounds incredible fuck yeah it does I took me back to being 12 again I was like yes what an awesome name yeah Janis or yeah that would like explain it to my friends and almost take it like it made me big yeah like this this it's so big like eight cars could fit in it oh it would be like whoa I think they said it something like eight elephants something crazy like that yeah it's gigantic it's the biggest dinosaur they've ever discovered and I feel like they discovered it within the last decade look at the size of this motherfucker Jamie brick can you rewind that to the very beginning where you see the full body video really oh wow sighs this fucking thing newly named speech is the largest mammal animal rather to ever walk the earth the titanosaur fossil was discovered in Argentina in 2013 am I saying it right titanosaur scientists use tri-dimensional reconstruction to measure the mass fucking thing God meat meat or veggie help me uh veggie we're so lucky I think it'd still be around yeah what it would win every fight estimated it's his heaviest 12 elephants or a full Boeing 737 jesus fucking oh that's unreal the skeleton at the American Museum of Natural History in New York is so large dot dot dot well what is that it's head sticks out oh shit this is everything it's like a just a too big of a dick do you think duck dicks back then were just like 20 feet long duct xpres duck dicks today can be like 9 inches long for like a little tiny duck wasn't that the deal like andrea's Antonopoulos he he thought for some reason it was like three feet long and he had me really super psyched change it's still pretty big it's not quite 3 feet long but what a crazy little scenario the Ducks have yeah dead like duck dick per body ounce must be like massive massive like a thigh Yeah right like you got an literally had another thigh cuz it cause like the female duck has two vaginas over that's the party pussy well they use the less like big dick and aside like to let you in at every turn yeah it's a labyrinth yeah it's and that's why the duck dick is like this weird curlicue apparatus type thing and the length because it's like that the little tiny factors will affect the next generation so like one duck had like a slightly longer windier Weiner they could like manage the magenta and there was this like really weird discussion this really weird scientific discussion about ducks and whether all Ducks sex was rape and how big I was in on that one but they were trying to determine but like coming from some of me who has chickens and I've get to see these animals behavior and other birds that I've watched in my neighborhood I posted a picture on Instagram recently of a hawk there's a hawk war going on in my neighborhood Wow Hawks are killing Hawks and they kill them and they they cut their heads off and then they eat parts their body I'm pretty sure it's Hawks doing it because one of my neighbors saw a hawk eating another Hawk like a baby hawk and nest whoa yeah so they think that somehow none of these Hawks he's young juvenile Hawks are fighting to try to take over this area so it's that's like gang stuff dude it is gang stuff one of them came swooping into my chicken coop the other day slammed into the cage outside the kitchen coup like the door was shot but it slammed into it like it was trying to get in to get the chicken so I was like whoa this dude is bold as fuck I got an owl in my hood trying to get my chickens to you yeah are scary owls are terrifying like they could take out a dog they're a big animal man people fucked up with owls with those goddamn movies making them the wise old cute thing flying terror they're just out there testing lollipops and you know and dude when you see one in real life you're like oh you're a fucking dinosaur oh my god damn flying talent covered dinosaurs yeah they took out a few of my chickens I got I got pretty pests I'm sure they did I'm sure they did you know what man I am thinking in my neighborhood that someone used some sort of rodent pesticide interest oh I really think that happened because I was reading about this that some owls wind up dying because in coyotes as well because they'll eat rodents that were infected by this road and with this road and pesticide yeah his poison they give four rats just rat poison and animals eat the rats and then they get it and die off and they were talking about owls in specific work really important for taking control of a population of rodents yeah that's sweet next to we just don't think of what they are man they are flying murderers we just we made them something you ya know like when you live in the woods it's you're confirmed with that constantly it really is a raccoon oh sketch like raccoons can in their intelligence level like my brother had to kill one with that pitchfork recently oh Jesus Christ yeah I was trying to kill chickens oh yeah no they'll open like locks and stuff like they have like fingers and hands dude there was one in my neighborhood and he was coming towards the chicken coop at night and the chickens were going crazy is it at late at night and I shone the flashlight on him and he started walking towards it oh man I was like fuck this fuck this I'm out of here man and there's sound or scream is nuts I'll fuck that I want to hear a raccoon scream I saw guardians of the galaxy that little dude was the scariest guy yeah the little raccoon with the guns and smart he was smart as fuck you see - have you seen - yet did I cry it on the plane watching it sweetie no I got a really cry much in life but every now and then like some big archetypal movie will just grab me they can get you especially once you're a parent you know they're yeah yeah you watch much more fun a boat what is that a duck dick we're looking at a duck dick right there how is that even real force copulation male ducks are notorious for a tempting forced copulation with females so females seem to have involved vaginas to make it hard for a male duck to actually inseminate them if they don't want to by forcing it towards the dead ends while they have dead ends they have like trapdoors of course male ducks haven't taken this line down the more forced copulation a duck engages in the longer the male's penis is tend to be according to a 2010 study whoa so their dicks get longer the more they rape I wonder if the female duck like laughs a letter like when the rapey dogs like man and she's like man cuz you like sent him the wrong way maybe this quote in fact male ducks grow a new penis every year whoa which means they can vary the length depending on that year's competition holy shit you imagine if your dick fell off every year like elk antler's and every year crew back like for like months nobody had sex and everybody was cool with each other and we're like can't we just be like this all the time like imagine if there was just like we had a season there's half maybe that's our problem we're such gluttons we should have a breeding season we should have a season where literally our dick falls off grows back it grows back look if you could re-engineer people to have like a three month period like a pistol slap offseason slap a little off season yeah you know where there's no genders there's no male there's no female no nothing everybody dick falls off and everybody just shows out for a little bit doesn't think about anything but just life existential shit yeah rental property yeah think about like going to the beach more like why don't I go to the beach more I always enjoy it feels good when I'm there and then the dick size and shape will tell you what the year is to come you know it's like it's a 15 inch here we got some serious war ahead of us got problems yeah because like chimp saw chimp ball size is directly proportionate to the amount of sluts that are near them whoa that's the thing with primates for some reason there was some correlation between promiscuous females and like women having sex with more than one I mean in a derogatory term it's just like scientifically they were saying that women who are having sex with more more males those males grew bigger dicks and bigger balls sperm competition yeah like literally their balls got bigger I think that was like provable I don't know if that dick is provable people feel weird about study index they do you know and there's so much like there's so many great stories if you study addition but if like you're a dick doctor people like hey why that stall into the Hawks for years that's what I prefer to call them it's the correct nomenclature you know everyone wants to say penis would my daddy was a cock doctor his daddy was a cock doctor we've always been studying it seems so important yet everyone's so ashamed have you read sperm wars you know what no I did not but I think that's been disproven there was a study that they did where they could not recreate the idea that some sperm actually attacked sperm and killed them they couldn't they she couldn't show that there was real differentiation in cells like there were cells that have the ability to go on kid other sperm they were saying that that was more theoretical than anything in the guy who originally wrote it might've liked leap to a conclusion I can see that obviously I don't know shit but this is just what I had read was that like scientifically it doesn't really jive but what does jive is with with primates this idea that the more females are round the more you grow more balls and you grow like bigger loads I'm sure that we about load size do you think they measure load size though how they gonna like hold on chimp before you come yeah come over here a little fella why'd you pull out and come on this trip over here yeah how would you be able to tell how would you able to study chimp load size they probably just surround him with a bunch of slutty champs and then one brave dude just has to jerk him off no one's that brave yes because chimps will just rip your face out plus they know that a hand job is not the best thing like we can do better than this yeah with a big ole scientist man hand yeah they're like start sucking and you're not gonna get a sample yeah if it's a lady scientist you can't let a lady scientist go in there jerk off a chimp because that's like some sort of prostitution almost right so we'd have to be a dude either way the chimps gonna fuck you up he wants to beat the shit out of you why are you jerking them off yeah that would just be such a weird beating black guy I was jerking off at champ and he freaked out yeah if he feels vulnerable at all like you're going too hard just like I get vulnerable with handjobs yeah did you imagine if you like hurt a chimps dick I mean it's not like you guys are communicating in English or anything right you're just jerking them off and you look at him like hey buddy it's gonna be good you gonna come so hard and then like maybe you fucked up you're like maybe he likes it rough and you kill him a couple of hard shakes yeah and he just beat you to a pulp yeah because you keep hitting his balls and you don't realize it well just grabbing his dick in a way that he's not comfortable with anymore it's like I don't trust you anymore so before your movements were soft and sensual and they seemed like controlled now I can't get on my dick it's like I got an agenda about this hand job yeah and I think to a chimp like any kind of violent display like that that's like some sort of dominance display yeah when a chimp takes a stick and starts banging it on another stick their balls get big and they just start punching that's how it happens do balls get big with violence that's a good question that's a real good question I wonder if there's a correlation between violence and how much sexual intercourse they have because like the bonobos have the most sex yeah but they have the least violence right I wonder if that's just because that's just who they are well they're they're weird they're they don't like they don't do a lot of the shit that regular chimps do now and the females will just it's like it's it's a really funny nature Channel and it's like yeah we have a male being angry and then it's like and then like five chicks of you like just start fucking them and then it's like now he's asleep in the banana leaves war has been averted for thousands of years you have they figured it out just have a big ol fuck party every day just drain balls and in pussies as well you just keep everybody calm everybody fucks everybody everyone's fucking yeah cuz then you think it might be your kid too so you have to like protect all the kids they have rules the only rule is a mother will not have sex with a son that's a salad rule it's the only one though guys fuck their daughters it's weird it's weird the the whole thing is um it's they have a strange like system in that regard like this is the one taboo that this incredibly promiscuous culture I guess you can call them a culture yeah species has they're fascinating man because there's so much like regular chimps but they're not violent at all hardly they like make some noise and shit but they don't do much yeah it almost like perfectly splits our psyches as humans dude we all have championed bonobo on us well just knowing that that's possible - yeah like that what what we are is just sort of like quite you know even like what we are as a culture it's just sort of kind of like worked into this spot and that's what it is you know like what what we are it didn't have to work out this way you know it could have worked out some other really weird way like forms that you see around me we could be dolphins they think dolphins are smart as us they think it's entirely possible that without the context of our culture like our ability to display intelligence through tests and math and building things engineering without any ability to display that we don't really know how smart they actually are we just assume that the social intelligence they have is not as valuable right the intelligence is involved in creating things but they have a cerebral cortex it's 40 percent larger than a person's that's intense yeah it's intense yeah it's all our yeah all our tests are based on what we value yeah exactly exactly what we appreciate I'm sure there's some other tests that they do and they know there's some really complex language that they have that they don't they can't decipher they still haven't figured out what the fuck they're saying they know that there's dialects they know there's dialects and they know that dolphins can understand a lot of the things that we tell them but they they don't exactly know what the fuck they're saying that's for sure they've never broken it down like to remember in Close Encounters yeah do you like oh there's a whole language here Oh see you know they tried to figure out what the language was there they've been studying dolphin language for ever and they're like who knows what the fuck they're saying dolphins blow my mind dude they're smart but they also do some fucked up shit too they do yeah a lot of infanticide sex slaves yeah they kill babies mmm it's a real common thing like it is in all nature unfortunately males killed the babies of you know if it's not his kids yeah find a woman you kill her babies it's really crazy that that's that's the code of native some hair another like that was the way to do it like like somehow or another of all the years of these things trying to improve to get to the position they're at now to be the most sturdy the most viable the most complex the most the most able to figure out a way to survive after all that one of the options for one of the smartest things on a planet is eat baby's gonna eat the babies of other dudes you have to like a race to the bottom of morality for efficiency on now on because it's like it's you can see how quickly that works you know your genes go theirs don't but it's like so disturbing here's the thing do you think that there's a massive I mean there's got to be a massive massive advantage and being able to physically record things that people have learned and to be able to wreak create them in the way that only we can like as much as we can say that dolphins are intelligent and I'm sure they are and they might their brains might work better than ours who the fuck knows but our brains we have this weird ability to manipulate things on dry land and that means we figured out electricity that means we figured out electronics that fit we've figured out electronic storage and shit like this the internet Twitter Instagram yeah instantaneous access to information about stuff like that's changing everything yes most like a life form it's unreal cuz we can act out things in the abstract and not actually have to do them and then create something bigger yeah but I'm not sure we're smarter I think collectively we are but like as individuals like dolphin literally might be like a more potent mind than ours yeah well pigeons are have incredible abilities that we don't have really yeah they can go like five six thousand miles to the same spot without a map or all right Lee those homing pigeons yeah the what are they using like magnetic fields what are they using like the morning now I mean that to me is I so intense you know Nikola Tesla was in love with the pigeon oh yeah I heard that on this show actually you're talking about that yeah that's hilarious that guy was yeah you couldn't make money on any of his own shit though all he could do is just love that pigeon well he was just so SuperDuper off-the-charts smart yeah but I think he had a tremendous difficulty in interacting with regular people you know and this guy just wasn't the best businessman in the world he was just a super genius inventor that's what he was crazy though massively massively would be the word eccentric yeah I think there's a level of intelligence where you start almost becoming destructive hmm you know it's like that funny bot on South South Park murmur was like the greatest joke in the world is to kill everyone and say awkward well it's like if you do the math of stakes of jokes and then like the like all the math of it it could get real dark you know and that's kind of like some people are so smart they're like why wouldn't I love a pigeon it can go 5,000 miles you know and you're like they don't have that thing that tells them just that's weird yeah well he didn't care anymore I think he loved the pigeon more than he loved people and it might not have been like a romantic love might have been like some spiritual thing you ever see that there's one photo of him that's so iconic it's Nikola Tesla sitting in front of a pair of Tesla coils he's got his legs crossed and he looks like the master of the universe he literally looks like a character in a Marvel comic book yeah that guy was a wizard like a literal wizard you know I mean look at this guy look at this motherfucker he's sitting there reading shit he's sitting there with his legs crossed and this crazy electrical thing is going on and that's behind him and that's the guy that would fall in love with a pigeon yeah it's like if that I got what like in his mind he's like yeah I'll just make all these crazy sparks with my brain and read a book and then just love a pigeon can you imagine what it must be like to be a guy as smart as that like clearly like a next-level intellect like there's like us as normal folks and then there's these like super genius like you know like a LeBron James of thinking like Jesus Christ what the fuck how's he doing that and that's what that guy was imagine being that guy and just seeing all these things that haven't been figured out yet how come you guys haven't done this it must be so frustrating I'm not doing this how many have electricity just in the air you wanted a fucking pump it electricity in the air where you would get it for free like the radio that must be like being around drunk people all the time like being that smart around normal people it's like being sober at a bar and I've ever be like dude on my penis and you're like what's wrong with you and that's probably Tesla with like us he's like oh you can't just make the sparks it's a very good way to describe it it's a very good way to describe it yeah that's probably exactly what's going on I've talked to a bunch of like really really smart people and at the time doing this podcast and then off podcast one of the my favorite examples is John Carmack do you know is he's like this super genius coder who wrote the 3d engine for its software I guess he'd like to be like the lead programmer or something for its software I'm one of the founders yeah like quake and doom and all those 3d games I can't vented those things it's unreal and every time I talk to him I'm like I'm barely your species barely same species his brain is firing so hard and so fast you're like wow I'm such an ape I can see that on Twitter with Sam Harris sometimes and sometimes he'll come back and I'm like I got to read like nine books to even get that Sam stupid smart it's like crazy smart yeah he's very smart very smart there's a lot of people like that man and they'll they'll give you a real reality check if you think you're smart you think you're an exceptional mind my wife masters in a structural engineering and we and so a lot of my buddies are super conspiracies 9/11 truther know do they prove that a building can't fall that way hey I've just calm we just goes but I'm they oh she's like I know how the structure of buildings work and she wasn't saying it maliciously she was like trying to be like no but I'm they write silly and they're still you know it could still be a thing I'm not saying it isn't true I'm just saying it like she was saying it is possible for a building to fall directly on top of itself it's also saying well you know that whole Tower 7 thing is so fascinating because that's the one thing where everybody points to when it comes to 9/11 now what a lot of people don't know is that there's a longer video when you watch the thing collapse it absolutely looks like a controlled demolition and the problem with that is if you're not an actual engineer and you don't really know how they built that building it was unusual like if you don't really know enough about it like there's a lot of things that I kind of know about but I don't really like if I if I someone had it if I had to explain a double-clutch transmission in like a BMW I think I could half-ass it but if there was someone right next to me that knew that really knew about it they would go without fuck are you talking about you know yeah like the half-truths confidence can be hilarious oh yeah we gotta be real careful with that shit it's like listen I've read BuzzFeed there's knowledge balls without because that's what's getting a little infuriating with me now is a lot of the things being debated I actually know a ton about and like like I was a World War two history major like who lived in the Czech Republic studying authoritarian governments and stuff and like oh so like I mean I'm not like an expert expert like you sometimes you have people on the to actually read books about puns yeah we're about so when they just get the most basic things about everyone's a Nazi this is not it and then because then you can't point out the actual Nazis and you know just how it and everyone thinks that it's left-wing right-wing but it's really not like like right-wing dystopia would be like Mad Max like there's no government at all you know and left is communist or you know socialist fascism it's just like the government is everything yeah you know what man um the Scott I thought the need for everything to be conspiracy is a real problem it's a real problem for a lot of people the need to know that they're right about things is a real problem you know the the not admitting that you don't really know part is a problem because until you until I'm absolutely certain that what you're saying like I have to know what I'm talking to you if you say I'm absolutely 100% positive that if I light this paper on fire it will burn 100% if this is regular paper and I have a regular fire I'm on two percent positive I have to if you I have to hear you say if I have to know that that's how you really are operating so if you're telling me it's a hundred percent that Kennedy's driver shot him dude it's a hundred percent you watch the video it's a hundred percent Kennedy's driver Shana or any any kind of crazy conspiracy like that as soon as you say you know for sure it's like god damn man know for sure that it wasn't a plane and hit the Pentagon you know for sure how do you know for sure right I agree with you completely you can't know for sure and if everyone agrees like I always get freaked out when like everybody agrees on everything I feel like I'm in a cult yeah it gets it gets super cultic yeah volts on both sides as being a skeptical person like there's a lot of people that are skeptics that they'll look at things even like Operation Northwoods and they'll be like well that just did no big deal if they were planning on killing Americans they were gonna armed cuban friendlies and have them attack want Onam obey they were trying to get us to go to war with Cuba and they were gonna manipulate us they were gonna blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on Cuba so we'd be outraged we want to go over and kick you his ass we cost who knows countless thousands of American lives for sure because we're you know you're talking about 1961 or 2 or whatever it was when they went kennedy vetoed this shit it's signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff they were really gonna do this like anybody who doesn't look at that and get disturb this is from the Freedom of Information Act that's not a conspiracy the problem with the really wacky conspiracies like you know Kennedy's driver shot em or you know that go as deep as you want yeah the really wacky ones distract from the real ones they mask it it makes it so nothing means anything like Alex Jones saying something fucking crazy today like there's Jewish actors pretending to be Nazis in Charlottesville like these guys had tattoos of swastikas on their chest that's not a fucking not Jewish person because you're not supposed to get tattooed right it's not a fucking actor once you tattoo a swastika on your chest that you're not acting anymore right you've committed to a team Jesus like that that's like one of the biggest steps that can possibly think of as a human being yeah is to go to a tattoo parlor and be like give me the fucking craziest one I saw this gay flag Nazi things I'm gonna try to take the the swastika back that's like from a bit that I had in like 2014 about camo I was talking about those duck dynasty guys oh they kept talking shit about gay people I'm like dude they're gonna take over camo they'll fuck with you and there's just every gay porno from now on takes place in camo SiC trucker hats they get away from like truckers being like we're fucking great and then a minute later they're like I'm not Justin Bieber I just like Miller Lite yeah the idea was that every porno film ever made would be made in a duck blind that's Jamie that fucking genius and everything would all start out with this way man is a Gaius black guy you could ever find going something about duck on make me whole that's a white dude comes in on chains and drops to his knees start sucking this day yeah that's their own camo oh because then they can't just do it without like having it apologize to people and be like dude we're not into all that shit my point was like it started like they took over the rainbow they could take over that too they can take over camo they can take over everything light yeah light sticks it's like you know most most people just have it's like already environmental it's like all you get green right it's like oh it's like we want all the fucking colors to get like a southern accent immediately what do you think the gay rainbow thing has done to the Leprechaun industry they think they got gold they found a gay bar in the middle of Ireland like for thousands of years it was sort of a friend in the park or the end of the rainbow because the culturally appropriated it from the leprechaun they culturally appropriate from the leprechauns and fucking owned it owned it like to tip owns cotton swabs owned owned it in a period of like what 10 20 years all colors they owned the rainbow the whole rainbow right if you think about when when the fuck was the rainbow first discovered long time ago long time ago when was the first leprechaun story the pot of gold that's probably hundreds of years of leprechauns being associated with rainbows right and now it's just dude sucking dudes one day it just became it it just turned and that's a hard turn to from like oh it's sunny and rainy at the same time oh now it's gay it's just also taking all the colors that just fight like you know gun control this is the orange color and it's the stake they get all of them you know what's interesting it's when you think about like men women like in a straight culture like straight men straight women I wonder if there's more violence with straight men and straight women than there are with gay men like gay community so I wonder if it's like per capita if the gay communities have less violence that we really fascinating to me there's more males together and less violence versus males and females together I feel like there's two effects happening simultaneously like it could make it go down or up cuz it's like you're always drained balls cuz they're dudes gay dudes are costly there's no one around to say no right blowjob car ride had yeah you know and then but then the flip side is you're doubling the amount of testosterone and crazy and like yeah if you get into a fight with your you know partner and and there's nothing saying like but you can't hit women you beat the fuck out of each other it's real bad totally dudes in a backyard brawl after they but fucked and fucking during the fight I just get hot yeah you bitch you bitch dude I bet lesbians don't fight much hmm that's a good joke that seems like a sexist thing to say Owen Benjamin yeah I can't wait to just call you out because it's like so quick so sexist then you bet you have like a good point and you're clearly not hateful and then they're just like so like what do we do now it's like the kids state my head when you're like no you double men and then you're gonna get dudes who love working out and like you know real estate I wouldn't if that's the case though I wonder cuz well I just guessed about the statistics what do you think they would be let's look them up but before we do that what do you think there'd be do you think they'd be less violence in the gay community I think there would that's my good as far as domestic violence like partner violence in general violence committed to hurt I'm gonna say less violence I'm gonna say less violence less violence Jamie what have we got I'm trying to find it all I found so far it most of it was about hate crime so digging okay that's the problem because they get victimized by people outside of their community I found one that says there's a study that suggests that same-sex relationships suffer higher levels of domestic violence and heterosexual interesting that's just like a study so mmm what was it by like Christian workshop it's on the BBC violence more common in same-sex relationships well you know what I don't know it didn't say how much that's domestic violence get more in common like less arguing right it's like maybe not though domestic violence is a weird word right it's like it's extra creepy violence because it's violence against someone you care about yeah you're near them and you you lose your temper to the point where you're enacting violence on someone at least at one point your life you probably loved you know right now all right now you want to get violent with them like physically violent so dangerous why don't you get a cop walking into that shit I can't imagine especially when you can't arrest a guy and like you're like this chicks gonna die eventually fuck that's some heavy heavy shit fuck that's another reason why I think it's it's so like it's such worse violence because you always in my head I'm like it's a dude beating a woman you know yeah even though the other way does happen but you just don't really I don't know I don't know man it's all fucked up it's like just the the fact that people can fall apart so bad they get to the point where at one point in time they love this first and like this first was probably like super important to them yeah and now you want to kill them you want to stab them you want to beat them up you want to hit them in the head with something like woof woof you're off the tracks yeah cuz kinda comes from the word kin like you're supposed to love your can you know that working kind yeah again yeah hmm that makes sense yeah you treat kinfolk kinfolk that fuck did kind bud come from kind bud yeah that was always like the weird hippie thing like that was one of the surefire ways we didn't want to get high with somebody if they offered you some kind bud hey man yeah listen bro we're gonna have a conversation about astrology that I really can't have right now do an astrology combo I'm fuck and tired and I don't want your nonsense I don't want to hear about your you Chandler I don't want to hear about your spiritual adviser no no no yeah it kind is nonsense talk do door opener kind bud kind bud it's kind bud man we had good weed and not good we like is okay it's pretty good it's mid grade mid grade if you were like a connoisseur you would say these are mids meds mids yeah we just had weed yeah and you just like from like 1997 on it's just been space weed that is crazy from the moment I started smoking weed it's been space weed here like the star death death experience I have a Joey Diaz was sorry about that that felt like mushrooms like it felt closer to mushrooms and it did weed in my mind I explained it in the Polish short podcast I explained too much but I was explaining one more time when you eat marijuana its processed by your liver and it produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolite yeah it's way more put like four to five times more psychoactive than THC and it does it's a totally different feel like it feels like a cycle like a psychedelic drug yeah like a really potent one to look especially if you go to per deep it gets really weird especially when you lie down with your eyes closed if you get like that you're really freaking out one thing that can kind of bring you out of it that you can if you can enjoy this yes go somewhere dark and close your eyes and like if you're really freaking out on weed I bet there is a light show for you to watch like it'll be like for me one of the things that I remember like consistently I would see neon cartoons having sex like neon looking old school goofy old school Mickey Mouse cartoons with a-movin weird but they were made out of neon and they're having sex with each other and creating more and they were like like like branching off like some sort of a fractal it was fucking crazy neon sex fractal has to be the name of your next it was like I was seeing it all in front of me in 3d to like I was on some Disney ride it was happening all around me he was I was like this is crazy this is just weed and it's crazy when you make the jump where you realize someone's showing you something versus you imagining something oh yeah well you're like oh I'm just watching something else versus like picture a helicopter there it is but it's just like holy shit this is something I've never seen before and I don't know who's showing it to me yeah there's something going on and there to deny it is really interesting because it's I think it's another one of those things much like what people want to talk about I know for a fact something was a conspiracy they also want to say I know for a fact that this is a hallucination and that's all it is I know for a fact that this is just chemicals interacting with your mind yeah but your whole life is chemicals you mean your mind is like constantly processing different chemicals whether it's adrenaline or whatever it is with different emotions there's a lot of different things going on chemically in your body all the time and then there's the big one which is when your eyes shut and you go to sleep and then you imagine a bunch of shit happening it's not really happening yeah like whole civilizations have been built on like the reverence for what you're talking about it's not like there's definitely something going on there easily could be something going on there could be different frequencies that our normal biology is tuned in to a very specific frequency and when something's off it could be that they're not picking it up like maybe that's one of the things about schizophrenics right they have these issues with their brain chemistry maybe they're tuning in to a totally different world than us maybe their world is like the fucking Dark City remember that movie with Keefe or something yeah yeah everything is fucking everybody's got like four foot long fingers and they fucking creeping around corners maybe in their world everything's like completely fucked because they're tuned in with their their own brain chemistry literally they're interacting with the universe around them it's such a different way that like their world is dark and scary and ugly and twisted yeah it's like a filter like when I learned about Dark Matter like I lost all hubris that I know anything like that 70% of the universe is this thing that we can't see or feel or measure anywhere and we have no idea what it is I was like yeah I don't fucking know about tower 7 man a lot of that too good way to describe it there was something really recently about dark matter where they were saying that they think that dark matter is stored inside black holes Steven find that so what the fuck's a black hole do you even get that that one isn't that one's a mind bender like what what's happening out there there's some infinitely dense point and everything is getting sucked into it and it's eating it but it's eating planets yeah fuck did you just say it's instant but to the thing it's eternity so there's something out there that's eating planets dark matter is dark matter less lumpy than predicted that sounds racial it could be racial yeah or at least gender specific that's that's not gender specific if dark matter was a person what pronoun would it use ah man that's an intense one zero sir sir I'm sorry say it but you could say zero two you could say whatever you want it's just made up I mean there's gonna be a rule around how to say it but yeah it's like when it comes to gender stuff see that's when I stop that's when I have a little bit of an opinion where I'm like there are man in there or women yeah but there's also a spectrum right I mean there's women that want to fight in MMA and they want to race cars and then there's men who want to be florists yeah but I feel like that's gender role spectrum like my dad is like a really flamboyant opera singing like he's real fruity yeah and my mom is like six foot love sports sweatpants when our crushes and it's like what my mom is such a great woman and my dad's such a great dad and that's why sometimes you know in my piano teacher got a sex change when I was 11 so like oh I've been thinking about this stuff for quite some time where I got to see the same person on different hormones as my you know and I'm a classical piano player right this is one of most important people in my life so I'm still friends with and it's like to see like you know transition you're like oh dudes are way different just the way the behavior change oh yeah totally when it comes to like you know justjust like what you're focusing on your level of patience well he transition for two she she yeah and I know on Halloween and I was like trying to we're gonna build on Halloween while it started work on a bit about that's like the best time to like make that hard turn because people think it's a costume and then by Thanksgiving everyone's like oh this is real like if someone like steve-o did it right you'd be like look this is I know what you're doing you're not getting me with this yeah this camp would take forever who would not be accepted it would take like months before people knew it wasn't just a gag they're like yeah it's a five-year gag like Tom Green that seems like something Tom Green could you know like almost get away with people like no god dammit you ever seen a Tom Green show it's what he does yeah it's like with us I'm boys with the Impractical Jokers and I'm always wondering like if one of them like really needs help in public because everyone gonna be like it's al it's good point you know cuz people will assume you're doing a joke and you're like no but I'm not joking that's a real good point because if you choke on something holy shit dude that's a fucking good point Wow yes like a movie man well it's a plot for a movie - no way bro so right now like this could be like a big film man I'm feeling it but I think it's gonna change the world practical joker goes out and has a life-threatening illness yeah and then doesn't get rescued and because that realizes that practical jokes are wrong that's the moral Mazzara yeah what else is there Ashton Kutcher you gotta have a cool black friend of course practical joker has the cool black friend yeah she keeps it real but is relatable she have a gay neighbor or no I think everyone has to be gay something has dad all right no they all have a gay dick ah once like every year like murmur talking about you get the new dick get a new one every now and that every eight dicks is gay ooh so you really see know about the community oh like every eight ones you count them off like a very specific number yeah magic people like did do that and then you came back gay that year damn this year came back gay bro my first time he betrayed all 30 years yeah man all 30 years that's crazy that's a good run it's a good run today I'm looking forward to getting ripped I'm just hoping it's a seasonal thing you know my uncle was gay for a year he had three gay Dixon Road lost his wife girl it's not funny man yeah my first gay dick where would that be that we would have a whole different attitude goddamn all these uh all these bigots that have problem with gay people that wouldn't exist that's again Dale has to go away for a year he's got roller skate time he'll come back and be hateful again you know there be kids in school bro let me tell you something knowing my family's ever got a gay dude I'm not getting a gay dick bro it's like the guy was like losing a little bit of hair when he's in high school listen to me bro my fucking hair is fine yeah no one in my family's ever lost her hair overcompensate guy there's no gay dicks in my bloodline dude it's all straight guys listen no one in my family's a serial killer okay like they start revealing shit myself like whatever you're insecure about you like secretly are ooh hmm well sometimes I feel like I'll find myself hating on a group of people and I'm like I'm like something about me is that or else I wouldn't care you know like hipsters I remember I always I always hated him I called him indoor cats and uh and then I realized that hating hipster itself is a hipster move Oh totally where I'm like no dude I was like that before hipsters and I'm like holy fuck a hipster would say that I could have easily been a hipster if they caught me look I could have been a Scientology if I didn't know better yeah you know I mean I just would have walked into the wrong door took one in personality test and go man maybe I could get my shit together these people yeah maybe I could be on while these crazy wacky levels yeah it's the same thing I could be a hipster I could have a weird mustache twisty mustache yeah it's like what Jordan beers and talks about the shadow self I could be like really into like micro beers yeah I could live out my life in 1820 in Austin Texas I do it really tight jeans and tell everyone I'm a photographer because I have an Instagram account three hundred dollars yeah and they all have those those shoes do you know those uncomfortable looking like Italian looking shoes yeah it's like a cobbler hipster cobbler but there's something kind of cool about it too right now like those shoes right there those are totally hipster shoes Jam you nailed it you goddamn nailed it that's the perfect shooter for hipster yeah I think well low-cut one would be like a little bit more hipster II maybe maybe I'm wrong oh that's a hipster shoe if I've ever seen one good lord I'm too hard turns in my life away from wearing those shoes right now that's really called a hipster it's a John Varvatos star us a hipster chukka boot it's a chuck of boot I didn't even know there was a thing until now Chuck aboot what's the chukka boot isn't it weird when you see two K's next to each other it like makes you think it's racist totally it is now you can't do that anymore this should change this immediately I'm triggered i'm so triggered everybody should be look who got real problems in this country it's not a joke anymore yeah that charlottesville thing that that just showed everybody when you saw those guys walking down the street with those citronella Home Depot torches I was like this is the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life screaming white lives matter crazy like you know who said best man I have a great quote Sturgill Simpson sent me this because he had an email exchange with dr. Rick Strassman who's the guy that wrote this DMT two-spirit molecule yeah and they had an email exchange he said for starters I would say this is Rick Strassman saying this that what we're seeing is a failure of the educational system this is due to faults within the system itself as well as attacks on the system that system from outside by forces and institutions that gain to benefit from ignorance in addiction both religious faith and the love of community have degenerated into crude parodies of what they're capable of being regarding where this is all heading he says my Zen teacher used to say that the force of good this is what we're was really interesting the forces of good relative to the forces of evil evil are always around fifty point one percent versus forty nine point nine percent there's a simulant similar notion in Judaism along these lines that the future of the world depends upon single individuals actions and I think it says something like a paradoxical like we are a speck of dust and the fate of the universe hinges on us wow that that quote right there we are a speck of dust and in in quotes the fate of the universe hinges on us that when I read that today I was like holy shit like that's so true yeah you see this right now like what's going on with Charlottesville and what's going on with the way Trump is reacting to it all and the way people reacting to it all like people are digging in their heels and forming sides and this is any group any group that wouldn't think that this is completely insane and totally out of control like any group of people they wouldn't think that someone driving a car into a group of protesters just randomly yeah running over a girl any group that wouldn't denounce that instantaneously as one of the most heinous things ever this is exactly what we're terrified of we see happening in Paris and in other parts of the world and here we have an American doing it and our differentiation is not even that you know we're we're being attacked well the way we're looking at it in terms of it's white people and white nationalists versus an tyfa right we're not even looking at it like we're all Americans we're not even looking at it like we're all on the same team we're we're literally home growing terrorism that's a homegrown terrorist activity yeah hundred percent 100 percent it means you worried about al-qaeda you worried about Isis you worried about the Taliban you've got something right here that is willing to drive a car into a random group of people that look just like him a bunch of white people yeah I mean this is this is completely fucking insane and the craziest part is they're not doing it to overthrow like the yoke of empire it's not like like you know the Ireland back in the 70s with British control like at least you can kind of be like ah they don't want to be controlled by the British these people are literally living in the most free country like you know the prosperous to the point of almost boredom where they start and I don't think anti-flood realizes how much similarity they have to the people they claim to be fighting against it's a natural progression yeah I have extremely violent protests like these people happen everybody ramps it up they ramp it up on the Left they ramp it up on the right everybody gets angry and this fucking asshole drives into a bunch of people fuck man it's fucking awful and then Trump said here's the thing all this happened because we were taking out a statue of Robert Ely who's the leader of the Confederates right Trump literally said today what's next we're gonna take down a statue of George Washington like what that's a bit of a false equivalency right what how the fuck can you even say that but this is quick he's got some weird thing going on where he has to dance around his support for white supremacist or white nationalist he has to dance around it which is weird because they're not that big of a group like it's not like but if they're on your side they're all on your side you know 10,000 people and might be a lot more than you think man might be a lot of closeted racists out there I see so much similarities between like you know white racists and then like the social justice races where it's like it's just it's usually like the white Nazis are like the loser is trying to get something either skin and then social justice warriors a lot of times we're trying to get something out of an oppressed being an unimpressed status and both of those groups I'm like you're both trying to avoid merit merit like your bones is trying to get something from your stupid group because you never see like a Nazi is like good-looking or successful they're always just like I deserve some shit because I'm white and you know like then that means you're weak is fuck that's it was I just think it's just a massive failure from the begin - now of thinking that's the only thing that makes sense to me yeah and just like the agenda think where it's like you start ignoring basic reality to get clicks or you know outrage culture well it's just the it's just not the way to go you did you just joined up with all white people like that it's just insane it's completely insane and even the concept of white is a new concept but growing up it's like oh you're Irish or Italian or yeah it's like when of this fucking Federation kickoff well we've been forced into this position by a thing called white privilege I don't know if you're aware of it I checked it on my way out check yourself wreck yourself yeah well that's the thing is we're all human beings who migrated from Africa that's a fact yeah go back far enough but we don't we're not willing to go back farther we're like we're stopping wherever the fuck you know we've got this accent from and this is my homeland and I'll defend it in my death that guys just that car because it never fucking it's always so he's cloudy yeah vitamin F is raining yeah it's literally it exactly that's why they're so pale they're trying to suck as much of the vitamin D out of the sky as they can yeah cuz like two percent couldn't get pussy because they died they died and that's how vitamin D and that's all evolution works they turn into paper those people they just did little goddamn solar panels just walking around sucking in the vitamin D take is they're all Africans Irish people are Africans that just stayed in Ireland yes that's what they're it's we all are it's just like a flash when we started separating and it really has nothing to do with who we are as people I can see the criticism yeah you're one of those bro out or you see color people those people I don't even see color bro no you're like no I am racist but is that oh I in my store but I know are equal yeah man except with the gay rainbow yeah just I'm not in Raiders fans or you know Chinese food choppers yeah you see who saw murders like black dudes with more than one pitbull scared the shit out of me but a black guy with a cell phone on his belt I trust that's hilarious I would do it I would have the crowd get a Verizon yeah because it's all cultural signifiers and so I would have the crowd yell out anybody you know white people outs like white dudes with teardrop tattoos in Idaho scare that you know and you just go through any race and you're like look it's always it's that Chris Rock joke that I won't repeat because of my privileged but like there's this group and then there's this yes and everybody knows which one of the dickheads in which one now even dickheads but from a position of like desperation yeah depending on where you are in history if I walk by too many dudes that have their pants saggin like more than two of them all these guys must make stupid decisions yeah bad decision guys if you got like your your pants like down like to like the curve the downward curve of your ass right it's riding the curve and I can see like a giant percentage of your underwear yeah one guy may have forgot about two guys they're hiding guns it's not even that it's just they're just making stupid decisions with their life right sure my brother's dresses people based on if they back into their spot or not oh if they can know my brother's like that guy in back end doesn't give a shit about his family like he'll make fucking job sister he's like oh so R then D if someone needs him I just back in in case of emergencies well that is a good move actually he's right but like it's just intense to hit like judge people like that yeah but like um I'm getting out if I can back out like I'll still get out like how much of an advantage I'd like to see like a test that shows how much how much of an advantage you have in a danger situation a half-second like was you being attacked by like a Terry probably a whole second let me think probably of like a good solid two or three seconds probably yeah that consumer wise yeah you know why you might be able to might make a light or you know like yeah my bill a figure like someone's falling off the cliff and he's just like that's like two seconds yeah well I guess it yeah if you're in a dangerous situation then the real question is like how dangerous are we talking do you have to decide like do you want to be one of those people that survives nuclear holocaust or do you want to be one of those people that dies in an initial blast alone death with my friends and family survived if I was alone like if it was that that like that the road that book yeah I didn't well I didn't read that book that I watched a little bit of the movie up until he was teaching his son where to shoot himself in the mouth to kill himself and yeah I was like check please that's some high stakes shit I'm good yeah I would I would went out with the blast it just seems like you don't want to cannibalize you just don't stay alive you really don't you just don't know you don't you don't want to have to worry about people eating you either so I'm scared of owls like like right now imagine if you're constantly and dread of someone stealing everything you have constantly constant yeah you're up in the middle of the night cocked and ready to rock look out the window always worried about invaders they might eat you yeah I lost a bunch of chickens to to raccoon and a fox recently and I dawned on me the stakes of life where I'm like if I needed those eggs like I'm fucking dead you killed nine of them in one night Jesus Christ I was like one mistake like one hole in the thing and they drink the blood right is that what they do the raccoons they bite their neck and drink their blood I think so they took the bodies they did yeah that's why I think there's a fox involved oh oh yeah wow there's a whole party going on your chicken it was crazy so we stayed up the next night with air rifles and shot a raccoon and a fox cuz it came back oh they did it was like a Disney movie god damn um air rifle huh what kind I just won you get it like ace it was just like we're store one yeah so did it kill him we're just hurt I was just trying to set a tone like I wasn't looking to take him out I was looking to be like listen don't kill the girls interesting cuz cuz I can't legally shoot a gun in my area even though I'm in the country time to go Walking Dead style son get yourself a crossbow yeah I got a bow but I'm not accurate yet yeah that's the problem it takes a long time to learn how to get accurate with a boat I would recommend a crossbow and a nice rest what a crossbow is is basically a shitty gun yeah it's a gun that shoots bolts I mean it just doesn't it's not really a bow I mean it's your trigger so all you have to do is just squeeze that's grow off and put the crosshairs on it and they they fly really flat and really fast yeah you could fuck up a fox with one of those if you were so inclined I am inclined well a lot of killing your chickens you should definitely try to scare it off and there's other options too they can you can take urine that they'll sell like mountain lion urine and even wolf urine I was he's been drunk for a week he's so dehydrated he's not gonna do anything yeah yeah if you have if you have like different kinds of animals that get scared off by different kind of sense yeah I gotta get a scent well man get some wolf piss they sell that shit do they really sell it they sell all kinds of different animal piss to ward off other animals it's real interesting cock piss I don't think that works I don't think it works with Raptors I think it's more of a mammal thing I'm gonna Raptors piss on stuff that would be interesting if they did I know mammals do a lot of dogs and cats piss on shit mark their ground yeah because it's like birds are like Raptors use that word just change my fucking whole opinion they're fucking like gangster they're so they're so predatory they're so ruthless too yeah I used to work at a dock and I'd feed ducks bread and just watch them fucking destroy Joe Oh bite each other stealing bread from each other that's why when a girl does a duck face I instinctively throw bread at them um so uh let's go back to that Google memo thing yeah cuz this is one of the weird lines in the sand that got crossed with this is that uh everybody I mean everybody established a line in the sand I should say and it was like you even thought that memo was the worst thing you've ever read ever and that guy's a misogynist piece of shit or he said yeah evolutionary psychology sort of tries to explain why people why people choose certain things and like yeah what factors what factors are environmental what factors are hormonal what factors have to do with being a male what factors have to do with being a female and there's like a lot of studies and that guy cited a lot studies he talked like he it was a really interesting thing the only thing that I think people could find derogatory maybe is that he said the women are more neurotic neurotic is a sort of a derogatory term right very actually avert derogatory term right it's not neurotic is like saying that you're not handling something good yeah right you're not you're not handling whatever freshers yeah there's a neurotic oh I would be calm because it's implying that like you another person handling that same situation perhaps even male would be more calm right like that like very aware would be the nice way of saying it because like my wife has a lot of anxiety but once we had a baby I was like oh this is why cuz you're responsible for this like little alien that can die totally make sense but the thing that guy said that that I like the prep like when people would argue with me about it I'd be like so do you think men and women are the same and from there I I don't care if they're an expert if they say there is no difference at all I'm like my mom had her PhD and quit to raise us as soon as she had a baby my wife stays home with our son was an engineer it's like it that isn't saying that there aren't Rockstar female engineers that have no interest in having a child all it does is affect the percentage right and that's always saying is a quality of outcome versus opportunity is really the debate and I'm very against equality of outcome because the legal precedent that is insane well it becomes a real issue like you have to find out okay what is the actual suppression what is stopping people from getting to this position that happened to be female is it because they're being suppressed along the way is it because the way they interact with each other is different than the way men interact with each other and so when men interact with them they get upset by it there's different rules that have to be established in these working environments is it that they don't want to have anything to do with that and they would rather not compete in one of those hostile male driven environments is that why they choose not to get involved or are they someone stopping them there's someone saying hey we got to keep chicks out of here I don't like chicks right it would completely depend on what's actually happening and if the latter is happening but then you got a real issue exactly but if the former looked a very beginning one if it's just they choose different stuff ironically it hurts women the most like the very qualified ones with the job people start looking at him like oh because they're women even you know like programming itself was founded by a check you know but like I don't think that she vented COBOL right yeah yeah like so my buddy's house cone adds that what's called COBOL that Lovelace no but yeah it's like it's not disclosing and it's not saying that women can't do it of course and said less women are interested in doing it yes so and if you have an equal number of men and women then you probably like artificially inflated the number of women yes that makes a unless for some reason women gravitate towards that thing in a just as higher percentage as men do which is really odd there's not a lot of things where women gravitate towards it with the same percentage of people it's the same like like like well there's I'm sure there's a lot of fields of study I know particularly nursing and I think a lot of the social studies that women gravitate towards in higher numbers absolutely like like nursing healthcare even I think you can change oceans I think there's more female physicians maybe that's bullshit maybe I read that from some yeah like teaching children yeah I mean gravitate more yeah yeah there's got to be a ton of different jobs that females like gravitate towards in higher percentages we absolutely shouldn't insist that there's an equal representation of men in florists exactly and in you know in interior design my brother's a lumberjack we worked one woman worked with us one time yeah and she was from Yale and like probably doing a whole thing you know like and he couldn't well I don't know but couldn't climb a tree and like some women for sure could but if you're going like these dudes go up 200-foot trees and and spend all day like chopping them down it's like that isn't going to draw 50% women it just isn't here's what's the most hilarious thing about the Google memo yeah it upsets so many women that they had to take time off proving the point it's so crazy they wanted time off so bad that they went for it they want to play the victim so hard that they went for it not even understanding that it proves the point of the most skeptical people the most skeptical people on the side of like I don't know if these chicks are gonna be able to pull their own weight these chicks here and then immediately they encounter any adversity like we need time off from a memo handle this nice somebody talks about evolutionary psychology and I just can't handle it I need time away from work I'm because they said it was time for a female James Bond oh it was like I called him I called her double-oh-seven seven cents on the dollar Jane bond she's open to hibernation and then whether Liza's in need of a vacation it's like if you take Jane you can have a female spy it's just gonna be different tactics you can't have a male Wonder Woman okay okay rule can't have a female James Bond make your own fucking detective right be James Bond right he's a guy and I'm cool with black Santa I am too because that's uh because that's uh megan kelly was out of line I do too she was out of line but theoretically what the fuck would he be black he was living up in the North Pole would be white is shit that's the whole point of magic there's no goddamn Sun up there it's freezing cold yeah black guy gets outside there could be black Santa but he would die of rickets well I don't think that would be the case but I think he would he would have a real issue getting some vitamin D he would he'd have to go get it somewhere maybe some supplements yes it's fine I get all fucked up telling him elves hook me up dude you know when you're building a little toy trains and shit go build me some fucking vitamin D bitch the other the D elves use that Christmas magic right make Santa some vitamin D I can't work dude yeah then they always bring they bring blow too because Santa's got to step for two straight days Santa does adderall like crazy just rampages listens to only techno only house music-wise making toys to crunch times like you know all through December's frantic yeah hoppin adderall can't sleep yeah and then and then like and everyone's like why are the presidents alphabetical he's like gotta be alphabetical huh organize the over organize Santa went crazy hey wait crazy well yeah it's like if you say that there has to be an equal outcome you're going to sacrifice quality I wonder what jobs it would be where you have if you have a hundred men and a hundred women what jobs would you have to be where you had an equal number of men and equal number of women that are interested in those jobs out of a hundred like what job would that be what do you think would be mm-hmm other than like famous I want to be famous what about high school teacher I feel like we're on family feud I'll go to the richard dawson family feud by the way no disrespect Steve Harvey yeah I remember Steve Dawson survey says wait that guy had always kind of like grab people well like it's a Dawson he's Pro drunk yeah I'd like put his hands on people he'd be like there's only 15 though Kate here's a pretty yester guy he was in a fucking Nazi comedy it was a goddamn Nazi Colin he was in Hogan's Heroes oh yeah that's a goddamn Nazi car less than 30 years after the war right it's like I Love Lucy but ouch wits like what's that pitch like let's ask the question what year do you think Hogan's Heroes came out I want to say it was in the 70s and the war ended in 47 correct when was Hogan's Heroes 65 holy shit dude that's less than 20 years after the war was over they had a goddamn comedy about the war do you think that's gallows humor like it affected so many people that they had this like an impulse to market well I think people were tougher back then for sure they could joke around about shit more hence Archie Bunker yeah to be literally impossible to have today the amount of outrage if someone tried to make an art a character like Archie Bunker yeah oh look at that he was fucking remember he had to pretend to be a Nazi at one point in time snuck in there's a there's so much horror today it's so much anger and even racist characters in fiction if you have a racist character in fiction yeah people are angry you like there's a bunch of what's young what's young fiction like young Hardy boys like there's a there's a category that they use but there's this very popular book and it's being attacked by all these social justice warriors because of this one character that's racist and so someone took the racist quotes of this character set and taken completely out of context out of the context of the book and published it in a blog and was saying like look at this racist bullshit that's in this book and then people are getting like really mad at the course they never read the book right read the blog which is what people do and so they got super fucking mad and it just became this huge thing like wouldn't mean you're saying you can't have a monster in a book can you have a guy who is a murderer because if we can't do that I need to know where the fucking line is man can I I can't I can't make a book about a serial killer oh I can't okay but it can't be racist right Oh got it okay can I make a book about a guy who brings people back from the dead and they kill a bunch of people can I do that I can okay but he can't be racist you can't like discriminate against Chinese people can't discriminate if he uses the wrong pronoun it doesn't matter imagine how fucking stupid you have to be just be o'clock which right now be called dr. Jekyll if you forget Hyde you don't learn like like my mom was teaching a class once and and she was like they took n-word Jim out of Huckleberry Finn yeah they did like you could get that word out you can't know what time unless you know the characters from that time you know and it's giving people a real disservice to just AM like emasculate and neuter our history so that everybody can't see what real dangers are like what just happened in Charlottesville all the people that called Dave Rubin and Nazi now have to use the same word for these people right and it's like now it has no meaning exactly yeah good good point thank you it's a it's really important to not overreact to people that don't have the exact same opinion as you now when something like this happens you miss okay that's what you should react to exactly this is real this is real you got a bunch of douche bags with a fucking with torches from Home Depot or wherever the fuck they got this those are those the citronella court people happen like the suburbs they've like a tiki party that's good buy some and now I can't come on look who's literally gonna like I like those dortch's twofer kill of escy toes and I was thinking about I'm like I'm not gonna buy those now cuz it's Charlottesville in all these guys I mean if any of those people that are into that are listening I'm not even upset at you as a human you get trapped into patterns of thinking I'm upset at that pattern I'll upset that this is a repeated repeating pattern that's happened through human history where people decide that there's specific groups that somehow or another deserve preferential treatment or are better or or or superior or should dominate over other groups it's stupid and it's bad for business it's bad for the business of being human beings yeah that's in the way you're you're judging people on nonsense and you get to all be in the group just because you have similar skin color that's fucking stupid you're allowing a bunch of losers in your group then because your own the only differentiation is that they have to be white that is insanely stupid it's so stiff economist out on all the cool black people you're gonna miss out on all the cool Cubans and all the cool Puerto Ricans you're gonna miss out on them and you're gonna think that you have some family in this idea that you all have Nordic roots or something like that it's so dumb it's I understand if you run into people that are black and they're racist against white people and you feel like you know white people have to protect themselves if you get in one of those situations and those situations are real they can happen racism can occur on both sides and it's another disingenuous thing that the left is doing is accepting this idea that you can only be racist if you're white the statement it's so racist it's over debt but this is something that people I think they've kind of let it go for most recently like out there in the Twittersphere but for a good long time it was a defensible argument that a black person couldn't be racist because racism is all about power and what black people don't have power over white people like that is you changing the word you're changing the fucking word and you're gonna empower actual racist of course and it's like no one you don't know Nazis till you know Treaty of Versailles and you don't know this until you like you know just over shaming always has a springboard effect like always look after World War one it's the same look like you know that shamed gay guy is the one that like hates gay people you know where it's like shame is a horrible thing in people and so World War one blood on all hands you know that was started and executed for very bizarre reasons they blame Germany for all of it to the point where they destroyed Germany and then they were looking for a voice that gave them hope and that voice is insane and so that happens that that happened in this where it's like dear white people being white you should just say sorry all the fucking time even though your people came in nineteen oh you know well you can see it today in the people that never criticize Trump and have like exclamation points and they write Magga after all their tweets no matter what Trump does no matter what Trump says yeah it's always amazing everything is always perfect like okay well I see what you're doing because you're not really thinking right really thinking you're you you are you got a fucking team you're go Raiders let's go Raiders you're let's go Trump like well now this is not this is not healthy there's not a normal way to discuss super important issues this wouldn't Trump said today that like what's next they're gonna take down statue of George Washington it's like they took down statue of Robert Ely never East Rica what's nice gonna take down statue of George Washington like what yeah that's like when the word normalizing actually fits you know like all these things that have been so flooded that is normalizing something terrible but it's like so crazy and with robert e lee is actually a problem but the left is like over pointed out problems to the point where no one like you can't have your you don't trust your instincts right now you know were you like if i say this does this make me racist it's like what that it's 80 degrees outside how is that linked you know and also I think anybody coming in and deciding to do something is a problem you know likes people coming in and started deciding to take down a statue yeah statues a symbol to a lot of people and a lot of people step in and say hey this is it I think there should be some sort of real prolonged intelligent conversation about what that statue means and have it in a way where a bunch of people can can see it and have it represented on both sides have it represented by the side of people that think it's a good idea to keep it up and have it represented on the side of someone who thinks it's a good idea to move on and maybe we should take this thing and put it in some sort of a War Museum right not having it represent the goddamn Confederate soldiers in the middle of this town that's not Confederate okay.we that the war is gone because you're you're holding on to this idea that your team lost a battle and if there's an invading army that's in with you right I know we're all Americans okay this is old old old shit 1860 shit okay let it go stupid let's take this down and let's put up a goddamn glorious Kid Rock tattoo style eagle with a fucking flag behind it come on you really love America let's take down the robert e lee and put up hulking american eagle with a fucking flag blowing in the wind just cash and and then underneath it have a gigantic plaque of everybody that lost their lives in the last two wars over the last 20 years have that yeah i think all of it is how it's being represented - is it like a glorious statue or is it just a relic of history cuz like right i think the debate is have you seen it no i haven't either look at it find out what's the statue of robert e lee that they were taken down I'm curious me Jo what if he was like found out he was like banging a slave oh that's it torch-wielding protesters rally a Confederate statue yeah can we go large on that buddy wow that's beautiful piece of art you know I mean much like when you look at ginga's Kahn it's a beautiful piece of art you know you look at some of the statues and things that they constructed from back in his day you let you you know think about oh wow this is a guy at war yeah who killed like a fit like 5% of the earth yeah something even crazier 'land I think he killed like 10% the world's population while he was alive yeah this is a tough one because it's like you know because that is a rebel army loss so that should be taken down but at the same time it's like but what do you do then then to the natives Americans tell people to take down Washington you know then you start then you start getting in a battle of like well this person wronged my people will this person and then you you know like I see people with che shirts from Urban Outfitters I'm like that dude committed genocide to a lot of people you know and it's like at what point is it with this one I think that it's a valid argument to take it down because it was a rebel army and a rebel army in the country that is still in at the same time it's like it's a slippery slope of a racing right you know well I don't think you should have it in your state capital wherever the fuck that is is that what it is state capitol building oh well that's a no-brainer represent that state yes but see if you could pull it up again just so we know what the fuck we're talking about I think that was kind of like I think was like a state building look it was a big deal that's how I thought about Confederate flag I'm like obviously take it off state buildings justice is what's still a part of a few different flags right that's that to me crosses that line where you're like oh well now you're incorporating it into the government that a lot of people associate with like valid social issues yeah I mean to this day I think it's on Mississippi's that's very intense yeah it's in Emancipation Park in front of their courthouse in front of the courthouse wow that's a bit of a tone you can't do that hey I mean you gotta get that guy out of there look I think for sure we should keep it I mean I don't think they should destroy it just like I don't think they should destroy you know if there's a statue of Mao somewhere I don't think they should destroy it I think we should we should look at it and hold onto it so that future generations can look back in a while that's possible yeah the Berlin wall yeah yeah like there's little pieces to be like yeah that people fucking split the world in two at one point and we forget that we doing this live-action roleplay until someone gets hit by a car it's like you know well we want better right so we want better so we pretend that better already exists or is is is possible if we force people to behave the way we want right you know there's a bunch of different ways where people try to achieve better you know they're not all smart is because there's a lot of them are based on how you feel right now and what you want to change so you try to be forceful but like the the bounce-back thing we're talking about it doesn't really work like that when you when you push too hard at people and you don't respect them even if their is ridiculous as a white nationalist when you push push at them and why do I say it's ridiculous if you're asking because it's all ridiculous I think being a black nationalist is ridiculous - I think it's all ridiculous I think you should be a human being and just because you enjoy black culture it doesn't mean you have to be racist you can enjoy Chinese people just as much we can all just be cool with each other but this idea that there's like one superior race is insane we are all interconnected in some very bizarre way and we help each other and that's what culture is that's what civilization is the reason why it all works so well is that we're all intertwined with each other learning from each other trying to figure out how to navigate this thing together competing with each other improving upon whatever the fuck it is we're working on because of the competition from all sorts of different parts of the world different cultures and behavior patterns and levels of aggression levels of intellect and all of us combined and some sort of a swarming soup of innovation and ideas and communication and trying to figure this thing out together and as soon as you just lump it all up - white people only like get the fuck out of here with that old stupid idea that's a stupid idea yeah and that's why I'm so anti PC and cultural appropriation stuff because those are the mechanisms to share it's like the it's not because I'm white and I don't want people to get credit for whatever yeah it's saying how do we you know there's no quote that when goods when goods stop going across borders armies go across borders where it's like if cultures coming together and sharing and developing and everything you just said is necessary for multiculturalism and so if you say I can't wear a sombrero because I'm a white guy you know but even though I'm you know as long as you're not being an asshole about it you're just having fun and what's the big deal and who needs that brim white guys yeah pails fuck right and skins have a nice dark complexion they can handle it I know Jews have no brim dude very good very important point Mexicans and juicy twits at some of the super Orthodox ones they have the crazy brim right yeah they're like cheese heads with fur oh that's a different one right that's a different one that's a different kind of hat they wear I've seen that one yeah that's a weird one it's like part of West Hollywood has a bunch of those hats yeah that's an interesting thing about Hollywood when you drive there's certain neighborhoods you go down to they're all Orthodox Jews or at least a high volume of them yeah I see them with their the strings that hang down from their belt totally okay Irish we're used to rock those those things holgar but that's so intact those dudes are there's the Hat yeah that is some ancient shit that that culture is clinging to yeah what is bananas like when do they say no more like you know what year they like all right we're 1815 guys well as long as you can keep together I mean this is a nice representation of what we're talking about non integration you know if you keep together in your own little community and only cohabitate with your own you keep this thing going as long as you can and that's what they're doing right now that's the irony of lack of oppression sometimes I was talking to these gay dudes in Houston recently and they were like almost bummed that they're that like everyone loves gay people so much because they don't feel as unified like we used to have a bar and I'm like you can still have the bar man you just now have the Bravo Channel - yeah but guys go in the bar now like straight guys are going to K bars and girls girls fucking love gay bars yeah go to gay bars and that's why straight guys go there sometimes because girls together for gay guys bar straight guys like they fucking weasel in on gay girls or drunk drunk straight girls rather they do it like it doesn't even matter if you touch it I don't you try I'm coming I don't feel it or it also shows they're so open-minded he goes to a gay bar I love these so confident yeah and women will go they're vulnerable sometimes ooh so it's like it's like I've just just got a relationship and I want to just talk cannot be hit on because I'm so vulnerable and then some dudes like and look at my fanny pack there's a dick in it well any bags by the way it's like that Mickey Rourke game that he did in diner remember the movie diner put his dick through the hole the bottom the bottom of the bucket of popcorn see bad his friend that she would grab his dick and he's like no fucking way and he so he put his dick through the popcorn I don't like I said I was laughs but she reached in and grabbed it Wow but what if she didn't realize it was his dick and just pulled up she yanked it and broke it off like like when you were hanging off that chimpanzee there it is there's a scene that's back when Mickey Rourke is a beautiful man can you imagine that scene now yeah just gonna say it's rape that's essentially rape I mean you can't do that you can't you can't force someone to be intimate with you and trick them if you're if someone's intimate with you don't even play that on this show god damn it this is rape culture you shut it off right now too hot yeah like when I was a kid it was so different that I have to train myself to not be like you should see how crazy shit can get right like there used to be dudes just whacking off in the street it was like weird they really yeah I saw dudes walking off in the street well there was one dude in the middle school woods would just chase everyone wagging off and it was like it you tell your parents like you tell your parents and your parents are like yeah you can brush that one off it's not their crutch that went off is it that was an actual wiener right there there's a lot of drama in this movie it's a slow burn people wouldn't even have time for that today people are so Twitter fied everybody Cho there she goes she grabbed it and she's mad and she got up to leave BAM she's outraged but then when you pulled a ween out all the popcorn is falls in your lap yeah you gotta be watch this here goes she's gonna grab that was really subtly good acting that yeah and like he was like was terrible Wow yeah I really liked it the editing was bad there's obviously two takes to two different they did get a lot of coverage I was like this happened but this happened before the sat was ye showing it like that weird it's like we got to get plenty of coverage like almost how to read like a how a second replay yeah man um you can't do that anymore couldn't have that in the movie no probably for good I don't know but yeah I'm wrestling with that too right if it's if it's fiction right there are people like that that can exist like we're talking about murderers are you lined up monsters and murderers are you allowed to show movies about war okay well if you are how come you can't have a rapist in a movie but you obviously can we visited in good taste is it something people want to see or won't the market dictate that you know like I know I don't know if you should be able to say that we're allowed to have murderers in a movie but we're not allowed to have rapists yeah it's gotta be market yeah I feel like I don't want to see people get raped but I don't know that you should be able to tell someone they can't do that we can't right and it always ends bad that's the drug socialism it's narcissism where someone goes if I had control everyone would be better and then even if that guy's awesome the next guy's stylist yeah well that's the thing is like these these kind of like we're talking about the statue having a long conversation like you have to have conversations about this kind of shit like should you want to read about rape oh of course not but should you be able to put whatever the fuck you want into whatever it is it's your your your creation I mean you're sitting there and you're writing out a story that's you're manipulating with your imagination you're putting it all together you should be able to have horrific characters that everyone is terrified of that people trying to get away from if that includes rapists or murderers or whoever the fuck it is if you're trying to tell a terrifying tale in a book you can't be hindered you can't be stopped like we have to be really careful about what what we're saying here well we're submitting we'll to someone that doesn't have our best interest that's what it is cuz they don't no one really cares that much I don't think I think they care but I don't think they're thinking I think it's more of a not thinking about this like it doesn't just because someone has a book about rapists doesn't mean people are gonna rape more there's like there's a book about you know people that are murderers they're not gonna go out murder more you know that's I don't I don't believe if that's valid like I think when you're talking about fiction and again I don't want to read about it but I don't want you to be able to tell people that they can't write about certain things that seems to me like way over the line like way over the line yeah because then you can't do critical government stuff it's a legal precedent that's set that then makes the craziest shit possible or it's like oh this is words or violence these words are violence I'm raped now no one can say like our new president is horrible you know like now you can't even show dissent it's all just a way to tighten the screws don't you think that people on the Left though are showing dissent more than like a violent descent towards the president oh yeah like really like angry like in a way that I can't remember anybody doing towards Obama now to the point where it freaks me out like they're like it's weird well I didn't I wasn't obviously traveling in this the right circles look for people that really angry at Obama but even the people that I saw online that are angry and I'm they're calling them incompetent or fool or spending all of our money and all those different accusations but not like what I'm seeing with Trump like I'm seeing just like flat-out insults from famous people all the time yeah and the media I don't get why people totally trust the media it's like you'll see them misrepresent something in such an egregious way mm-hmm and my dad is a rhetoric professor so it's like he teaches a class in propaganda this is like my whole childhood is learning about the shit it's not watching CNN I'm like you motherfuckers you know exactly like you can misrepresent things so egregiously that I'm like of course no one's gonna trust you and that's a problem right and it's not that you you don't wish that they were correct right it's that in them lying even if you're on their side more than you're on the Fox News side if CNN lies even a little then it's fuel for the other side and it vastly diminishes the impact that you can have because you're not you're not trustworthy absolutely that's all you have in news now yeah it's trustworthiness because everyone can manipulate in Photoshop now that that that audio Photoshop oh my god it's like you have to just trust people I can't trust anybody though it's real issue and an issue with an issue with the left being so hyperbolic it's like when Trump is first elected I was like ah sucks Trump's crazy and then I saw their reaction and I almost like triaged it I was like wait a minute what's crazier the guy that may like text a dictator is dick or like people like saying that democracy is bad and I'm like this is a weird battle well it's it's certainly not the result that people wanted right like a lot of people and so having him there they're super frustrated and all the things that they see happening people are super frustrated and they don't know what to do and so the the feeling is you should somehow another protest and riot and like the people that got in front of Trump Tower because of his reaction charlottesville yeah people are super upset his reaction that was I think that was a big one when he said that you know that something about despicable acts and violence on all sides yeah see that was a whore that was crazy they did that whoa I mean that's like okay one you have people that are fighting and whoever side you're on okay whether you're the side that wants to keep statue up and you want white people to get their respect or whether you're on the side that thinks that you guys are a bunch of racists and call yourself white Nationals all day you're a bunch of Nazis like whichever side it is I don't know which side you're on yeah but as soon as someone Joe's driving a fucking car into all those people and you find out that guy is a Nazi or that guy's a Nazi sympathizer or whatever he is a white nationalist you gotta go look this thinking is shit brained shit brand that you think you could just drive a car and a group of people and cute including a girl you killed a girl with a car yeah it's who crosses the lining of violence like I was a hatchling science random violence on two sherries injures yeah no look in the eye no interaction with them stomping on the gas of a car it's um one of the most cowardly acts you could ever do yeah it's a horrific ly terrorist activity it's horrific ly terrorist in in the way that it's like sheer terror that this could ever happen to you that someone could just gun a car into a random group of people and slam into whoever didn't get out of the way and they think that think that that would be the thing to do against America like people in your own country don't just over ideology yeah and and I yeah that's unbelievable whether or not you should take down a statue of a guy who was the commanding general in the losing army of a civil war and you got that in front of a courthouse this is a little weird right a little we should have this discussion we should at least have this one problem is people aren't allowing discussions you get labeled racist sexist immediately or the opposite you get label to Nazi if you even think like from a historical point of view like hey we should respect that this this statue is a part of our culture in our history yeah we don't embrace the ideals of the Confederate Army we're not trying to bring back slavery we're not racists we just think that there's an unique and interesting history of the south as as unfortunate as it is it's all connected to slavery you know this is not entirely what this guy represents to us like if that's the argument you're making okay well then we should probably have some sort of a Confederate Army Museum you know where people can go and just observe like the strangeness of it all yeah cuz it is strange whether or not you're on the north is south it's strange that in 1865 people were shooting each other and the only difference was like either they were cross a line the mason-dixon brother shooting your other crazy and that just happened right just a couple hundred years ago yeah we lost 800,000 people and only 3% of people owned slaves in the south so think about how many casualties were like what the fuck the whole thing is ins and all the immigrants in the north just right off the boat Italy Ireland just grab a gun go die fuck man yeah just stop and think about how insane that is and there should be some way that we addressed this in these areas I don't think it's a statue of Robert Ely in front of some important federal building or state building I think you should take all that stuff and bring it someplace where you have like a museum or a you know an area where you have where people can go and you have experts to give tours of this and explain put it all in context explain who this guy was you know have like a tour that people do that's an Allison idea massively educational and it doesn't you know look nobody today was a part of the fucking Confederate Army okay if you're if you're a thirty year old guy today you were not a part of that okay you're a human being that lives in America you're not responsible for the sins of your ancestors nor are you obligated to continue the same ridiculous ideas that maybe you were raised with or other people were raised with too it's it's not smart we're supposed to be honest together if we all got attacked by whether it's some invading army or fucking aliens from outer space I mean that was like a famous Ronald Reagan quote about how quickly we would forget about our differences between US and Russia if we were attacked by an alien force from outside this planet so true so true it's not like even just a concept of reminiscing is new like I do a song summer of 1869 like just to put in perspective how good we have it now oh yeah and we just should be celebrating every day like holy shit you go into any drugstore this could have killed Kings it's a dollar yeah but like we just myself included I can't do that I just think relatively to what I've seen in my life but like if you think about the summer of 1869 like people are dying of like Spanish flu and shit like crazy so 100 mile ride to get butter oh I mean and that's like modern times you know I mean think about back when the only reason why we're here is because people had to breed from the time we weren't people yeah I had to keep from the time we were some sort of it that's if you believe all that liberal bullshit about evolution which is mostly just a plot concocted by the Jew but if you if you do pay attention to evolution we we came from some sort of a lower hominid and we evolved over time we kept improving natural selection and all sorts of different factors and mutations we improved and became what we are today well that means we had a weird we bred back when we were almost like fish people right we kept going through this whole thing yeah well we are today the only reason why anybody ever got better than those people that had to walk 10 miles for butter because they were like fuck walking 10 miles for butter we got to figure this out better and so no one's ever happy no one's ever happy with the current state of affairs he's like why am I still walking where's my fucking flying car where's my teleporter well I can't go to Mars right now when I go to Mars right now and that's the gene that passed like I was trying to explain to some buddies in the UK ik side dude stamp throw I'm like Americans are a little fucking crazy because we were two dudes who agreed to come here you know like if you're gonna do a genetic just cut and it's like okay you're probably gonna die but there's gold and pussy well it's like one out of two hundred people's like all right and then they settled America those guys need a hug they're insane and then that set that settled America and then that's why it's like some of us are just so wacky like people aren't even drinking water right like they're just hammered all the time trying to make big decisions about slavery oh so hard and that's the other thing when it comes to like racism racism is horrible and it's horrible today right but I think it's better than if I saw a post by killer Mike or think very cool dude I want to have him on eventually I like that guy seems like he's fun and you know he had a post on his Instagram about saying America is exactly the same and it was essentially saying you should be armed he was saying anybody tells you you shouldn't be armed and you know and be trained in how to use a firearm as it's crazy weather or some sort of an agent of the state I was like whoa killer Mike's going deep yeah but don't bored yeah well but I think it is different I think it is different from 1963 I really do I really think it's a lot better than it was in the 60s I think it still sucks in some spots though and I think emotion like events like this as horrific as they are they're good for a lot of people that live in places outside of there well they didn't know you know I get caught in the pattern of whatever your environment is and if you're in an environment of stagnant ancient racism that goes back to the slave days and goes back to pre Civil War and then it's like the same area that new ideas are slowly making their way into it's not like a lot of influx of like new people moving into these places either right it's people having kids and the kids maybe learn a little bit at school and you know it's a slow process of getting out the shitty ideas it's like you're a bit about the Middle East or the Townies of the world it's so true it's like just the people that don't leave and then well it's Iraq in specific because Iraq is Sumaira which is where the oldest known civilization is is why it's so fucked over there that there they really are like the Townies of the world and like tribalism like you go to UK and it's like Catholic Protestant and they don't give a shit about right they don't have the same history as us right and they're like I heard a great Irish joke there was I are you Catholic or Protestant and a guy goes I'm atheist and the other guy goes which one don't you believe in like are you awesome and like you can just split it up based on counties in England and here it's skin and yeah dude when I was in Ireland I was in Northern Ireland as well I went to Belfast once and mmm there was a bunch of people that were there that were there you know the guys were in their late 40s and 50s they were telling me about back in the day with the the bombings with the IRA and they were explaining to me some horrific things that were done to people there I mean the and these are Irish people going after other Irish people right and the cop cars there are fully armored like war vehicles like I've never seen anything like it and all the places that I've been I've never seen anything like it where the cop cars are covered with like steel plates like steel mesh on the front steel plates and battering rams I wonder what the fuck is this how it's bomb proof I was like what it can get a lot worse man this is this is Northern Ireland and I'm talking about shit I want to say like 2006 something like man somewhere around then I was there and I was like holy shit yeah Dan Carlin was talking about 1968 there was like 40,000 bombings yeah like something that I had to look up I probably got that wrong but it was like the weather man and all these like homegrown like shit can get bad there used to be a machine guns on the White House stood she can get bad it's been really good for like a short amount of time that's why I value it so much yeah but it's hard for us to have a perspective of how bad it used to be you know have you ever seen that a section of France this is France that's how you know Moroccan but in France if I said France I'd be an asshole there it's a tricky little fucking road to navigate like but reto is the same way have you seen that area where it's it's like essentially no-man's land something you can't go into it because there's so much unexploded ordnance that literally there's so much toxic shit from these bombs that there's an area the size of Paris that you can't go to that's a mighty man like fucking fenced off you can't go in there and they keep pulling shit out of there and they're like people collect them you know they have like they've rescued them I mean giant fucking bullets and missiles and shit and that was recent same with the Eastern Front and Russia like the ghost of the austere front that hardcore is pretty serious like just the bone fields Oh were you like things it's right out of a Pink Floyd video yeah oh hi alright so I have a problem with pronouns but it's like fucking fight to the death for this if you were really um like smooth transition transgender person it's absolutely no issue because no one can tell they're like Thai people you slide right in nobody gives a shit slip in comes an issue when it's not obvious yeah it's like that Valley what Valley with robot faces yeah what does that called uncanny valley where if it's like close but a little off yeah a little like something's wrong yeah yeah except no eyelashes it's kind of eyelashes yeah simulation like when my piano teacher got a sex change like no one really cared as long as he still matched that like the demo like liking the bills and shit like that and you know it was a shit no one cares the thing is why should you care like do whatever you want to do but also you know like don't don't swing too hard the other direction either exactly it's gotta be it's got to be in the middle it's got to be like you you can't be you don't get special treatment now yes yeah well there's not only that like you don't we don't pretend you're amazing and beautiful and incredible in a hero and you know such a hero and so brave like okay we should we should respect your choice and we should you should live in a world where you don't have to worry about people getting upset that's the real problem the real problem is not that it's this amazing thing to do yeah the real problem is it should be able to be a 100% free choice that no one cares about and no one should fuck with you because you do it like no one should hate you because of your choice the real problem is that people hate them because their choice and then because that you want to say I am NOT like those people I think you're the most special unicorn that's ever existed in the world and you're amazing and you're my hero my hero foxes near the house okay okay okay maybe it's just you know yeah and people are operating from fear to or it's like they are starting to say like and a six-year-old can choose their gender and then and then have hormones they don't go through puberty yeah and that's when and that's when I think back to all those idiots that I would always disagree with where it's like stay away from my kids gay guy I'm like gay guys don't give a fuck about your kids but then when you think like oh my god the state could enforce my six year old a sex change you like that they can't do that they don't do that it's it has to be the parents right the parents have to bring the kids somewhere but it's the question is when is it old enough like is it okay when you're 18 man I don't think you should the fucking frontal cortex doesn't even get fully formed till you're 25 it's like what are you doing making big choices like if I had to go back and think about like some super important choices that I could have made when I was 18 whether or not I've been rational yeah I was essentially a monkey with a language I got thought like a monkey I acted like a monkey there's no way I should have been ever response especially something that could affect you for the rest of your life like the idea of the way you're 18 you get a tattoo like Jesus Christ this is like sterilizing yeah you know it's a sin also like an industry can pop up like my parents felt that way about circumcision and imagine like stay like they're like yeah you guys can be circumcised and you turn 18 so you can decide on your own that's not should being yeah it shouldn't even be you know what you should be able to do whatever you want to do when you can decide they're cutting off your ween part of your reign and you lose a lot of dicks this way folks okay people don't admit it but there's a lot of infections people lose their dicks every year babies lose their dicks because of this this is a fact it's not a lot in terms of like the actual numbers of people that are getting circumcised but it's a handful like you want to take that chance yeah risk reward on that you talk about propaganda saying it like you know you're always gonna have infection shit they were just trying to get an extra 500 bucks a clip how many babies do you think lose their penis every year from infection due to circumcision I say five in America I say five what do you say lose their dick because they've got affected from clipping yeah yeah I'm gonna say 11 11 11 okay full deck gems gonna pull well any parts even partial dick loss cut off the tip of your dick that times yeah that's just as fucked they're gonna reconstruct the tip of your dick yeah I feel like my wieners like you know I got like a worm they take your nose and they put it on the tip of your dick and they give you a rubber nose my nose my dick is sniffling the kid can't even make a fucking choice for himself I know it's happened before and one kid lost his penis in a circumcision accident and so they tried to transition him to being a woman and then he was suicidal and they turned it back into a man and he want to kill himself it turns out it's not all societal it was a famous case I forget the name of the boy who yeah I read that book yeah I forgot though yeah I forgot to which book was that I can't remember it was like a kid named Gary you know we won in 201 in 200 real bad wound infection serious one in 200 okay but how many of them lose their dicks I don't do studies and I saw study once that said that more teenagers than ever are engaging in anal sex and I thought about that I was like whoo oh fuck is doing that science like what scientist is sitting around like him which I study global warming asteroid impacts no how many of these kids are but fucking I need to get those but fuck numbers I need to get the numbers and who's gonna be honest it's like a it's like a Trump poll election right it's like who's gonna be like Gabon but fucking fucking same thing I think porn changed the game for all that shit like no one was yeah it did for sure you know everyone's pretty high level going into going into it now yeah yeah it's a total different experience it's too many people are watching too many people fuck now it's it's not the same experience it's freaking people out it is I had a similar experience to you with the with the play of in the woods we called spank Mountain everybody did dude that's where they were everybody found them in the woods man either that or you found him in like your friend's dad's garage yeah magazines tucked in a corner and some fucking fire hazards situation dude my buddy once traded a playboy for a gun magazine saying there was more nudes in it and I did it and I like looked through every fucking page and he was just layers I'm like I'm sure like I was that naive oh that's so funny yeah cuz it's like they couldn't exit the browser so they would have to like physically put it in words when they when they were disgusted at what they whacked it when I was twenty one of my friends found got ahold of one of those videos of women having sex with the animals it was like barnyard Betty or something like that right and it was a VHS tapes real scratchy fucked up copy of a copy of a copy be ashamed ripping machine so weird man so weird I remember all of us you know just becoming men you know 20 years old sitting there watching it over well I think it was someone's dad you know someone's parents house watching this fucking video going what are we even seeing here it was crazy my brother mislabeled aa Debbie Does Dallas Robocop and I was like Robocop and I just watched people fuck for like an hour and I was like what what like it was so intense I still remember those feelings of being like it wasn't like a rosal it was like arousal plus fear plus just confusion confusion yeah like white stuff coming out of a wiener I was like what the fuck is this also like you've never really seen people fucked before it's just like whoa that's how they do it yeah I thought I was like watch it go in and right watch them kiss whoo this is crazy and that was before fake tits right a lot of women didn't have the natural breasts back then yeah and that Bush - yeah they had Bush that asshole hair as well chaos down there that's why everything's a balance yeah it's an order man well as soon as people started looking at porn they start oh we could fix this you clean this up neato hack this off there hmm we need to make these bigger yeah that efficiency guy it's like oh I got sweet tits bigger gonna clean that up I'm gonna sell some product yeah yeah we brought in a cleaner a guy who comes in like Alec Baldwin yeah and Glengarry gun Ross all right is that coffee trim trim yeah yeah they change the whole game they're dead kids today I bet they have way more sex - with like tinder and all those things all those ways they can interact with each other like dating apps and shit see I want to know or maybe they're bored of it like it's so easy that they can't I think they're fucking up a storm really but is it like a pathetic like they didn't earn it it's like a trust fund versus doing it for sure yeah it's not like us well like we had to go hunt for it hunt yeah yeah get up early you know you had to make your coffee by the firelight I was in paper boy house get I was saving money buying stocks mmm it's not today these kids just swipe right and fuck say there's no stage show up places man and this cure for almost every disease now it's also an issue you know then you have to worry about warts anymore they just get shot up with that vaccine does that work doesn't that fuck girls up though I think it's bad for girls the vaccine is the wart vaccine really but I guess it's probably like the circumcision thing it's like one or two hundred probably look a similar number nothing's perfect man that's a problem it's all it's okay that's an order mash the Madeleine exactly chaos an order and there's no order it's all chaos it's like this order for moments there's attempted or yeah and it's only in like bleep brief little areas brief little patches of time in small areas yeah it's like the Joker and Batman like the Joker's like the progressive rats aiexander's Aaron he's like you're fucking confusing me you know it's like order and chaos nothing Batman fan you know I checked out Ben Affleck became Batman I never watched that one good I've always hated that guy good I don't hate the guy I don't know it's a strong word but I instinctively not liked him he seems like the type of guy that would work out and then like pretending worked out harder than he did you know I'm talking about yeah I know that guy you know that guy like we worked out fucking hard today did you really suck I did ten shrugs I did a farmer's walk with 20s no disrespect to him he's a great actor has been awesome in a lot of movies like the guy but as Batman I'm like you just had christian bale who looked like a real Batman come on jacked shredded I believed him I believe he's out there fighting crime I think I think Good Will Hunting was so good it made me not like him I don't I can't explain it he was something about me I don't like it's got to be something about me you've established that he was really good in that recent movie what's that recent movie I was a girl no no not that one where the girl was a murderer what the fuck's that called gone girl who he was good nice a great movie he was he was good what did you find out he did nothing Batman I brought this up cheers it's like a joke right look he's shown his abs in the movies he's directing right for CGI abs workout hug him doe see that you can see the lines here you don't see him here these are side by side I don't see anything in the right-hand side yeah now side by side he's got it well you can see how just a six-pack here to show him again at the beginning okay here's Ben Affleck without CGI ABS let's see shit that's like we just it's a quick it's a really quick cut this seems like hate and here's here's what the problem with this is in one view you're not gonna have abs because the guys core wasn't engaged in the other view the guy's doing a chin up and his core is engaged you fucking nerds don't even know what abs are so shut your mouth unless you're willing to earn those ABS to engage the core no more sugar I don't he looked thin enough and fit enough that I could imagine him having that six-pack I don't think it's CGI ABS good for him if it is people love to be hatin Hey well it's ever since 300 men ever been since everybody's like Joe that Gerard guys fucking jack yeah he was the most Jack guy that ever lived he's like a fucking he's like Frank Zane when he was competing in the Arnold Classic right Walker like Fight Club member Fight Club like that was really ripped mmm well that was Brad Pitt was rip back then there was 100% real like he wasn't there was no CGI back then they weren't I was a shit I don't think they could do that back then could they how long it was Fight Club 99 yeah they couldn't really do like CGI on bodies like the butler was CGI ABS yes interesting yeah yeah they just created them they're basically painted the shit out of their whole body I've got with that though I've given the option if someone's a guy I'm like yeah the movie though I mean kind of demanded it because the movie was this fantastic visual masterpiece where I don't I think you would have been thrown off of people had regular bodies like I 100% support it in that movie because like Xerxes was like 10 feet tall remember like the the Persian king yeah and then all the other people like everyone was totally jacked it was perfect cuz it was like very much like one of those illustrated books like a comic book super high-end graphic novel come to life is perfect I thought it was great because if everyone looked normal it would just be like sad 300 guys dying even if they were in shape if they looked like real people that are in shape you know some people have different body types some people just you don't see them even in there like fade or you don't see them with ABS even though he's like a big power yeah yeah yeah there's that's like that's the reality of humans there's a bunch of different kinds of body types triggered it was like archetype ol they wanted to make these like comic beautiful ways perfect men they nailed it they did awesome movies this shit I never saw the second one me neither once Gerard's dead I'm like why am I watching this the rise of the dead yeah no that's you gotta go Gerard you can't fuckin maybe you have a prequel bitch Omega you know code 200 before they got their last hundred yeah I mean could you have like a bunch of adventures this guy had before he got killed yes you have a childhood just fighting that cat and if I can cave yeah and once he gets cocky any wants too much money you go with him as a teenager you get a new guy yes some young dude yeah some young boy band type character but that has to be the end the end yes going past that it's just Justin Bieber stars in it he's 20 years old he's right in there - give him some fucking fake abs get the damn how much pussy Justin Bieber would get if he did that like it would be unmanageable he already is about alright this is Jimmy a simulation of what that would have looked like with the 300 guys verse twenty thousand so this is so this really did happen there really was 300 guys a lot of hate crimes happening right there 300 guys at how many thousand Persian twenty thousand twenty thousand Persian soldiers well that's not right it doesn't look right that does all good move your eyes oh my god that's why they called him a mortal's right cuz they just kept coming back there's so many of them you would have to be so good to beat all their asses they're probably beating their own asses waiting and getting on you you know this is blowing my mind that's like a Phish concert smell this is bad but in kind but over there oh my god so insane cuz a good job of that one the King of Kings series yeah Dan Carlin does a great job on everything but this this really is insane that this happened that they really did try to hold off all these people holy fuck what a sea of humans and it's not fair because they're they're fresh by the time they get to you you're you already beat down you fought killed seven dudes already but now yeah but now you have high ground just with bodies yeah a little bit that's really alive yeah nobody knows see that's how naive I am I'm what are we just buying it like I'm like oh shit this is exactly it I had this super STONER idea once that one day they would come out with a computer that is so powerful that it calculates the position this would have to be dependent upon a bunch of other technologies that are new like specifically the ability to monitor every single thing on earth in high-definition and then put all that information with some crazy supercomputer so you look at every object that is in every position wherever it is and somehow or another they could figure out how everything got there and through some super powerful AI that hasn't even been invented yet they would literally be able to recreate every single moment that have led to that happening right there like you get the math and just go backwards either we realized what at one point is a superstone or idea that I don't think it's real folks don't think you're so fucking stupid George doing how time works that's not what I mean but might this is my super stoner idea was that they would figure out computers that are so impossibly powerful and they can calculate and extrapolate and and and do this crazy sort of some sort of algorithm that figures out exactly how everything got to wherever it is and then you could recreate in some sort of visual form everything that's ever happened ever I think that's possible theoretically we're both so I we shouldn't be talking about this publicly totally possible but we'll never get there if we keep hiring 50/50 genders oh my god you're a misogynist I'm only kidding I saw a lot of people that said that guy was a misogynist that's that's like calling everybody a Nazi you can't do that you got to be careful because then you see a real Nazi and it's it's they're a different thing it's like the issue that I have with ten nine rounds an MMA sometimes a 10-9 round do get the fuck beat out of them and other times a 10-9 round it could be either one but you can't have a it's not the same thing yeah I have a new name for it and that's sort of how I feel terrible explanation terrible comparison rather but that's why I think about people calling someone a misogynist like a misogynist is someone who hates women if someone writes a page and a half of different ideas of how you can encourage women to get into tech and so they would be more represented that we you know like make it more interesting for them or nice to get them in that's not a misogynist it's the opposite of a misogynist I mean just because someone doesn't toe the current lefty liberal line doesn't mean that you're a misogynist you got to think about what this is saying no one's saying women can't do something no one's saying women are less qualified what he's saying is that women are more inclined to choose different things that's it and this is supported by science and it doesn't mean you hate women if you think that the reason why there is whatever the percentage is is 10 percent or 15 percent or 20 women in tech if that's represent e percent of the women who decide to go into college and decide to pursue a career are interested in it if that's if it's any other reason we need to examine it but if it's that reason then we should just like kind of accept it for what it is and try to make it easier for those women that work there I don't know how the fuck to do that I don't work in an office but I would imagine there's got to be ways you know I would imagine it just treat people with respect you know figure out a way to make that a priority in your office or a part of your business or the culture of your community yeah just focus on the individual not the group yeah you can't yeah all girls and all boys those things that's like all white people that does not end well it doesn't end well it's not a good way to differentiate whether you like someone or not if it's all girl or all boy or all white or all black or all anything you got to be open to possibilities especially when you're not saying like you know I need a fuck in a large white power lifter well you got to go to Iceland you know gay stuff with them Iceland dudes now that's not being discriminatory it's like you got very specific needs oh yeah those dudes you got to go to the north I need a Norwegian oh yeah yeah you gotta go to Norway yeah Rico that guy yeah you gotta need one of those dudes that works at Diggory do Oh have you read our sports gene by Epstein no I haven't no I haven't read that but there's there's like when it comes to sports it's so obvious yeah where it's like there's one area of Kenya where like all the winners of every marathon come from but but on the individual basis it doesn't mean anything you know like Cameron Haynes would beat 99.9999% of black people in long-distance running but that you'd have to get really long those little skinny African dudes that win marathons those guys are beasts you cannot fuck with those guys right when it comes to running a marathon those skinny dudes like that is the build for marathons and Cam's never gonna beat those guys yeah but you put him on a mountain where they got to go up like 9,000 feet of elevation and it's a three-day run he leaves all those motherfuckers in the dirt because it's a different build like his build is a muscle build - he's a built guy who does endurance sports and that's like a lot of the mountain runners like a lot of the people that do those crazy like the Bigfoot 200 there's a massive amount of like travel and elevation up and down you have to be strong it's not like it's not just flat ground and if you're like a really good flat ground runner it's a totally different build they're real skinny and that for them it's just about efficiency in motion and just mad cardio yeah it's also like oxygen consumption like that's why warm wet air wide nostrils you crush yeah but like if you're in you know where Kent where he's racing with dry cold air you need a lot more surface area that's not even these tight noses and saying something like that someone say all roses you're like now that's just a fact you know it's I stupid it's just is it racist as to their black guys have big dicks any more racist if it's good right that's isn't that the question that has been a question that has been is it a racial stereotype maybe and maybe it's triggering two guys who have regular-sized dicks that's that's who suffer where girls are psyched like finally got me up black one whoa can't wait for this ride and then it's like you take that goofy ride at Disney it's like Oh God you know you have kids take them to Disney is like a one roller coaster it's like Goofy's really cool like you're ready for that fucking California screaming we go upside down doesn't happen yeah it just hurts like it's like an Asian with a hammer or it's like oh he's a really good personality oh my god he has a monster in his pants like he's just constantly breaking stereotypes in a good way hmm reowww it's like the opposite for me with basketball like first pick suck it's like big man I'm like don't do it now it's a bad call constant letdown but when you got like the five to Muggsy Bogues guy it's like he's the greatest and I'm just a letdown yeah it's you know there's a bunch of people that are gonna be better at things in you whether it's better at math or it's better at music or it's better at whatever the fuck it is and there's going to be a bunch of people of all sorts of genders that are better than you at it and all sorts of ethnicities and all they come from all sorts of different parts of the planet and it's just it's not fair there's no fair involved no fair it's not it's so yeah I know it sucks I know it feels weird but there's no fair and evolved in European Jews winning more Nobel prizes than anybody there's no fair involved in that it's like what are they doing like how fuckin smart are they like what's goin on here like this is a crazy group of smart people right and crazy smart also culture you know that's calling on it like black redneck white liberals were my favorite books by Thomas all and like culture is everything you know and a lot of it has to do with rather not you herded animals or had a farm and that's the size of government you want you know hurts like it's the same with like certain Chinese people can count so well and they're so good at math because they just they it's it's one two three four five nine ten one ten to ten three so they never had thirteen fourteen fifteen that set us back a month and that like starts snowballing right you know same with uh like rice farming it's all about efficiency because it's year-round and you have like a little amount of land and then like so that makes you a little more efficient as a culture and that's not racial it just means like you guys fat value different shit yeah I mean you got a wonder how much of what a person is in 2017 how much of it has to do with all sorts of factors in influences that are completely out of your control and if a lot of it I'm inclined to believe it's most almost all of it has to do with things that are out of your control like why would you think that would be a good idea to be aligned with a group of one people that have one thing in common like you're white yeah or you're black or whatever the fuck you are it's it isn't it's a holdover from ancient times when we were tribal and we were worried about being invaded and everybody's thinking well there they are invading the RVing they're taking away our cultures taking away our history like just fucking relax alright no one's taken away shit you can't take away history first of all it's not like people are gonna forget and second of all like you're not here for very long man this is a short time you're wasting your time thinking about some stupid shit you if you're fucking super lucky you got a hundred years on this rock yeah a hundred and we're also externalizing pride yeah where it's like oh I need Trump to say this or I feel shame or pride it's like it should stem from your own accomplishments and yourself you know like pride like what do you have pride in you know I'm saying happy you did something difficult yes probably where it ends you know it should be happy that you're a good person and uh you know you should be happy that you you have a lot of friends and that you enjoy each other's company and you can make them happy and they can make you happy and that you you enjoy seeing them you should be happy about accomplishments and you know good interactions that you successfully navigated through with people that maybe could have gone badly you know those are always great those are always good feelings when clear the air with somebody and you give a big hug at the end of it and everybody feels better yeah those are things to be happy about but people are happy about stupid shit you're happy about what that you both like swastikas how about those dudes showed up with guns they showed up with guns like full full-on open caring walking the street with military outfits on flak jackets machine guns showing up while they're taking down this fucking statue yeah it's a it's definitely form of mental illness where it's like you're living out trauma that it doesn't really apply to your life well there's no real war for these people now okay is this in at least where they're standing so because there's no real war they're bringing guns and they're turning something they're ramping up although the power and the pressure of this moment I didn't see the what happened on the side of the left but I heard that they were doing some horrible shit to people too and there was a lot of punching and people were fucking beating the shit out of each other and there's piles on top of each other the violence all escalated I have no idea who started who I don't know I have no idea I have no idea if the police were at fault there's a lot of people that believe that the police should have separated them and they did not they didn't do anything about it they allowed it to escalate and they just stood back while it escalated like they didn't have the power the manpower to go in and enforce some sort of civility that's tragic it's horrible man I mean they might not been prepared for it they might not have the resources I mean how many fucking people are working there I mean there was how many thousands of people showed up with torches yeah it was like the opposite of Woodstock yeah well it's like the worst possible too many people and I think a lot of times people need a purpose you know I got friends with a lot of vets and like they have you know PTSD and all this stuff and and a lot of them just want to purpose cuz like idle time makes them crazy you know I think there's a lot of people right now that don't feel any purpose so they're like listening to chat rooms rather it's Isis or not Caesar hey we have a purpose for you you're more than just your like possessions yeah and then that's when things become horrifying yeah yeah and you listen I know people get mad where we're talking about this people on both sides if you have a group of people and you all show up with the same torch you're a bunch of fucking assholes why do you have torches did you get listen go to fucking re F so is it is it re F oh yeah Joey Diaz go to Ari I get a headlamp bro there's so much better than torches if you're really concerned with seeing at night okay I love myself I have this shit they have three different things you can make them strobe sometimes I got a good one I think it's a black diamond I think that's naming the company I wear it when I go hunting I put that fucker on my hat and it's awesome I clicked that sucker and I could walk around with no problem and the batteries in this thing they're tremendous they last forever why the fuck do you need fire why you protected is that like some intimidation tactic or you want to bring us back to the days but we didn't have fucking electricity and you had to walk down the street with a torch yeah they're almost intentionally being like we're backwards it is exactly like that headlamps whether they realize it or not it is fucking stupid it's symbolic it's symbolic of Robert Lee stop stop you in a bad pattern man you're in a bad pattern you're not a bad person don't get stuck in this don't let this define you you're just a person and any one of us could have got stuck in a shit pattern that's all it is that's what being a racist is it's not being a realist ah there's assholes of all colors and genders and everything all persuasions there's assholes across the board and there's also a lot of nice people you just gotta figure out a way to navigate away from the douchebags and don't be one of and as soon as you show up with a fucking torch yelling white pride you taking off your shirt to show your Nazi tattoo like dude do it the Nazi flag is literally a red flag it's the worst thing you do to your body to show that you're a part of like one of the worst groups ever in human history you're part of this that randomly discriminates against Jews and wants to kill them and throw them in ovens that's what they did you gotta let that go you little mustache go you gotta let the swastika go that you can get by without a swastika tattoo you really can yeah drive you'll be a happy person this pressure my right big friend Germany right before the war I have the right to be part of the group that clearly fucking sucks at everything no no didn't suck at first good idea for some good early policies it got out of hand he built the Autobahn bro got out and after a while he started taking adderall right after they've made the Nurburgring bringing those old out east around those corners it's like what's he made a fucking 50-mile missile it was bad it's just wasting time they should get into bowling they could be in a bowling just as much they're into like US history Confederate histories important part of my life bowling is everything to me the same person yeah the same thing so true Gobbo hunting man it's way more fun yeah get into a hobby that's listen to your new hobby I'm the pod it's like I'm the same way like oh I'll teach myself like a very hard Beethoven song and that allows me to be like disappear and have a hobby and a purpose yeah like these like goal oriented purposes like listen to you talk about like getting into archery and like loving it and like you know the little amounts of weight on a arrow and stuff and I'm like I need it reminds me of hobbies it's fascinating man all hobbies to me are the same thing in that what you're trying to do is try and like focus on something and get better at it and get figure out what it is it makes this thing good you know and it's the same thing it's like it's an extra mean obviously they're not the same activity but it's the same thing in that it's a focus it's an avenue for your mind and I feel like it's like cross-training I feel like when you get involved in hobbies and you really get it as long as you manage them healthfully where you don't let them take over your life getting better at a thing like chess or jujitsu or whatever it is gets you better at the entirety of your life as long as you look at the entirety of your life in balance and you don't let it run away from you because I've let it run away from me for a bunch of times I think we all have to stand up - oh yeah like you're like just learning Spanish I'm trying to teach myself Spanish I have a whole new 10 minutes I'm the gender of nouns like that I wouldn't have even thought of if I'd only spoke English my whole life yeah that's a good point that's yeah I mean that's another a totally different take on things right looking at it from the point of view of like any sort of Latin art or Latin language and Laluna why is the owner woman then you go through the whole thing yeah it's like which doesn't have any gender assignment at all on nouns and then for them it's everything you have to remember like what everything is if it has a dick or a pussy I wonder if they're triggered all day all day all day like everybody's like super upset all this gender classification what about non-binary folks in Latin countries they just must be spiraling what about gender fluid like who are you el senor or la senorita who are you what desert it's like sir Presidente sir hmm they don't buy that shit over there now and they don't even think about it's fun doing it in Pasadena and shit cuz it's like a lot of like Mexicans haven't even thought about that just so second nature it's almost like having someone describe our culture to us and being high noise shit we put silicon in chicks fucking boobs you know well the butt things more disturbing to me for some reason yeah the new trend in fake butts I saw a girl just two days ago at the hotel it looked like she had a diaper on it was insane she was walking around by the pool I was like this is the craziest fucking she had some dress on and some so preposterously proportioned buttocks I was like listen you can't just do that you can't just do that like what are you doing here this is crazy do the floats it definitely asked you if it's all fat the ones that are doing it now apparently what they do is fat grafting that's the same word I use when I describe welding fenders on a Porsche you graft offender yeah they call they called fat grafting so they take fat they lipo you like they take fat I get one if him tell you to get fat first listen just give you excuse up just beat the fuck up eat a lot of pasta get get crazy and then they lipo you and then they tuck all that shit in your ass just thicken that beast up whoa and they have to they have to like smooth it out to they don't want it too lumpy yeah make sure you do a good job it probably makes air travel better like do you think that like you're also shit yeah you bounce café or for sure like he'd be like everywhere you go you're sitting on a water balloon you're always engaging the core yeah you'd be like yoga bubbles alright those those balloon things yeah I sit on one of those things those balls those exercise balls dad to it it'd be like all day long you're sitting on a giant yoga balloon like swimming I feel you drown like you're an asset just be like a buoy movies and just women that drown cuz their ass but we show me some here young Jamie what do we got here this is what you do okay so the you suck it out of even though the thighs the thighs in the upper middle back area they suck it out of there and then pump it in your house give me some before after son look at that hold on go back to that picture Jesus look at that I don't like ass and surgery I don't like those two words together I don't think I think ass surgery if someone says that to you go all dude I'm so sorry you got to get a surgery no no I want to know it's funny bro what you want to get a surgery identify the jiggly fucking pillow I want plumper rump just gonna be honest with you and you can never get mad at that point if someone cat calls you it's like you literally are just throwing blood at Tigers at that point the girl on the right okay she didn't get crazy she was just a little conservative of in her approach it's like she almost like photoshopped like she took a little off the sides and put in our button like mmm I kind of see what you did there but I have to do is CrossFit okay oh but did you see that video of that girl doing that clean and she falls and it hits her neck and she cry I'll send it to you it's dark dude she get hurt oh yeah yeah yeah yeah she got fucking heart she got hurt man for sure guaranteed it's not good hey let me see we're gonna find it here Eddie Bravo sent it to me today but it's been all over uh it's been all over Twitter did it fall on her now yeah dude she cleaned it and it landed like literally on her neck it was horrific oh that's just Eddie by himself alone second I'm so sorry what I'm so sorry it's rough dude yeah that's really rough here it is I got it I'm gonna send it to young Jamie err hold please GTG copy link oh no you can say share right can't do that that fucked up hold on this is a really awesome part of the show this is my favorite part it's called Joe isn't not really talking very well cuz he's sending Jamie something that he needs to see all right there we go I said yeah I tweeted I sent it to your phone was it like every way out here I should right put it up yes no no that's not her I think more than one chick has done that I'm sure here I'll email to you so you could play it on the thing it's I got it okay it's horrible man it sounds wicked horrifying watch she gets it up in the air and then she loses control of it and drops it down and I don't know if she's doing yeah it says CrossFit look at this watch she gets up oh man yeah not good dude not good look at this that girl could have died for sure for sure she could have been paralyzed she's okay apparently luckily cuz the bar is larger than her you know the but the plates are larger than her body so as it falls the plates hit the ground the thing pipe bounced off the ground was probably rubber so she was alright but food that's not good yeah and that's you know that's the issue that a lot of people have with you know people getting really crazy with those kind of Olympic lifts and things along those lines you got to be real careful with that shit you know it's um it can go wrong you know it's one of the things I really love about kettlebells like I've never had that kind of shit happened to me with kettlebells never lost one I'd lift pretty happy with them but I've built up to it over the years and I never go to failure like what I'm doing is like it's hard and makes you stronger but this like that it's not gonna make you that kind of strong like that kind of clean press squat strong that's a that's a fucking high level strong but boy that's so strength Pacific and it's super dangerous yeah yeah and kettlebells more applicable to your life like now like I literally am swinging my baby like it's a kettlebell and I'm like oh wow that gym work really made me a better dad I do Turkish get ups with my kids which ones that Turkish get ups you lied on your back gonna press them gonna sit up nice get up and I'll hold them up it was way easier when they're babies bro it's hard now yeah like that it's like it's like we're adding weight to the baby I carry my kids around all the time to that's one thing I do I go hiking I'll throw my kids on my shoulders so it's like my 9 year olds like 50 pounds 53 pounds so I carry our pills that's legit it's good it's good workout like I kind of have like a little slightly wide hips which kind of like a woman so we're like halfway so if you went the other way it'd be quick quick transition yeah but I'd still be six seven and like just not good at basketball big sexy woman hippy but like with the baby though I'm like oh I can this is why women have these that's why they have them out yeah it's not to carry them around still if they had a pouch like a kangaroo or in the hip and it grew out when I write when they got pregnant its talked a little kid right there Debbie amazing yeah they just walk a little sideways limp kids sitting right there yeah cause like my wife's like chiseled now from just holding the baby oh yeah you get jacked yeah you're carrying around a bit of weight all day it's like you're doing stuff like boxers use hand weights they're only like two pounds you know yeah ankle ones yeah use those for kicks we used to use those and people like I gonna fuck your knees up you know cuz if you kick hard with ankle weights on you fuck your knees up so we always ever but now that I'm older I'm like oh no you wouldn't just do it right yeah did definitely make you stronger kitten calendar on showed me you kicking a bag and it was unbelievable to watch we're like onset of solvent in Sunnyside dude look at this and here's just wham wham and I remember just being like fuck man that's just skill I'll never have it I really enjoy watching that that's a skill that I don't even believe I have I don't believe it's real like it's crazy it's one of those things where whenever I go to work out and like do this like it doesn't seem like I should it was like a machine guy there's just BAM dad I'm like that's a 30 clip right there well I just do it all the time but even even to this day like I still it's weird because I grew up doing it and it's like so I kind of barely remember learning it it's like me a piano like I'm playing Bach and I'm like so your fingers just find the keys and I'm such like I'm just I'm like retarded dude I'm playing like the craziest songs ever written we made this video because Eddie Bravo had always seen me do this and he would tell people and they would go shut the fuck up you know cuz everybody always thinks that everybody everybody's always exaggerating about their friend who does something you know whatever the fuck it is and so he was always like talking to me about dads about martial arts kicking and I was like well there's a lot of like problems with some of the way some people kick and I would explain it to him and then I would like show him on a bag and he'd be like what the fuck like how long have you double do this I'm like I've been doing this my whole life like how do you not it like this is crazy I can't believe you can do that it's muscle memory well it's just I grew up doing it you know it's just a part of how my body moves but because I don't really remember learning it it does feel weird it feels it feels like I'm not sure I really can do it until I do it then every time I do it I go oh yeah yeah I'm like the shock and awe of a kick oh it's horrible like even if there's someone that is more of my speed if they just bust out a big kick I'm like yeah it's alright yeah my wife you know she's a bitch especially leg kicks man if you like see like a really good like Muay Thai fighter and you watch someone kick someone's legs it's so horrible like the sound it makes and the power it has I see that in the UFC all the time it was still to this day one of the hardest because I'm like god dammit I don't think people are appreciating how that is like that hurts like that other guys in pain right now he's just got an awesome poker face like he just got ate up with that kick and then by the time a guy does start to show it you like oh no he's done Brad his legs are gone I've always wondered that like they just don't show it right cuz that yeah oh for sure the toughest men in the world if in women you know if you if somebody who is not trained got kicked like that yeah and like well I want to feel what it feels like and like you let someone like tyron woodley or something a UFC welterweight champion let him leg kick you you lift you leg up and you check it like you would you try like they're trying to hit the meat they blow they could be trying to hit low - that's actually more recently a much more used tactic is the low leg kick where they're attacking like literally like right above the ankle yeah nasty and they clip right about the ankle with your shin and it just swells up real bad on a lot of guys you can't you don't really condition that area like over low by the ankle but the thigh you can condition you can take a few shots and then the other thing you do is as the shots coming in you lift your leg up a little bit and kind of turn your foot out and so the idea is that your shin and your thigh take the brunt of the hit instead of just the meat of the thigh can you help bone density or zach yeah it helps bone density it actually what it is is as you keep having impact over and over again a bunch of things happen one is a bunch of little micro fractures that happen they heal up and it gets harder yeah also there's a calcification that happens cuz there's a lot of bleeding like a lot of those guys like if you feel their shins though I Jesus Christ like hard like a rock man yeah this is dude malla pet there's a bunch of those dudes um that are fighting in mow time that can kick through baseball bats yeah it's it's super common like all those high-level guys can most likely kick through a baseball bat it's hilarious when you watch them do it too because it looks so terrifying yeah another animal just like that's a dub yeah they've made their shins so fucking hard and they kick so hard they could just smash right through things so go for the guy like that is kicking your leg you're in a nightmare it's it's a terrible place to be yeah I played football suck would you talk about brain injury sometimes I'm like man I'm gonna end up crazy because I used to take so many hits to the head yeah this I forget this gentleman's name but watch watch him do this he's warming up right there and here he comes oh he just snapped that baseball bat in half fuck all that I forget that guy's name he's a famous uh see if you could get his name cuz he's a famous yeah Mel Tripp milk has named El Chorro men nor I hope I'm saying his name right but he's a Muay Thai coach I'm one of the seasons of The Ultimate Fighter the early days but real respected Muay Thai fighter and coach there's a bunch of guys who could do that it's a real common move actually with Muay Thai fighters that kick through baseball bats here's another one so that's that's a broken shin bone not for him for you and me yeah this guy's gonna kick through it while he's got like a cord attached to his leg did a sports science on oh dude what in the fuck dude who's that ooh same guy yeah so he doesn't all the time that guy's probably busted a hundred bats if that guy kicks you it would hurt so bad oh my god one of the worst things that's ever happened to you and then everything else it's like your basement flooding it's like what can you do and you don't have a foot to stand well you can't punch either you like your punches are they become like these windmill arm punches you can't pivot off your foot you know you can't place weight on it you're in agony it's like ready to give out and they don't show it yeah well a lot of them don't yeah a lot of them have an awesome poker face like it takes a while so cool it's the hardest probably the hardest sport to ever compete in I'd be like fuck if it's not the hardest sport to compete you know I'd like to know what it is it's gotta be it's one of them cuz strength endurance mental ability you know you're basically a quarterback and a running back and a linebacker at the same time the only thing that I would think might be harder to do is those ultra marathons when those dudes are running like like we're talking about the big foot 200 those dudes are running 200 pounds that might be harder to do than an MMA fight like if you thought of the amount of people that could fight in an MMA fight versus the amount of people that could run for 70 eight hours in a row on 205 miles how many hmm I think it's it's close real close they're different things obviously because one of them is dealing with getting your ass kicked but the other one is dealing with your own demons like your demons are wanting to quit demon and the the how much did you prepare did you prepare properly what about the disciplined demon you know the fuck off demon that tripped up the discipline demon and you didn't get in good enough shape to really run 205 miles in 78 hours that's just insane man verse self versus man versus man yeah it's interesting the white whale versus a war movie you know it's like you're bowing it's like golf I always see plate I've never played golf but like they say you play yourself it's all about yeah yeah yeah it makes sense I mean you always get the shot right you get your own shot you set it up on the tee you get to whack moving around nobody's like knocking it out of the way for you it's not like pool they're not like hiding the ball on you right just you've ourselves know 78 hours I can't fucking crazy that might be harder might be harder than MMA fight cuz yeah cuz they're resilient I just can't even picture being awake that long like I've been up for 40 hours and like I'm listening you definitely hallucinate people hallucinate when they run when they run those races yeah I was hearing that guy on your show know the one about the baby in Everest oh yeah that was my friend Ben O'Brien yeah that was altitude sickness and altitude sickness and some sort of a probably a stomach bug and the two of them together and he was just again tripping balls he saw a baby saw a wolf that didn't really exist like he was out of it I feel like like if people aren't reacting to a giant baby that you see that would be the crit like it's like you guys don't see this giant baby who'd feel like such a fucking idiot you be like oh no what do I do now like that hits so many levels of primal shit like take care of the baby you know but also like what the fuck is going on with this baby oh fuck a baby just in the woods imagine fear just walking through the woods you find a baby what do you do with your deep in the woods do you take the baby I feel like you got it all right if you take do you have to sit with the baby and go hello I found a baby hey anybody babies right here but whoever but if you steal the baby it's like you piece of shit I was just going to the bathroom took my fucking kid they called out down some crazy hood rat having a baby in the taking shit in the woods yeah baby thank you baby in wilderness you should take the baby right yeah you should just plop you know the baby down on the ground right next to where your shit keep an eye on them and don't shit on them yeah I mean there's a holes and raccoons and all the things we've been discussing every but you're like talking about shame of shit next to a baby with no memory yeah I'm saw a good argument that's a terrible argument yeah you gotta watch those babies man look who you're saying like how your wife started to get like really like concerned about things when she had kids yeah yeah that's what this normal natural thing that's why we we get so freaked out when someone leaves their kid in a car like what you left a baby in the car by itself oh you're you're not doing this right yeah that's when I really get triggered like if I do like child abuse stuff that's what I'm like that's what I think people are describing what triggered I literally get angry oh yeah sure child abuse stuff for sure yeah you see someone yanked their kid I saw some lady kick her kid in a video online chic it was a baby like a two-year-old she's kicked it like hard and the kid stiffened up like probably got Kayode it was horrible horrible to see campus crawling around the ground and she just kicked it don't pull it up please okay so you type it and like you something use um it's just that stuff is triggering right same with dogs like there was this video some chick on a subway just hitting a dog and I'm like you know that just makes it like it triggers everything in me that protects weakness mm-hmm I'm like that they can't protect themselves what about Oscar I'll punch the shit of an ostrich yeah how about the beach hockey they get cocky on you don't start pecking you dude even my chickens will come at me they'll be like super scared and then they'll start being a dick but if you have bare feet they'll go for your toes yeah I think they might be able to eat at oh my brother fed a chicken which is a hot dog that is fucked yeah yeah that's how you get mad chickens do they have mad chicken disease probably like it's like upset chicken it's like not quite as bad we're on Fear Factor I got attacked by an ostrich not really if I was like an exaggerator I would say to attack me but definitely took a swing at me if you're a buzz feed you were attacked I grabbed his neck I was like bitch get the fuck out of here like it came close enough for how to do listened and then push it away from the fans they try to fuck you fuck you up rather they try to get some fucking they don't want you they're like bitch cuz they can like take a person kind of right they're not a small animal you know and what's interesting is they have red meat they have ostrich burgers that you get at Fuddruckers and they're quite delicious and they're actually very high in protein like much higher in protein I think than beef I think they're up there with like wild game like in the neighborhood like maybe not why not maybe not like like wild moose or something like that but in the neighborhood like getting closer than that than it is to like beef and it's real lean but it's weird because it's like essentially again it's a fucking dinosaur yeah dies and you think like this gonna be like chicken no it's not only chicken no it's red it's a red meat it's a fucking crazy old Raptor who do you like ostrich kangaroo who do you got money on dude that's a good question the kangaroo clearly cuz they'll choke you kangaroos with choke you plus they sit back on their tail and they fucking punt you right you know I don't think an ostrich can fuck with that ostrich is gonna try to kick the kangaroo the Kangaroos only bitch you simply can't sit back on your tail bro it's like a guy who took like oh look at this this is kangaroo versus an ostrich this is an actual fight that's it really it's an emu but oh it's an email it's close enough took if it is like a kangaroo right so it's a kangaroo in an email not an ostrich I thought an emu was like a peacock I don't know shit oh there's a guy who that thing looks scary see I would have my money I don't know though it was bigger for sure yes yes email huh yeah but that's a little ass kangaroo that's true that kangaroos small they have big giant kangaroos man some dude got fucked up by a kangaroo recently well this is a crazy little fight here the emus all goofy he's like shucking and jiving well fake moves trying to fake him out he's a girl kangaroos like I'm taking this food bitch this is my food and the EMU is like our motherfucker I'm taking that food ok the emos like literally like a Star Wars bird it doesn't even look real like there's a shaggy Ness in that it looks like it would fight like giraffes to like just with its neck just like yeah well you might be right it's like it's like scary and like precious at the same time it's like Hello it's the same posturing yeah I'm not making a move come on bitch it's like a fancy who try to stomp their shit technique I browsed the kangaroo I just charged this bitch well this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing I'm just gonna move in on this there's three of them yeah but if you I bet if you smack one of them the other two are just gonna [Laughter] is there contact I don't know I don't think something's a bitch-ass fight didn't he get one of those big angry kangaroos that's a little tiny baby kangaroo form yeah the end of the day that kangaroo got all the fucking leaves stupid birds need to step the fuck back to respect the superiority of the mammal I'm on team mammal I don't give a fuck I think people should all be lumped in together as one unit but it's us versus them when it comes to mammals yeah I'm at breast feeding big the man regret glad yeah if you have an egg your kid comes out of an egg the fuck guys get out of here you're not part of the conversation it's so old that's like driving around and some sort of a horse buggy you know this hipster shit hipsters imagine if your wife gave birth to an egg so I sit on it and wait just sit there keep that egg warm yeah it was like the penguin yep penguins are like almost like a frog like the in-between bunker there that is why they have to keep the baby on their feet remember that they put the baby up high and therefore otherwise it'll freeze if it touches the ground yeah the the environments that they're like smart social that's like nature just telling you look dude Europe contributions are really not valuable okay we're barely accepting this model still right there watch for the tuxedo you guys are out there essentially population control for local fish and their food for leopard seals that's their position just keep keep making those babies keep it hold onto those eggs it's a niche now and the dude that's so it's a weird society because the dude has to take care of the egg interesting yeah the chick takes off gets a bunch of fish stuffs in her fat face comes back but it's a long ass haul and during this long ass haul the dude has to take the egg and sit it on his feet nice and he's got to protect it from the snow on the ground the blizzard-like conditions and those are gender roles not gender see that's a holding on to the egg and then the babies are about to be born baby like I'm out of here bitch yeah actually what that those are modern they're very modern Birds cute little fuckers alright just cuz I'm a man doesn't mean I can't sit on my fucking leg it's just weird because they're almost defenseless it's like nature's saying like you can't even fly dude no you can well yeah when you're on the ground you can't move fast we want you like lumbering barely you have to give birth on the ground the only time you can get away from anything is when you're in the water but you're rarely in the water so stay on the ground and be vulnerable yeah with a walk it's so absurd if you played like a tuba it's like a comedy yeah there's not a penguin alive that I couldn't beat in a race I could be drunk and I'll beat them I'm like c'mon pussy already said go fuck you absurd animals cuz there's no but they do have predators though how come it's not just like they're not wiped out leopard seals are they jack them but they can only eat so many leopard seals are fucking huge man there's a leopard seal killed a photographer a few years back it was the first time ever was there which is weird because uh they're apparently they're very intelligent too and they've actually brought photographers and divers they brought them seals I'll kill a seal or a penguin not a seal a penguin they'll kill a penguin and bring it over to a photographer try to like the photographer come on man eat less hungry and if you like tried to help them and like they've hung out with him for days on end it's really some amazing footage of those things but as far as I know the they very very rarely attack people and that was the only incidents that I had ever heard of where they had killed somebody it was pretty recent like within the last ten years I think well they don't look real man I'm gonna teeth on that thing look at that fucking teeth in that thing yeah she opened her mouth and her head was twice as large as a grizzly bears head what in the fuck man like how come when we were kids we never heard about this look at the size of that fucking thing so this is the this is the the leopard seal that was trying to feed the photographer so the photographer what is your site Jamie I just Sun imager it's just a series of pictures you can find it folks I have faith in you but they're worth looking at these photos are amazing this creature doesn't look real like look at the face on that thing with the teeth it looks like that the thing from neverending story like the smiling yeah well it's like hey man you want some fish and just think about the mass oh yeah with a face that's twice as large as a grizzly bears head what what just think about how fucking big a grizzly bear is dude that's twice as big it's like this enormous avatar demon that lives in the water and eats penguins they're amazing they're amazing I mean it's just one of the most astounding and an overlooked underappreciated animals in the ocean yeah I never know any of this until right now it's a fucking mammal you know I mean look at that thing just chill in there it's like smiling it's okay it's fucking a huge killing machine man probably need a penguin I got a guy I mean when you think about seals what do you think of you think all those cute little fellows they hang I don't need some fish not this motherfucker this is a murdering machine and it's the biggest one right so this is a big-ass giant seal that just kills shit what like do they hang with the other type of seals or is they wonder if the other seals have like websites dedicated to shitting on the leopard seals oh sure about slipper privilege yeah privilege and Prejudice all of it it's so real it's the most real thing in the world you know what's fucked up is like sexism does exist you know shit thinking does exist like real hard line dopey right-wing ideology does exist but when you pretend that ideas that oppose you are those things that all the ideas that are posed you are super alright and like that's one of the things they've been doing Jordan Peterson recently oh it's crazy a sees these these the authors of these articles about him and then of Charlottesville all these different things they have him lump Jordan Peterson have him lumped in but actually not Charlottesville because of the Google memo have him lumped in with far-right they called him a far-right conservative it's just not true there's not sure but it also muddies the water so there's no meaning and then call them all right like you it's not alright he's goddamn he's a professional intellectuals literally a genius he's absolutely a genius and a kind person from what I've heard a very kind very sweet guy I really I really enjoy talking to him he's genuine and he has real concerns about all these things and I think very valid concerns in particular about people wanting to enforce their ideas on other people and make people behave a very certain way and there's a real inclination that people have for that they really do and you're seeing that with Charlottesville I mean part of the reaction to all this stuff part of the reaction to all this stuff is realizing that this these this kind of thinking can exist right that this this shit that you didn't expect to see can just pop up like that like I almost think we have to see it to know it's real yeah because I thought a lot of this was gone like I'm just fairly naive about it because I you know I hear people overuse these words all the time and I'm like now these people are gone we beat these people we don't even let them adopt highways you know how a man you call other people Nazis that aren't that it fuck's the whole thing up that's not a Nazi that's a Nazi right here they are and you have to be able to identify it's also extremely shitty to people that have been victims of actual Nazis were you like Oh a micro like a micro aggression at Brown isn't my fucking grandmother in an oven that's not the same thing these other words two men you don't I mean the problem is that it's an indefensible word you call someone a Nazi and it's indefensible you put them on their back heels and they have to deal with that well that sort of noid me about the right when I was a kid was a sinner or like James because of Gina well it's like it's a conversation ender and that's why I saw almost that flip where now I see the left doing it where it's like racist it's like dude we're arguing about like a proton like what does this even mean it's just like a way to end a conversation and I'm like it's starting to get yeah it's starting to act like a religion exactly well it's like white guilt is original sin and then being woke is baptism and veganism is kosher and it's starting to line up Kurt Metzger I do love Kurt yeah a great guy yeah he grew up Jehovah's Witness so you know he's super resistant to any like enforced ideology and he was like no no no I've seen this before you can't tell me what's right is wrong or right is left and left his ride he's like I know what you're doing I've seen this before I've seen this when I was a Jehovah's Witness and I was like that's exactly what it's like it's like this enforcing this and in silencing debate like there's there was one of the things that was talked about in the Google memo that I thought was fascinating was that certain subjects are too sacred to be discussed and that that is one of them like gender in tech and apparently I don't work at Tech obviously but in gender and specific like any any woman's issues you're not supposed to discuss them as a man and any men's issue discussed by a woman is like the thought of a woman trying to steal your money or come on sneaked your divorce laws or you know we don't want anybody having any opinion whatsoever about aside of they're not on and that limits growth and it's the opposite of science like scientists science is skepticism the whole thing is asked why until you hit a wall you know it isn't like do not address this and people get labeled toxic and just kicked out toxic is a dumb one it's fool texted someone toxic masculinity and by the way there's a lot of like women that are like evolutionary psychologists that know a shitload more about men than even men do right yeah sure they do and you got to listen to them if they're explaining the actual evolutionary mechanisms that have caused human beings to behave a certain way why more men are inclined to favor of specific activities and you look at all the different numbers and variables that you look at in terms of like how many more men died on the job how many more men picked you know difficult job and also like this weird thing that we're doing where we're like trying to pretend that things are different than they really are to sort of support your point better like that's one of the things that people do with the gender pay gap right they always want to say well the gender pay gap shows is real prejudice between men no no it's not what it shows at all I mean I think it shows that women and men choose different jobs and when I told a good buddy of mine that he didn't believe it he was like there's no way I go that's what the gender pay gap is he goes no I thought it was like women and men doing the same job and the woman makes 77 cents on the dollar no no no that would be horrible right that's not what it is they choose different jobs yeah and look at men and women doing the same job though the difference is very small and when he found that he was angry he was like are you fucking serious happen to me I got path gets it you get mad because you hear the President President Obama was talking about that on television surely someone must have alerted him mr. president this is a disingenuous line of thinking mr. president this is nonsense this is not real okay it's like they took every man and woman and just put a line at the 50th percentile and anyone who knows anything about math that's insane yeah like there's so many factors just the factor of having a child oh yeah like so then you quit for 10 years you come back you're gonna make less money that all goes into the pay gap thing or if you even quit for a few months I mean you know whatever it is at the time you have to take off that's going to and then women work less frequent hours they'll work less hours rather they take less overtime it doesn't mean that they're not just as good at a job as a man is at a job it just means that overall they're probably gonna earn less money in that sort of scenario they choose different jobs they work less hours that's just I'm not saying that that's the you know they don't get some sort of discrimination I wouldn't want to be a chick work with a bunch of dudes yeah I wouldn't want to be that that's a different I think women working with God I think they'll be terrible especially attractive if you're attractive women you got to work with like ten dickheads at some stupid fucking UPS office I bet it sucks I bet those guys are annoying as fuck yeah they say stupid shit about you behind your back you know I'm sure it's horrible but that's a different argument hundred percent it's not it's not saying okay we're not saying that there's not some discrimination I'm sure there is but that's not saying that that's happening in tech to the point where there's a reason why there's ten men and four women that's not that doesn't necessarily make sense and as soon as you do that like what you said equality of outcome exactly yeah that's the perfect way to describe it yeah because it guarantees that you're gonna have a problem and it also the biggest victim or women that feel like they have to be a CEO and they're a mom to be like normal and it's like that's an impossible position to put somebody in yeah well it's like if your instinct wants a child but you don't want to slip at work at all it's like dude workings for puds like my wife made life with her body and I'm just like I'll do the funny bone here's more money it's like I agree but I also could see it from the point of view from a woman it doesn't want that no of course probability just the fact they have a womb is gonna affect probability you know even percent yeah if it's 1% I would never tell a woman that she has to have kids or like not pursue any life that they want not at all I don't think anybody should tell anybody what to do I mean that's the whole all this but I think we should also stop pretending that there's not some sort of meritocracy going on when it comes to most corporations and most jobs you know whatever discrimination that there is boy I really hope that gets routed out so we can concentrate on what's important and what's important is people finding something they enjoy and doing it without discrimination and doing it without you know having to deal with too much resistance from the people that you're doing it with you know that's that's a harmonious life right find something you love find some sort of a path of least resistance to get to it we could really enjoy it and participate in it hopefully with like-minded people like one of the things that I've always been really happy about the store and about stand-up comedy in general is that they're it's a brotherhood and a sisterhood like when Whitney Cummings comes around the comedy store she's as much my brother or sister as any of the other guys is Andrew Santino is any of these guys we're our family they're course that there's not a whole lot of us there's very few and if you get through and you're funny if you're Sarah Silverman or you know name that person you're treated with the same amount of respect that guys are at least I would hope at least in the circles of the people that I enjoy you are yeah at least you're I mean you're held up to the same standards as well you know and you're you're also like like you ask people like who's funny the way we like funny people yeah you know like if you say like you know hey do you see Sarah do her said in the main room holy shit did she fucking crush dude like people tell you inside there's no sexism when it comes to that it's a total results-based appreciations yeah yeah it's like fighting and commies the same way the stakes are so high you develop a no-nonsense vibe where it's like dude bombing sucks so like I can't say like I have to just be like what joke is funny like I can't do the nonsense just like with fighting it's like well if you commit to just you know Taekwondo and not do the full package of jujitsu and all that shit like you're at a disadvantage so it's like that like that that identity can hurt you if you don't branch out and like what works you know I don't know shit about fighting obviously but I've just heard you talk about like just that well-rounded grappling and striking and all that shit like it the stakes are so high that you can't really be nonsense the only other option has got to be a specialist at such a high level that you're better than everybody else at one thing like you get that with this guy Damien Maia who just lost actually two guys more well-rounded ironically but he's been able to beat so many world-class fighters just because he's so amazing at jujitsu gets a hold of guys drags him to the ground and either strangles them or gets really close to strangling them to the point where he dominates all the exchanges he's done that with like I think you beat six or seven guys in a row and really good guys by really like Carlos Condit former interim welterweight champ it strangled him got him on the ground choked him out so it's like there's a few guys that can do that but for the most part you got to be able to do everything and I think if you have blind spots when it comes to like things that you if you're like if you're a you have a blind spot the blind spot is you don't respect women or you have a blind spot you don't you don't like black people or you don't like gay people if you have a real blind spot like yeah that's gonna emanate through all your thinking totally it's gonna fuck up your logic and how you look at anything that happens in the world you try to turn into a bit that prejudiced thinking like if you if you think you have that kind of a stupid hate and anger or resentment whatever it is in your mind we're not thinking clearly you're gonna miss things you're not gonna be as good as you want to be I'm gonna you're gonna be at your best that's why I do a podcast why didn't they laugh we're like I literally just I don't always do it because I am NOT always on the road but I'll wit I'll just show bombs and just almost like it's like sports where I'm like why didn't that work you know yeah and and it motivated me to try shit a lot because I was like okay I got an hour I got a want to do another hour so let's make it fun that like I get to be like oh this one was on me I rushed this one this tag offended Miami you know like shit like that like where it's at it's a humbling to real issen to yourself and show P like I did a documentary 60 minutes in 7 days where I wrote a new hour and a week just hopefully sure oh I remember that yeah was that a few years back right when you're out here yeah my wife is pregnant is like maybe yeah two years maybe and so it would just be like watch me just struggle and I maybe got 15 minutes out of it but it was just like heavy bag we're amazing though you got 15 minutes and that short of a time like how long would it take you to make 15 minutes in a normal time I mean if I'm in the wrong mindset like we discussed that's for 3 30 years you see guys do this if you're like in the mindset of like oh this works so I'm just gonna do that but if you're in the growth mindset you like because I love doing new shit you know well isn't it interesting like you coming from a music background like you know you've been playing piano like you said as long as you can remember that requires practice right it requires 10 hours a day yeah you have to be dedicated and sit down to practice that is one of the major things that comedians lack they don't practice we don't write write we don't sit down and go over the material we don't listen to the old recordings like when I force myself into doing that just four or five times a we just forced myself for an hour at a time it's like a giant accomplishment yeah sometimes it hurts to listen to old sets like mistakes and like even when you were like okay there was a crazy bomb in that one it's gonna make for a great episode and then and then like my instincts are like you don't want to relive that man it's like that bachelorette party like I got spit on on Christmas you know did he make a video about that yeah I saw that video and it was like you know there's a strong instinct of me to put out my best shit all the time but like part of me also wants to be like this is this also happens that you know I'll be playing like like bait um like my blinkers on with like with like jokes and I'll just die and I'm like why didn't they laugh people aren't India they just decide somewhere online I want this guy to tall for my patients or fuck this guy wearing a suit guy who's some kind of gay guy yeah anti white power yeah probably doesn't even have a tattoo on his forehead where's your fucking swastika bar on your cheek I was a kid the city once I walked out in a suit and someone yelled faggot before I said one word whoa good Club I would said one word a good work environment yeah imagine any other job we show up for work and they just scream faggot at you and they paid to be there yeah it's called systemic oppression that does any other jump that would never be insane just people throw shit at you yeah imagine if you like school teacher did ice to be a heckler to Renaissance Festival in a shock yeah that was my high school job that's a lair people are throwing tomatoes in my face all day long and you'd mock them Malcolm that's what I learned I learned to mock what people have pride in not what is where it's like a 400-pound man fatness doesn't matter someone ten pounds overweight it'll crush them oh yeah where it's a little fucking soft in the middle there Michael yeah what your wife's too hot for you I'm fucking young meat tick-tock-tick you know they freaked out I was getting paid based on the tomato thrown oh so I was like dollars of tomato it was five dollars for three tomatoes and my goal is always to beat the joust and dude I used to get drunk I need and just let people slap me in the face for $20 $20 a full-power slap I would I would judge the man but like it would be like his people wouldn't be able to hit me if I got in their head they just like throw into the ground Oh was like like once you own so mad but my friends I was like Kurt Metzger you know didn't fall for the shit like I'd be like you and it's like now we know you're just Owen yeah that's funny dude I gotta wrap this up it's uh it's almost 5:00 o'clock time flew by so this is great there's four hours and 15 minutes about 15 minutes stuff your
