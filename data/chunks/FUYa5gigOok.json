the girag and experience I said on camera we had an email from somebody he said that his master could point pressure say they could you know knock you out I got a great story but there's also with the mirror anyway I'd looked in the camera I said okay anybody in America you're watching right now if you have a person who kiss who says that he can knock me out with a punch like just pressing somewhere we invite him we pay him we pay his trip he can come on the show we can do it on camera on me he could knock me out I said it's a no-lose situation for me because if it works I'm signing up to do that stuff but I tell you it's not gonna work we had this guy but you know a mirror Perret so you know most everybody we see these guys on stage and touch guys right yeah so one guy goes this stick and this was personal sister they just fall back and then the guy said did you see his eyes roll back in his skull that means he was out for real so I got to him here we go this is gonna be fun watch this so these guys they come walking down after this set I said okay do good to me I want you to do it to me you want me to cut you are you sure about that I show do it to me I I you know I I want to know how it feels and he goes you know what I could actually I got something better so we already steered away from it right so he says let me show you this and he walks over to his body they start talking to each other and then he walks away and in the corner he stands like this I mean crazy he runs towards his friend then he goes like this in midair he stops and he flies on the ground so he threw like kung fu kung foo hands I didn't touch him doesn't touch him I go do it I'm salt do that to me right I'm gonna attack you right now so I'm going to the corner and he goes yeah but you have to be really angry I said excuse me yeah really angry otherwise it won't work I say your French is this right I said I think I can better act than your friend don't worry I'll be in the zone you know boy will he says no no because if you're not real angry it doesn't work it needs to be that balance so I know it was this way out so I walked over to him and I'm standing like this I say kick me into pills and he says what I said give me a I'm really fucking pissed he didn't want to do it needless to say I mean but they're idiots that truly believe that is true when you stop and think about what an actual football player today a 310 pound man who can run like like literally like a track star of the 1930s yeah you know when you stop and think about the kind of damage they can do and you sort of look towards the future and extrapolate 1,000 years from now 2,000 years especially when this drastic changes happened just the last 5060 years its unbelief that out and of course there's genetic and physical limitations but as Jeanette as as nutrition improves in science improves and genetic engineering proves you're gonna wind up in the future pro sports a couple centuries from now pro sport you not I mean they're not even gonna look human I didn't look like a different species that's how I came up with the idea for the book is I used to be able uh I used to do a little stuff for ESPN when I was in college like manage the teams coming off the field or hold the dish and that kind of a thing and I had you know I was 126 pounds and Michigan Michigan State's a giant football game every year it's huge ESPN is there and my producer al Killian I'm on the headset with him and he's got me bringing the team's out of the out of their dressing room and then he starts screwing with me because I'm 19 I don't know any better and he's in my ears go and listen if they don't come out at the right time ESPN is gonna lose five million dollars of advertising and that's gonna be on you and I'm like he was fucking me because he could cuz I didn't know any better and I'm like so stressed out and then let Michigan State out of the locker room at the appointed time and all these giant human beings are coming out and then as they're coming out they're running walking by the door to the Michigan locker room Michigan door locker room door opens up and standing in the doors Greg scrap knack you ever heard of him no he was six eight three three six two it was he was um it was a giant giant man plus he's got all the gear on and I'm on and I'm like and I'm a little tiny thing I'm freaking out I'm like well Michigan's gonna come out he's like you don't let them come out of that locker room I don't care what you have to do and so I he's giant he's six foot eight I'm five eight I'm 125 pounds and and he goes to step out and I just put my hands right right on the sternum I just stiff-armed him and what stop right there you guys can't come out of that locker room yet and just he looked confused I was like who is this little person and he managed to wait and all the guys were behind him and he managed way just long enough for Michigan State to come out then I got out of the way and they came out but I had I wrote the whole concept of the book in that one moment the whole GFL series I had my hand on this guy's here my nose came up to his sternum and I remember thinking it's like he's a completely different species than yeah and that was and after that I went home and started writing that book like what if we had different species playing football and the whole thing blew up from there how do these people feel about you taking off going to America to let everybody know about them and then flying back again it means this this must be so bizarre for them yeah well that's what's crazy at first every all the night well I've been to more than nine but the last time I went I went to nine different tribes and of pygmies little nine villages each one of them never seen a white dude before so that scares me I mean there would be times that it would take an hour maybe even sometimes a little over an hour before someone in that that tribe most of the time was always women or children that would finally come up to me and touch me to make sure they don't go through me like I was a spirit or a ghost of some sort and then once one person felt me and I play a game with them or something like that then more would I mean literally come out from hiding behind trees come out from from the forest whenever I come in sometimes they'd flee run cry kids like flailing on the ground like just freaked out by me but whenever I'd make friends with them then they would ask me one thing every place that I went in all nine tribes they asked me well I helped them have a voice that was the thing they're like we have no voice here they're the only tribe not allowed to have their citizenship in Congo and like so they have zero voice Wow what a strange turn your life is taken that this is you've gone from being on the house and the ultimate fighter you know competing in the heavyweight version of the show to now live it in a grass hut in the Congo what uh that's a string or a leaf hut rather what a strange journey you're on man yeah you need to be honest I wouldn't change it for me actually booze was my savior because I was hanging out with a lot of dudes who were doing some serious serious drug that bad drug and my whole thing was I don't want to be 60 years old and so I always have this my idyllic sort of retirement which I'm trying to get to sooner rather than later now it's just like just sort of forgotten like little Cove you know it's a little cold that'd be your neighbor and I'm solar I'm sitting there this girl I'm gonna send you this I'm gonna send you this this article of this how old your kids three and one man dude I got I'm gonna send you boys or girls girls I'm gonna send you this article it's a fantastic article but a dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma and phonic cancer like the worst cancer you can ever and and he was a Greek dude he grew up in America but like you know came here when he was three or sumption so he goes back to Greece to this little island in the middle of nowhere and he has to walk up this hill every day he goes to talk to his buddies drinking the wine he's eating the food from the whatever and all of a sudden like five years but he was given like you know six months to live or whatever we're not even six weeks to live and and they said well you know what the fuck happened you didn't die and he goes you know I came here and I forgot to die because you know he's sitting there and and there's no stress and he's walking up the hill every day and he's drinking wine with his buddies and he's eating the food from the you know the fish from the the bay in the fucking whatever and I sit there and I say you know now I'm looking at this shit so my idyllic retirements basically I'm stealing this guy who killed cancer by living this euphoric life of I live on this little Cove and I'm drinking my wine and I'm sitting out there and I'm just blissing out on reality now that's why I didn't get hurt to heroin that's why I didn't get hooked to fucking crack that's why I didn't get hooked all this shit to my boys got hooked too because I always thought to myself if I fuckin get hooked to this shit I'm gonna have to a die or be fuckin quit it and if I quit it guess what I'm never gonna be able to sit on that fucking Cove with my glass of fuckin wine sitting out there I'm being this blissful old Buddha dude right Sophia and that's why I don't that's why I don't judge anybody cuz I'll tell you what everyone's trying to get through the day to get to their god damn coat
