Smith 2013 the Soviets say the last one is coming 93 years I won't be here to see it haha see you next week we got to quit that was as good as we've ever done it what we should do right now let's move to Seattle we should move to that wilderness area where they film the very first Twilight movie gonna play that was fun as hell I spent my favor hon I think I was given I was white as hell I'll tell you that was fun I don't think we've ever thought about a podcast I agree I mean I know we were fucked up but I think I think people I gotta say that was really good was your one moment where you felt like this is the wrong thing to do no I know I know about it well that was a goddamn perfect ride down the side of a mountain to sledding Lee Mazzilli mouth well man I might be as good as what capable though that was little time we might have to just do that once a week we might have a little scheme for a year that was like the most water - yeah that's a lot as for all I think you motherfucker you were partying you were like I was going to say you like some existential fucking cocksucker with people who shouldn't even fucking know what exponential ism is well we know what I always explain the way you know someone like it's get deep enough to let me explain myself I sorry I'm late I'm the bridge between the meatheads in the pot that's exactly what a bridge and by the way people out there your audience understands that we're doing shit in a different way yes and you're doing shit a different way that's fucking awesome you're going to monster all to do the fucking fight but at the same time you're here doing fuckin podcast talking about her professionalism and how the bark peeling no one's ever done that before I don't believe no one's ever done that before in the history fucking media yeah but it's not because it wasn't there it's just it I don't think it's been there well they I don't think it's been there I honestly believe that exposure the exposure to information gets broader and broader we're all going to get swept into this sort of wave acclamation and wave of exposure to information I think concentrating on where the information is being tuned into or where it's being broadcast it's not it's less there's not a the most important thing what you're doing has never been done yes and no it will never be done but you know you never had 4G internet before it I don't know how that workers doing what you're doing there's never been a I understand it's fucking fucked us yeah I understand but it's not it's all we're doing is let me know shit has happening it's not it's not a lot of doing has never been done and it's fantastic now I said that the last podcast I couldn't say that this time then I'd be yeah but what you're doing is that well we're lucky that we're in a position to do it but it's with what anybody would do they logically look at the situation realized this room know what you're doing and what you're doing it's never been done yeah but it's not because it's that hard or it's that there's no resistance to do it right here's a reality right I don't feel any resistance to doing this this way to you ya know what that's right this is the ocean I have what you've been what you guys are doing talking has I've never been done that doesn't guys yeah but you know yeah I took a look at hurts turn Howard Stern used to be the uncensored king of all media nowadays he's like a fucking TV news compare dude like what can I say one thing to your a guy who's like you already you made your shit you got your shit you got your gigs you got our stuff and you're taking that and you're using that to do something different something no one's ever done before oh listen now I'm in I'll press that button this one I'm gonna hold it until it beeps and so they hold on till it beeps the hotel class women don't don't even breathing yet keep squeezing keep it together I won't don't get hold your squeeze it don't don't suck it hold squeeze squeeze hold hold hold dizzy the woods in the woods this is what I'm surprised alright I didn't shut up by the way thing for I love that I'm saying what I'm glad you made your money we pay on it a lot of people George Clooney everyone goes oh let me just finish okay you actually go out there laundry fucking pogchamp it's fucking import is fucking import well I know we talk about I don't care what you say it's fucking important what you're doing and by the way you have a huge audience which is fucking fantastic and what we're talking about a lot of it's weird but a lot of it is we're talking about shit that no one else will talk about come on yes you have isn't it yes okay yes I did want but it's not it looked as a lot of people who did it but for me all I did was pick up the ball and let everybody know that I think that if you can if you can justify your position or your reasoning for look new things if you can talk to a group of strangers about it and be honest about where you're coming from that it's important to do I think it's important to have a point of view that that makes sense with the information you've been allowed to have access to if you've got to have access to a lot of shit and you kind of made mistakes pretty fucked up they see people making the same station it's really important to step up and look worried yes it was always that we're just fucking down trying to just say work for in regular and so you're not gonna have a bunch up you're right here to fucking do you made your shit you fucking hit your fuckin thing but still you're these podcasts and by the way every time the Fuhrer of positivity comes out I'm going to say this we talk about a lot of fucked up shit and these people are like either one you're fucking at least you're telling the fucking truth we might be wasted we might be fucked up move you're talking crazy shit but in fact they're saying you know you're fucking telling the truth and I gotta say this that's important that's fucking important I agree with you I think it's important whenever people express the ideas of sort of universal from the people who follow you are the people we because what they are doing and they're free thinkers are perfect or saying fire everything all the bullshit repent to you I've never had a more positive reaction to anything I've ever done alright great but it's bizarre numbers are it's great it is great but it's also bizarre it's great in the fact that it's a how about how games like anime guys are the freest thinkers we have but you would think that that's unusual but me as a guy who's done martial arts the whole life I think that it's uh that's how it's supposed to be but I think it's not a mistake and not a coincidence that the very best guys at the top of the heap um also what I would consider martial arts like Anderson Silva the flying birds he bound was telling different spots in the what should a happy wedding this way George Sanders has heightened is gonna happen the same Nick Diaz is up my life to be after open their Bibles like pejorative hear me motherfucker see past this bright no not at all passes but I could DSS listen I love both of these guys I love George and I love Nick and I look of fight and I love the idea behind because the idea behind is you took at the very best in the world the very best in the world these guys are really really and so what I knew I do love because he's also mature he's also a real martial artist the way Anderson Silva is the way lyoto machida is the way even John Jones oh yes I love Jon Jones elbow they aspired to be marshal or I've even watch the final I don't what was it you have seen fight land is our fight man yes I'm alright so the very first step so but Dustin Poirier yeah we're trying my bedtime stories these guys I understand he looks are we gonna good job with so we put an amazing job listen you can tell me before I would I'd like you know I can actually know tell us and if we're doing something wrong tell us because I would listen I would look at whatever you want me to look at if you ever want to know Washington I we have very high my wanting to I'm gonna do it so appointment whatever you want to do do what where you won't want to do this I'm saying is I just don't want to be your shit help I think is our guys they love it okay about this how about you and me do a breakdown of the conviction martial arts world I would love to do it every week career my wake surfing 3d whatever let's go look I can tell you why okay because I think what we have to do with what our job is will you escape certain stuff we took core and we did with pro wrestling and and indeed we're doing now a soccer we take core core MMA fans of the craziest fans but we have to take it to cross them right take it to cross over to the other team and what you are you're the best crossover guy in the fuck the world because you're saying I'm an MMA guy but I'm actually smarter than oh shit talk about a fucking philosophy this is my advice ready yes forget it all ignoring doing to like put on what you like forget all the bullshit but put whatever shows you're interested in any conversation either hasn't someone home and what I love to do is take it from that core of MMA and bring it up the crossover and say this isn't fucking just these guys right it's like like if you look at John's own and you say okay this guy is fuck these Muhammad Ali he's that I mean he's the modern-day Muhammad the only difference between him and Muhammad Ali is he doesn't have 50 fucking documentaries right I'm up boring no I'm Geoff edgers and Shawn Basha but the device also he has the massive just unbelievable like mountains and mountains and feelings of but it's only not 20 but when I saw him fighting over 324 yeah I think it's 25 but when I saw him fight I was like this guy so far ahead Gabrielle's and he's so much better than everybody else but also his story's legit guy is a smart guy yesterday and the whole thing of like when he won the championship choking out the purse-snatcher like like yeah yeah yeah and I'm like something yeah right yeah and I'm like okay if we had that on film this is what we sell to to UFC is we should have had we should have had him choke together for the court snatcher in New Jersey before he went to win the fuckin chain right you mean if you guys were there while he was born exactly now now we have that access right over my whole thing for anybody just be someone hmm anybody doesn't understand we're talking about John Jones before he fought for the UFC light heavyweight title like the day of the fight it was meditating in a park in New Jersey and he saw some guys snap someone's purse and he was riding around I'm like spider-man like literally like Peter fucking Parker literally he went over and he took down this this waiver structure he ran after him choked him out in mid-stride yeah of course got the first bag yeah then - thank you very much and went on to win the fucking I mean like hold on a second I don't wanna think that's the greatest story in fighting ever ride a Peter Parker let the the criminal past by then he killed his uncle bang right that's what haunted Peter Parker and made him be so but this guy is literally like Muhammad Ali going to go fight for his title he choked out a fucking criminal New Jersey yeah we're yeah talked about game to the cops said two hours later I'm going to go fucking fight for the championship of the world and by the way one and I'm going to say that's a great story it's a great story you're anything but a lot freaky to go to go one more step you with what you do with fear factor what you've done with MMA what you've done with a shit and still doing these podcasts is fucking that's very important it very important and by the way if you say it's not important I'm going to punch you in sign of work does your mom need punches I'm not fitting any punches takes a lot of effort that's a need and I just say this then I respect you and I respect you and into I respect you awfully high bro I completely respect the the idea that you're trying perform I respected and I was pretty good and now we're finished yes yes yes [Music] I [Music]
