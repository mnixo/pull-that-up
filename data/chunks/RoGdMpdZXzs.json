hello freak bitches well we've tried out we've tried other online interventions too so I have my these YouTube videos up but we also designed I work with some corporations a while back because I've done some consulting and I had designed tests to help people hire better employees which I still do and in fact I work with this company up in California called the founder Institute and it's the world's largest stage early technology company incubator it's created 2,500 companies in the last four years and we test now in a hundred and thirty-five cities but when I was marketing these tests to companies they kept asking me what could be done about their poorer performing employees and I said well I didn't know because it's not that easy to if you have someone who's problematic who's troubled it's not that easy for a manager to figure out how to straighten them out and they just don't have the time they don't have the time they don't have the manpower and they don't have the training usually to do that but I designed this set of programs called the self authoring suite and one of them the future authoring program helps people write out a plan for their life so it helps them ask you some questions about six dimensions of your life you know your your health mental and physical your use of drugs and alcohol your wishes three to five years down the road for intimate relationships for family for career for education and so on it asks you what could your life be like three to five years down the road if you set it up for you like you or someone you were taking care of so it asks you those six questions then it asks you to write for 15 minutes about about your vision for your life you get to have what you want and what would be good for you what would that be and then it asks you to write for 15 minutes about what your life would be like three to five years down the road if you let your bad habits and your you know IDIA cease and your foolishness is and your weaknesses take the upper hand and auger you into the ground because everyone knows about that and so it's like you get to design a little heaven to strive for and a little hell to avoid and then you write for then you basically turn that into an implementable plan that's the second part of the program we've used that with about five thousand five to seven thousand University students now mostly in Europe at the Rotterdam School of Management and we've raised they're a great point average of their kids 25% dropped the dropout rate the same and has had a walloping effect on men and on non-western ethnic minorities it's moved the non-western ethnic minority student population performance at rotterdam School of Management from 70% below the average to above the female Dutch natives and so the other the reason I'm telling you this apart from the fact that it's a very good program and we did it at Mohawk College in Canada a year ago and we drop their dropout rate in the first semester 50% and that especially again worked well for men because men are at more risk of dropping out now and especially for men who didn't have good grades in high school so not only is there the possibility for the net to provide tremendous dissemination of the intellectual material but there's also the possibility for the net to provide dissemination of psychological interventions that have major impacts on people's mental health and productivity at almost at extraordinarily low cost so that's really being fun too so well I think providing some that sort of a structure and a framework giving people the tools just in form of asking them questions what would you like to do please describe this what is your view and when you do that you sort of allow them to help themselves outline what they would like to accomplish which most people don't do know allowing our education system our education system was designed in Chicago in the late 1800s to produce factory workers because it was set up when when rural people were migrating to the cities on mass because their kids first of all we're likely to get factory jobs and second of all if you were working in a factory your kids needed to be taken care of and so the purpose of the schools was to train factory workers which is why everyone's lined up in roles rose and why there are bells it's a factory model the problem with that is that now people's careers basically have to be self determined but that's never that's never part of the education system part of the reason I developed these programs was because I realized this is the same course where I'm teaching students that if they would have been in Germany in the 1930s they would have been Nazis I'm trying to get them to design their lives and it's way better to have someone articulate their own plan you actually neurologically rewire people by having them formulate their own thoughts which is why you know you're schoolteachers used to say put it in your own words it's actually very good advice if they would explain what that means it's like if you have to conjure up the thoughts and you have to articulate them then they change you and so well and so this program has had the the the effects have been absolutely overwhelming for us as researchers because it's very very difficult to produce an intervention that actually has a positive effect on people you know you hope it does but generally when you test it out it's like not doesn't do what you thought it did or sometimes it even has the reverse effect that sounds fascinating how do people have how can someone a regular person have access yeah it's called self authoring so that's SEL F authoring like like writing a book self authoring calm and the programs I gave away the future authoring program I think it might still be free it was yeah it is till the end of November I did a video called message to Millennials where because one of the things Jonathan Hite said about he called Karl Marx the patron saint of the social justice warriors and John Stuart Mill the patron saint of people say who stood for objective truth and freedom of expression and I thought that was really smart he said Brown University is number one for social justice warrior universities in Chicago for truth universities but one of the things that Marx has over John Stuart Mill is that Marx is the social revolutionary and young people like to think about ways to change the world right and that's actually a positive part of their development it's a stage that the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget called the messianic stage and he associated that with late adolescence it's like while young people want to change the world the problem is is that that's being harnessed into attempts to change other people but that isn't what you should do if you want to change the world you should change yourself and I don't mean that some cliched sense I mean it in the sense that Alexander Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the Soviet Union he said don't be thinking that the line that divides good from evil runs down a political spectrum or or country's or something like that it runs down right down the middle of your soul and if you want to sort out the world and what you do is you sort yourself out it's a serious business right they say it's more difficult to rule yourself than to rule a city and that's the truth because you're complicated and there are horrible monsters inside of you that need to be tamed and to be brought and to be brought into alignment and submission so that you can be US powerful and useful person and I gave away the future authoring program as part of this video I made suggesting to Millennials that instead of rushing out there to change the world by changing other bad people that they should look inward and sort themselves out properly and I think we've given away about four or five thousand of those programs so far I said about three to the end of November and what happens with it it's well the self or the future authoring program is regularly $14.95 and the whole self authoring suite which involves it's a program that helps you write an autobiography so it helps you sort out things about your past that are still burdening you you can tell a if if you have a memory that's more than eighteen months old approximately and when you pull that memory up to mind if you still have an emotional reaction that means you haven't fully articulated the memory you haven't analyzed it causally you haven't you haven't freed yourself from its grasp and you're carrying it like a weight and your brain responds to that like the more more weight you're carrying like that more baggage let's say the more of the stress hormone cortisol your brain produces and cortisol makes you old some of this work has been done by James Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin because he he started to pioneer these sorts of writing programs and he found that if people wrote about uncertain things past present or future so they could be traumatic things they could be uncertain things that their physical health improved and he he did a lot of detailed research trying to figure out why that was and basically came down to the explanation that it was something like an uncertainty reduction mechanism at work because your brain is always figuring out how well situated are you in the world how much do you not know compared to how much have you mastered and you can tell that you've mastered things because when you go somewhere and you act things turn out the way you want them that's an indication of mastery and your brain is sort of keeping track across your whole life of how many places you've been where things haven't worked out compared to how many places you have been where they have worked out and if all those places in your past where things haven't worked out you need to map and master and that that decreases the existential load on you but that actually decreases your psychophysiological load it makes you healthier it makes you less stressed and so we put all that together in this self authoring suite to help people write about their past to sort it out in a in a detailed autobiography to ask you questions about your past it says divide your life up into six epochs and then divide each of those that might be say old birth to kindergarten and then maybe elementary school and then maybe junior high school however you want to do it and then to write about the emotionally significant events in each of those epochs and then to describe their effects on you and then to analyze how you did in those situations what you might have done differently what you might have do differently in the future to straighten out your past and I've done that with my students in my maps of meeting class for about the last ten years and some people have written 15,000 words it's not that uncommon for students to write 15,000 words in their autobiography Wow so that's such great advice that's such great advice about reconciling with your past because so many people just carry it around yeah well if you're if you're thinking about your past what it means is you haven't analyzed the causal change because you might say well why do you remember your past well you might say well it's in order to have an objective you know record of the past it's like it has nothing to do with that there's only one reason you remember the past and that's to be prepared for the future that's why you remember the past and so what you're supposed to do is take the past and extract out from it wisdom and wisdom is the ability to avoid stumbling blindly into ditches and so you think well here's a time in my past I stumbled blindly into this horrible ditch and terrible things happen to me it's like okay you need to take that apart you need to how was it that that events conspired with your participation voluntarily or involuntarily so that that terrible consequence emerged you need to know why that happened and how you could react differently in that situation and as soon as you do that your brain will leave it alone you won't obsess you about it anymore because the anxiety-producing parts of your brain are basically trying to tell you where there are obstacles in your environment it's like look out don't go there don't go there it's like well don't go there there's fire well maybe you could master the fire right then you're a wielder a fire you're not just a victim and lots of situations our dangers are not dangerous depending on your level of mastery right life is like that and so a negative emotion that's associated with a memory is is something that's crying out for mastery and writing can really help with that so you're reorganizing your brain when you write autobiographically you're basically the emotions imagine emotion memories can be stored at different levels of your brain some from sort of primordial reptilian image Laden areas that are very emotional up to finally articulated plans for your future life well you want to take everything that's negative and emotional and transform that into a fully articulated vision for your future and that frees you of your past you shouldn't be thinking about your past I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know you're going over a well-spent life that's a whole different thing but if you're thirty thirty-five or twenty and most of the time you're thinking about your past it's like it's like your soul is trapped back there and you need to you need to free it through investigation and the metaphysical language is appropriate because that is in a sense what you're doing you're trapped in the past it's like you got to break free of that so you can use all your resources to move ahead into the future
