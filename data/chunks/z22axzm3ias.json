the Joe Rogan experience there are two Austin's one of them is a drug-addled shithole the other ones in Texas we hear about 10 miles outside of Austin Nevada I'm with my good friend Dan Doty hello say hello Dan hello and we just got back from we allowed to say unsuccessful until it hit the air son six well successful in memories and fun we had a wonderful time chasing unsuspecting undulates with sharp pointy sticks it did not work out that means we were both hunting for deer it did not work out dan Dodie is here you are a fucking Renaissance man my friend you're an undercover hippie on a hunting show you're a man of great vast wide range of experiences and Dan has worked for me leader for 65 episodes yes is my 65th episode shooting the show Dan's been on the podcast before with Remy Warren back when he and Remmy were releasing that apex predator show which is excellent you know if you hear noise because we're driving we're on the road right now and we're we're passing through some fucking strange shit we're about a hundred and fifty miles or so outside arena I think 170 outside of Reno Nevada and we just saw so much strangeness today this is lonely country Desert Rats are these people there no offense if you're one of them listening to this podcast right now I'll show you wonderful people lots four-wheelers lots of side-by-sides lots of weird haircuts weird haircuts like they just it gets to a certain point all man I gotta cut the end just free no is Reno is fucking metropolis compared to this and I've always thought of Reno's being that one of those weird places I really don't want to go to but no offense if you're from Reno and you're listening to this if that is it's a bigger state than I thought you know what game means once game mean does I mean so yeah it's like how much it's amplifying the sound that's coming oh so if I crank it up way high it's probably too hot yeah it's making a red it's like bitch what are you doing there's a clipping yeah so Jamie can handle this this is a new thing I think I picked up it's called an Apogee microphone because some people were complaining about the sound quality of my iPod or iPhone recorded podcast that someone from our message board recommended this is pretty dope I like how it hooks up it just looks up right to the base of your iPhone and this might be the future this is really your first time yeah this is our first time dando t you're the one who's breaking it in so we're about we're we were about five miles or excuse me five hours outside of Reno in this incredibly beautiful desolate landscape chasing these deer that have these ears that they're fuck there's biggest Kim Kardashian's ass and they fucking hear everything these animals hear everything and Dan and I dan was behind me with the camera and I was being the clumsy sneaky fuck trying to sneak up on these things and it just didn't work out but goddamn it was fun trying dude we got close yeah I got so close that it could have happened once one time it legitimately could have happened the other time we got kind of close a few times but one time I got inside of 30 yards and as I was crawling towards them in the bushes I made too much noise and they got up and bolted but there's two deer that were in laugh this is too many too many details you can catch it on the show it's called meat-eater it's on sports from his channel it's an excellent show but this uh this fucking trip has been really interesting first of all it's nice to be off the grid for seven days I haven't done that in a while god damn that feels good when was the last time probably last time I hunted with you guys yeah probably Prince of Wales though that was not quite a year ago huh yeah know what less or more miserable of a mammal oh this is way more fun way better miss is just hot but I don't mind he he doesn't really bug me as long as we have water we had plenty of water I mean you just keep your skin covered so you know burst into flames yeah I have I've done a lot of these meat eaters but I haven't been doing them lately the last year yeah this is first time I've been off grated in bath I don't know a good long time - it felt easy the first three days just felt like a vacation yeah well it made me realize like we're so addicted to taking in information sorry at least I am I shouldn't say we I'm so addicted to checking the news and finding out what's going on in the world and just it's it's a lot of times doesn't give you a chance to use your brain and think about what you actually feel about things like you don't get a chance you're just so wrapped up in pay attention to all the news and all the information and all the the stuff that's being fed to you constantly through the media that's social media networks through you know all it was just everything it's just too much I try to get my phone off for four hours at a time during the day is even if I'm working that's nice should I put it on airplane mode put it away and just step away from it as much as I can well my friend already got it right and I can't do what he did but what he did was he switched to a flip phone that's smart yeah you said it enough said enough I can't do it I need it I like having the phone first of all if I had a flip phone I wouldn't be recording a podcast right now cuz I need a fucking iPhone for that is the first thing you do in the morning do you wake up and check your phone sometimes shouldn't but sometimes I do it is for me I try not to what I've been trying to do lately I check my phone to make sure nothing important is going on like I look at my text messages make sure that they're okay nothing's crazy no no 911 calls or something and then then I just try to start my day but I used to I used to do it I used to hit it hard for like an hour check the news check all the bullshit check my Twitter feed check all the lakes people post me check what I'm supposed to be doing check this check that I don't I try to do that anymore yeah spent a fair amount of time off the grid and then disconnected like that to do you know the past 10 years it's a weird kind of addiction because it's I think that's what I felt so when we got out here and it had been a long time since I've been here but we got out here and it was like holy shit this is great yeah yeah I think we're doing something weird to ourselves by constantly being connected to everything and everyone and everyone's terrified to be disconnected terrified to take a week off of just nothing coming in but your own thoughts just the world the actual world that you see in front of your face which is not will we get a lot of times I've been talking about that a lot is that there's a real problem with getting all the bummer news from 7 billion people all over the world does you get a distorted perception of what's going on in the world because you're you're connected to everything that's happening all the time 24/7 anytime anytime anything fucked up goes down you hear about it instantly and it just gives you this this feeling that the world's just falling apart yeah but meanwhile most the time nothing is happening where most people are see pre-pre iPhones are pre these kind of phones I I really did disconnect from from news I wouldn't watch news I didn't have a TV and it didn't do all that but hey there's no way I can claim that anymore there's no way that I don't know how I would extract myself from that stream of information now because it's just it is everywhere I mean you can't you can't open one web browser or anything without seeing anything so I I don't know I have a hard time with it I really do i don't i don't like to know you know and now actually lately I feel responsible lately I feel more responsible that I do need to know I don't know I think it's about managing it man I think that's the big thing is managing you don't you know you don't have to completely disconnect yourself in the world but this can make sometimes and you know and and know when you're getting too much like I'll go down those you ever go down one of those YouTube rabbit holes oh yeah we watch one video on fake foot and that's even though it's four hours later you're like what the fuck just happened you've watched several people get eaten by crocodiles and I watch this thing the top crocodile attacks of 2016 and I'm like what the fuck is wrong with me what am i watching this it's awful this is awful it's important assholes so it's a noisy its noisy life it's a busy life and to me it's almost it's the busyness that I get second more than anything else it's a constant pushing into everything that's going out to them whether it's for a hunter for whatever reason get disconnected that is the part that I I don't at that that that's what light that lights me up and makes me happy just it just a fucking settle down yeah like doesn't have things to do always and always be going somewhere always to be something and I try to live a pretty relaxed life anyway but well you were taking it to a whole nother level this weekend you were talking about one day wanting to go to the mountain by yourself for 40 days I would I would love to do that yeah that would and I'm sure I will do it you know I do a lot of meditation and in the lineage of meditation that I do there's a lot of solo practice or basically solo retreat where you go either in a cabin or on the woods or whatever you write whatever you want to do and you just you just you're just there by yourself doing your thing I have not had a chance to do that recently I also used to what I used to be a wilderness guide and would run programs for people they would always do a solo at the end of their wilderness experiences sit out in the woods all alone by themselves four days six days whatever it was yeah man it's it's a weird thing it's not something I think that most people are drawn to I don't think it's a type of thing that that you know I think it is a weird thing for people our culture but I think there's something massively valuable to be gained by that just self-knowledge you know self experience it's just reflection oh yeah yeah well reflection but then also exploration I think you know of your own thoughts yeah man yeah and like what's actually there like what's really inside you what were what really you know disconnected from all the input of information and the need to go do stuff and the need to say stuff an end but just to like fucking be there what's going on yeah yeah you know I'm a big fan of the isolation tank and you and I have talked about that but one of the things that's weird is when I tell people about it they I've had many people say oh I don't want to be alone with my thoughts yeah oh yeah you don't want to be alone with your thoughts you want to know how you really feel about things and explore whether or not you're right about things are wrong or whether or not you have a bias or whether or not you have some sort of preconceived notion you know one of things that I've found that a lot of people do is they have an opinion on something and then when confronted with new evidence they do their damnedest to try to defend that original opinion too big yeah yeah they give and they fucked themselves but you got to be able to be flexible with your ideas or not you yeah totally and I'm so yeah I saw that idea about going out to a mountain and be there to me it's about I think there's a disconnect in our culture from the actual experience and however you want to say that your actual physical experience that you're having in the mall the actual emotional experience or even even mental experience I think that there's so much controlling us you know we control ourselves or other things all the other forces control us but the actual sitting in what's actually happening is to me the most compelling part of being a lot of and I think there's a lot of ways that that people go about doing that but it is challenging in and it's not it's not something that yeah you're right P P it scares the shit up you know why cuz it is scary I think it's it's intense life some cans you know that you actually have to confront what life is and when nothing else you know when you're really just thinking alone by yourself nothing else occupying thoughts not a television show not an album you're a let and those things are great too but to be alone with your thoughts totally and I actually and I think it extends to to being with other people too like if I think there is something to be practicing maybe it would be present in the experience that's happening right I think that different spiritual traditions are searching for that thing different all kinds of different things that people do to try to feel better and do better in life and so yeah but the practice have been doing it yourself I think is one thing and then I an even more challenging thing is sort of that sort of rawness or simplicity or even connection with somebody else president so really exciting it actually an important point about being alone too because when you're around other people other people influence your thoughts the influence way you feel the influence the way you react to things and to be alone and then on top of that to be alone in nature that's what's that's really interesting that's that's really interesting to me because look at that is a tornado out there yeah it's like a dancing twister that's been over the column what do they call a goddamn tornado but better run for the hills I think this would hit us like heaven you know before we came into Austin we got Swiper but yeah we got hit by this huge boom Austin Nevada by the way not Austin Texas I thought you liked Austin I do I like Austin Texas I'd even hate Austin Nevada I'm just fucking around phones but look the place where we are at is a particularly unusual kind of nature because it's it's desert but it's it's got these sage plants everywhere which really smell awesome when you step on them and break them they have the school's you know say just got a great smell to it so you have this these sage plants all over the place of these very small shrubs occasional trees not that many but mostly like these like 6 foot high at most shrubs and there's a few of those trees like those yeah they're Cedars and they're soggy knees mahogany so it's high desert so high elevation desert these big massive basins flat basins with pretty sharp and tall mountains kind of I mean each of these basins of the valley and up to what was it 12,500 or 13,000 feet yeah just above where we were hunting we were really high up there we were above 9,000 feet and there's he's some rock slides everywhere where like the the side of the mountains are rodent and we had to climb up that shit it's all these like chunks of rock and especially problematically trying to sneak up on these fucking awesome hearing mule deer because everything is like Clank it's like like you're stepping on broken pottery everywhere it's just weird it almost looks like somebody made it you know and you see all that it's like somebody decided to make like a giant runway filled with broken chips of rock it's just really really cool but just like an alien landscape I've never been to the the high country the desert up there before so for me was uh it was a first and it was also it's it's beautiful but it's what you don't want to live there but it's it's cool to visit you know it's like one of those things I don't like I'll dry it is that's that's my only beef with it I think it is beautiful but it's it just looks like it needs a bath but it's interesting too because it's so perfect for these deer the deer and everywhere up there and they're fucking big and fat and healthy and all they're doing is eating these sage bushes and then taking naps and running from mountain lions and shit because we found some big thick ropes of shit they were filled with hair that is either a giant fucking coyote or most likely a mountain lion or maybe big dad that one seemed way too big to be a coyote that's a that's a that was about lunch right probably yeah woke up one day were fucking scream and they sounded so awesome they were screaming it's interesting we only saw a deer and we saw a couple of coyotes over scanning the horizon but the landscape for people is death if you lived up there you'd be fucked first of all you never catch one of these deer if you had a rifle you have a really good chance because for some reason they know your bow hunting so they stay at like 160 170 yards it is fucking stare at you but anything you get inside of that they're like fuck this how many deer did you did we get within 100 yards up like maybe two groups two groups the first day we got inside of 30 and I could have had a shot if it wasn't for we only had a tag for a buck I sparked explain what a tag is we're high on public land you may not know this because most people don't and I didn't until I started hunting but we the people of the United States of America own massive chunks of land it is your land it is my land it's just like that song this land is you're there but it really is that it's not just in theory its public land and it's rare because most countries don't have what we have we have these giant chunks of forests that you can hunt in and you can fish in and you can hike in you can camp in you can do all these different things but to hunt in them one thing that people don't know especially people that are like down on hunting is that hunting is closely regulated by wildlife agencies that's manned by biologists that are working on science and data for that particular area so in the area where we're at it's not that easy to get a tag so Steve Rinella how to use his points to get me in there as well and what points are is he put in for a tag you have to put in every year and it takes like a few years so if you can hunt in this place you could probably only hunt here like every three years but there's other places like the Nevada Strip which is on the Utah Nevada border that is so awesome there's a Nevada sorry Arizona Strip was on the border of Arizona and Utah which is the most cherished place for mule deer where you can only hunt there like once in your life like literally it takes like 20 plus years to get a tag like area I think it's a Team B yeah so it's supposed to be the shit so these places it's not there's not a lot of people there like we were like we saw a few people while we were there that were also hunting shout out to James Kawasaki who gave us some some great tips we we've met a really cool dude from Hawaii James Kawasaki we found him hunting up there and he gave us some good tips about where to go and study now he's such a fucking good dude it's cool when you meet something like that is doing the same thing that you're doing then and he was leaving over comments and for generous yeah which happens yes yeah you get people that want to hoard hoard their honey holes but he gave us all this information so it still didn't help that's probably why he gave us the information sleep it changed me yeah gonna kill anything so much trip Nevada folk have been incredibly generous he was just yes and we're right behind a truck pulling a trailer but that belongs to a trendy Warren and his family they just hooked us up with stuff a trailer two trucks incredibly generous maybe that's the thing about Nevada maybe it's a big 50 placement maybe everybody's really I joke around about you know that place being a drug-addled shit but I've met a lot of really nice people from Nevada I mean it's it has a bad reputation because Vegas is linked to organized crime and gambling and all the other sordid shit that comes with that people think of it it's like you know this horrible sinful place but that's just a small area of Nevada most of the my friends that I know that live around Vegas that are involved in like the MMA business there they're fucking the nicest people in the world and they'll tell you like in Nevada is like what's outside of the strip it's a great town like at Henderson Henderson is a great town it's a really nice place to live if it's real safe so there's a lot of good spots in Nevada but anyway point being we're out here in a you know it's just a really fascinating interesting landscape to just spend seven days but bring a lot of fucking water that's for sure I'm impressed that you haven't been in a landscape like this before to me this is what the majority of the American West looks like if Brown yes flat with you know bumpy mountains oh well the first place that we hunted in Montana was a little like this we were the Missouri Breaks which is right on the banks of the Missouri River and that's that's how I got hooked it's goddamn Steve Rinella he's a little crack dealer with this hunting stuff he gave me the first dose for free and then he got me but it's the same sort of feeling and the Missouri Breaks is that feeling of massiveness and also that you are completely insignificant yeah this is the universe or the world the natural world around you really doesn't give a fuck you could fall smash your head open on a rock and those wheel deer will bounce on body like nothing happened it's uh it's just it's it's amazing it's amazing like that I think the place that sunk that in the most was probably Prince of Wales so uninviting yeah Alaska one of the harshest places I've been I know it's weird though because that that one's like heaven hell like a Sun comes out yeah it's you don't want to be anywhere else but then most of the year when it is raining because it does it's just it bring every fucking day we were there all day and D'Antoni was warning us before we went damn was like fuck that place I don't wanna go back to that place and Stephen ELLs like why isn't that I'm not that place plays awesome so I swore twice in my life I would not go back and I broke that promise but it's a media is also just amazing just saw as far as the the animals both under the water and above the water it's just a rich rich environment well and it's it's also super unusual to like the way it looks it's a rain forest it is well it gets closed I don't think it's quite maybe both what it what it what is really cool about it there's a lake at the top that's so high up that beavers don't go there so you can drink right out of the lake so we would take our water bottles we just dip it in the lake and just drink right out of it so this place is almost the exact opposite of that whereas that place is all just rain and and lush greenery and the occasional sunshine pops through you like wow oh look at this place it shines like a green but an emerald yeah Suz you rather get dropped off they keep me here they're naked they're there you probably make it better you wouldn't make it here naked your skin would peel off you know there you could you would be cold as fuck until you figured out how to start a fire how to kill something and wear it skin you down steady enough to be a large thing to kill a bunch of squirrels to sew them together make a dick holster got a lot of shit and then again if you just naked that means you don't even have a gun or a bow and arrow and that's not good then those things are good I think that Prince of Wales was like the most profound of all though that experience like I felt through the Missouri Breaks that that feeling of like just complete did not detachment but like it doesn't give a fuck then the landscape does not give a fuck it is just completely oblivious to your presence and it has existed in this form for thousands and thousands and thousands of years did you get that feel like YouTube yeah yeah yeah definitely I was curious because both of those haunts both of Missouri Breaks and we're not motorized you know so like Missouri Breaks we drop the cars off have you Oded truly you know you call that a true wilderness experience and same time Prince of Wales that we got dropped out by a plane Andy if we needed to get out there and get a pitch you know we're getting out of there in a bitchy it would have been so I was wondering if that was a little bit of the feeling you got but yeah there's a little bit more of an ominous set incentive situations yeah here we had a truck that we would drive to the top of his hill and then for the top of the hill we walked and fuck did we walk Dan Tony and I walked up hills at 9,000 foot elevation some steep fucking kills two hours and hours every day dude I was hurtin but it was a great cardio though awesome workout so you were telling me about these wilderness trips that you take people on that you like wilderness therapy yeah so my for my first job out of college I've been living in Panama with my ex-girlfriend we were moving to Utah and I just needed a job and I didn't know what I was gonna do and so when I Craigslist and we looked insulted the area around Salt Lake City and there was a job advertisement for a wilderness guide or wilderness instructor they called it I didn't know this shit existed at that point so yeah there's there's a huge industry and most of its in the western United States but their therapeutic wilderness programs which are tied to a bunch of therapeutic boarding schools so in the most basic sense there's kids from generally pretty wealthy families across the country that are having trouble their parents don't know what to do and they'll send them away you know as an intervention and usually the intention is that to have these kids go to a boarding school where there's a therapeutic presence also but in order to get into those schools those schools require a wilderness sustain so so I work for a program and went out there and just kind of it was it was a the type of program where everything was made by hands he got out there you were given a half of the milk hide you're given a knife and then you were taught some of the basic skills so we had to make our own backpacks out of sticks and al-qaeda we would sew our own moccasins you do all that kind of stuff and all the fire that we made we had to make by hand you know with a bow drill whoa so yeah so it was it was this amazing it was really life-changing for me because I you know I love the outdoors I love the wilderness and all that kind of stuff and I didn't know what I want to do with my life but got out to this place where there's literally walked out into the actually it looks a lot like this where I work so just these massive brown dry and got out there these groups of kids some of these kids would stay in these programs for 90 to 120 days so literally and here's the part that I still very much don't agree with and I don't like is that these programs would literally kidnap you out of your bed there's companies oh really but yeah man yeah so there's like you can do that for a job you can be kind of a heavy or a tough guy that literally goes for an intervention flies to a family's home takes the kid out of their bed and flies them and drops them in the middle of the wilderness and it's it's a as you can imagine it's traumatic man it's it's not like you know all these kids usually 14 to 19 whoa 19 that's an adult yeah well that's where you get sketchy is fun so that's sketchy look maybe I should say fortunately and their adult too yeah so they have ways to sort of override the age system at bad times yeah so these programs are meant to sort of give the kid a chance to look at their lives other than behaving and an opportunity let's just not like we were talking about but reflect and sort of explore and learn and there's there's actually there's a lot of good there's a lot of good that happens like it really does help people and there's in my opinion there's a lot of bad - I don't think you can ever imagine that you could literally kidnap a kid out of your house and not fuck up the trust you have but yeah yeah it's messed up yeah but that's it so I did that for I started there and then I started working in more state-run sort of correctional programs so for a long time I led the trips in Minnesota that were there was a 21 days sentence but it was basically an alternative to a 60 day juvie seven so basically steal a car you can either go the judge can either send you to juvie for 60 days or send them to me and then we'd go on a badass like you know 200 mile hiking Trevor's well it's definitely take that over juvie oh yeah one but yeah for obvious reason but then the other reasons too is that you know these programs are generally run by it really like grounded good people that treat people at least the ones I always work for my I worked for programs with really like exemplary leadership ahead you know I think what these kids can learn in those programs as opposed to going to juvie you know the shitholes that doors are it was it was a really bad much better option you know yeah I would imagine that some way way better option but just a kidnapping part is crazy they've given up on discipline their kids so much that they just say alright okay I fucked up raising this kid it's time to just electroshock therapy jolt them with wilderness totally and it's a long slow uncomfortable shock so when you get these kids so like if you think they're kidnapped how many days into this kidnapping do you meet them well day one I mean right away yes a lot of programs have kind of like an in-between camp so you come in and maybe the first two weeks like a halfway house yeah yeah I like wilderness up where else like a like a base camp you don't like where you learn how to do some of the skills and maybe you start so the other thing is there's relationships with a therapist that's how it works so there's the people that work with the kids directly are like what I did which as an instructor so usually there'd be two of us two adults with a group of ten kids and it was all all boy usually say you're getting into the in female and female so I pretty much just worked with dudes for a long long long long time so it's the instructors would lead the days and you'd usually hike or float or whatever you're doing you know most of the day and then you would run she called circles are like processing things where everybody would you really a lot of it was came down to learning how to communicate and can he get it honestly and openly it's really good act I learned a lot by being there doing it but then once a week or twice a week a therapist would drop in somehow magically and have therapy sessions with everybody huh so a therapist they didn't even know well they developed a relationship with them you know and they work with you for you know three to four months that they were there so they became a pretty close you know usually they became pretty close to the therapist too so did that did it stick with many of these kids have so many questions did it stick with them like how many of them like that experience actually changed their life so that yeah good good a good question and I don't think anybody has the actual hard numbers on that maybe some people are looking to get that they call ever sit it isn't right like if you end up back you know I know for a fact that I say contact with a ton all the kids that I worked with just cuz you know we got to know each other really well then respect each other and became friends and I know I've seen the benefit almost across the board like like good things learned a lot of growing up happened you know something it's kind of like a forced right rite of passage in a sense you know that force force for inner passage which I've you know don't agree with the first part a lot of I know a bunch of those kids I could point to 12 right now that I know just kind of turned around and maybe went to college or didn't go to college but ended up have a good relationships with their family are feeling good about life but then there's probably far far I know there's far more that didn't necessarily happen I don't necessarily think it was a bad deal for them to go through that experience but it's it's not a it's not a cure-all but what it does I think itself selects fur for people who really do kind of want to figure shit out because it gives you a break at a good time to do that but ya know I wish I had I wish I had more numbers on it how much resistance did you experience like when these kids would get kidnapped and also them come to you like how am I never more like fuck this get me home where's my mom Benny I mean yeah I don't know 30 40 50 percent of just like either shutting down completely and not compliant with anything or you know direct direct sort of resistance or eight or things like that most of those come around what's up did they go yeah Oh totally yeah there's not there's only a couple folks a couple dudes I ever knew that kept it down you know that kind of had that had the stamina to keep that up at some point it was you know it's just sort of like accepting the fact that you were there I mean get literally dropped in the middle of a desert and you're told you're gonna be there for three months or four months at some point do you either have to accept it well for someone who's on a fucked up path it really might be one of the only ways to correct it to give yourself that chance like we were talking about being out there in the the desert in the high country and you get kind of like a little bit of a reset like you get to relax and be alone with your thoughts and just experience a completely different set of input of a set of data then you're used to we're used to like certain kinds of data and input and for a lot of these kids they used to hang around with fuck-ups and being around their asshole friends and doing stupid shit together and they get stuck in these patterns these grooves get cut deep and the momentum of their life and their past is incredibly difficult to escape so that's why I was really excited to hear about this when you tell me about it I was like wow that that might work like for some people right well so and then you asked so how many does it work for one of the the tougher thing is that even if it does work so say you yanked on your home and look like just said to your home and your friends and your community has so much to do with with how you end up interacting and what you do so even if you get sent away for four months or even years to these programs and then you may change we probe well not even be you will change or incapable if someone will change but then no matter how much you change and you go back to that the situation that you came from the house your family just the culture that you're in god is it hard to want to not slip back into old patterns but then also even just to fit in that's I'd seen us that's what I've been working with kids lately and is that you know they go away and have these big experiences and they then they go home and mom and dad are still yeah exactly how they were you know as a try to be impartial I don't think I'm good at being impartial but I tried looking and getting to know these kids and all the things that they went through it's so fucking hard not to point every finger that the family in the pants and you know it's hard is that the parents were raised by equally fucked up people so it's almost not even their fault no the the line of blamed if you want to do that can go back to the monkeys from the trees if you believe in that so that's the thing about a wilderness like a long intervention like that but then I think that's what I meant about self-select because it's possible for somebody who really wants to change stuff you know did she has to change the momentum of your family to change the momentum of your past it takes a lot of energy to do it it takes like a lot of dedication a lot of let it go the bunch stuff but it really is a pretty amazing thing to be a part of it and that kind of experience does facilitate that sort of thing if one wants to but then like I said once you get home it doesn't get it's not like it gets in there but yeah you certainly can grow a lot and you can change a lot it's almost like we need that for parents - yeah I mean parenting is very bizarre it's sort of it's incredibly complicated very difficult to do and it's an unbelievably huge responsibility to be in charge of the really the the future of a life and all the people that life is going to touch so if you're your son is you want to grow up and all the things that you teach him and all the experiences that he has with you will reflect on how he interacts with other people and that ripple effect carries on to thousands and millions of people potentially it's it is incredibly it's so much responsibility it's incredibly difficult to do correctly and there's no fucking there's no requirements anybody can do it if it's like one of the most important things in the world is to raise a person it's going to affect other people in a positive way and it's so fucking hard to do so hard to do and yet so easy to be in that position all you have to do is fuck and everybody fucks no I can't stop thinking about it I you know my boy was born two months while my first kid I feel all of a sudden saddled with this responsibility not let it get I should just go it's going bomb beyond him I feel like yeah I just like I feel so much less of a narcissist than I ever have been just that it's not about me and I need to clean my shit up I need to you know get my act together give him as good of an example as I possibly can you know yeah well I think that and I don't know you know I've been very new dad I don't know this but I think one of the best things that we could do as a people as a culture is for yeah people for parents or to put in that position with all that responsibility to somehow look at themselves real hard and take that time I don't know the best way to put it but just improve themselves right rather than trying to figure out how to pair it a certain way or apparent better I really think the best thing we could do is just be better people would be better humans ourselves that's a very good point that's very good point lead by example you know that was when I was used to teach Taekwondo one of the things they'll call you the term that the Koreans used is Solomon and it was one who leads by example that was the idea behind it behind being an instructor and to be a parent that leads by example I mean hot or sometimes some people learn a lot from parents being a fuck up totally I got a lot of people's parents were fucking losers and they're just go get them so they just get shit done and their hustle because their parents were drug addicts or alcoholics or jailbirds or whatever the fuck it was and they just felt the pain of their family being awful totally but that's not a good bet well I mean that's learning from experience or learning example to you know I'm right you can either accept and love with it what your parents did were rejected or you know but so that I looked at to what I learned so I worked with with young guys between the ages of 14 and then toward the end of what I did that work I would do more specialty work so I do like one-on-ones so one time I did a 55-day wilderness trip with one kid just him and I that was the entire thing but what I loved was that like 55 days was one kid so he was amazing so it was fucking fantastic it was amazing he loved to work out so he was - he was a good kid man he was like 19 or 20 and just not sure about college not sure what to do did they kidnap him he knew he was gone because he was an adult he's legally an adult right and the first day he showed up and I remember he said you know what I'm gonna pretend like I'm with me here until I die he had this really interesting perspective he's like I he's like I know this is gonna be long it's gonna suck so I'm just gonna sort of you know just not count knees I'm not gonna like count my time um but he was awesome so he was really into lifting weights and stuff and I was at the time and so we would do push-ups one day we did I think we hiked like 14 miles and 1,400 push-ups or something like try to blow shoulders up it was so fun what I was gonna say is that what I learned from working with kids so much is that example thing is there's there's nothing to compare to that as far as what people are kids are good guys especially will respond to is that example like right you can you can tell them I mean kids say if they catch bullshit the fucking second it comes out of your mouth you know if you're saying one thing but you're not living it right I mean honest if you're not being real about yourself it doesn't work so I mean that I think that that was a real you know what I did this for five or six years and I was spent at least six seven hundred days out doing this and I came back from that experience just seeing this this huge gap in our culture about role models and mentors and just just regular relationships that seem pretty natural and pretty normal that just like I would get into a group of these kids and it would just there'd be something there they would recognize something give me and I'd recognize something in them it's just a really cool thing to be a part of you know what did you guys do for 55 days in the woods early so we would hike a lot most of the day right we would hike probably 50 we camping yeah yeah backpacking Wow backpack I'll put the shores of Lake Superior so there's a it's called the superior hiking trail that's a 200 plus mile footpath that goes in the hills mountains like over yeah man we would hike we'd swim in the lake at that point in time I had this idea that I was gonna ask my girlfriend to marry her so I was looking for there's a it's these little jewels stones in all the rivers so we spent a lot of time looking for stones I don't know man you know it push ups and push ups Wow and so a lot of conversations about the future about life about yeah how to change your path yeah yeah some of that and then a lot of times a lot of silence too bad you know we're looking at top 60 now it's bad all right but yeah he end up doing great man I think I think he's off kind of killing life right now but that's an extreme you know that's an extreme example so now how is this organized his parents were like a fucked up time to put you in the woods yeah yeah so they had heard about it and they they just felt like that would be a chance for him to break his pattern sure exactly that's interesting like this there was a generally a like different categories of kids who would come to these places so there you'd have your drug abuser sort of out of control kid you'd have your internet that they did slightly softer guy you know them socially awkward sometimes to be an emotional outbreaks they kind of broke you know into categories but but honestly that the thing is the cool thing about spending that much time where people is that you know like it doesn't take long to see through those behaviors to really see a good kid I worked with hundreds if not thousands of kids and maybe one one I can only think of one that I don't think was like somebody I would have a better today like good good kids they're really good they're great human beings are just you know shitty circumstances or made a lot of bad decisions or just refused or maybe whatever you know I think I could end it up there easy if I would have got busted in high school for just a party well especially if you were born into the household that they were born into and that's yeah one of the big things obviously about life is that you can't pick your parents and you can't pick your neighborhood that you grew up in you can't you know you'll have a say until you're an adult yeah and that's we were talking about yesterday so after I did the wilderness stuff I went and I became a high school teacher in the Bronx that was part of the New York City teaching fellowship program so basically they give you a free masters if you teach for a couple of years in you know high need areas so I was an English teacher it's really cool school in the southeast Bronx for a couple of years and you know just that was the most challenging and probably rewarding thing that I've ever done and really so a lot of the session so first I worked with mostly wealthy kids and some his private pay wilderness programs event I did a lot of stuff for correctional stuff so that was rural poor you know that was a lot of kids from reservations and just sort of no offense but white trash type kids and then I moved to the inner city and worked there so I got a I got a good Specter month I'm working with different kids really he's had enough that I kind of like them all but what you're saying yeah you can't think we're where you're from man in you can't argue helping of a difference that means giant it's almost everything in terms of your future you know and so many people don't realize that it's about this but a lot of times the really fortunate ones don't realize it because they just think that everybody's got it like this or they just think that well my life's hard too you know my life is only challenging and that we moved around a lot like my mom my stepdad were really nice people got lucky you know it weren't fuck-ups they weren't assholes they didn't you know they didn't beat me and torture me is here such horrible horrible stories of what parents do to their children and you know you got to wonder what their parents did to them that started this whole path this is almost like unstoppable force of momentum yeah but some of the things you were telling me about the the poor kids he worked with like yeah and so one of the kids that just as a me light-filled kid you know cut comes 100 I don't remember how it happened I think I think he came into school one morning and you know his dad had had bashed his skull and with a with a baseball bat just just I think he got drunk and got angry you just eat the fuck on him no I remember that morning feeling just so hopeless and just like you know nothing I could do to protect this kid like I could be the best teacher I could be the best role model and friend and this guy then that I ever could me but every night he has to go back into this just unimaginable horrible place you know and it's insidious there's a lot of weird ways that comes out Jonah and it's this another student line of mine a girl her mom would basically tell her that she was always sick there's a name for that there's like a conditioner but where a parent needs their kids to be around so much for their own well-being somehow they turned them into a hypo contract yeah have you heard of this no yeah there's a name for it I can't remember it right now weird shit man just just weird stuff you know I think there's so many people that are working so hard to do good things for for people in into harder circumstances and it's it's like an overwhelming force it's it's so hard and that but I've here's the thing I've seen it like I seen a bunch of those kids that I that I taught and so I taught in the school where I was their only teacher it sounds like a kindergarten model for high school right man all the learning was based on projects they did and had internships so they didn't go from math to English to science and all that we just worked one-on-one and they tried you know kind of worked on everything at all times and so you know they were my students for two entire years the amount of time we spent together was just really intense and man we got very close losing my train of thought but yeah so there's a lot of people trying to do good things but it is that home life or that cultural pull trajectory I don't know how to Kabaddi well one of those Pat well those programs like the one you were involved in it might be well the only way to do it yeah our a program like that something that's going to give them individualized attention let them know hey there might be a light at the end of this tunnel there might be a way out of this like there's nice people out there like Dan Doty they're gonna help you out and he recognizes that there's people out there that need help but they're filled with that shit every day - man you know they're told that by my team and you know that it is interesting because I'm this I was born in North Dakota I'm about his wife as he could ever be and my students who act so I mean just four facts I like the school I work at the Bronx completely segregated was completely black and Latino with Mexican and Dominican and Puerto Rican and black and not a single white kid in the entire school like it's just not that way and so there's immediately this hot dynamic for me to go and teach in a in a location like that that there is a racial dynamic present no matter no matter what like my kids who tease me about how it was great and we we got past any racial barriers but at least most racial barriers you know we're able just to see each other as human beings and work together that way but so there is a lot of they get what you just said they get a lot of people tell them that all the time that there's a lot of dev Intel there's there's options you know you can you can take a whole of his life but but that's just words sometimes to kids yeah just lip service you know yeah and they hear that before like you got to get good grades or you got to go to college you get a good job to hear all these things that don't seem to resonate no because it's disconnected from the experience of life right so I can go in there and say that and I went to college and I had a good safe childhood and in a safe place and I can see in the petition for get me anything because they go home and it's not safe and I think that's what it comes down to more than anything it's people are in a state of fight-or-flight constantly because it's really as a seat yeah I mean it's like everyone Rinella was talking about those deer today he was like the deer a jackrabbit runs in front of deer and the deer leaps up like someone hit it with an electric shock yeah like they're constantly on their console en garde they and that happens also with children and yeah you know I have talked about this before I had a feral cat and that fucking cat was wild too the day he died I had him when he was a baby I got him when he was a kid he was on a couple months old but he was alright it was very too late he was fucking wild yeah he was just in his mind everything was out to get him yeah I mean you know I can't officially say this cuz I haven't studied it officially but I think that there are you know versions if you call a PSP I'm sorry PTSD or just stuck in the state of hyper vigilance whatever it is it's just coming from a place that's not safe a place that's fucked up to be expected to to be able to overcome that without any real-time assistance work is really unreasonable I I think it's just this is really not like you can't just decide right cuz it's your body it's somatic you know it's like it's either you get into you is maybe it's your mind maybe but you must use its bulk but it's it's not like you can just say okay I don't want to do this anymore it's far more yeah it's a battleship that's moving a hundred miles an hour and you're expected to turn on a dime yeah it's long it just was a lot of weight momentum behind that past its I was talking to Michael Irvin once I was on a flight with him just randomly and I was all the way to Australia this is a long last time and he and I were talking about work that he's been doing with some young kids that come from troubled houses and troubled backgrounds as well and he was telling me that when a child is in the womb and the mother is experiencing intense stress from violence from crime bad neighborhoods that kind of shit domestic abuse that kind of thing that the child grows up with more of a propensity for violence like that that violence becomes like almost in their DNA as a response to any perceived threat whether it's real or not and that the we have to understand that these children like they're being wired for violence they're wired to deal with bad neighborhoods bad situations crime and it's literally a part of their genetics it's in them it's their DNA almost or it is hey I don't know this the Republican you know white conservative idea that people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps so just you know the cliche right they need to get their shit together my god is it more complicated than that it is man but some seriously here's the interesting thing is I do think that I actually agree with that in a different way I think that you can never expect anybody else to do anything like you the way it is you're born and raised in the way you are and then at some point you fully have to take responsibility for that right know no matter how shitty or great your childhood was no matter what you I think that that there is no one else that's gonna do it for you so you I really do think that there's a there is a piece of truth in what they're saying I just don't think that general mindset is nuanced or understanding enough of what people are working with it their unrealistic about yeah yeah they might just be like whoa what's conveniently aloof you know they're conveniently ignorant about the circumstances that are involved in creating a child that grows up and has been in juvenile detention since they were a little kid and has been in and out of all sorts of police custody in bidding crime situations from the time they were young this to say that you need to just straighten your act up like they don't have any examples the examples that they see on TV - won't be them watching an Iron Man you know it just doesn't seem real it's not real no and that's that's an issue I have with that whole debate your political discussion or well however you want to put it is that it's only they're talking about a situation and never is the actual conversation being here conversation between people who in actually affects is rarely brought out and it's just a bunch of people looking at things from the outside and commenting and talking about it not actually digging into it and it's just doesn't really doesn't serve anybody yeah and it's it's also like very dismissive it's very dismissive of other people's misfortune and not really appreciating or understanding your fortune you know we're all born in totally different circumstances for the most part and most of us here in America we were talking about this yesterday that people that are in this country are so much more fortunate than someone who's born in some you know terrible third-world situation like we were talking about Liberia yeah the reality of Liberia which is a former prison I'm not prison college slave colony what with it was they took American slaves that were released and they shipped them back to Africa literally and created this horrible horrible environment through you know a bunch of different factors but several war being a big one of them and vice has it's a really insightful and amazing piece Liberia I think it's a vice guide to travel oh my god is awful but no you can't say that you know being born to a blue-collar white family in you know Cleveland is holy as bad as being a child born in Liberia he can't so and then looking at that person though the the child was born in Cleveland you know I'm sure there's a lot of kids that are born there that wish fuck you know why couldn't have been born in New York City or fuck what kind of it you know it's it's just again it comes back to what you were saying about being a dad and the responsibility of being a good person and being a better person is that making and developing human beings and creating a community together with these human beings is so incredibly difficult and were handed this responsibility with no instruction manual no that's the thing no good leadership no instructions somebody or ship guys like you or some other folks out there that are doing similar things you can find you know but man if you don't find them fuck yeah once one thing I think it's really important that you're gonna get out there or we're saying is there's like a big leap to go from the place of believing others and just feeling like all my shitty like look at my look what I was in it was really shitty it's a big leap to go beyond that and accept it first of all no matter what it is that you got going on your life and then even a bigger leap I think to start taking responsibility for both yourself and other people you know I think yeah I think that's what is not that it's missing cuz it's out there but I just think it could be like we got time in our lives you know like we're doing okay in general in this country I think we could take more time for each other in that way just across the bar tonight whether that's in our schools or whatever it is I don't know well you have some answers and I think you've got some great ideas but I think one of the things that we talked about yesterday was the amount of children that you had communicated with that you had taught that found themselves these horrific situations that you've had a kind of experience with them and I think that human beings today it's important time we have to realize that we are some sort of a super organism where we are all connected and if this kid who grows up in this horrible environment and is just abused and subject to all sorts of violence and that kid's gonna go perpetuate more the same if no one steps in if no one offers some solid example that you can do better like some some sort of just some pathway through the bullshit yeah and bullshit's not strong enough worth yeah it for me like so I've spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about studying sort of both both rites of passage parts--the or old but then also just this really simple concept of mentoring or mentorship or role models I think I got really lucky like I had I not only did I have a good family and good parents like amazing parents I had I have this like string of role models that I had from little kids so we talked about this briefly before but my first one was my Taekwondo instructor was kid Master Mike you know like he was just I was super shy super like very soft as a kid and then this dude in a sports car drove into Drake North Dakota and I started taking Taekwondo with him and he was just this you know badass brash strong confident guy and I looked up to him like I attribute a lot of my the quality the good qualities I value about myself both of him hands in Taekwondo itself because it teaches I think it teaches great thanks to kids and so he was a mentor and then in high school I had this it's farmer worked on a pig farm his name is John where's my he didn't talk about shit we didn't mind he didn't like fill me full of wisdom what we did was just worked and it would work side by side let me make a shovel Pig shit and make dumped it on the field over and over and over nomads college I had this great mentor sort of you know nonchalantly took me under his wing and kind of on and on throughout my life man I I don't know I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and I really I just really wish that for for people I don't want that for people you know because because you can't rely on your parents in this life it's just it's too much pressure well also I think well as we were talking about earlier their parents didn't know what the fuck they were doing and their parents parents didn't know what the fuck they're doing and for a lot of us that's you know it's the reality that we find ourselves being born into but I think with doing with some of the things that you've done and you know also with the amount of data and information it's available today I think we have a chance of affecting our society and our culture and the way we communicate with each other and just just who we are as a species this this crazy weird super organism of human beings we're we're in a better position to change that and then than ever before like my grandparents came over from Italy and Ireland fucking boat nobody knew what the hell was going on their parents didn't know shit and they brought them over here they just heard there was a better chance there's a there was an opportunity I mean they might have saw a photo of what New York looks like you know there might have and they took a chance and they came over here the the difference between them and the kind of experience and the kind of access to information that your children are gonna have or my children are gonna have its fuckin profound you know and I think we're a part of something that's really interesting right now and that the human race is becoming hyper aware of all the variables that are fucking it up and one of the big ones of course is the abuse and miss handling and miss raising of children so yeah to that point there's this been this thing that I've been paying attention to that I think is happening so as we have more information and as things happen faster as all of this compound and things go faster faster faster I think that the impact of slowing down becomes very very valuable very very quickly so you know we're talking about all these wilderness experiences I also bring out like meditation or any of these things I think that as other things speed up I think that those these things like have the power to just smack you across your face yeah if I changed its fast you know and I don't know this has just been hopping observation for 10 years or so but I think that you know 150 years ago or whatever in the West United States we had slow lives I don't think we would have had a huge impact by going and camping for a week but today when you're pulled out of your crazy digital electronic life and you go back and you feel that human simplicity for a little bit of time I think the combination of the two offers a really powerful place really crazy you're probably cause if you can get that awareness and sort of that the impact of slowing down yeah compounded with all of the information and the power and everything that we have I think it's I think so I think we're on the verge or a very ripe place I think it's a it's a time where you know people can really change themselves a lot quicker or maybe even a lot more than they think is that's another thing I would love for people just to think or believe that things could be different that they could change you know because I well I think also any kind of a trip whether it's a meditative trip or even just a camping trip or something where you have that opportunity to sort of reset and reassess it gives you sovereignty it gives you personal sovereignty instead of just being just caught up in the momentum a buddy of mine my friend Ari Shaffir began bringing them up again was with another buddy mind big Jay oakerson and they were they were watching this couple make out through a window they were doing a podcast and they were on the roof and they were watching this couple through the window these couple of baking out and then in the middle of making out they start checking their phones hey this is this is what's going on today that's kind of sad it's kind of sad but maybe they both something bad for the better but you know it's you gotta not just have all this access to data but also have the ability to decide what you take in and what you don't take in I think that's that's the we're perhaps in the wildlife viewing area because I look - well I think they're talking about the humans that live here near it in the middle of nowhere yeah I think it's kind of super the supercharged time for that man and it's cool to see people should like literally change the lives I one other thing I'm involved in his eye I started a man's group in Bozeman where I lived in Montana and I've been a part of men's groups for a walk a while probably six or seven years I think it's something that's really not understood and really not even knowing about but really ought is it's a group of guys who get together to really practice being completely real and really clear all the bullshit out of the way and it's been incredibly helpful for me for me oh yeah but just that I've been party or privy to so many people just sort of like just changing you know a lot more fucking happy and a lot more productive and I think it's easy to get stuck you know things just are how they are sovereignty is huge me that's the biggest thing like owning what you feel owning what you want owning who you are all of that well it's also a lot of times people that get out of high school to go into college to get out of college to get a job to get a job to start the career they push forth in their career and before they know if they're fucking 40 years old and they can't stop the momentum of the life and they're not enjoying it no they're desperate dude they're quiet they're quietly desperate yeah wasn't that Thoreau yes men lead lives of quiet desperation it's such a great fucking whoa so why aren't we teaching every seventeen-year-old kid who's coming out of high school like hey that's that's probably your future you know once you get on top of it well you know how you teach people uh like this yeah they listen to podcasts yeah they hear people talk they realize that their parents didn't have any fucking awesome information you know and look a lot of parents they mean the right thing when they tell them get a good job don't take any chances you know y'all you got a dream huh yeah I will it dreams don't pay the bills though they don't they're not doing that because they're assholes for the most part they're doing that because that's been their experience in their life and they don't want the kid to be a fuckin idiot yeah and they don't they don't understand they don't they don't know but that's the listen up fuckers like look around look around and notice how many adults either have shitty lives they don't like or are like going through massive amounts of self-help or therapy or all these things at old age and not you know what do you think the antidepressants come from do that many people have broken brains or is there no I'm not denying that there's most certainly quite a few people that have natural chemical imbalances and some pharmaceutical drugs can benefit them that's that's the true absolutely no doubt about it but I know for a fact there's a lot of people who get medicated because they fucking hate their lives instead of picking a life that you enjoy or working towards developing your life into something that you'd enjoy you know and one of the some of the most satisfying email and tweeter tweets tweeters tweet messages and Facebook things that I've ever gone is people that have listened to this podcast and said you know what I realized I am 36 and I I've always wanted to do this and I'm gonna quit my fucking job but I want to figure out how to do that yeah I'm gonna work towards that I'm gonna save up some money and I'm gonna fucking whatever it is I'm gonna make pottery I'm gonna start fucking selling my paintings whatever the fuck it is everybody's got a thing and if you don't have a thing find the fucking thing but you can't think that that whole like work get a good job get your benefits and then don't don't do anything stupid cuz you don't wanna get fired that life is bullshit that is a bullshit life if you got a good job that you enjoy that's a great life and then your job doesn't feel like a job I mean even though it can be challenging and difficult if you can find something you actually enjoy doing your life will be immeasurably better than if you're just grinding it out waiting for that five o'clock fucking buzzer to come right it's what way I like to talk about it that I think is a really important difference is to be descriptive rather than prescriptive because if you try to force yourself into if you're trying to be Joe Rogan or if you're trying to be anybody else out there or you want that life like like good luck with that in the long run like I feel like you have to sink into yourself and just actually fucking be who you are like that it's hard to find though right it is hard to find who you are it totally is but that's I think it's your job until your until you are who you are and that's wrong the way don't be embarrassed if you're pretending to be somebody else because I think we all get that when you try to find yourself total mean I I must certainly have been massively influenced by a lot of people that I respected and and in listen to them or watch them or saw their work or whatever it is that's okay you know it's not as long as you eventually figure out who you are and that it kind of happened to you before you even know it like when I was young man I always I'd never felt very secure and always was like god I would I wish I could fucking be someone like all these people that I admire I wish I could figure out how to be me instead of wishing I was all these other people and somewhere along the line it's just kind of if you pursue what you actually enjoy it kind of happens totally but it's not it's not an easy process and it's a process of self-reflection and you got to be honest and that's where these moments that you're talking about like meditative moments or moments where you can go to the mountains and be by yourself those moments are huge because they give you this opportunity to maybe examine your ideas a little more closely instead of just constantly being just inundated with other people's opinions about what you shot have your own experiences man you got it just you just got a live and you got to experience it that's what I think you got to experience as much as you can whether that's a trip around the world or traveling or to a different place or or a hallucinogenic experience done in a safe way or whatever it is I just feel like you got a yeah to find yourself you gonna you gotta test the waters you got it I touch the waters all over and if your boy in this fucking town that we're driving through good luck then out cash payday loans man I grew up in a place way smaller than this really oh look at you Dan Dodie he made it 600 people 600 how many of them you fuck oh he left fuck yeah probably better off that way once you fuck people they think you owe him something Jesus can't just leave me alone mister whoa yeah shit out here hi I got super lucky man so yeah I grew up in that tiny little place ten miles from the Canadian border in North Dakota just like nothing going on and through this place Gasoline Alley Speedway casino there's a casino in there that's a casino and a 24-hour gas station fuck yeah cash loans on car titles that's the fucking title of the goddamn store cash loans on car titles how many people give up their cars here for a loan this is Fallon it's not exciting to say what it is okay poor bastards wherever this is this was Stockman's casino spinning wind Saturdays come play yeah a lot of cigarette smoking a lot of people here can describe with a gun tastes like in your mouth it doesn't taste good but it seems like if you know that that's a possibility what strange places there's a lot of these places that we drove through like how about that one wild west town that was established in 1865 I don't remember the name of it but they had the old buildings there that were there from 1865 that were in ruins and various state of disarray and decay surrounded by these more new modern ruins the people were living in yeah yeah they did because they they got something there's some class that's weird about like mobile homes and like really shitty aluminum siding and stuff you know no one's ever gonna be pumped to find that someday no you mean like 100 years if you find an old barn like that old barn that we were passing and that little shack whatever fucking was a cooled cabin of distressed wood you look at that and you go wow that's kind of badass no one's gotta look look at some shitty old aluminum sided fucked up house so what you're saying is quality spans time that American flags a little too big for my liking it's at half-mast did somebody die while we're in the woods some shit my uncle died but one of flags at half-mast that's what it means right we missed something we probably don't have a lot of fucking things that went down for seven days that's gotta be a good thing we know that two Olympic swimmers got robbed at gunpoint Brazil way to go do you feel better knowing that though No I feel like I feel better that I was in the woods and I wasn't a cab and Brazil the gunfire for bastards but no I mean there's a lot of you we have to look we should know that that's possible and that people can get robbed like when you hear about terrible things in the world the good news or the good fact about that is now you know those things without having it's not like you live your life and some sort of a Mormon missionary Factory and then they send you out there to the awful parts of the world and all of a sudden you know you're in some third-world country and you don't realize it's being run by a brutal dictator and what's a dictator like North Korea what is it like it's good to know that North Korea is out there there's some Kim jong-un type dudes in the world but never being robbed yes when I was little kid definitely gunpoint I got in the wrong cap once and the border of Ecuador and Peru got stuck up guy like they call it soft kidnap where this other dude got in the back of the tax that they started driving out in the jungle ohshe asking me questions about politics and my family and all this stuff oh my god I didn't really know I was just was down there learning Spanish I didn't know I grew ball yet and I basically said listen guys I fucking got nothing I had like 40 bucks right so they drove me to an ATM and like I got a guy got like 80 bucks more audible or out and they gave it to him then ran like fuckin just took off wow that's something that happened in Brazil recently Brazilian jiu-jitsu student from Australia I believe was out there he got kidnapped by these cops cops took him to two ATM machines and made him withdraw money yeah yeah cops fuck you wanna trust him but you know what man it's like again what the fuck happened to them what happened what happened to these people that are robbing these people something bad something it's not necessarily 100% their fault that's who they've become I'm not taking away ownership of their own actions but you gotta think about the development of their ideas how it happened I had this friend of mine on the podcast recently and he was talking about he grew up in his name's byron bowers he grew up in a really poor area of georgia and a lot of crime where he was just a lot of luck really fucked up family environments and he was saying that when we thought about robbing something like going to a store and stealing something we didn't think it was a bad thing right let's think that's how you get it that's how you get things you gotta go get it gotta go steal and then it was just that's what you grew it now he's a successful comedian he's doing well and it's like he he can step back and have the hindsight vision of his current state and like realize like oh that was why I thought that way yeah and I'm sure these guys have robbed you I mean they didn't have a fucking pretty upright there was nothing it's not like they went from a gated community to robbing people in Peru no it's not like they were doing it because they were just morally poor people you know maybe they were but what made them that way yeah sure no you should think about your own little boy he's two months old I mean you get to shape what that boy becomes as it was it becomes a man and someone did that to the guy who robbed you in Peru you know that is that's how it goes I mean it really sort of highlights the bizarre nature of humans raising humans we should really raise my robots we should yeah if someone should come along to make the perfect human razor ya know obviously for people who do a shitty job I'm what are they gonna come up with technology one day and I think they will that we'll be able to install better memories and a better pattern of behavior into a person's brain like almost like they're gonna be able to defrag your hard drive sure you mean just like with a click of a switch but yeah like look you up to it like say if somebody gave you a computer right but it has a virus on it's all fucked up every time you check your email and sends you dick pictures and takes you to Russian escort sites like you motherfucker it's what you do to my phone if your your computer your computer's fucked right yeah dude but if you bring it down to the computer store the guys go oh you got a virus here's what we're gonna do we're gonna we're gonna wipe your hard drive clean reinstall your operating system and then I'll back up your crucial files and add them later yeah sure that's that's gotta be the future of human beings yeah I think you're totally right but I think that there's some things that are acting in that way all the others participate in your child's life even if it's uncomfortable what though they're sharing their houses no there sure I know but what is that if it's uncomfortable even if it's under it's a billboard here in the middle of nowhere participate in your child's life even if it's uncomfortable who the fuck sees that billboard and goes you know what I'm gonna stop ignoring my kids doing math I'm gonna participate even if it's uncomfortable because I need my math well fuck man if that sign makes it happen for one fucking kid yeah I was saying there's a lot of recent research and study that has happened specifically with PTSD and in that realm that shows how memories and our experiences when we're young and older how they truly are stored in our body and that there are techniques available now that truly can unlock and and free those and it's it's it's not psychology in the sense of just talk therapy or just figuring things out or analyzing I think it's it's it's much more body body based so the idea is that if there's an experience that happens the natural human range is to you if it's overwhelming right you fight you run or flight or you freeze and it's the freezing that these people will argue that things literally get like locked and etched into your bodies either yourselves or your musculature well I don't know what whatever it is but that through processes of awareness and relaxation and and being able to go into that you really can open and release so it's not an automatic hit a button defrag the entire thing but there are things that people do that that truly work in that way and in that direction and it's not mainstream at all you know I think it will be one day and actually really think it will be but I think that there's proof now that things are more malleable our memories are more malleable are sort of set patterns although they're very firm can't be shifted I think there's a lot of Hope than that it's really cool I don't I don't feel like that's like an accepted viewpoint well I think it's being more and more accepted and I think people are understanding now more and more that there's a method that the human mind has sort of undergone in order to take these memories in the first place and if there's a way to re-examine those initial ideas and form new ideas based on better data and and a better understanding of how your actual your mind works very few people know how their mind works they just know that I get mad when this happens sure this pisses me off and you know what one thing that's a beautiful idea that has been going around is look at something when it happens and decide how to make that a positive for you and decide how to give that thing meaning because nothing truly has any meaning other than the meaning that you give it and the meaning that I might have to something might be very different than you would have for the exact same experience and we don't even know who's right or wrong until you look at like where that path takes you and I might look at going ah you know what tanto D was right I should just let that brush off my shoulders look he did and now he's doing great me I'm still carrying around that one fucked up experience I mean there's people that are still repeating arguments that they had in the ninth grade while they're in their car they're sitting there going this motherfucker thinks you can get away with that off cucas us go fucking fighting them right now sure to my girl yeah there's a lot of a lot of stuff that we carry around in our brains and we don't know why it's even there it's just bouncing around and he got to do it a clean up I got a defrag yeah well I think one of the best like tools to begin an entire process imp mindfulness practices which are so what that means is that when something fucked up happens and you're gonna immediately have that knee-jerk reaction all it is is that you you have you keep it a little fucking space yeah and you glad to be there and then you can decide to freak out or do whatever you want give it a lot of space give it a lot of space and think about it don't don't let the momentum of every event run your life because you'll just be bouncing from one catastrophe to the next and mindfulness is like a term that gets really bandied about a lot lately but I think the way you're describing it it's very important like examine these things yeah it is it is always an overused term minutes and a misunderstood term but I think it's in a very simple project of the way it's just just be aware yes and being in the moment being in the moment don't live in the past thinking about the argument that you got in the ninth grade don't think about your future only think about this moment right now because this is what you have look you and I are in this car driving down this godforsaken shithole Highway we could get hit in the head with a fucking meteor before this podcast even makes it to the Internet we don't know we're assuming right now as we speak in the dementia that's gonna get out but why not why not I like what you said about you know taking things as learning opportunities you know in general that that just anything in life that happens - whether it's good or bad is an opportunity that you can capitalize because you can learn you can it's just it's hard to break free of the patterns that used to have that's where I really advocate self-help books even though like a lot of people think self-help books are bullshit you know why they're bullshit because most people don't really listen yeah they don't really know they don't do anything to try to change the pattern of behavior that they're stuck in they just read the book and go they don't do anything you got to do something about it but being inspired you know what even sometimes a fucking really good movie can change your life because it'll take a little incremental change in a certain direction and then over time that could be a gigantic factor in determining your happiness or your unhappiness depending on like how you choose to behave yeah I think there's a big stigma to against self fell open in the hand I think for guys especially for probably for everybody that we just got to get over that yeah that's the you know it's got to be okay and I don't know because all of that self-help spiritual type stuff that's you know being fun of and made fun of for good reasons but but there's some there's some things in there that that aren't all that weird in there just incredibly health Yanis Patel is calling us no fuck you hanging up I was gonna I was gonna talk to him say something silly but we're to podcast Yanni I hope you understand 60 miles outside of Reno wherever the fuck we are we're headed to the metropolis of Reno Nevada we Andrew Dice Clay was here the day before we left the show the day we were leaving yeah I was uh I was gonna call him and say hi stop on it but we had a drive for five hours into the middle of nowhere so let's wrap this thing up let's bring it on back home but I think your life experiences and what you're trying to do is very noble dude and I think what you're trying to do what you have done is very exceptional and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this with you because this story's that you were telling me over this past week and all the other times we've hung out together over the past few years since I met you in 2012 is that a copy it the breaks of the crops the photos baby those stories are they're powerful man I think it's it's nice for people to know there's people like you out there so anything else you like to say to the world because it's not I just say America that people in Europe got mad at me I don't think so no that's it damned odious poke at you fucks so Dan is most likely gonna start his own podcast someday I know people like goddamnit Rogan you always trying to get people to start podcast it's not even my idea you fucking asshole let's dance Tony's idea he wants to do a podcast and I think if he did one it would be awesome so hopefully you will do that and I'll ha be on again when you're launching that will let everybody know about that all right my brother thank you so much and thank you everybody for listening and that's it we're done see ya bye-bye Wow
