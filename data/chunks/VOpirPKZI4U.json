the girag an experience you don't talk about Asians don't know this one your your reality your situation like your family like you don't want to talk about them I told everything you tell everybody your own story what you did yeah and why you can't go back to Japan no I could go back I just can't get out you can't get out once you go back I would imagine so there's probably like why's that there's probably like a criminal record yeah would you tell it's a little different because tell everybody would happen if you wanted to you mean this is an interesting sort of best story ever yeah well um if you want to listen I don't know it's not a problem okay that's the only reason why I brought this up because I know you're pretty adamant about expressing yourself all the time about I I would say before I finished start the story that Dave was arrested in Japan September of 2003 in the same week I was in jail in LA County so I guess we were meant to meet each other but they apart ten years ago said this come in September we're in jail Oh someone sounds like a stalker that's exactly what I would send Dave an email if I was trying to get him to get me pregnant yeah so what's your tell us your story so I got an email in August 2003 from my cousin basically my writing scale in Japanese not good so he wrote in English he basically could roll pop out dead that's their nice wet dad my father was dead but they didn't know how to write in English so that's the only thing they wrote and I called them and find out my dad supposed to killed himself so wedding a couple days I flew back to Japan and find out what happened because I saw him six months before early 2003 I find out that my stepmother was cheating on my dad before marriage during marriage and they're trying to during process getting divorce but my dad killed himself later on we don't know for sure he commits suicide or my stepmother have something to do with his death we don't know but during the funeral I saw my stepmother killed do you think she killed I think so why do you think that the more I hear this story she sounds like my my cousin's older brother in Korea she was living in Korea at my stepmother so my cousin's older brother lives in Korea their version FBI they've checked the background and my stepmother in the day before the last time they saw my dad alive doesn't mean that he killed her but she lied she killed him yeah she say that she was in Japan the whole time and we find out little why she lied she lied about that well she lied about that that's the that kind of guilt lying about where you were it's very suspicious yeah so doesn't mean she did it I how did he die um hanging so I went to police station saw the picture and he was in the hot Sun for like two weeks so he it was dark I mean it would look like he's hanging outside inside but that summer time Japan is so hot and humid decomposed this is this is how I met Yoshi he told this was the joke it was a darkest joke I've ever heard of my life what did I say I'm hi I'm the NOI your little wife she's like oh tell the joke it's soulful that it's not a joke I just like you know he was darker than a nigger or whatever but uh yo that is not a dark joke or even a good one but but uh racial slurs the are Kurd then Bobby Lee's balls yes so Robbie Lee have dark balls yes black balls um I can't uh I can't approve without that joke you don't say that on stage dude yeah he did he did I was like this guy's crazy he's like that's ridiculous that's how you ended your act I'm sorry that's a good way to get your ass kicked not yet but I'm gonna have but basically he had been hanging and he turned black yeah so he was hanging and basically the heat of the the house just yeah slowly cooked him yeah I mean I saw the picture the cop told me I highly recommend you don't look at the picture but I needed to see you know because after his death my family family told me that all the horrible things that were have so do you think that she could have possibly driven him to do that dad for sure 100% yeah yeah she lived hundreds of thousands of dead and he she told my dad that she brought one of her cousin from Korea we later on find out it was her lover the whole time so while my dad was working she was fucking this guy pretending to be her cousin whatever just a whole humiliation debt and all this stuff and like was she younger ten years younger but are you sure she wasn't just fucking her cousin this is why guy like David should be afraid of marriage okay never ever never fuck someone where you're confused as to why they're fucking you or never well then I want every day you ready yeah believe the reality is and then the natural law you shouldn't get laid Brian should get your shit together first but so so so that happens yeah when you do that man people start to resent you you ever see like a famous dude with a trophy wife and the trophy wife fucking hates being there yeah you know when you see that that that's a that's a sketchy situation yeah I've watched his dude I watched his white belt yell at him and shit and and he's like a like this sort of miniscule famous guy he's a small guy and you know the wife was yelling at I'm great my heart company had just he just absorbed it and dealt with it right and it was really really fucking me up cuz this guy's really famous and I was like ya doing man why you let this person abused you just this fuckin shitty person in your life is treating you like that what because she's not impressed with you like what is it yeah I'll tell you why some people weighed 130 pounds and she was 6 foot tall and hot as fuck and she really wanted to get fucked by giant black yeah mandingo two giant mandingo Orca so and maybe like what a guy if you like the abuse 20 guys an old guy yeah he's got this hot young chippy and there's no washes with him yeah she's fucking stealing from you now yeah so what happened so I went back to the funeral and somehow she was she didn't know my temperament because my dad's very kind a nice person he's never hit me before but I have temperament from my mother she was you know she was typical Korean women very aggressive you know so I caught her at the funeral by herself preparing the funeral thing for my dad right it was like way up a hill yeah way up in the hill rest of the family down the hill in parking lot they didn't know what's going on so basically I went up to with my aunt and my aunt sold my stepmother and she could you kill my fucking brother you fucking bitch he leaves it was me and her and everyone knows at this point that she was cheating on him the whole time oh yeah everybody knows she told us what she even tried to poison my dad so next thing he tried to poison yeah they took the sample yeah you know those Korean dish kimchi whatever she brought from Korea my dad keep getting sex ed they took all the food from refrigerator it's a medical lab they check and there was poison in the dish all right so your stepmom is poisoning his kimchi mm-hm and everything on and cheating on him and the whole family knows that she has the fucking balls to go to the funeral well she was playing this thing she didn't know anything about me and her older sister have a reputation I'm marrying a bunch a guy and the old Hina mysterious circumstance oh whatever history they have a history of that her older sister does this yeah I can thing this sounds like it's crazy it's fucking insane so my answer you fucking bitch you killed my brother she left and then then 10 seconds later I just started running over and just beating the shit out of her and whoa I grabbed back of her head and start punching her face for a long time and put her in she's unconscious no but she was shot because she didn't know I had it in me to do that and I was a little surprised because I didn't plan to do that I was angry but anything she was dumb enough to be separated by the rest of her family but she was a resolute she was by herself you were by herself no one's anywhere near no one near and then stuff grabbed her back of her head and just start beating her face in and I put on her ground and it starts dumping between her legs for like eyeballs was lopped up pussy yeah well stomach in her face or eyeball as well to come out I was stamping her face like after five or six time I heard some lady that work at the cemetery screamed that is like kinda I saw that I was stomping on this lady and started screaming so how much damage did you do to her I think if I did it like my cousin called me like week later and he was not actually he was laughing the phone like yeah if you did it for another men you probably killed her or whatever she ended up going to put a hospital for like two and a half three months but that snapped him out of it the lady screaming so then he ran back down the hill that's true and then like like everyone's like what the fuck's going on and he like grabbed his cousin's car keys no no yes I went down and my stepmothers nephew was walking up the stairs he didn't what's going on so I start coming down and he doesn't know what's going on so I figured by then I would be one person what the friend doesn't make it fire so this guy go are people this this funeral is how long after Japan my like when you got off the plane and went straight to the funeral right a day after yeah so this guy gets to Japan goes to a funeral and then just starts punching people and then like so you attacked him as well for what reason just because you guys I feel related to her related to her and like what difference does it make if I walk everybody at this point it's like porn stars like what difference does it make you feel will fuck one hooker or 500 once you do one it's really interesting you're using attempted murder and connect it to gangbang yeah well oh yo she kills hookers all the time no I killed him with his aids so the edible ate here attaboy attaboy so I went down the stairs I saw him I sucker punch him he doesn't know what's going on oh my god and there was a little uh a little bad for that no not at all but he I wish I want to do with it I know by was just angry with the her and her family right but mean her family just people yeah you know me know about that of poisoning poisonous people well you know me maybe they don't know what the fuck the yeah her and her but at the time I didn't I wasn't really rational I was just so angry so I sucker-punching he went down and most of these 18 I'm six foot one most of these people like five one five two right so even though I'm not a physical impose in America I'm pretty big in Japan you take an ass in jail yeah I'm Anderson Silva when it comes to fighting and beating up old women but uh so how old was she when you did this to her fifty five or something whoa holy shit she killed his dad man oh I understand listen there's no time I lost my fucking my I uh listen I would have killed her I am stomping on a chick for five times she's dead I don't know how the fuck your pussy stomps allowed her to live so he knocks he knocks the nephew out I got this list not something to joke about by the way ladies and gentlemen you're right if you're outraged listening to this like I can't believe I got that little mallet where Buddhists scoop the water to clean the symmetry I grab that step just beat him over the head a couple times ran down the parking lot and so then my stepmothers older sister and her and her husband I think I started sucker punch him - its punching everybody yeah punch bowl how's your endurance at this point getting winded yeah I able to stretch before that but I didn't plan I wasn't planning it so people do I don't I don't know anything about martial art I don't know any other style but it was unplanned you beat all these people up how do you get out of the country um didn't like see my shit Mike my aunt yo she ate she's the only one when he started finding me back she's the one she had a cancer brain cancer actually but she's the one you know uh interrupt a fight stop punching him and just told me to leave and I told my cousin drive me out of there and he wasn't sure because he wanna see your punch come true no no no I if I think he hesitated because he doesn't wanna a somebody who did criminal right but I he's smaller than I am so if you don't think I'm gonna beat the shit out of it well we got in his car he said try me out of there and I went to also go international he just got to Japan yeah like a day before then he would and beat everyone up and then he's hiding you got right to the airport I grabbed his cell phone and call the airlines changed my flight I'm praying there's another flight waiting for hours there just happened to be one in four hours so I went over there but that was the longest full hours Airport because I figure she'll call the police just hidden about what happened had they not call the police they never even occurred to them because they were so worried about her they went to hospital weather probably didn't know where you went they figure they figure I was hiding somebody one of my cousins how do you think that they knew that she was guilty to everybody know she didn't know how did you find out it was your aunt that told you right yeah it was her trying to poison him huh yeah your aunt told you what did she say my son have a medical record someone this whole time yeah yeah but it doesn't mean she tried to kill him oh no she tried to kill him because of the poisoning no that's pretty definitive yeah they did a medical lab I don't know how they figure a poison but they took it to live never eat kimchi at Yoshi's house he keeps his daddy stabbing kimchi in general is pretty strong and yes I love kimchi yeah of kimchi at Yoshi's housing to taste a little weird don't eat that shit damn do so you escaped Japan yeah and their criminal charges pressed against here's a weird thing mostly comps in Japan don't want to be a part of like family dispute technically she's still my family so whenever there's a family at each build a rather there's even a fucking head stomping while generally speaking but I don't want to go back to Japan find out so we remember you and I think Jody's ideas ask me like to go what you translate I would love to do it but I was little worried maybe soon as I land there's a Ricker of it and put me in jail there could be right there might be there might be no it is already what the fuck son
