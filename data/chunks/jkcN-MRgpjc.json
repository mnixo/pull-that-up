director of cocaine cowboys and then I look down on my phone he'd been telling me that he had to cancel so you were close by he said fuck it let's drop in anyway no about a doubt that I was on I'm getting on the 134 when he called the first time and I just got in the right-hand Lane right and I just did 65 like the rest of civilians yeah you called back I was on Forest Lawn and I fucking kicked that into that HOV Lane I had the sons of anarchy but that black biker buddy so I knew if the cops gonna pull anybody was going down first he was my beard I got in front of him an HOV Lane and I just shot that motherfucker hell-bent for you all the way till you called me and said nah we're gonna and I said hold on I'm back in the HOV Lane and I went two cars and there was an unmarked police car the right-hand Lane he didn't even see me I just slipped right back behind him I took my time after that 65 like a fucking salmon yeah that's like a thing that we do out here you like you roll the dice in the HOV Lane four hundred four hundred bucks literacy 460 and if you wanted a like went like when I go for it I go for that I go for the 922 package I'm hopeful 920 our package that's you go over the line and you fuck because you can only cut into HOV where the lines say you're permitted right so I do the 960 package which 920 in court all together court cause you got a drop 100 for the victim compensation fund another 100 from the deaf kids from Chinese society you're gonna run into about 16 allowed what is it about minivans and fucking Southern California that makes them think they should be in the left lane kills you and it's be particulars anywhere in this great country of laws when you driving this somebody doing 65 in the left hand they get out of your way get out of your way only in California don't sit there and fucking torment you and they'll give you the finger like they don't think that they should have to move it's something that never made it out here and back where I grew up the highways were more narrow like there was a lot of two-lane highways so it was just good good citizenship in getting out of the lane there's only two lanes so if you're in the left lane you're trying to go fast if you're in the right lane you going slow but these douchebags have this wealth of lanes you know they they have six seven eight lanes like you can go around me we'll just go around me why just not be in the fast lane each watch one lane number two we do 65 yeah no bomb you're going 60 miles an hour in a minivan and you're mad that people don't don't want you in their way that's ridiculous you don't have to be in the left lane that's for passing people you stupid fuck and the worst is like a when I go up north like when you go up north in the 101 after you pass a certain it's beautiful opens right to fuck up it's beautiful driving and here you are doing fucking Haiti you're on cruise you got the Eagles Hotel California yeah and you get behind the fucking 750 oh that's doing 65 and that's when I start to burn I'm thinking of myself for starters he's a Jew driving a German car how computers just Cox Cox this motherfuckers got no loyalty people that's right that's number one number two number two he's doing 65 changes at a 7 car it's because the only reason I would buy a 7 Series if when a cop pulls me over I could rip the ticket in his face that's the only way I would drive a 7 if I could do 90 all the time Joe it's not I don't see the beauty in it I don't see it unless you can do 90 then it's ok to you mean it's like a 77 Gabriel those I don't you agree you should shoot yourself that's a Toyota fucking Corolla you just paid more you want to impress people you know that's your dough deuce right are you talking about this 3-series BMW I have an m3 no but you have an m3 it's a big fucking difference it's so beautiful yeah I love that but the people I get 2/3 holding on to so I'm famous 8 cars Joey has a 3 and this fucking thing that drives brilliant but there's some people can't afford the 3 that Guetta I said basically it's a fucking Lexus fucking are they have a smaller one than that they have an eye they were tiny one they have an IM it's like tiny little buzz mode mobile but it's looks like a like that you know me I'm Porsche yeah the one I am I just that Porsche grow out wholesale we think that's 800 he's got a 9 91 which is the newest generation it's more than 100 okay that's a Carrera so you might be able to get that one for less than 100 it's not the Carrera ass you pulled me all with that car like yes officer do you know how fast you were doing it doesn't matter cuz this is how I do it what license I don't have a ticket you rip it up you give it to me given the name of your fucking attorneys got a yarmulke on it with a star you go call him in ten minutes I'll tell you it's a shooting star yeah I got a picture Jesus bleeding on the floor and shit remember that alright cocksucker take this cocksucker you gotta pull me over doing 90 I'm in Northern California you know when you get up here it's beautiful to drive you can't no six number one and do you tank yeah but that area is filled with cops waiting the bag waiting free I've seen it I pulled the one night on the 130 cuz this parts when you're coming from the 101 north where it becomes hilly and you get caught up on those motherfucking hills late night you got the music on you listen to the radio whatever you're on the phone with your buddies when you go over that hill look at your speedometer yeah you're doing 90 yeah by mistake you know really are you doing 90 they come right behind you yeah there's a lot of spots where they wait yeah they ride to San Francisco is a fucking parking ticket central are they driving speeding ticket central you gotta really see you got to stick to the law other than this around LA that's the one leniency we have there's not that many cops I tell you what was ticket City Boulder really them college guys have a fucking hippie loving cocksuckers those the cops and Boulder had this thing by uh and they were telling me the statistic once it was like one of the highest on the national average this isn't the eighties right on that one iris iris takes you into Longmont uh-huh okay on iris in between 28th and 30th Street they would nail more people it was like a national they just sit there by the mental health center and they get you on that twenty with the blinking light 35 cuz you ain't used to that you don't know what's cracking right so you don't even see that 35 you're doing 35 Wilson you see 20 BAM that's how they get you right there boom I got I got nailed on that thirty five twenty that's really cool and I went to court they told me at court they're like aw you fell for the fucking they have a name for it in Boulder at the time the alley that's where they just so it's a set up it's almost like the transition is so quick it's designed just to give it took us somewhere else I just was at with it they said be careful because the transition Nashville when you're going from Nashville Chattanooga we were talking with name they go dog they kill motherfuckers they're reeling as it goes from 75 to 60 within a minute you don't see in the cops it's right there hey man you gotta go for the state sometimes yeah well there's a little more of a police state in other places and there is here when it comes to that when it comes to speeding and shit like that like I remember in Connecticut like Connecticut state troopers were brutal because they all they had to do that every day they just pulling people over that's what they're looking for that's their their number one crime they're just trying to pull people over and write them tickets as much as possible they become glorified revenue collectors it's really rush especially rich white people yeah in the rich areas they just they don't give a fuck yeah sit there it's crazy the cops actually have a quota that they have to make and it's been exposed like the they were they were offering pride was in California there was some something that we're offering you know officers something more if they got more arrests it was it was proven that they got more tickets that they would get you know some benefit from it but you know you're not allowed to do that because what if nobody drives nobody speeds at all and you have to write ten tickets a day but what if everybody's we're assuming that everyone's gonna break the law and if that's not the case that you don't have a job because that's your job basically every day you're going out there and you're parking you're waiting for people to go by and speed well if nobody speeds anymore everybody just quits how do you make that ten ticketed a quota well you don't what the fuck happens then what happens in you pull over people for bullshit do you fake tickets I mean is it possible that we can get to a point where nobody's doing anything illegal anymore and we don't need traffic cops if that happens the fuck are they gonna do with all that what they need that money they've got that built into the budget the amount of tickets they get they build that into the budget they know it's coming in they know well we get it you know how did audit speeding tickets a week so we just had those up that's a hundred thousand dollars for this company la is brutal it's crazy that's why I'm in LA I see like budgets they talk about how they're ticklish town assistant for three days a week and four days a week that they're out of money I just go to Hollywood look around that's a money-making machine in Hollywood I got those black chicks or the angry angry sisters driving them ticket motherfucking cars those are angry sisters the brothers uh left it with four kids she got rickets you know shit like that I mean these sisters are beautiful and they're driving around dog I had I had a car in Hollywood that was given to me and they never gave me the registration and the registration expired and they will hunt me down did you know that really it would just drive around and give me a ticket every day just on Spike for the registration they make them motherfucking quota valet let me tell you something I lay the biggest thing when you move to Hollywood is your first 90 days if you get banged up I got like I got Stanhope's car towed one night by mistake really parked it by on Sunset I mean it's fucking ridiculous down there they will destroy you I feels like they kind of have to be on top of everything though there's so many people there and there's so many dirt bags oh my god yes they have people living in Hollywood like the percentage like there's a lot of nice people in Hollywood I know a lot of like really normal people folks would be surprised when you meet like folks people who actually live in West Hollywood and have like a little house in West Hollywood I met some really wonderful nice people there but there's also a giant percentage of crazy fucks in that city there's a lot of them young kids they move here after college yeah their parents give them a credit card go out there for you know whatever you do till the credit cards over no we've seen at the store yeah how many people come and go we're just having this conversation this morning at breakfast yeah how many people went came out I had seven great minutes went to Montreal got a deal for a quarter of a mil not fuckin late nineties to thousands and once they fuckin got down they went to the improv they got sandwiched in between Joe Rogan and Nick DiPaolo one night they realized how bad they really were and they said you know what I'm gonna go back and ret run daddy's fuckin transmission shop because they work and I've seen it how many people went this you've been here people that were gonna be stars yeah there was a lot of that that's definitely happened I think it's easy to lose your your way lose your your intention it's easy to it's easy to just fucking get caught up in the fear of it all you know the uncertainty of it all and just get swept away in it that happens a lot of people man a lot of people they just can't ever build any momentum up the can of a building to success up they're always just slipping around I just can't I can't get control and so then they just quit too much stress it's too much pressure you know me ask you this I mean we've been here I've been here trying swinging you know tripley's been here swinging and trying you know I mean it's really weird that I just never seen just given up I always felt like a lot of times I go to auditions and I see people that were at the store with me mmm doing spots not running the camera I don't edition people that I knew as actors years ago running cameras and commercial dish right and when I'm walking out though chase me mmm and how's it going yeah I started doing this I really wanted to wreck commercials and I'm getting in my car I'm like they never really knew what they wanted to do in the first place yeah they didn't really want to sink that tea if I came to you one day and said uh uh you know I'm gonna become a fucking writer I'm gonna become a director you like Joey what the fuck yeah no I don't think I would say that you know why Ron Howard no no you don't understand what I'll say to you but there's a lot of people in the middle of the game they change Ron ha was an actor I've got you know a couple years in this it's not like you come in here and there's a lot of people have gotten here and said fuck it I'm not gonna do I know I bump into standoffs with wild Willie Parsons yeah where's a lot of ways Judy Turner was a lot of these people that you know we're working for a long she knew that was huge Judy children is still working by the way she still doesn't movie here there but I shouldn't have said Judy she just came to my mom because you're just trying to come a plan we were at the Stork a lot of years you know a lot of those guys you just don't in my book you just never stopped being a stand-up yeah I don't know but for some people it's just the pressure of performing is is different I think the pressure performed for you and I is we that we enjoy it because we know that we're putting in the work and we want to go up there and give you a good show you want to go up there and give you some fun it's fun for us fun for you it's fun for us we want to do it but for some folks they just become more private they don't want to deal with the criticism they don't want to deal with the critiquing of their work they don't want to have the stress of it and they'd rather get a job like as a writer that happens to a lot of guys they just decide you know on the stand up performing thing it's just too fucking harsh you know it's I would rather get a job as a writer it's easier it's more relaxing and then some of them come back and forth you know the beauty of is that if you really think about it part of this job is the nucleus is the writing yeah so they're not really straying now my mom was right on the right hand change is completely fucking different right like I'm a producer now what huh what the fucking welcome yeah I see a weird part the director kind of makes sense right cuz that's more of a creative much more relative thing or an editor or something along those lines but yeah a producer but maybe they don't like the Performing part maybe you know maybe they don't like the artistic part but they really love movies I don't know man everybody's got their own fucking paths but for me I think for you and I there was only stand-up we weren't going to be anything else we were always going to be stand-ups and we we know that too like when we run into someone we'll know for guys are real I'll call you about this guy I'll say hey man have you seen blah blah blah or he's fucking real that guy's real that guy's real very funny guy and you know I mean it's like there's a few this there's not that many there's like there's maybe a thousand professional comedians in this country if you really stop and think about it people that make a living by telling jokes is there even a thousand let's be conservative and say there's a thousand and for those how many of them are like national like touring headliners is it like like 300 maybe 250 300 some like that yeah it's not that many people like that man and it's because not everybody's supposed to do it it's we don't the world doesn't need more than 300 good stand-up comedians okay that them enough is enough crazy assholes talk and make talking shit and making people laugh that's like plenty the the vast majority of people will never be a professional stand-up comedian and they shouldn't be they have something else they this is just a step on the way to them just finding himself some other way but for you and I it was always it was like I you know I was on news radio and one time the producer said to me why are you doing this you why still do in stand-up you're an actor now and I was oh my god I'm ready to quit right now it's like are you crazy like you don't get it you know you can't possibly understand how much different it is to be on a set repeating brilliant words someone else wrote you know in front of a bunch of you know other folks who are doing the same thing and you're doing in front of an audience that has to see the same scene over and over again and then you get to watch it and people enjoy and there's their satisfaction that but I can't fuck with stand up my god it can't fuck with stand up best quote I've heard the last six months is by our boy Vinny Kurt oh what'd he say he goes you know one actors taking a second chance they get cut stand-ups there ain't no cut motherfucker I mean for Vinny kernel to say that I got goosebumps like my whole body goes we're having coffee one day he's talking about comedic these guys supposed to be comedic actors get him in a fucking audition room they die the people just laugh as a courtesy hey who'd I fight in 1964 because it says don't forget who the fuck he's talking about you don't say and then he went right back to that beautiful statement yeah he goes all I know is I've been in plenty of rooms with these comedic actors from television show and once they hit cut their fucking in heaven stand-ups we don't hear cut I was like damn vinegar little chocolate like a bad motherfucker this is certainly an art to acting no doubt about it definitely but it's definitely there's also the the real thing about auditions is that's not normal you're you're pretending you're sitting down at a desk the guy's holding a piece of paper and you've got to pretend that this is a real scene you got to pretend it's really happening I mean you're pretending you're in a different environment you're pretending everything if you're in the movie unless you're doing some crazy fucking CGI screen where everything behind you is a green screen you're actually like in Brooklyn you're actually in front of the house you're actually pointing the fake gun at the guy I mean there's a lot of shit going on that would lead you to be better prepared to pretend that you're actually in the scene than being in a conference room and there's some guy who's reading like reading like tell us where you put the money or you're gonna be in big fucking trouble like that's how the guy reads to you and you're supposed to go what money guy what might you supposed to be real come on it's like ridiculous it's so fake that if for you to be real in that audition you almost have you almost have to be fucking crazy for you to be real in that wacky ass audition room I mean that's that dude just not wearing a viking outfit how are you pretending you're on a boat you just doing it you're just pretending it's some of the silliest shit ever must be there they should take like auditions that they film that were like super silly it preposterous especially for like B movies where they like got their cousins and I don't do to prove Sue's on moving and he brought all his friends in that don't act at all and they all played parts that's how to do the best because they don't know what the fuck's going on they don't know what the fuck's gonna it's the guy that comes in and goes me me me me you know oh my god you know sec I trained at Juilliard I was like what's his name what's the guy train doctor the last month Boogie Nights has been on HBO every fucking nights every night you got to watch the movie it's great moving but who's the guy in that the crazy guy tries to make

he's he's a great actor easy Capote he played a Truman Capote yeah that's a and those motherfuckers really do go under in their own sense you know that's their strength they they you know they take it to the next limit like that to watch it the only guy seen in a room that fucks it up in a room like that I seen two motherfuckers fucking the plural on my table they are Christopher Walken but one of the baddest motherfuckers that was on his tail was Phil partner Oh why he can audition he was a such a professional Hartman and could light up a room by himself though that's a real gift not too many when people clap on the scene yeah when you do a movie scene and at the end when they go cut and the motherfuckers are like yeah like what the fuck did we just see you know when they were saying when the when they did I went one day on the Adam Sandler and Christopher Walken was there but they were saying when I got there the days earlier that when that motherfucker doesn't seem he locks you in on the set like I'm the set the people were like but you have to look at the person to cut cut cut and they like oh fuck that's how much he locks you hmm like Easter and probably when you watch that movie where he shoots himself you know Dede Milo and deer hunter I mean watching that about two months ago he was brilliant he locked oh yeah he's playing the fucking guy that's that's all he was he was on heroin whatever they were giving him and Vietnam and he was on a game of his he made money by playing Russian roulette Jesus how do you prepare for that character do you want to tell me do you wanna what acting teacher on Melrose you to tell you about that shit you think about that motherfucker now you know he had to come up with that character from somewhere so there was motherfuckers

over here my play Russian roulette for a few hours I say yo what the fuck I'm on edge over how crazy are the Russians that they came up with that is that who invented I guess it's called Russian Roulette Brian know anything about I have no idea I mean is that what it's it that's that must be their the invention of Russian roulette right Christopher Walken made a movie that's not a popular movie I mean one of his best movies was the one only taste the acid what movie weapon with Nollywood isn't there a movie where he does something altered states who's in that altered states was John Hurt yeah William Hurt Julianne hurt William Hurt yeah William Hurt played the scientist but for me one of the best times I ever seen Christopher walk is a movie called that close range with Sean Penn

lot of people say be hunted his bitch looked at me she goes you just got three quarters in my door that is his best movie we have an argument at the house every day about it so what was this about that you got dragged into they drank no no they Co I'm talking about the story I wasn't the Sopranos David called me in for an audition but this woman who brought us to for walkins wife and she was working for The Sopranos she casted Oh her and her partner Casa soprano she's doing that not anymore now she's retired she retired that was Sopranos but before that was Christopher Walken's wife that puts you in that show that's who you met with wow that's crazy that's crazy yeah what makes sense though a successful relationship but a lot of those people it's all in the business people understand how nutty that business is you know you know I was thinking about it when they started accusing him of throwing that Natalie Wood off the boat shit Christopher Walker wasn't he on the boat you know no yeah he was on the boat it was but that's not who they don't always uh it was you know it takes a thief yeah what is this noise on the rag Robert Robert Ragna takes a thief I just took your deep what was the show he had after that with the redhead with the hot redhead Jesus Christ you're killing me I kill your dog I take it deep Brian you weren't even around for it takes a thief you had what a fucking exploded I says Damian Robert Wagner died you're a GN er redhead Oh Stephanie from other fucking powers she was the first original cougar yeah they think that he killed him al there's a guy who apparently is uh putting on a book right I think think he killed Natalie Wood his memory came back up to 20 years once you got the book via once again once again the 50,000 he fucking remember he snapped out of his alcoholism he's been on a couple NCIS's yeah a few two-and-a-half mends I wonder what the fuck man wow that's a crazy thing that too I mean if this guy bullshitted it could you imagine if your wife died the tragic accident and then years later some motherfucker is writing a book claiming that you killed her and you have to deal with the fact that you lost her anyway and you loved her and you miss her and this guy who you know who knows why the fuck is is that you breather no yeah holding my breath cocksucker no what was the name again Oh Willie wood bro she was beautiful if he didn't kill her if he really didn't kill her then this guy what a piece of shit this guy is that would be a horrible thing and it's based on when they got back from fishing something like that he and if he did kill her well he's a piece of shit in this guy's in here alright keeping chasing after it wow this is really interesting the only full sentence I could completely decipher during the entire argument was get off my fucking boat said by Robert Wagner Wow the day after Woods body was found off the coast of California this guy Davern said that he was asked to go to Wagner's bedroom in his Beverly Hills home where he met with a lawyer and was told to say nothing the captain wrote Wagner informed me he would hire an attorney who would handle my statement about Natalie Wood's disappearance and drowning which he did before Natalie Wood's funeral I signed a statement appointed District Attorney drafted one completely void of facts of the facts surrounding Natalie Wood's disappearance Wow that's crazy man they might have got drunk and he threw her off the fucking boat and she just drown what year was that brother yours in 1981 November 28th 1981 Wow they'd gotten a drunk fighting he threw her off the boat holy shit if this guy's telling the truth that's horrific cuz the guy's gotta live with that and goddamn Natalie Wood was hot my god she was on no makeup no Clairol that's 1981 though that bitch waked up drank a glass of our shoes and that's what she looked like yeah this is really crazy man the detectives at the who is at the heart of the original case said that he believed Wagner's account he added that the actress was very small so that it was believable that she drowned quickly wow yeah Christopher Walken was on the boat yeah Wow it says Christopher Walken began talking about his total pursuit of a career which he admitted was more important to him than his personal life he clearly thought Natalie should live like that too Wow so they got an argument that was what started off the argument it sounds like Christopher Walken was trying to get some pussy and Robert Wagner was there and they were all drunk and they were all getting shitty with each other and he fucking threw off the boat and tried to be captain save-a-ho and Robert Wagner said what bitch you ain't going home with nobody grabbed it by the fucking head doing true in that ocean well that's so scary man which could have happened we weren't there who the fuck knows oh man they had dead kids too dad kids yeah they had two children oh god what a mess dude is there anything worse than relationships gone wrong we were screaming at yelling at each other while drunk that is like one of the lowest forms of mankind a relationship gone wrong where you're both drunk and you're yelling H I get off my fucking boat it's just Charles Bukowski asking it's sadness whatever the woman you date I do the opposite if she the cocktail once and why you smell griever she smokes reef you have one yeah cuz when you both do something that's the same it's not going to pay off it seems to be that works in some people you know some people professional pool players they're both they're both men and female both professional pool players and it works some people do that with golfing and it works some people do that it works with some comedians Tom and Christina the perfect example it works great fucking works those people are happy as fuck tom is coming his wife is super having do it doesn't you know so it's not always but it's low percentage is low I'm sad to say low what I'm trying to say is every time I dated a woman when I was younger that should let's say she did blow and I did blow at first it was great because she's sucking your dick you light her asshole on fire but then somewhere along the line it gets astray where she's watching you because you got it you don't want to share well oh jeez I'm saying you don't want you got your period bitch you you no good to me you know say you're doing blow by yourself no son she's like are you doing blow no and your jaw is gonna last she wants to do a line now she wants you to fuck and she's got that blood pool and you got your on the blow fuck that well the chick had a period I don't show up really okay yeah fuck you just this evenin stuff that I made that mistake one time when over chicks out with a period and then she started getting naked and she had like a you know she had the fuse right in the front and after like five or six hours they can only suck your dick so many times I'm like me bow either ass and I went to her ass yeah like a half a head whereas if fuck that shit the next day mark Babbitt picked me up happy the kisses that picked me up where is he these days ah I don't know I don't know I think he's the vice president of Sandusky corporation and shit take Mike Babbitt who's the head of the laughs stop in Houston during the glory days the glory days where you would go there people don't know about Houston Texas man people do not know about Houston Texas what it used to be first of all it's the very first place in the country that I could sell out shows the very first place was Houston Texas and when the laugh stop was in his prime glory they had a Monday night open mic night where they would go from fucking whatever they started was eight with a p.m. they started that shit would go straight on two o'clock in the fucking morning and the place would be packed back and there was a hundred comics looking calmly stores job people come at 7:00 leave at 10:00 another 100 people coming over 10:30 and leave it - it was a legit machine there were legit comics out of that scene they were good comics but the scene crumbled and a lot of guys stayed there and guys that jettisoned they came to LA but they didn't fund success quick enough it wasn't what they thought it was going to be they didn't adapt for whatever reason and we lost a lot of guys who like in my opinion you know could have been like fucking all all-time funny guys really fucking funny guys they just whatever reason they never got out of that Houston scene but that Houston scene was a motherfucker man it's Kinnison and Hicks left behind the remnants of that scene they started it when they had that the annex the the comedy annex which was in Houston and that's where Kinnison was just on fire man he was just coming out of the gates gun but he was so unique that his opening acts would all sound like him they'd all stop talking like em they all would do like his cadence they couldn't help it it's like they thought they were so hypnotized by him I thought that might be the only way to do comedy now you know and they they would they would go on stage like you would watch them you're like this guy's like Dillon AK innocent impression this is weird that's how much of a motherfucker he was and so when Kinnison laughed it was just boom just left this ripple of a community and you know there's all in Jimmy pineapple and all these other guys that the toured with them and they were part of the outlaws now they were all sort of left behind and some guys some guys survived and some guys didn't but that was a that was the the burst of that scene it was Kennison and then fucking nothing man no nothing you know I mean I know they had the comedy what they call it the comedy Union going for awhile and I got the Houston improv you know and Houston improv how's that uh you know I said open mic laughs I think they have open mic night on Wednesday but not like that god I've opened mic nights they don't understand but I think they have a couple rooms around town in Houston yeah I haven't talked this yet other laughs stops done the new laptops done done everything's done the last spot is done that's done - yes all that's left is the Comedy Showcase which is on the side outside the improv or a theater or the House of Blues there's well copy look the improv must have closed a lot of places down because they get the top talent like if you're going to a town and there's an improv that's the top talent you know it always is it's always you look at the lineup it's Jim Breuer it's this guy's Tracy Morgan it's always like top name guys you know so what a club like that moves into your town it's probably hard to be the laugh stop and I think the only reason because is that they they didn't keep up the same level of quality they have like local headliners it was like one of the few places where like San Francisco's one Denver's one and Boston is another one the way you have like legit local headliners but like this nobody talks about like legit local Chicago headliners how many guys like in Chicago that are just headlining clubs around Chicago there's not letting Larry read Larry read he's been around for a long future who else is out of Chicago that I know there's a there's a funny fucking guy I always forget his name and it's a shame because I thought he was one of the best monologist I ever saw on stage and when I eat November his name no he's a schoolteacher he's got like four kids he doesn't like traveling so he just does Yoda rooms and anything local in Chicago huh but the story goes that when he was on stage and a rumor was in the old days when Kennison would do a theater he would go right to the koloko comedy club and get on stage really so they said that one night they told him before the night thing of liquor we don't want to offend you but kinnison's coming in when he comes out we're gonna give you the like wild awful pay and they said the Kennison came in now I had worked with Myrtle Beach and I left in awe of him he had one bit about getting on a bus and I was just dying and somebody told me the story years later that Kennison came in and they were like we'll get him off the stage Kennison was all in a drink I started listening to the gang go no no no no no let me watch the guy that's how good to get class he's a broom now he's got this is 10 years ago when I worked at it well Kennison must've been a fan of comedy you know yeah hell yeah you can't get that good without being a fan you know told the guy do you want to go on the road the guys like god I'm dead I got a wife a kid I'm a schoolteacher Kenneth you ever fuckin come to and look me up wow he's a great kid he still works he still works locally you know it's nice when you find new town on the road and that's why we found Tommy Segura when we did that a maximum comedy tour Tommy Segura was one of the opening acts they would have a new opening act in every place and you know some some guys are pretty good but Tommy really stood out I was like this kids fucking coolest Tommy cigars the nicest guy I am in heaven lately I have coffee with Bert Kreischer three times a week ah beautiful two blocks from my house you know now I can meet Chris Maguire I just started bucks he just wrapped up the burn the burn he had the wrap party last night you know I was with Brody this morning we know a lot of really nice yeah bro we really like know Tony hiring cliff he knows grody said a joke last night that motherfucker's bad to the bone Tony and cliff Brody's had a joke last night in the burn and I immediately knew fucking Tony wrote it that's how much of a fan I am at Tony's about that he goes to McDonald's as he eats the happy meal but he keeps the burger or something like that something very witty I don't have not given it justice but it made me fucking lunch that's a very good ride and I knew he was it was Tony's I knew it was Tony we know we were real lucky that we know so many so many cool funny nice people and it liked it we all feed off of each other you know that's a very important part of any like real strong seen a real strong community you know and I think we're a part of a very strong and fun stand-up community you know this is more more of a community now I think at this stage in our lives than it's ever been before and we think about all the people that were like networked with you know it's pretty unusual and how everybody's doing so well like I just got off the phone with Aubrey went down to see Ari in in Austin last weekend yeah and I was talking to Ari I was like are you fucking headlined the cap city comedy club like that's legit a cap city comedy club in Austin that is a legit weekend you headlined a legit Club and for the longest time dude couldn't get booked places and now you know you see him headlining a legit place it's like wow this is seeing your friends prosper and seeing people around you prosper and seeing them grow and seeing them do shit that's hilarious on stage man it's like nothing more energizing there's not nothing more beneficial to you as a person and your growth and your own inspiration because it's like inspiration without jealousy it's inspiration without you know without any of the negative aspects attached to it like no fear or insecurity that's causing you to be inspired to action no you're just inspired by watching somebody else do what you do someone that you love so you like watching them up there killing you know four years ago I was very disillusioned with this business we really yeah it was after the Carlos thing and The Comedy Store where they all went back and there was no real solidarity I became a comic because of people like Lenny Bruce that he would do comedy and then shoot over to the Chelsea and shoot heroin with a jazz musician and fuck a stripper that was the lifestyle I wanted you know when I was 28 I was a little crazy and I was content with that I couldn't handle a family I was pretty content with that knowing you content with that is great I was a little distant chanting I'm not gonna lie to nobody I didn't want to do it I didn't want to hang out with those fucking people the store ever again I didn't want to see him that the the real problem was when that all went down everybody sort of pussied out pussied out except for you and Ari and uh you and Ari with the only ones already took like a year off of that place and you never went I take I take my friends and family serious because at the end that's all you got I got no family yeah so you and on top of that I know the old thing you know you got a close one door before another one opens we were done at the storm I was done at the store and I went applied for a job as a car fucking salesman I took the piss test but like obviously the thing melted so tha so I never called back they were scared and all of a sudden one what kind of cars

fucking light I had an off from a weed store Michigan to fly me out do calm me realize number two hell yeah oh yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah why not what's the name of the store I don't know they didn't sent me all the details they twitter mad flavor you got to change your Twitter we need joie de uh you know Jones got Joey Diaz on Twitter we chart me you do I'm the baddest motherfucker you got involved Joey Diaz yeah but anyway the problem is nobody's gonna give you nothing bad bro you know I heard in New York in the 70s on Halloween they would put razor blades and apples and give them to kids you know what if you ate an apple on Halloween go fuck yourself you're supposed to go to for the fucking doremi I never even ate candy and Halloween I went for the money I went for the pennies and the fucking dollar bills they changed I grew up early when I came from Cuba I was in New York City in those buildings those buildings are Jews they give you fucking cash how much a table a quarter in the seventies somebody give you a fucking quarter that's a little juice drink from the hot dog man you know I'm I listen take your little MMS and all this shit and shove it up your ass isn't it strange when you really think back about the price of shit when you were a kid when you see like comic books for 25 cents and you think about how ridiculous like you hear like what someone's wage was he got $5.00 a week working for the ranch and you're like what like what's the price for tickets now for a concert like a hundred and fifty well didn't you say Bob Dylan Oh 225 yeah what'd the guy say there was $300 yeah well that's why we're in Santa Barbara I think he said 350 to me by 7:30 15 February 24th look at a 1980 I paid $15 and 50 cents for Pink Floyd the war and that's what the service tax the service tax they have now you know what how much the service tax was what 50 cents oh now it's dollars now it's like five dollars not any more than that is it yeah you know you think about it so in 30 years to the so let's say it doubles every ten years it should be 60 $70 for a ticket why are we paying 300 200 for a ticket for anything this was pink floyd the wall that's as good as it gets live at the Nassau Coliseum well it's just weird how everything got more expensive like that that weird thing of inflation that I never really totally understood like why does a lot of things have to get more expensive every year like it but it does why does gas have to get more expense who does why do people have to make more money I don't know but they do and it just keeps the number gets higher and yeah people are it mean for sure if you have more money you're going to be able to buy more things but then when those more things cost more money as well you're just raising the numbers but it all balances itself out it's just so it's a weird sort of a trend to me that things constantly get more expensive constantly get more expensive like no one's ever they're not going to lock an iPhone in say ladies and gentleman's iPhones $200 it would be $200 to the end of fucking time the iPhone 80 that comes out will be $200 that's we're trying for a fucking iPhone you can't say that because you don't know what the fuck 200 dollars going to be worth in 20 years you don't know what it's going to be worth in a decade you don't know what it's going to be worth if the fucking economy collapses like in Russia like it went down in the Soviet Union like it's going down in Greece I mean Greece is they're really running a very real possibility of evening the European Union that's gonna fuck the dollar up it's gonna fuck everybody up what happens I was with it how much does it cost to get your car washed now is it $18 you know what how much do you get an hour is minimum wage twenty dollars an hour now you know at a certain point time that's gonna keep going I told you the other day that I was out of touch with reality but I went car shopping yeah I sold cars for 10 years a forerunner when I quit selling cars of 22,000 loaded with the fucking under grease and the fucking stars in Colorado it's 40 $50,000 for $20,000 I looked at a Honda last week it was 10 years old with a hundred thousand miles they still want a 13 grand and the Blue Book is 14.5 Wow Kelly Blue Book you know me I know all that shit I fucking look at that stuff I have friends in the car because I call Colorado I asked around I was even thinking again a car ship from Colorado from my buddy in Honda he's a gentleman along on Toyota he gave me a fucking dollar over invoice right I give a fuck he was come get the car so I'm thinking about doing that I'm trying to put it together uh it's just I was out of touch yeah and we know what tells me the prices and things like I told you you know we live around here with BMWs and Mercedes so we forget but I go to Pittsburgh and I watch I go to Houston I go to all those cities I look at these people I look at the people who come into the shows and I'm like bro we're in fucking trouble I look at these malls or the auntie across America empty bro warm America's one thing they you know everybody wants to have a business at the Mall of America have you been there jumped no no it's designed to make motherfucking paper Minneapolis I was very impressed I mean the airport it's 10 minutes from Mall of America not 30 they design that city

floor is deep fuck for floors do people exercise in it oh you had a shock you got to see this thing and then they have a whole area where you're it's an amusement park used to be a fucking death it used to be the old twin stadium so think of a fucking stadium a baseball stadium and that's just a little piece of it that's just I walked around the one day was an hour have walk Wow he walked around the whole thing fucking whole day I didn't go up the stairs don't get me wrong it's like I carried away my Dolce fuck that I'm that walked around that mall oh wow fucking mall but it tells me that broke this country's in trouble we were talking about the phone there there they don't have five pound bag of sugars no more because the prices should go one up you have to buy it by the pound the three pound bags gas has gone up everything has gone up but the price of cocaine is still 35 a gram you said it went down they went down it was forty or sixty two years ago when last time I bought blow five years ago to 60 I'd go to el compadre pick up a grande 450 if the guy was high you don't say if I'd been there a couple times out 35 $35 you get jazzed up for and it's better than ever they say better than ever gives your skin a rash don't fucking heroin did you read about heroin did you read about new weed in New York City amongst teens what I mean Oh teens are going nuts in New York City with her weed and so was I so good more of it know what I'm gonna do give made DV pills and I saw West don't you get these fucking you know at a certain point time it becomes okay I don't know what it is 17 18 19 whatever it is you think it's okay for you if you have a good childhood if you have good parents go for it but it's not I don't I don't buy it that's gonna hurt you I don't think it's gonna hurt 18 year olds but is they say that if you smoke it when you're young that it can diminish your IQ I've heard that but I'm like how do you find that out you take two people make them live the exact same circumstances you know and get one of them high and one of them doesn't they both follow the same diet they both have the same genetics they're twins but other than that how the fuck you gonna tell me that that's what's going on how do you know what his IQ would have been you're not you're just extrapolating you know there's a lot of other environmental factors that could lead to someone being in an area where there's a disproportionate amount of people with a low IQ you know its IQ test itself is not really necessarily a good judge of intelligence because a little bit is about understanding how tests work it's a lot of really fucking smart people they just don't know how this test works and they they know how to be very intelligent in their own world they know how to be very intelligent in their own occupation on our own their own world in a way that you wouldn't be able to plug into just because you write some fucking shit on a piece of paper that requires thinking doesn't mean there's a real accurate measurement of real intelligent usable intelligence because it just does it you know real intelligence is social intelligence there's a lot of people that are socially brilliant I mean how many guys we met that aren't that good looking but they're always getting laid everybody loves them people come around grab on them they can't wait to hear them talk what is that that's the social intelligence is if there's a talent to that there's something to that and to discount that is silly and to say that you know the only kind of intelligence should be standing in front of a computer punching numbers and that's stupid because there's a social intelligence if a guy can talk some crazy freak who's never done it before into sucking his dick in in an alleyway somewhere I can't believe I'm doing this that's in social intelligence that he allowed you know he pulled that off yeah I mean that's what you saying you can sell cars that's a social intelligence you're like you're right there you go okay you all also you are you are a black belt in talking I don't give a f--- yeah you don't get down with the best of all that you know and bold it's tough to talk to those people like a rock and Boulder because they social is somebody real yeah they're very intelligent you know then I get this on a grant you know those people in both in the so intelligent take ALA dzo told me this once a friend of mine said to me bro you have to forgive these people and bolt some of these astronauts that you know at the University right there so their intellect is so high that they have no social skills yeah he's been sucked in it's not that they're assholes are trying to be bad people is that they really the introverts didn't know it's and I understand that shit I understand between a guy that's a dick and there's a guy that has his fucking face in a book yeah he loves and he doesn't care about the things that they don't concentrate on social shit they just don't question it hello uh the outside blow up what yeah were Dan and and then I told you when I was uh heavy in the martial arts most like a teenager I would get like social anxiety when I had to talk to somebody I would get anxious if I had talked somebody in return of video if I would get anxious if I would go to the the mailbox and get something or if I go to the bank and deposit a check I would get socially anxiety and anxiety where I couldn't talk very well for no reason because I just wasn't used to talking to people all I wanted to do was train so I was just training and fighting all that it was just locked into this one form in my mind where most of my day was dedicated to movements and learning how to strike things and then I would go out into the outside world and I would be really awkward it's real weird it lasted a couple years stand-up changed it for me teaching and stand-up the two things had changed it for teaching made stand-up easier because I was tea I would teach whole classes and I got used to being able to do that used to be able to talk in front of classes and explain the right way to get you know momentum and technique and all this different shit that was kind of complicated and when I explained it to the class I would get more and more confidence because I was doing that when I was a teenager you know get your black belt this week you'll enjoy black clothes that Ron Van Cleef is shit Ron Van Cleef you know still working out there's a video of him years online I think he's even hoping he's in his 60s yeah he's got 83 body tournament I think he was 62 years old he fought in a karate tournament but I heard a Linux I heard Dan Inosanto just got his brown belt in jujitsu god Eddie really bout you 70 Danny no Santa I believe it's gotta be soldered on to Jitsu he's been yeah I think he's been involved in in jiu-jitsu fro now his car wasn't in Marina del Rey he still teaches jeet kune do-- well yeah yeah I mean Eric Paulson was one of his students I believe Paulson is a guy who's sometimes more famous for as a coach but he was a great fighter for a while there's a shootout champion and Paulson I think is the main style that he originally claimed was Jeet Kune Do see but if you're in a G kundo you're essentially into MMA because G kundo was Bruce Lee style and the style that Bruce Lee always always preached was use whatever is useful learn everything learn whatever use for whether it's boxing I mean he had he wrote a book the dial of Jeet Kune Do was essentially like copied techniques of how to throw punches correctly from old boxing manuals he look like was like just sort of documenting all the stuff that we know works and he had some unique ideas Bruce Lee did that to this day are starting to be adopted by people like like Bruce Lee was the one of the first guys to say you should lead with your strong hand because in boxing you always lead with your jab and then your power hand is your shorthand you're your strong hand which you throw less of and Bruce Lee said that doesn't make any sense you should throw more punches with your your dominant hand the the jab in the hooks are more frequent so you should lead with your more dominant hand and then boxer started doing that Oscar De La Hoya did that there's quite a few boxers today to do that I don't know if Julio Cesar Chavez jr. does it Andre Ward does it Chad Dawson does it it's really interesting man there's a lot of fighters that do that now so Bruce Lee like predicted this shit like way back deep in the 70s so when you say that a guy like Eric Paulson's aji Kondo guy like anybody who's smart it's really a G condo guy because G condo is just like it's it's figure it all out pull it all together you know what kicking from muy Thai you know punches from karate this is this hook from boxing this is a double leg takedown that's from wrestling here's a headlock that comes from you know whatever a catch wrestling and he was doing like arm bars and shit in movies like way back I got out tap tap yeah Sam oh it's funny last night I was watching Pettis against Joe Lowe's only knocked him a good kick and you said you
