the girag an experience I was influenced by a tell a massively yeah like is a new drinking to the dead no no I'm seeing thing oh I was fuck I told you I came in yeah explain that because this is a crazy story you didn't say this in the podcast yeah I have I when I was in 1997 Rolling Stone magazine wrote a six-page article about me calling me the number one party animal in the country this actually gets a little weirder were you doing stand-up back then just partying just I had a notorious reputation of Florida State for being like funny but being a wild party animal like what kind of shit were you doing just fun shit like like fun I think why allow this guy in the room shit you know like I remember we I used to climb up on this telephone pole outside the bars on Tennessee Street there would be 500 people out there and I just stand up I go everyone shut the fuck up and listen if you want to smoke weed go to my house and the cops are all sitting there I have tons of weed enough for everybody and we're all gonna have a blast and get I if you know where I live you're invited if you don't have someone just no one tell the fucking cops and you'd have literally 500 people just giggling at the idea that someone was offering them weed in front of a cops face and what did the cops say when you did this the they would laugh too like one time for action I got naked for this election just shit on a pizza box and won the election election for what for my fraternity I just got up naked and shit on a pizza box and then actually won and then I won did you wipe no I just shit I just shit I learned one very important lesson when you go number two you also go one cuz I pissed all over the feet on everyone that was City stop it when you go to 102 this did and so I won the election so like all these stories came out and then rolling stones like let's do a fucking let's do an article on him oh my god gets crazier ready sorry for the you ready for the part that you go that you go bullshit I will never say bullshit I've heard enough of your stories I'm not so uh so so Oliver Stone optioned the rights to my life and then from the article so then I try stand-up and I moved to New York to start to establish I did once and Tana Tallahassee you know we went amazing I got offer my own morning show in Tallahassee really yeah Oliver Stone up see the rights in my life like I started with stand-up five months later Will Smith sees me do stand-up and I got a deal development deal with him like right out the gates like Bill burr style like she would stand up for no time at all development deal based on the article and that the fact that I could competently do stand-up somewhat and then the development deal falls apart with Oliver Stone all the guys that have submitted their scripts for Oliver Stone's movie about my life then get their an electrical property back one of the guy takes his movie changes my name sells at National Lampoon and it becomes a movie Van Wilder so theoretically and I say this theoretically loosely I'll never be able to sue I'm never would - I never would sue but I went into National Lampoon and did you remember Kevin couch he stopped showing nationally all right yeah XM radio yeah yeah when I told him I said bring some execs in I've always wanted to find out this is true so then he brought some execs in and I start telling the story just like I am you one of the guys fucking locks up like hold on stop right now what do you want what's going on here it's just like an ambush and I was like no I just want to be able to tell it on radio and no I'm not lying that's all I care about all I care about is this story being like true right and and he was like what do you want like your own radio show I'm like fine and then he's like we'll do a show partying with the original band wild are you happy I was like yeah and so then he was like pretty much I was like so I can say what row but yeah we're gonna sue them we were telling stories this weekend about like like one time at ok one time one morning I thought I was my parents are out of town my little sister was 10 I was probably 21 I was drinking a lot at the time cuz you know party animal shit and then and I was pissing a lot of places that like in around houses like I pissed on my ex-girlfriends dining room table and was walked in by her dad dude you want to talk about a fucking nightmare Oh what wait a minute wait a minute you pissed on the dining room table down Metta and her dad walked in and caught you her dad Larry medic in Orlando Larry if you're listening I I what I'm guilty I so here's again because I never really accepted blame for it I always said it never fucking happen cuz it because I would didn't want it because I didn't want okay why did you do it was Thanksgiving it was right after the wrong Stone magazine came out and so and I go back to party ah you mean the Rolling Stone magazine with the number of the released under 1997 called me the number one party and I'm on the country just for someone who's not doesn't know and then that was a big deal I became famous and I became famous in like Tampa Florida Tampa Tallahassee Gainesville Orlando anywhere that I had people with four went to Florida State lived I was fitted they knew who I was they were like that's the fucking party guy so if I went out shots really weed any do people put drugs in my hand like it was fucking insane I get roofied I got roofied a couple times so you became like a sort of a celebrity party already I became the guy that I'd walk after the before the article I was just a loud fun shirtless guy on top of the bar getting everyone in a frenzy and then when the article came out it was like the fucking linemen would come to the bar I drank at Yanni's and they pulled me aside they're like you drink with us tonight we want to drink with the party animal and then I just be up with these linemen like four linemen and we'd be just doing shots and shots a shot and these guys are 350 pounds when I got to to 18 at the time probably like right through to 18 and probably more like 225 but but and so I became like like I say famous I say I say like reality-show famous like the way Snooki first season was you know so that's how you were in your town and you're in low Halla hash if I went any right after that article came

bed I think I get confused I wake up at like I just pee on my I think I could be a suitcases a lot like it what yeah I put it in first credit of really drunk people peeing in suitcases yeah it's actually fairly common yeah it happens maybe twice a year last time you were here there's a fucking story about the Russian mob we tease these bitches we let these people right now on Twitter they've been going crazy all day do not let Bert Kreischer get out of there without the Russian mob story man tell us what the fuck happened all right this is in 1993 probably I think is when I went to Russia I was taking Russian classes at Florida State I thought there were Spanish classes because I thought there was business classes because I was a noon class and I signed up and then I was like fucking sweet Spanish at noon I can phone that in and then I get there and they start writing a new language a new alphabet and I'm like all right this clearly isn't Spanish so then I said I'm gonna leave in the teachers like listen don't leave because if you leave well we can't have a class and I can't get my master's degree so but if you stick around I'll talk to you after the class I get done the end of class she's like listen don't you know if you don't leave and I won't just show up a class he'll get be a see I was like done done so I took Russian I took Russian one two and three because these kids need another guy in the their class to take these classes so then finally I take Rush I take runs before when we go to Russia we go to Russia but this is Russia like when the mob ran Russia like are you are you guys aware of that now ok in like the nine late 90s mid 90s the mob ran everything that had to do with Russia so when going over to Russia you had to you had to literally pay off the mob in order to go and study abroad so we paid off the mob and they gave us and return to banditos two young mobsters who would go everywhere with us they lived in our hotel they stayed with us they went on tours with us they want they would did everything with us their names are Igor sasha our teacher was like listen this is Igor and Sasha they will be ghosting us with my teacher who was there with me was like during the fucking mob Igor inside gonna thought it's like a neighbor guy named Bruce and they were like and they were oh it gets worse so so they like listen whatever you do to our class do not talk to them do not interact with the hallmark do not engage them they're only here to shadow it so in my head I'm like fucking get to know these guys right like get a bottle of vodka six-pack a ball knock on their door no minds where I speak no Russian at the time no Russians I'd never studied in any of the classes so first night there a knock on a door in Sasha's room and they're having a party in there like fucking all their friends are in their room they live right next to me and Kendra my teacher lived across the hall from Igor so I knock on the door Igor opens the door and he looks like a fuckin thug he's got he's got like a wife-beater on a cigarette a beer and he just looks at me in Russian he just goes stole and now is the second he says that I start panicking all the phrases I had in my head that I was trying to say all disappear and all I say to Igor in Russian is I am the machine what is that he say that yeah yeah machine oh and so but I just said yeah machine though and he went huh stole and now I don't know what I said I'm like - what did I just say I'll fuck you up like and I go I go I am the machine and he goes say it again I said I'm the machine and then he starts laughs and he brings me into the room he's like hold on say it again and so I say it to the room I don't know what the fuck I'm saying I'm like I'm the machine they're like you're the machine I'm like on the machine I said that all fucking night with these guys that's the only communication we had as I said on the machine and Igora Sasha and I became best friends right we did everything together if we went on a field trip I they would tell me machine you don't need to go on the field trips come drink with us so now cut to one day we have to take a train to Moscow now a different mob ran the train to Moscow and a different train mob ran Moscow and Igor Sasha were not allowed to cross boundaries and they told me they said listen we're not going to go with you

Harty we're gonna party hearty today so I'm standing like this for his whole fucking hour speech with a basketball here and there and he's like and he keeps coming back to me and by the way I'm so in my head that I have social anxiety disorder but I'm in front of everyone and I'm like being made fun I'm being mocked that I wasn't listening to his question so he's like you think you'll ever party again I just said yeah and the fucking place went bananas they're like oh and he's like how do you party Harty I was like and I didn't know the answer I just was like with two hands fucking people are losing you think you knew marijuana and now I'm killing I'm like I'll get to in college and these kids I left that gym and everyone wanted to talk to me everyone's like party animal what are you doing and that you're still holding the basketball between your legs the whole fucking time so why you're cracking jokes while I'm cracking jokes and I wanted to hold the basketball an hour that's a long time my cousin Ava almost brought him here today I should have I didn't even think about it my cousin Abe was there at the camp he because he's from Philly I didn't know anyone because names like I didn't I didn't know you party like oh I don't I don't I just thought we don't put our fucking hands he's like no why would you put your hands up if you don't party I was like I wanted to be cool ah so yeah so like so now and then everyone would come up and they'd be like party animal you partying harder I'd be like yeah but then I became cool at that camp and then I have friends and so I wrote that story is a little longer and I gave it to them I go this is the best story this defines me and they're like uh I'm not really that's a lair yes so it's all partying stories but it's like that's a hilarious story no thanks that's so nutty that this could have possibly sent you on a path when you were that young yeah you know thirteen years old I just I and it's all just wanting to be accepted did you ever have one of those moments where you'd go somewhere and you didn't know anybody sure you felt like everyone fucking grew up together yeah that's a weird feeling I felt like that a lot as a kid but I thought that that defined me then I became the part I became the party animal that kind of lived up to whatever I by the way I went to high school the very next year didn't know anyone so I'm sure that kind of I was like well it worked in Villanova so
