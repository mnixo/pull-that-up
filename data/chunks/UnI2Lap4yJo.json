boom and we're live Jamie words you get that awesome shirt show everybody your shirt can you show the people your shirt I picked it up yesterday it says believe believe that believe that from the hundreds I saw the store yesterday what is the hundreds hundreds is a streetwear brand it's starring Fairfax I thought it was like a scene in a movie I was confused oh so I just saw it I was like op dope yeah I mean that's a combination of that girl who's on dr. Phil show and UFO Soria yeah yeah take bleah dad cuz like believe believe is so x-files the year to 1999 or whatever it was like when was the x-files on it's on now but when yeah right but when was the original one yeah and one star 90s late 90s mid nineties yeah yeah believe is that that's that poster and I always just you can't disconnect them from the pole the poster and Mulder's office but believe that that's today you nailed it even whoever made that shirt it's a cool shirt is it I want to believe that would have on the poster yeah yeah believe that's better but I do want to believe of all the things of all the stupid things I would love to believe that someone like got real footage of UFOs like more than almost any other weird like Bigfoot type Loch Ness monster all the really nutty shit if they could find out one of those was true fucking aliens number one right for sure even if you just knew for sure that you saw a real ship or if the aliens looked like a Bigfoot then you kill two birds with one stone that was a actual theory to some of these Bigfoot people or so there's spectrums of Bigfoot people man this Bigfoot people there's people that are like real primatologists like Jane Goodall Jane Goodall believes in Bigfoot believe it or not it's really fascinating there's a whole interview with her where she says she's sure it she said she's sure that there's another species how how can she be sure let's play the clip see if we can find that clip who's Jane Goodall he's a world famous primatologist who did some groundbreaking work with chimpanzees she essentially lived with chimpanzees she's so powerful I mean this lady is amazing if you watch her documentaries so when someone like her says something like that I'm like okay well I should shut the fuck up and stay in my lane what I'm gonna argue with Jane Goodall about primates and it used to be a real thing they used to really be a Gigantopithecus an 8-foot tall orangutan like thing that probably walked on two legs and she believed it's real she thinks it did exist or she thinks the thinks it exists right now Wow yeah Wow I don't think it was taken out of context because I'm pretty sure it was someone asked her a question and then she gave a long a detailed answer based on like what we know about certain chimpanzee subspecies that are really really hard to find like we just find it now I think they figured it out from like the 1990s this is a giant version of chimpanzees that lives in the Congo it's there call them bondo Apes or there's a couple different names for them they call them but they sleep on the ground like gorillas they're giant chimps I love that stuff these watch planet earth to the other day just mesmerized just physically saying like wow wow I don't think a normal person understands what you're talking about when you say a six-foot-tall chimp yeah I just don't think they know what you're talking about you're talking about like a super gorilla it's like not it's it's way scarier than a gorilla because they're there chimps chimps are scarier chimps are predators yeah chimps eat monkeys man I mean they people want to associate chimps with bananas and nuts and stuff like that they eat that stuff too but they also eat monkeys scary dude they're they're ruthless motherfuckers what is this buddies from MPR conversation yeah see if you can find the actual recording because it's fascinating when you hear the tone of her voice she says something like I'm sure of it well she has this super powerful voice this lemonis lady is a fucking biologist badass she's living with chimps man just hanging out with them constantly you know what kind of human being you have to be to be able to keep your shit together and a tribe of wild chimps where they accept you Big Bear you don't just smash your fucking head in for a goof that is crazy dude come on man well here's this is the transcription but I'm pretty sure it's that soundbite here but there's no link or anything oh I know it exists dude tried find it on YouTube maybe shit what did what did she say there well well now you'll be amazed when I tell you that I'm sure that they exist yeah yeah that's what it was that's how she said it well now you will be amazed when I tell you that I'm sure that they exist ha ha ha ha that's basically how she said it did you always believe that they existed she says well I'm a romantic so I always wanted that and there you have it ba ba ba ba ba where does it say about evidence she's talking to dr. Meldrum who you talked to here yeah we had dr. Meldrum what is his full name Jeffrey Meldrum Jeffrey Meldrum and he's a professor right I think he brought in the mm-hmm the Bigfoot foot who's the guy dr. Meldrum was a really nice guy he also said he'd be willing to cut off a finger to know that Bigfoot was real whoa like what pinky yeah thank you which one would which one would you go with pinky no cuz you'd want the pinky cuz that's the farthest leverage to the other side of the thumb right so it's sort of like a claw maybe the ring finger it's a good point the middle finger seems pretty pointless this is the interview but I don't know where you're going to be amazed when I tell you I'm sure they exist it's like a scene in the movie when she says it because here she is this esteemed scientist right and you're expecting well there's no evidence and right now that's just we think of it as legend could possibly be a bunch of different things that people think they saw voice and deliveries important when it comes to being convinced of something yeah you think about like you know all the way to just comedians right you know you think of Chappelle's voice if you look at the transcript of what Chappelle's saying at times I'm sure it's not that insane but you listen to him say those things sing gozu Joey Diaz oh yeah for sure you know and when it's coming from a scientist with long gray hair who lives with chimps she must I mean you think she's hooked up I mean she lives with all of them yeah well know you'll be amazed when I tell you that I'm sure that yeah I've talked to so many Native Americans who all described the same stones - who've seen them probably got about Oh 30 books that have come from different parts of the world from the China from from all over the place do you always have this belief that they're the baby that they exist well I'm a romantic all right thank you thanks for calling she probably knows more than me so you know if you can when in doubt go with the person knows more than you but I've net I've never seen any like real evidence other than these footprint things I mean everything else is just bullshit they find hair turns out to be bear hair they find scat turns out to be like wolf scat where'd they find the foot princess how'd you find him everywhere man but you don't know what you're looking at you know it could be anything could be someone decided to fake footprints you know it could be a big bear less likely but but it depends on the area like a big grizzly bear print who knows I mean you would if to make it look a human foot it would have to either be a giant human foot or be just incredible special effects it's one of two things you know some of them they got like ridges they've found like dermal ridges that indicate they think it indicates like what like a footprint type thing but with the with the feet of these things they seem to think that that somehow or another makes it very very difficult to fake but people want to believe that shit that's part of the problem part of the problem is it's fun it's super fun to believe that someone's not fucking with you but that's some big giant monkey just walked through but with every day every passing minute of every day it becomes way less likely that's a real thing because there's so many people with cameras yeah and these people go deep into the woods and I think it's also like one of the cooler things to believe in because it's not you know yeah even if it did exist like we have guns and shit where is like if aliens existed were fucked yeah we're fucked maybe so we're sort of rootin for the sasquatches in the world what all the look there had to be a bunch of different kinds of human being like creatures that existed it just only makes sense they're finding new ones all the time they like constantly finding some new subspecies of people that they weren't aware of before it's super possible that something grew to be like that like why wouldn't it be if we can get a chant why why is that so weird like it's not any weirder than a person or a chimp both of those things are way weirder we found another person we Blake holy shit look what it's done like if we could if we poked our head into some other dimension right and we just stuck our head through and we saw the impact of a human civilization on the natural world we'd be like what the fuck that's way crazier than Bigfoot yeah human being is making tubes out of aluminum with giant wings and shooting itself into the sky and landing on different spots it's sucking oil out of the ground and using it to build everything it's talking on behind and it goes to the air and winds up in your phone all this is done by a human that's way crazier than Bigfoot that's fucking crazy then you go to chimps chimps are way crazier than Bigfoot they're hunt and monkeys man they're fucking forming little societies together some of them are figuring out how to use tools and they're right there like that's way crazier than Bigfoot Bigfoot's just a shy guy they just he just wants to be alone just let him find a good place to shit you can't find any Bigfoot shit because he's always paranoid that people are watching them so he's holding his shit in I I think Jane Goodall is wrong on this one I'm gonna be honest with ya I don't know where but I'm gonna go out there off on a limb that is a limb it's quite a limb sir why would you think that she would think that's real because she wants it to be real yeah and you know she said that she was talking to Native Americans about it and you know they're like you know they go off on there a little bit trippy right right right who knows you know just like saying you talked to two Native Americans it's like saying I talked to two white people like you just people you know just because they happen to be Native Americans like they got street cred for Bigfoot she that's what she's saying yeah she said she's the Native Americans Bigfoot street cred closer to the Sasquatch they named it it's like if anybody knows about almost going extinct it should be state of California sued because it won't recognize Bigfoot Oh today there's a lot of people in this country who claim to believe the existence of Bigfoot but one California woman believes it so strongly in the Beast that she's actually filed a lawsuit to prove it could you imagine being the court systems all choked up with divorce and RUP shin and tax evasion whatever the fuck else they investigate and this crazy lady it's like I got a team of lawyers we're taking the whole state down we're taking the whole state down they won't recognize a Squatch we won't recognize them and she's just going to town getting crazy she makes it GoFundMe and Bigfoot people they're like super pom pom there's some action something's happening they'll fucking donate to that go fund me a little bit here a little bit here a lot of Bigfoot lovers out there and this chick could be fighting the government imagine the lawyer that takes that case like is this a video of her with Bigfoot yeah she said it was 30 feet up into a tree it seems real where just observe wonderful people that really really really really really really really want Bigfoot to exist and when you really really really really really really really want Bigfoot to exist you sort of figure out a way to make them exist in your mind there's no evidence the problem is there's nothing there's no footprints that are like attached to hair you know what you could get like a little bit of hair off of it and say oh well this is definitely a primate just none of that they didn't have any of that they have these mushy you know footprints that people have made in the mud they say impossible to fake maybe I don't know I don't know if they're impossible to fake but I do know that I haven't seen one picture that looks real I've seen one video everything just smells like bullshit yeah the thing the problem always have with it is it always looks like a man in a suit and here's the thing the only thing that looks like a man in a suit is a man in a suit like this even a chip doesn't look like a man in a suit they move different man chimps kind of like throw themselves with their arms yeah and kick up they move different you can't move like that you can't move like that you could try you're not gonna be able to move the way a chimp moves especially the chimps moving fast just get the fuck out of here it's not even close you look like a guy pretending to be a chimp you're moving like a guy all these things move like people they move like people like your brain that little computer in your brain that recognizes shapes goes that's a guy in a monkey suit Yeah right yeah instantly that's exactly what you think cuz it is that one video with the word the famous one that we know that ones was a guy in a suit right well there's people that dispute it but that's the Patterson footage the Patterson footage is like the most famous footage in all of Bigfoot lore because this guy who and I'm pretty sure the guy was a he was arrested for something like for not petty I believe it was something like not paying for the very camera that he used to film the Bigfoot footage Wow report so the guy okay he's stealing cameras right that's not good and then there's another guy who claims that he wore the suit what the fuck is that guy's name I always forget that guy's name Gimlin is the guy that was there and then there was the other guy who wore the suit he was a large fella and there's a picture of him walking like he showed how he did it and he walked and then you see on the other side of the screen the guy in the monkey suit doing the exact same walking yeah hieronymus bah bah bah bah that's it now I remember Bob hieronymus who's a big cowboy looking dude and they had him walk with the monkey suit on and everybody was like that's real Bigfoot footage this guy bought a monkey suit too by the way well the guy who made the film he had bought a monkey suit Wow and he said he was gonna use the monkey suit to like you know film reenactment sort of practice filming with it or something like that some cockamamy reason for having a monkey suit it's just like the whole thing is so stupid it's if you look at all the pieces involved you're like oh yeah you guys were fucking around and you know you filmed some shit while you're on a horse it was all bouncy you see this thing walking across the stream but now they can isolate that footage because it used to be all bouncy and shaky with computers they can isolate it and get it all into one flat plane and you watch it move it's a fucking monkey suit man haha hundred percent right yeah you've seen it have you seen it yeah you watch that shit you go what am I looking at what are you doing here it's crazy but people want to believe so bad yeah I've never had a chance of believing in the UH in the whole Bigfoot thing it was always just silly to me I remembered was it John Lithgow and Harry and the Hendersons back in the day or something like that yes yeah I grew up on that and I was just always like that's like a fake character it's like I think if you see Harry and the Hendersons before finding out about Bigfoot it's like believing that Barney the Dinosaur would exist out there the only reason to give it any credence at all is the vast expanse of wilderness that exists in the Pacific Northwest because it's so lush it's so crazy that no one's getting in there and figuring out exactly what's in there like ever I really think everyone who lives in this area especially because you get up there pretty quick but anybody anywhere should go to the Pacific Northwest I go to the mountains right above Seattle that's a crazy place man that was way crazier than looking for Bigfoot one of the craziest parts about that trip was being in that real rainforest the real thing was fucking bananas it's thick like like like you can't see anything yeah like every two feet there's another tree I mean it's just thick with trees which reminds me of my what my favorite thing basically mystery ever DB Cooper because that's where he jumped out of that plane ad really was in the whore most horrible place you can imagine did he do that in Pacific Northwest oh yeah super they flew outta Seattle heading back down again and he just hit that button on the rear that's crazy they felt the plane shake and then poof he's gone he's gonna land in the trees for sure and it seems like that but his parachute none of his stuff ever recovered and then they combed that thing they did find like a stack of money I think like ten or twenty thousand of the bills sort of buried at a beach next to a creek yeah but for the most part it's one of my favorite than little I mean the fact that that guy maybe made off with I think it was only it was something low like 150 if you got $200,000 yeah $200,000 but back then cuz this is in what year 71 71 and he didn't just hijack the plane he made the plane land get rid of the passengers bring them parachutes bring the money and have it take off again like this is way back before you know he just it was a true hijacking they land at the airport they're like I'm gonna save all the passengers lives but here's the catch I need two hundred thousand dollars a few parachutes and something else like something weird right Wow and they never found him they never found the body they never found his suit they found his clip-on tie somehow that like was found somewhere but it makes it even crazier when you factor in that they found the clip-on tie and not the parachute and not the suit and not you know what I mean because then it's almost like he's just God is two hundred thousand and is just walking off I think they said the money was never spent though was that true August of last year they found a 18 inch nylon strap which they think might have been a piece of his parachute I don't know how they would know that right away but so I'm looking up some other information word Mike yeah might have been some shit some campers left behind - yeah and I was just in in Australia and I visited the grave of uh the Thai um Shh mud should another crazy mystery one you ever hear that one the guy that was found at the beach in Adelaide I actually went to the cemetery and visited his grave during the day one of the days I had off there oh when I was doing shows in Adelaide and this guy was found at a beach this is one of another one of the great mysteries ever found at a beach wearing a suit he had a half with a cigarette that was out like in his collar they found him he'd been dead they they don't know the guy there's no ID on him no nothing so they keep him around for a few weeks and the morgue waiting for some type of information on the guy they just don't want to bury him and eventually they cut through his clothes and they find that there is a little pocket with a piece of paper like on the inseam of his pants or shirt I can't remember they trace that they can tell that it's cut out of a book called the tie M should or something like that I'm not saying it right because it's some old Latin word or something and but there's a code on it and a phone number some or no there's a code on it but they know that no there's not a code on it it's just a piece of paper from a book and they have the page and everything so they go to the newspaper they're like hey does anybody know have this copy of this book so that we can find out who this guy is and why this is so din on them they don't get anything so they go nationwide to Australia and try to figure out what this piece of papers from they find the book in another part of Australia with the missing part and in that book is a phone number and a code that every Code Breaker ever has tried to figure out and they just don't know so it's the tomb of the unknown man whoa yeah and it goes like deep there's so many theories about what happened to this guy and it could have been the CIA he could have been an American spy could have been a Russian spy could have been an Australian spy like nobody knows anything about this guy whoa and they followed up and there's some there's a guy that like has some crazy theory but I don't know there's a guy that has a crazy theory I mean there's a time for everything in the world you know there's people that think the Elon Musk thing was fake is a hoax oh my god I saw someone yesterday with that malarkey tied a mystery death in Australia to Thomas Jefferson whoa when's that from that guy unidentified man found dead Australian Beach baffled investigators for decades and new DNA analysis links Somerton man to Thomas Jefferson and Native Americans so he was an ancestor of Thomas Jefferson and Native Americans that's interesting I read thread that yeah so they essentially just did they call him the Somerton man because that's the beach that he was found on you guys you know about this Elizabeth Warren stuff do you know who that woman is she's a politician yeah and she apparently at one point her life claimed to be part Native American and now just like won't talk about it and won't do a DNA test well she's like yeah they were like do you have any pictures she's like yes I have many pictures and they're not for you is what she said to look investigators man then you got Trump just hauling her Pocahontas it's so brutal she hits back at Trump's use of bocahantas valves to highlight Native American issues you know I wish I wasn't skeptical I wish I thought she was she was awesome and this isn't real but what's weird is that I think it it gave you some sort of an advantage for her to be Native American in terms of like getting into certain schools or what-have-you I don't know if that's true she might be part Native American she might be like fuck you I don't have to tell you that's possible - I don't think that's the best move but maybe she doesn't know maybe she like there's always suck that's that is a thing with families like a family tell you yeah your your grandmother was 23% Navajo you're like wow I'm fucking cool yeah he gives you next year a little bit of badass this is why Jane Goodall was willing to accept the she's like this to Native Americans told me well you could have talked to two other ones who would have said what the fuck out of here with that yeah I mean people are people man it doesn't matter if you're a white person or a Native American person or whatever your ethnicity is there's gonna be a spectrum of people in that group and some of them are gonna just be Bigfoot believers man it doesn't matter if they're Native American it does sometimes people are bored and they want to believe in Bigfoot so they start thinking they hear things that they don't really hear they start thinking they're camping out this one guy thought they were camping out outside his window that they lived in the forest like right outside his back door that they come near where he is big the season yeah yeah they read your mind they they can sense when cameras are around they won't show themselves that's pretty smart what a great evolved habit that is but then like we were saying earlier some of them truly believe that Bigfoot is like some interstellar traveler that maybe he's from another dimension there's a creature from another dimension yeah because creatures from other dimensions are super hairy too and looked just like that and that makes sense he's real but you can only see him when you're on mushrooms if you imagine that that sort of makes sense imagine if you did like there's a perfect dose we could see him he'd get into his world and you see him looks like Bigfoot but he's all in like a rainbow I mean I've been on mushrooms and seen the same thing that wasn't there is somebody next to me I thought it was a UFO but somebody to one of the guys told me that it was a it was a like someone playing with like a laser white thing like out in the distance oh but I don't know it could have been if you're on mushrooms could be if you saw blaze those laser pointers are so weird like assholes pointing at planes like that's how ridiculous those things are it's um it's kind of weird it's very weird when I was a kid that was like the the funniest thing you could do it was just have a laser pointer and have a red dot appear on the wall like during class Mario's teacher has got away first they didn't know about it remember yeah teachers didn't know about it yeah those red dots are showing up didn't know what it was very rebellious cats love those things that's always fun that became like a thing in a movie man dude's got his hands up red dots moving all over his body means they had the gun on him right that was a exciting part of a movie like oh my god look they got him yeah happened to me and my buddies once we were speeding away we were underage at a high school drinking party yeah I did it was nasty and the party got busted up by the cops everybody ran out the back door like 70 kids at once me my four buddies got slammed into my one pals car and we're driving down the street and you just hear stopped stopped off fucking car and I look to my right my buddy in the middle of the back seat has the red dot right on I'm up and down from his head to his neck like this is crazy Christ you know maybe all got in trouble I'll never know they never know could it be young Tony Hinchcliffe and his mischievious friend or could it be murderer bank robber trying to flee yeah could it be this cop occur that cop in particular was a real real bad person like I mean he knew that they just busted up a kid's drinking party and that all the kids were scattering at once and he decided to stand in the middle of the street and he said that like you know first of all he could have easily shot us because you're standing in the middle of the street instead of having common sense like there's so many other things happening but he you know he could say that that's assault with a deadly weapon if you're driving towards somebody so he runs out in the street pulls out his gun almost can't wait it seemed for my buddy to not stop I mean it's just it was one of those one of those shady cops in fact I'm pretty sure that's the same cop from where I'm from that saw a UFO and it was on yeah there was a big thing in Liberty Township just outside of Youngstown where this one cop saw a UFO and nobody could take him seriously after oh my god that is hilarious but here's the thing but me saying all this I I'm not saying that people haven't seen UFOs because I don't know what they've seen it's totally possible that something that's capable of coming here from another dimension especially before recently right would be able to figure out how to avoid detection somehow or another they're probably pretty close to figuring out how to do that now I mean they have the stealth bomber which avoids radar detection and they I know they have those cloaks you've seen those jackets of people where where it literally shows a video of what's behind you it's it's like this new technology that they're trying to develop where literally you your clothes would show exactly what's behind you so you've got a camera some sort of camera system mounted somewhere on you and it's taking a picture of what's behind you streaming what's behind you and so then that appears on your clothes so as you move you literally are everything that's behind you there's this weird like predator effect from the movie it's very crude right now but you look at it and you go they're just gonna become everything should be it's the future scary you watch porn ear yes oh my god they make it look like everything in the futures that make us crazy it shows so good man Wow so good yeah in terms of like a show that makes you just like after shows over you just go what the fuck that crocodile expert um APIs ode rather crocodile I had like 15 friends text me after that going what in the fuck was that yeah what the fuck it's so crazy and it's so good and you can see it happening you're like no no fucking way no fucking way oh my god I don't remember a show ever does that powerful like when it comes to a science fiction type show yeah I don't remember I mean there was some amazing shows on before but they were all really fiction shows right like this is fiction with like a dash of futuristic possibility like dystopian future that fucking dog one with the robot dog oh yeah that's Christ what was that called metalhead is that what it was yeah fucking a man Oh like I could see this this could be real like what what are we doing the future seems scary you see that robot open up the door open up the door and hold it first friends now dude robot opened up a door click open the latch yeah that guy whoa dude look at this thing watch this shit let's just first of all look at it and just imagine it with guns everywhere of course you could imagine that right laser pointers and guns everywhere this thing walks up grabs a fucking handle turns the door check this out puts its leg there to stop the door walks the door back so that it has some kind of intelligence unless that's a programmed move and has there ever been anything that doesn't get it like a virus or things go wrong at some point of course this is all gonna happen gonna go wrong it's gonna go wrong but I wonder if that's a programmed move like it told it the exact steps to take and it measured out all the inches and then knew the exact movements to make or if it can accurately accurately calculate distance so they've given it in a sense some sort of electronic eyes right if it can walk up to a door grab the handle turn it and pull it and then hold the dorable with its leg let its friends go by like what is that we're fucked that's but that's that kind of articulation is very crazy to think you could teach something to do that so if you only teach you to do doors or can I just do that with everything that's when it gets weird what it gets weird is it if if it can create if you could figure out well if it works on this what kind of door do we have here oh I see this thing's just a slide is it gonna be able to figure that out that's that's kind of it's it's these earning it seems like it would be able to figure it out pretty easily especially when you factor in that everything in the future is gonna be more like technological anyway like the door is even you know like turning a knob or sliding a door yeah this is gonna be ridiculous because people are just gonna be like Jedi's or whatever you know how people have fingerprint things now for stuff like fingerprint things for like opening doors seeing fingerprint things for locks at the gym just a fingerprint thing now that's like a new thing you know that's why you wouldn't want to cut off your thumb out of yeah out of all the fingers that are cut off well just it's it's just really interesting to me how quick all this technology's moving and how that doesn't it doesn't seem like there's any end in sight and most of us like you and I like normal people are sitting back watching this on internet videos going whoof um what do we what do we do like when when do we stop why don't we stop making robots that could kill us like before they're smart or after they're smart I know they're smart they're gonna just stay alive and obviously as soon as we can latch guns on to them they're going in yeah that's what a drone is yeah think about whether the drone is what a drone is if someone is piloting something just because it's flying around doesn't mean it's not a robot all right that's a fucking robot it's a robot airship and they're flying it around and they're getting these kids that are wizards and video games like if you want to have some fucking impossible to beat armies you you hook them up with some of those iRobot things from that Will Smith movie you make them all bulletproof and you have a bunch of kids that just play wicked video games all day know how to fuck people up with Madden and that UFC game you fucking send those kids piloting these things in real time you send them to parts of the world and why that would be first of all it'd be 10 times more terrifying than drones right some things running through your Street I said the problem I've always had with this idea is like our battery life that we use on stuff is terrible yeah it's gonna eat people but what batteries are they using in those drones that are flying up above now that are over overseas doing damage and whatnot are those like special batteries that we don't have access to that maybe in five years we will and the question won't be so weird to us is are you sure that that's the way those times I was almost just gonna ask that I don't know how they fly I don't think they're gas powered though but well let's find out it'd be a good thing we might not be able to find that out I don't think they want to hurt my defence Stefan you're scared to Google [Laughter] you do not want to Google how far how far can you fly a drone and wonder I'd rather one on gasoline while it's carrying two missiles just wondering that sounds like the most American thing ever the drones filled with gas and oil just wondering with missiles that's what's happening drones well we have to worry about people more than we even have to worry about drones right this new shooting in Florida freak me the fuck out again yeah it's happening all the time now it's horrific and the crazy thing is like kids used to joke around about this guy doing that some day that was something he joked around about I think that I think that the way that the news reports it and the way that it's such big news isn't helping at all because one thing that I've noticed is the whole car-ramming thing like that's a new thing car ramming where a lot of the things that are happening are people just getting in a truck or a car and just running people down yeah it's a fairly new thing yes it started with like I don't know maybe that French one or something like that I can't remember the first one but since then because the report you know they're just they report it and they blow these things up and then bing bang boom like I feel like going off of the car ramming situation in the growth and car ramming zl-- own that we could sort of see how overly reporting these I mean I don't know if that's even a thing or if I'm what I'm saying is making sense at all but I know what you're trying to say but the counter to that would be someone had what was the someone made a really good analogy the point being what this is is only happening here we have to figure out why it's happening here so often it rarely happens anywhere else but here it happens pretty often so what is that is it access to guns is it mental health is it both of those things is it it's just far too easy to get guns is it that you're not being monitored in the sense of being talked about and people don't want anybody infringing upon their rights right but if we just sat down and had a rational conversation with someone to renew a gun license you know rational conversation with someone who doesn't work for a gun group or anything just someone you know who you just give you a reasonable reason why you should be suspicious about this person having a firearm you really don't want to do that either though because you can't trust people it's like you're putting people in a position of power to decide who gets the guns and who doesn't get the guns it's all very very fucking terrifying and confusing it seems like the ar-15 is the one that they need to keep an eye on because all the biggest ones are that and it seems to be able to mount mow down a lot of people at once yeah semi-automatic rifles are more effective in those type of mass shooting situations that's why those guys use them that's why they use them you know all sorts of horrific ways all we're all around the world right that's what they're good at so then the question is are they too lethal for a regular person who's be carrying around I you'd want to know why a regular person wants to carry him around and then you would realize is that really my right to even ask a regular person why they need it I mean if most of these people are law-abiding gun owners when we freaked out that one person who legally bought a gun in this case is a kid who legally bought it does it does this horrific thing it's a very good question and it's a question we all have to ask ourselves like how many times does this happen before something happens and is the is the answer arming the schools that's a fucking terrifying answer putting armed guards at schools like I saw a story or someone had held up two signs which it was like Instagram thing and it was the the two signs were which one of these signs would make you feel good if you were like a killer it shows no weapons like a new weapon sign and then it also shows a sign with an armed guard saying that the staff is armed and trained and you know you're looking at the two of those you like god dammit I don't want either one of these fucking things I definitely don't want weapons in schools but I don't want them to need weapons in schools that's why I don't want it there yeah but when they you know when scenes like this happen you have to go well how do is there a way I don't know I don't know what the way is other than even if you take people's guns away god damn you you're not gonna get all of them there's too many of them the number of guns that people have today I I think it out numbers humans I think the number of guns like total in this country outnumber humans insanity even if you are for guns when the number of things that can kill us outnumber us are we overreacting are we crazy are we stockpiling for some fucking terrible collapse that we're all afraid of is that just start thing because we're like we were like the last country or whatever you think is it like defensive question deputy question like crazy scared country well there's you know there's different uses for firearms and who are you to say that like recreational shooters who are respectable law-abiding people and there's a lot of them out there that are very good people they just love to shoot pistols at targets they do competitions they enjoy it they like being proficient with a firearm for their own personal safety and there have been cases I think there was a case in shit I want to say it was in Ohio where some guy was stabbing somebody at a mall and some dude who was a trained shooter one of the was shooting competition things shot the guy and killed them when he was running around stabbing people at the mall and it was one of those things where no one wanted to play that up in the media because they thought it was like irresponsible it's irresponsible to play up the idea of the rogue vigilante with the pistol yeah but but that was a real guy like the guys actually like kind of a hero like if he was in a Bruce Willis movie he'd be fucking pumped like that guy's kind of a hero yeah like he was a normal citizen that happened to have a concealed carry permit right I found another similar story I guess from what you're describing in Minnesota was an off-duty cop that stop somebody that was stabbed stabbed 10 people yeah it was an off-duty cop that we still with the stabbed once I got that wrong was he who was the firearm instructor one might've been another similar story to I don't know might have been but there was definitely one I'm sorry if I fucked that up there was definitely one where the guy was a one of those big NR a shooting competition type characters this is a terrible terrible tragedy and these terrible tragedies seem to keep happening and we don't do anything to change everybody's worried about you know their second Amendment rights being taken away you know people worried about law-abiding people who would never do anything like that's worried about their guns getting taken away but they and all all of us we have we have to figure this out this this can't just keep going on this way and whatever it is whatever is causing it whether it's the way people are raising people the way people are treating people whatever fucking crazy mental imbalances that we're not treating in each other whatever the fuck it is whether it's biological whatever the fuck it is that back we just can't keep as a civilization as a thing that should in its best times be able to get along great with each other these little aberrations their horrific aberrations but they exist frequently there's so many of us three hundred and twenty something million people this was from 2015 more guns in people yeah well okay oh boy Wow so the there's 317 million people in 2013 and 357 million guns that's crazy but then the people who are gun not to be like what do you fucking care how many guns I have man okay I'm a law-abiding citizen saying I would never do anything like that that guy did that guy's piece of shit folk him and they're right - yeah they're right - if you're if you haven't done anything and you would never do anything why would you get lumped in with someone who has if you have a truck and you would never dream into plowing into a mall full of people why would you get lumped lumped into the same group as a guy who has a truck who did do that why should you it's not fair but we still have to figure this out it's just there's something wrong there's something wrong with there's that many more things that can kill us than us if a guy pointed a gun at you from across the room do you have something in your head planned that you would do oh there's nothing you can do I would do a bunch of cartwheels and somersaults that's always been like sort of my plan I feel like if I just do weird movements uh you could avoid just almost nothing you can do yeah you know it's um terrifying terrifying thing the ability to just end someone's life with a single movement of your hand and we learned so early on I remember you know duck hunt as a kid the Nintendo like tick tick tick tick tick tick tick remember that young gun you know it's like we learned so early on well it's just that people value people so poorly that they would do that this is where we have to find like the root of what that is and that sounds it sounds very philosophical and hippie-dippy but we we have to examine what could possibly be inside someone that would make them want to do something like that what would that be I don't I mean how the fuck does that happen how does it how are there in the same timeline we're not talking about like primitive Roman days or the Vikings or anything crazy we're talking about right now how in the same timeline does a guy like you exist alongside someone who can do that there's something wrong there's it I also think that there's something to be said about like awareness of depression and psychological disorders for the older generation I feel like in the future more people are gonna know about it and take it as a real thing but I still think now there's probably there's definitely a lot of stubborn parents out there that ignore and go you're not depressed get up you know and all this because it's definitely deep-rooted a lack of structure in their lives you know stuffs gone wrong and they don't have anybody to talk to or anything you know that's definitely a common thing 100% the dissatisfaction with their current state in life their physical health people of all sorts of undiagnosed mental issues and maybe they don't have insurance and they can't afford treatment or maybe they just got off of it and they think they're fine I mean we know guys who did that who got off of stuff that they weren't supposed to get off of and then they start getting really paranoid and crazy and then someone has to talk them down and one of the things with being depressed like that is you know and like you said they don't have insurance then all of a sudden they're like I don't have insurance a little did they know that it's a phone call away to get like you know free whatever somehow or help somehow but also with the depression makes you not want to do that it makes you it's part of it is you don't want to sort of find help it's hard to reach out yeah you know what I find it's interesting that is I think avoidable then maybe we should all like to think about this a little bit there's something that happens whenever something takes place where people like expect a reaction they expect the reaction from you and there's this tendency to get upset at people that are not showing a reaction to it like publicly instantly there's a responsibility to show a reaction and I've been thinking about this I was like is there I don't know because I I had put something up I think on Twitter or Instagram and someone's about our show in Bakersfield tonight and someone said hey maybe not a great time to promote there was a school shooting just saying or something like that I didn't know about it I don't think maybe I'd heard peripherally that something happened like when I was flipping through Google but I didn't know the extent of it and then I saw it I was like oh my god like I mean that is it's one of the worst things people can do to people's to like snuff out young life they no reason yeah it's it's it's crazy it's becoming so common it's becoming common and it's like it has to be a way to stop it it's almost like you know away it's I feel like people have become so desensitized that like it's almost like the new super suicide you know it was very very desensitized because if this had happened 20 years ago it would be a gigantic thing that would freak people out for days and days and it would be all anybody's talking about so in one sense if I did hear about a school I think maybe I had seen something about the school getting shut down or something so I might off Fox something happen and then going into it later the more I looked into it the more I was like oh god like this is just so the most heartbreaking news you could ever hear right someone decides to go kill kids so you're talking I was in Texas okay man who opened fire in Texas Church shooter was Herald as a Good Samaritan oh there was that guy there was another guy though it must have been the undercover cop because it was the stabbing story I might have conflated him I do that on occasion well we gotta got the story in two instances someone who wasn't supposed to be there with a gun had a gun one of them just have to be an undercover cop you don't want people to be vigilantes you don't want people to be out there fucking Charles Bronson and that but look I was performing at a comedy club in Dallas a couple weeks ago and I was standing out front near the like the host booth for a second and they get a phone call and the guy goes you know what sir I actually don't know let me let me ask my boss I've never been asked that before and he puts the phone on hold and goes to find the owner but like before he does I go what's that person asking for like I was just curious like what he's never been asked he goes he wants to know if he can bring his gun he has a concealed carry license I don't know the exact laws here I'm like no don't ask the owner he's not allowed to bring his gun get back to that phone call no not my ID to shows that night like no concealed carry yeah I got a buddy of mine who carries ever wire Wow everywhere man yeah hope I never accidentally may fire them its firearms instructor he's he carries everywhere he lives in Arizona you could do whatever the fuck you want in Arizona you know things just 1800 do you think if I did my cartwheel somersault thing you'd still be able to get me though maybe not maybe not you are a clever fella I always picture that and I you know what else I always picture is in elevators if the elevator Falls and you're in freefall would you jump would you try to jump at the end to sort it on how it works yeah sure going the speed of the elevator inside you're gonna get crushed the same exact amount you're fucked darn it yeah it doesn't work I was gonna try to jump there's nothing you could do with that one dude that's a sad fucked-up way to die elevator accident you know that's one of the things when you're in a place like Manhattan and you're on the 89th floor of a fucking building you're like what yes is nonsense what is this nonsense I feel like it's even worse when they like it gets stuck but it's halfway between floors and someone tries to climb out and then you've heard of them like getting decapitated or and like their heads they're getting severed in half yeah dude those people up there and then 90th for those people are just view monkeys kiss me higher I wanna look over this whole fucking City would you want to be on the first floor I want to be on the first floor okay so I just get the fuck out of there get out of the office and go home I don't why would I want to be on the 100th floor unless I'm just look down below motherfucker I'm up here at the top of the tree cuz I'm the number-one chimp helicopter I'm flying right above these guys on my dick out the window haha right that's the ultimate is to be a dude who lives in the penthouse and gets helicoptered around Manhattan and drop down some fucking dude covered in like extinct fox fur you know strutting this shit that's the ultimate to have a penthouse on the top of a giant building in New York City and have a helicopter landing your roof you'd be special agent baller I didn't even get in the helicopter I would have the helicopter I would attach a rope to the helicopter and have the helicopter go and I just fly like that underneath the helicopter so when they slowly land I land do you know there are guys like that out there this is what you like not obviously not wearing extinct furs but there's guys that of that rich that just get helicopter around Manhattan and they've go to the Hamptons to get helicoptered out to the Hamptons they land in their estate they get out their state they have people waiting there and full outfit that work for them it's like they're in some colonial time I mean they're they're living in a like this is a total alternate universe of human beings fuck yeah have you seen those crazy Hamptons houses my way out and what's this wait Alan NBC pays for Matt Lauer's how does it work oh there you go from the Hamptons BAM his chopper out to the Hamptons where is a 40-acre horse farm oh it's so hard ballin so hard man Laura Wow Oh took a helicopter ride to his nice office with the button that's that thing man and it's it's not just guys like him it's you know rich hedge fund guys and Wall Street guys I mean there's these there's people that just have ungodly some sums of money like you can't wrap your head around it you're never gonna understand it they have hundred million dollar estates hundred million you'll get a hundred million dollars state you're like what what the fuck is this that's insane yeah that's a weird thing about capitalism that someone can get that far at all out of whack they could ball that hard above all like what what kind of what did you do and those are some of my favorite uh some of my favorite crazy stories is like the jinx the Robert Durst one where he came from you know the family that owns just Manhattan skyscrapers and oh yeah he's crazy the DuPont guy with the wrestling team yeah that's another wild so that's one of the wildest ones yeah yeah that was a terrifying one Steve Carell can act his fucking hats off Kenny hell yeah yeah he's great it's another thing where someone used a gun to kill someone that they were threatened by and some sort of a masculine way cuz Dave Schultz was like this super badass wrestler yeah hop with him and his brother mark top of the food chain wrestlers name it was a terrible story I almost went to the I think pretty sure I almost went to the match Schultz is it Mark Schultz Mark Schultz wrestling camp back when I was in high school I went to the Ohio State one instead he fought guy Big Daddy Big Daddy Goodrich in the UFC way back in the day it was his one and only MMA fight in the UFC and it's really interesting because in the movie that they did with Steve Carell like that's a his Oracle moment see they don't understand MMA so when they made that movie the cage fighting part was like yeah whatever would just fucking fudge this like how do I why would I believe that anything in that movie is what really happened when the thing that I know for sure really happened you fucked up yeah the thing that I know for sure really happened is this guy Big Daddy Goodrich fought Schultz when Schultz was a top of the food chain wrestler man and he just took him down at will he he handled him at will he took no no oh no no no no no no no no there'll be none of that yeah there'll be none of that yeah Mark Schultz was a gorilla yeah I mean just like I said top of the food chain American wrestler he's a fucking tank yeah and so this is him fighting Gary Goodridge looked like very little striking very little striking trait he's just looking for this he's just and once he gets this I'll fuck boom takes him to the ground like he's a sack of potatoes beats the shit out of him mounts him does whatever he wants to him he has him on the ground whatever he wants to him it's a level of grappling that the UFC up until then had never seen you know it's like if a guy like Daniel Cormier entered into the Octagon back there same kind of thing just takes everybody's going down shut the fuck up there's not gonna be any stuff in these takedowns there's a guy named Jordan burrows out there that I wouldn't what's that they just stop that right there because it wells different times man it was back then yeah they would they didn't know what the fuck they were doing half the time like look marks got no gloves on and Gary's got no gloves on but back in the day you could wear gloves if you wanted to and I think he has shoes on yep he's got wrestling shoes only this boom I mean every time he wants to he could take him down there's just in these mounted on this is just a level of grappling that you just don't understand you're not getting them off you stop haha you stop this is nonsense you don't even understand this is like a I mean and Big Daddy Goodridge I should just say is a incredibly strong guy and an awesome athlete what's happening here what happens Big John oh did he key lock him is that what he's that's interesting I why did I've in my head I had that he beat him up on a decision what how did how did that result did he submit him no I can't believe I remember this wrong well either way I just remember just watch yeah yeah look so you got him in a key lock oh okay it wasn't that they just stopped it huh okay so the stoppage either way there's a guy named Jordan burrows who any wrestles he has these the greatest double leg takedown ever just shoot slow drives in his opponents and know he's gonna do it he's won multiple gold sight I mean he's just a monster there's and I would love love love to see him learn how to strike a little bit or learn some jujitsu and figure out UFC because in like almost the history of wrestling this guy is a freak shoot slow there's nothing you can do here he is there's just nothing he just dominated serious Drive man boom yeah boom over and over again just destroys people look at that drive man he's good he wrestled I'm like Times Square did you see that yeah that's cool yeah I wrestled in Time Square last year maybe like in the winter oh really yeah oh wow look at that guy go insane nowhere well you know this is what we're seeing with the veve number comment off when you see like this super high level striking or excuse me excuse me super high level grappling it it shuts down even like really good grapplers is this him in Times Square wow this is awesome who was he wrestling against some guy that thought he was about to get points right there that's amazing who's he wrestling against does it say oh it's got some rap music on it they'll get kicked off YouTube that this is all these are like world championships and stuff crazy man serious power and technique I just I think that's the most important skill in MMA I've always thought it and I still do because I think these guys can learn defense for grappling defense for jiu-jitsu and they can learn submissions which is probably even more important way quicker than a regular person they're so used to squeezing shit already yeah they're used to they're constantly used to squeezing things and gripping and pulling and unlike jiu-jitsu with aggi which relies a lot of it on grips and like there's an entanglement factor that you have to really take into and they can really slow the game down that way you can't do that with wrestling another thing with wrestling is hip movement and hip your control and spinning around a guy we're hitting a easy reversal just from popping down and back up yeah yeah if you don't wrestle you're not taking a wrestler down yeah and it's crazy sometimes watching you know high-level fights and you know sometimes I don't have obviously when we're at a live fight I don't have the audio so it's like sometimes I'm seeing what's just a little thing that's wrong you know like for example like in Diaz McGregor - I remember a part where Diaz was trying to take McGregor down but his hips were above McGregor's who had dropped his just lower whereas if Diaz pops down and back up he's got him but you know all this stuff happening at once and you sometimes you can see it with wrestling and it's just the difference in a little thing that sometimes the energy and the emotions of the fight it's about you know just being like oh yeah drop down up and like you know yeah yeah it's uh it's very very technique oriented and that's like the people that have never done any kind of grappling don't understand when you're watching like someone drivin well you see a beautiful like if you go back to like who's got one of the like the best power doubles probably Frankie Edgar's got one of my favorite power doubles ever he takes a lot of motherfuckers down that are really tough to take down but if you watch like as he enters into it there's such a flow to it you know it's an aggressive of attacking like George st. Pierre when George is in his prime oh dude everybody's scared of that takedown man that power double was coming yeah Josh Koscheck went early on in sport Oh Josh Koscheck had ridiculous power and is in his takedowns just ridiculous he would just drive through you it's so technical there's you know it's the one that's the whole thing in wrestling is strength and quickness and all this stuff is so secondary to some dude that'll own you doing your own thing he'll wrestle jujitsu you he'll just let you think that you're about to do something while he's moves ahead I think everybody should know that Yoel Romero is a real human being like that that's possible like everyone should know like when it comes to like what's what's important about wrestling Yoel Romero is a real thing like that's what happens this is what you have when you have like the elite is a leader wrestlers you can get in a super athlete body yeah good luck yeah good luck he decides whether you're going down you should take him down to luck I mean you might have been half-assed the takedown defense because he knows as soon as he gets down I just fucking flip you over and stand back up again it's just not the same kind of thing it's like he's just way more athletic than you way stronger than you they need to get niganda to work out with him dude welcome the gun is way too heavy unfortunately you're dealing with 85 versus heavy weight but at 85 no I mean like trained and trained with it yeah but still it's a big guy to train with he's so good dude is this his highlight reel dude he's he's so good like he's knocked out with stunning accuracy Luke Rockhold Chris Weidman look at that boom dude Tim Kennedy I mean he's a fucking monster although the Kennedy fight was marred by controversy you can never ignore that he did not come out for the look at that left hand he did not come out for the for the end of the round and he was still sitting on a stool and they had wasted all this time trying to give him more chances to recover you have to be afraid of any guy whose shoulders stick up like that dude he's he's terrified it's like a king cobra how it like warns you with its wings if you stop in this dude with body stress oh I mean that is crazy who the fuck stops someone with driving elbows to the body who the fuck stops somebody with that oh oh my god yeah dude I mean that was meat he made me go back to that let me look at that again that's crazy yeah look just like it right there right there right there and they'll show it look it's got blood all over his elbow that's just that is a crazy his whole face is a mess but that's a crazy amount of force this guy can generate and that wrestling is just another level man like that kind of shit yeah he could do that to anybody yep like he fought Brad Tavares right there and Brad Tavares a stud and it was like they were nowhere near the same weight class like the way he can handle him he's just so fucking powerful this case just shows you with a fucking stud Tim Kennedy is Tim Kennedy almost had him the reason why he didn't come out for I believe it was the third round when he came out late was because by the end of the second Tim had him in deep deep trouble Tim had caught him with a couple of big punches and staggered him and so when he went back to his corner look at that fucking shot that he lands when he knocks him down then another one he just smashed him at the end the craziest thing about Tim Kennedy is he does all this and for a big chunk of his career he was active military and still fighting like that yeah you all Romero is yeah and here's him just smashing the lyoto machida he's terrifying so he's gonna get the next shot at the middleweight title after he just knocked out Luke Rockhold I can't believe Whitaker knocked him that's the crazy thing is knocked him out like this is the crazy thing you're talking about a guy's like one of the best wrestlers to ever fight in MMA and he's knocking people out standing leaping in and crack and you it punches hitting you at flying knees knocking out world champions I mean Kayode Chris Weidman with a flying knee he's uh he's just he's on another level like a real fucking monster athlete like it's it's a pleasure to get to watch someone who has such fantastic technique and physical attributes all combined like his wrestling technique is just ridiculously good his timings ridiculously good it's explosions it's like to watch that I mean for me a guy who's been around the sport for a long time when a guy comes out and it just stands out that hard you go whoa like this guy is a real outlier physically he's gonna make such a good pro wrestler in a few years oh if he does decide to do that fuck yeah he would make an amazing one yeah as he gets older yeah look at other stretching him out here yeah he's super fucking flex at all dude please you mean he's a product to the Cuban wrestling system and if you listen to my podcast with Matt Brown I'm gonna plug that one more time because I enjoy the shit out of it it was one of the MMA shows I did last week with Matt Brown and he and I were talking about it and he's like he spent an entire six weeks I believe in Cuba and one of his his training camps and the way these people live and trained like they are they are all in man they are all in and there's just a tremendous amount of talent over there both in boxing and in judo as well as wrestling Taekwondo they have a big Taekwondo team like Cuba doesn't fuck around athletically man but it's just to see a guy like that and you go wow like that's a any 40 like what would that guy have been like when he was thirty good lord he's 40 he's 40 yeah what would have been better been faster now on top of all that Robert Whittaker still beat him with a blown-out knee yep that's amazing Whitaker is to monster that shows you how amazing he is yeah he still managed his stuff take down so that compete completely blown out knee crazy yeah Whitaker is no fucking joke he's scary guy and he's getting better I think Whitaker is only like 27 right how old's Robert what a girl he's one of the younger guys that's a world champion currently I believe 27 yeah so he's still growing and learning man that guy at 30 I mean he's a world champion right now at 30 he's gonna be better than he is right now he's just gonna keep getting better another thing is your well didn't show any of the signs of pain from the shin injury that he had that's a big part of it too you know is not letting your opponent know what's hurting you because I'm sure if Rockhold knew that he hurt his shin more than he hurt his then he would would have kept picking away at it but he didn't let him know so it just seemed like he wasn't affecting him with his leg kicks meanwhile uol's like oh [Laughter] yeah painful well he's a super winner he's what you would call a super winner you know that's really what he is it's if you get these Olympic level athletes that have just been competing their whole lives they just not a win and when he learned how to strike everybody just you're fucked you got this guy there's a little bit a few guys that can survive it that have been able to survive it you know but the most impressive one I mean shit there's just this is a real wealth of talent right now I was just gonna say it's a very exciting time to be a UFC Fan it really is available because like Robert Whittaker was the first guy to is he the first guy to beat Yoel in the UFC I want to say he is and I want to say that yo L lost like one of his really early MMA fights to phase out in Strikeforce is that true Rafael Cavalcante yeah it's Strikeforce Barnet versus Kharitonov Sergey Kharitonov so that was like way back in the 2011 so yeah look it was one of his first fights he lost that fight and he lost to Whittaker so he lost since that the facia fight almost all knockouts yeah the only one that has an asterisk right next to it is the Tim Kennedy fight because there was definitely some fuckery there definitely some some cheatin it definitely stayed on that stool an extra few seconds well how long did they wind up staying on the stool for extra I want to guess it was an extra 15 seconds I think that might be what did he do he just chill for a bit might have been less than 15 he just didn't get up he sat there yeah well yeah there was around he was in there though the corner was leaving he's still sitting on a stool they didn't even knock sommelier 30 seconds 30 seconds that's a long time it's a long time I was thinking it was 15 and I was thinking I might have I might have been wrong it might been 10 they didn't even try a trick like the old spill the ice that classic which I love so much dude 30 seconds is a long time for a guy to recover you could he could have easily been Kayode he could have I mean who knows because he's such a super athlete he might have been able to rebound but he might not have to yeah we'll never know if you're taking 30 seconds you're taking it because 20 seconds wasn't enough yeah well it's yeah well it would be in a minute at that point there's a minute and you know a 30 second break on top of that so was a minute 34 from the time Tim was beating on him till the time the round ends he goes back to his corner clearly fucked up and then he sits on the stool for a long time it's a it's a hundred percent of an asterisk asterisk did you ever say that word right asterisk aster yes it always sounds wrong it's like when George Bush used to say especially and he would say expecially haha the Vaseline does that have anything to do with it nothing on him and they tried to get the trainer in and he couldn't understand what they were saying was that what it was - that's what this yeah but he was sitting there he was sitting there and they didn't end Tim Kennedy standing there the rounds over he's got his arms up the areas like see if you could play that and you played out where they'll get us kicked off okay don't worry about it did you find it but that's the only one next to his name where you gotta go you know that one that one ain't good can't take a 30-second break yeah that's not good but and he wound up winning that fight which is man that's that there's a major violation there that's a giant like not being ready for the start of the next round if you if the round starts like you don't want the referee doesn't want to stop the fight he doesn't want to give it to your opponent because you can't start the round on time but he's in a terrible situation where he wants the fight to continue but he also understands you're taking unfair advantage here by just sitting here while you should be engaging in a contest there's a specified one-minute break you've exceeded your one-minute break therefore I must disqualify you so they're stuck yeah they're stuck in no-man's when they don't want to be the party pooper we just get yo well up real quick oh yeah he's just in the 30 seconds later he finally like what how that's a big one man I didn't know was thirty seconds I really thought it was 15 or less but take that away okay so you know that's unfortunate but shit happens take that away and you're looking at just a freak the freak of freaks he's going to come in here he is with Joey Diaz yes Joey's gonna help translate so if everything like everything's going smooth or maybe he doesn't understand what I'm saying he might turn to Joey and then we'll just fucking throw their hands up here just each other and shit and then we'll be back at business surprised if you all can get these headphones on over his shoulders those I know he's a tank I don't know I don't know how much he wants to talk about his life and Cuba and what it was like like wrestling there but I would be utterly fascinated to hear about that you know yeah and to rise to the top of the heap in that crazy shark tank of athletic talent and then go on to Medellin like basically every wrestling championship that he entered internationally I mean it's just one of the freak of freaks yeah fascinating that those guys exist and I think it's so important that we know because everybody has these ideas in their head about like physical limitations and physical capabilities and then you see like like a Walter Payton and you just go oh whoa how is this guy or Herschel Walker a Herschel Walker is a great example you see you see Herschel Walker run and you go oh what that's a person too crazy pause how is that guy I mean Herschel Walker to this day is super jacked and he's in his 50s that was him in his late forties fighting in Strikeforce look at that 54 wants to fight again is this new come on seriously in June 2016 so no two years ago so now he's 56 wants to fight again still open the rampage back he's open to a Rampage Jackson bout he's so crazy my twin dude Herschel walk is terrifying yeah that's another what exactly the same thing we're talking about it's a another insane level of physical talent above and beyond wasn't he like all push-ups only or something for a while apparently that's a lot of what he did a lot of what he did was push-ups and a lot of bodyweight exercises and he didn't really necessarily lift weights who knows man he might be telling the truth but it seems like he looks like a guy who lifts weights so he could be that jacked at 47 or 48 and not lift weights this was 2011 from this photo okay so but you know not a young man and ridiculously ripped and always has been he's just a severe outlier there's like there's Brock Lesnar type guy yeah there was a guy when Jamie and I were back in Columbus way would way way way back named Maurice Clarett a running back for Ohio State that only played one year he was a freshman and broke every freshman record this and that led us to a national championship wasn't even that tall probably I don't know who knows whatever five ten five nine was something like not that tall but he had thighs and hips that where he would just keep running he would just keep his legs moving and he would run people over just boof boof boof smashing guys guys on the deef in art and when we played them in high school he because he was right around the corner at Warren Harding in Youngstown and so we played him in high school our guys were being taken off on stretchers on the defense guys trying to tackle him stretch her stretch her stretch her I'm not even kidding it was crazy Maurice Clarett look did you see that midget but he's a real human man look at that isn't that crazy that's so much muscle yeah did you see that video of Brock Lesnar punching that guy for real and a wrestling match he's done that quite a few times sometimes Brock let's dudes to know what's up if they don't do things right or if they don't need him in the face pretty hard yeah and his head snapped back and Brock cracked this dude yeah like with like real punches like I'm gonna hit you with real punches now like boom boom sometimes they do that on the jaw that was an old school gym here that's a hard fucking knee to the head and Brock gets up and you could see he's very unhappy boom yeah that's a real punch right there that is like the kind of shit that he hit Frank Mir with that's real yeah they're playing big time ball that is a freak that guy man people think about him as a WWE guy and then they think about him as you know fighting in the UFC and winning some fights and being this bad motherfucker but they don't you know when he beat Jane Carwin I mean that was a big fucking fight for him he'll choke out Jane Karl Shane Carwin but what people don't realize is like when he was an amateur wrestler he was a fuckin monster yeah it's just his decision to go into the UFC late after he had already been doing pro wrestling people were like oh this guy but look this guy who is a fucking unbelievable athlete so obviously his NFL Combine scores no did you see that shit Jamie see if you could google Shane Carwin versus Brock Lesnar combine because somebody made in one of those images and it showed their numbers similar height similar way maroc was a fucking freak and it shows in the WWE ring you know people say you know like it's sure it's fake but it's not because you can see that compared to all the other athletes some of them that only did that their entire lives his hit this number of strides that he takes is longer and faster and you just see him even from seats far away you can see wow that guy's big and moving wave J's moving at the same speed as the the crazy luchador Mexican wrestlers were earlier but he's that size with shoulders like that he had what I would call a fractured MMA training that led him to the Heavyweight Champion and I say fractured that he jumped right into the deep end and one and beat guys like Randy Couture beat guys like Frank Mir Shane Carwin beat some world-class guys but if he had started I think earlier in his life and learn how to strike and got some of that in there first so there wasn't such an alien thing to him when he was fighting in the big leagues he's really only been striking for a few years if he learned that a strike from a real technical instructor someone was a real technical and still had that wrestling ability when he was younger they would I mean who the fuck else is like that who else is like that when we got him he was in his 30s already he'd been doing pro wrestling a long time it beats the shit out of your body you might think it's fake there's nothing fake about when he flipped over the fucking top rope and landed on his head remember that one yeah that's all yeah that's not fake you try faking that you're dead most people are dead from that yeah he survived and kept going with the wrestling move like this is not a normal athlete but every now and then one of those guys comes along and if they can they I mean obviously Brock was very tactical when he was in high school when he was a young wrestler his his if you watched some of the videos of him when he was a younger guy he was slightly smaller he was definitely a smaller guy but he still was a gorilla I mean there's nothing there's no getting around that genetics you know there's like but it's rare that a guy like that at him you know can reach the level where you see in Yolo Romero because like that's almost like another level even past what Brock's capable of doing rocks I can't find Shane's numbers okay 40-yard dash time four point seven vertical jump 35 standing long jump ten feet whoa he can stand and jump ten feet forward and he's 265 pounds benchpress 225 pounds for 30 reps 40-yard dash time four point seven vertical jump what is this why is it to not know why I repeat it okay okay Wow oh I see okay so that's that was the last stop was the benchpress 225 pound bench press for 30 reps that's a lot of fucking reps man that's crazy but I know these guys who do more than that it's a similar thing I could find was in a forum it said that Shane did like 43 reps on that but I couldn't find his oh that's oh so you did more bench press what is the world record in the combine of how many times a guy can benchpress 225 I'm gonna guess 50 do you think a guy could do it 50 times probably there's probably something like Cheyenne is that 5150 wow Price is Right who is it Justin earnest name that motherfucking weather it's probably some field goal kicker Jesus Christ just jacked to the tits all I knew is kick balls and press bench imagine if they just made field goal kickers that were just giant Brock lesner style gorillas - that'd be fun why why couldn't those guys kick just as good or not further and faster why kickers are always like you're not supposed to hit him right yeah you can't hit the kicker [Music] that's a weird job man you miss a kick all those guys don't care about you they'll they like stab you in the back I mean they just there's no loyalty for the kicker the rest of the other guys hold each other up from what I haven't read and understand it's like a depressing job it's gotta be you don't you don't get you're not a part of it yeah you know you can't get hit if that's the one thing everybody's afraid of and you can't get hit and the littlest stuff throws them off too like in this last Super Bowl the you know they painted like the 25 yard line with a special Super Bowl and mess these guys up because it's white so they're not used to kicking off green who was the first kicker is that the designated kicker is that always been the rule that you can't hit the guy who's the kicker am I wrong do I know what I'm talking about that you can't hit them you can definitely hit them oh you just can't hit them while they're kicking the ball yeah yeah so you can hit them after the ball right while they're in the process of kicking you can't let kick they're like unless you're about to block it if you hit the ball you can't actually then run into them but if you don't block the ball then you can't touch them but if you're reaching for the ball and you got to remember their legs coming forward at a crazy fast rate if you miss the ball and you hit them and in by the way the rules crazy and the same goes for the punter like if you hit them while their leg is basically still in the air huge penalty really huge this is afterwards this guy's a punter this is Pat McAfee he jacked up this guy on a pot return so like he's not afraid to go hit him he fucked him up but yeah he's probably out for three years after that the kicker knows what he did illegal no he's just now part of the team he can go hit him but usually like a quarterback they want to try to he's the only punter on the team so you got to protect that guy otherwise you go to somebody else Wow interesting Jim you love the football don't you yeah it's just so weird right it's like it's a high level chest thing - there's 53 guys you have to break it down and then that's all strategy and it's all pre-snap strategy because it's only five seconds at a time and it's all setting this up I'm gonna trick you yeah like it's just the guys up in the booth old 50-year old men that think they know a lot about football they can't actually go do it sort of like an MMA like a Duke Rufus type guy mm very good call things out it's very strategic very much chess and that's why Bill Belichick and Tom Brady make it to the Superbowl pretty much every year which is you know just like with the UFC we've seen in so many fights like any given Sunday almost right like if you put made the same match ten times we know it's not going to go that way every time right but those guys have a way of figuring it out so it's crazy about a pro football team like all the planning that has to be in place all the monitoring of everybody's health all the knowing what everyone's capable of all the different strength and conditioning routines must watch these guys perform and drills you must watch these guys complete and then you get together all these people who are trying to strategize what's the best moves the quarterbacks got to figure some shit out and call things out in the field it's really a fucking nutty game and they can throw money at it they can throw money to fix any other problems they want yeah and when you factor in that some of the times they're doing things just to set you up completely to make you think like oh we saw them do that when we watch video with them play the Raiders they did this so this next play is gonna be this and bubble gon another touchdown yeah that's the thing that's just obviously the issues what happens to the players when they get older it's harder to watch it now right doesn't seem the same it's not it seem like the same thing to me anymore now that sounds fucked up coming from someone who's seen a lot of fights but I will I just think it's it's all it's all bad yeah it's all bad to get hit that hard like but in a fight there's a high possibility that you could avoid getting hit that hard if you're like a Mighty Mouse or I feel like a GSP or top of the food chain athlete John Jones he's gonna get hit hard to get around the cell those tapes are like biggest hit to the NFL like he's been commercials on TV like it's a little tough to watch those now yeah don't you think that they're getting hit harder yeah they're getting it harder than a UFC guys right well though the speed is like they're so fast now they're faster than they were even five ten years ago yeah I've seen some of those hits and I'm trying to imagine the difference sheet that and like a punch or a kick and it's multiple magnitudes of power stronger like a guy's getting launched through the sky with these hits I mean well they get launched they lift off the ground they go flying these are 200 pound plus men I'm pretty sure footballs worse because when it's helmet to helmet there's mmm don't think there's any shin to skull kick that could even compare to that because the your brain is hitting the inside of your skull if you're receiving that hit and I don't think there's we unless another guys wearing a helmet running at you at full speed especially if you're running the direction that he's in boom i mean i just--that's like two cars hitting head-on if you've seen the difference between like a car accident and a head-on car accident what happens to the dummy and what happens to people like it's night and day the first play here it's very first play the biggest hits fucking launch the guy well DARS Jesus Christ probably knocked out yeah I would imagine a lot of guys get knocked out I mean yeah you know they say that some concussions happen from getting hit in the chest that we always thought about concussions you got all you got hit in the head you got a concussion I didn't know and to like fairly recently that's all stupid I am I didn't know that you can get a concussion from getting hit to the body because when you get hit in the body your brain jostles around just as much it's a different scene that you know the hemorrhaging in the brain that you often get from local trauma that's scary shit people fall and hit their heads but just getting kick to the body fucks your brain up that's what's crazy it's not just hitting right on the spot which definitely does it too but guys get their brains rattled from a kick to the body for sure for a takedown for sure for football everyone's had a bad one in a wrestling match in high school I got stuck like in a bridge and the guy had me in like a head scissors and snapped it back real hard and my head hit the mat I woke up with puke on me I was still I was still on my back in the middle of the mat and I peaked like projectile like pop I'll cold and count cold and puked that's dangerous man you could choke on your own vomit that's the one time I had to go straight to a hospital sorry easy yeah an ambulance football is probably the most impact because you're both running so a guy's running at you full clip that never happens in wrestling there's never like running at you this is the hit sound this guy Ryan shazier number 50 he does a normal tackle but he is just now getting the feeling back in his legs this happened about six months ago oh my god yeah oh really freak accident in a spine on a normal tackle normal everyday - yeah this happen Oh like play like that can happen like that any any given five seconds of an NFL game a player like that could just have his life changed and that's a net another freak athlete from you the Ohio State University that's been one of the top linebackers every year yeah I mean it's it's super unfortunate the body so goddamn brittle but it's also one of the things that makes it so fascinating you see what these guys capable of doing is you know there's a brief window like the Olympics which is going on right now this is a brief window where someone can be good as a Michael Phelps right like how many how many years do you have well you could just dominate swimming like that you got 10 is it this out real is that a real number is it 15 I mean what is it how long can you definitely can't keep it up forever it's like when does everything just fall apart so when you're watching someone who can do crazy shit with their body and then you see a tackle like that that leads to a guy being paralyzed like oh fuck dude that's hard you know but you wouldn't want would you want it to change yeah I think they should have big like balloon helmets on big silly looking super soft bouncy helmets would you want to change I've been thinking about that I think it's going to change a little bit but I mean if you were the Commissioner yeah if someone someone said young Jamie you seem to know what the fuck you're talking about would you please do us a favor and tell us how to run this football thing yeah there's things like I think they could do to change it there's stronger how much they could probably be using I don't know if that would help them I could probably have some more protection mm-hmm the technology's probably around the corner it's probably like some type of weird airbag and a helmet that they're gonna end up getting or something weird you know right like maybe a decelerator or something like that that absorbs the impact of the hit on your head so that doesn't snap you back so the the conventional wisdom is that the the helmets actually make it worse because they can hit each other much harder whereas like they get more damage than a rugby player gets rugby players because they know there's no padding they're not doing the same kind of crazy shit yeah it requires different techniques if you want to have a career and I just rugby's obviously they get down and dirty and it's a very very tough game but they it's a you have to do a totally different thing when you're not padded up it's like if you watch their scrums and you watch some of the crazy physical altercations they have it looks more like running and wrestling there's like a lot of wrestling involved where's the football it's just like fucking chaos of colliding bodies and people fucking smash into people and yeah jumping over people and I just feel listen to that NPR episode about football and how it started that's how football used to be it used to just be two people or two teams would line up and they just run into each other and scrum and just slowly move the ball down the field slowly slowly slowly and then eventually I was time went by they started adding the past and things and now it's just the NFL's literally just passed the ball for as many touchdowns as you can get hopefully nobody gets hurt Enid was just trying to turn me into a soccer fan but just didn't take hahaha he tried you tried me and him in a bar he showed me like some super important game I'm just mocking it mocking him and making fun of the whole thing yeah I could see being a pro wrestling fan before being a soccer oh for sure yeah no look I've stated on numerous occasions I'm a huge Ric Flair fan yeah you know I love that baby I'm a huge I love the rock I think the rock is awesome yeah I go to see all his movies I am on G twice I got starstruck I met Ric Flair at the airport after the Royal Rumble it was so crazy our flight had just gotten delayed on the tarmac and then cancelled we get deported everybody else is waiting at the desk I'm like I'm gonna go to the customer service part of this airline I know how this crap works there's a long line so I'm like I'm gonna go to the customer service and I'm walking by myself and there he is walking straight at me by himself and I literally like as I'm getting closer I'm like that's not Ric Flair that's not Ric Flair that's out of my face comes Nature Boy he goes yeah man I'm like hell yeah following my Instagram uh I follow him on Twitter I don't know if I do fall good Instagram I follow my Instagram best man just a legend yeah you know it's like stuff like that that I enjoy about pro wrestling that's what I enjoyed the most ridiculous aspects of it yeah like I was a big fan of Jimmy the Superfly Snuka back in the day because it was just so ridiculous that he would always wind up on the top rope put some guy unconscious underneath them and he would fly through the air land we were always pumped about it so silly a lot of fun stuff happening because yeah the man I had the next woo the nature I used to be a fan of Bob Backlund you remember Bob worse I was like he's a no-nonsense guy that's how I felt about him I felt he was like to me like what embodied an actual wrestler versus like the progress and he stuck out like a sore thumb because he did like the pro by something but not really what he basically did is just engulf you on the ground and and hit you with some ridiculous real wrestling yeah you're not really prepared for his finishing move fucking hurts crossface Chickenwing see he was just for whatever reason he did wasn't appreciated enough it hurt it was two normal people didn't appreciate him enough the figure-four hurts in real life to make it four leglock yeah is that a real thing that's where invented it oh I know but I'm saying is it a real submission look here's the only catch it's a real submission okay the person has to basically let you put them in it I see it or they story they have to be completely unconscious but Bob Backlund I had you back buddy back in high school when all the other kids were they only liked the Superfly and then Hulk oh yeah here it is here it is let me see see all the way around okay let me see this see this is the part they have to be like what are you doing let me see this drops oh yeah that's totally legit you know dude if you can get a guy into that position that shit will hurt yeah if you get a guy like Gordon Ryan puts you in something like that just for fun yeah oh fuck your legs up but here's a go back to it again I don't think it's a good position for a couple reasons though like right there it's good if you can get to that if you can get to that but I'm not sure here's the catch stop in him I'm not sure what's stopping him from scooting his butt towards that guy's right leg here's the cat but is that if you can roll over while you're in the figure four leglock it completely reverses the Polar's of the of the earth pain of the pain so then Ric Flair we go well let me see by the way that's also true in real life I've tested that well what I'm saying is like the position it's you would there's a natural way to defended that it doesn't seem like the guys defending it that's why like look oh he's trying to keep him from putting it in there I stepped on his dick because he stepping on his dick a little bit that's the under tape Wow you allowed to okay oh this is a shirt legs oh yeah that's a heel hook yeah okay the guy here's why this is so fucking stupid the guy's getting his leg cranked is actually the guy who's in the best position he's in a heel hook position yeah she just grabbed his leg right so who's supposed to be getting hurt here this is actually the guy in black the guy in black is no no the guy in black has a better position all he has to do is reach back with his right arm and hook time his elbow on to the ankle no you timeout motherfucker this is not a figure four leglock this is embarrassing that's a heel look he's giving him a heel hook and the other guys pretending he's in pain this is crazy this isn't even a figure four leglock doesn't know what this is it's on a lot of fighting force oh come on look he's in agony no he's got a fucking heel hook take the heel look it's right there you go like this you clap your hands together this match is over I mean it's a hundred percent over in real life yeah well what the fuck are they doing that what are they winners or losers everybody gets a trophy is that what you're doing you show in a terrible position the guy in white is in trouble what happened how's the dip in use right now I broke out yeah the other guys doing it wrong for the whole fucking time okay this is one steps over yeah boy it takes a lot of work to get someone to do that Wow what is that I've never seen that I'll tell you what that is okay that looks painful to go back to that again let me see that again I think it's the same thing I think it's the same thing go back this is the same thing no no one want one a little bit further a little bit further back I gotta go I gotta see the setup I gotta see the setup okay steps over the other guy is basically triangle in his lower leg the guy on the bottoms in a better position this is nonsense the guy in the bottom fed his leg through the center which is the worst thing he could have done right there he had a triangle on that I should have fed it he should have tried to go through the he could have fucking swept that guy with that let me see it one more time he's a long time see this guy's stepping over and then this guy could just triangle that leg right there why is he doing that he let him put it in the center even if he lets him put it in the center he's supposed to move as soon as that guy spins and then you're free he should have wound up on top there Oh see this is a true figure this is John Cena there you go boom boom mm-hmm it might hurt yeah it probably hurt if a guy a big gorilla like John Cena got you in that shit but you have to be almost dead exactly do all that shit I mean he might be able to do it to me don't get me wrong exactly size for example if anybody ever hit a figure four leglock in a real fight like that would be the most watched worldstar video ever the thing is today well John Cena reversed it oh that's actually real that's realistic that hurts like hell what he's doing is he's fucking that guy's knee up and he's cranking on his neck at the same time yeah and and under his nose the inside you can tap now oh you've always been able to tap that's the whole point that's how Ric Flair beats people well count it out when you pin the guy that's one way that submission is a new thing count-outs there's disqualification count-out tap outs and if the ref hits the mat three times with his hand how long have they been tapping out how many forever for the beginning Bob Backlund who you mentioned well yes crossface Chickenwing that submission only matches the great 45 did they have them back in the superfly days cheek yeah Iron Sheik smooth camel clutch but he made guys tap the Abbott camel clutch hurts in real life dude I blocked that out of my memory that's a weird thing to block out of your memory why did I block out the tap outs because you have not wanted to be a pro wrestling fan you've been in denial of your love look at this this is the mandible claw from mankind oh man puts a sock on his hand and then two fingers I don't know underneath your tongue ha ha and then squeezes his thumb underneath your chin in that space and tries to connect it what do they call that the mandible claw but at one point it was mr. Socko when he was working with the rock and they has a rock oh yeah so he's got a sock puppet on he stuffs it in your mouth it keeps the sock in his underwear until it's time and then when he gets you down the crowd sock out and lifts it up in that crowd goes insane that is the dumbest and most awesome days ever at the same time the dumbest and most awesome thing at the same time heck yeah that kind of shit that's funny yeah that's funny it's ridiculous but the thing about pro wrestling is like a lot of people myself included don't want to enjoy it they don't want to let go for something like that I think you're I think you were like perhaps weeks away from becoming a pro wrestling fan to delusional interesting guy Tony but I don't trust your judgment on many issues oh I think you're weeks away you're gonna watch you're gonna watch Rhonda's match though you're gonna see what happens at WrestleMania I mean they rebooted the cosmos son I'm watching that oh my god it's so fun a pro wrestling's fun man I just took everybody we went to the Royal Rumble had a blast it took a whole crew of La comedians out to Philly saw Ronda Rousey come out we were all very surprised it was exciting yeah it was a big deal yeah you guys get super excited yeah yeah we went crazy I can't get I just all the the nuances to follow along who's mad at who you would love it didn't they keep it really easy they give you just like UFC they give you a little breakdown before they have their own Joe Rogan type who's like again you know doing the voiceover here's why this person's like this is the technical side of things like they do a cool like you know a little background an explanation before so you can catch up quick and then all of a sudden um you're watching the only thing that seems interesting about the possibility of that is that it to me is I'm a I've overdosed on reality yeah whether it's Poncho's or you know what whatever the fuck it is that's on TV Swamp People or people making moonshine all that stuff I don't I don't have any desire to watch anymore reality do you know who Brun strimmin is no but what I was gonna say yeah I'd rather watch like a really good fiction like something that's good some show something that's like written yeah and somewhere I know it's gonna be good yeah all the time not every now and then the guy tries to mouth fuck a dude with a sock on his hand no funny that is kind of funny but I don't have the kind of time to wait for that to generate it's like when I hear about Saturday Night Live sketches I'm like I'm sure they get one every now and again that's fucking amazing but I don't have I don't have 90 minutes on Saturday night I agree with you a hundred percent on Saturday Night Live but they get good ones they get good ones not as good as Pro Restless and that those Alec Baldwin ones he knocks it out of the park ouch there's some funny shit still Alec Baldwin's done some stuff with uh with Pro Wrestling which I love it's Alec Baldwin's most popular show 30 rock Pro Wrestling 30 rock is Pro Wrestling now the rock I tried to make a reference there but it didn't work as in 30 rock just like I'm an address your ears silly person that's the worst pun you've ever done you need to take a break from puns pun King people come see my stand-up they're like I am really surprised you didn't do any puns after you rattled off three or four really good ones right before this show started I try to hold back I wanted the whole Jane Goodall thing you don't think I wanted to say chimp in ain't easy I wanted to but I didn't why didn't you say it because I don't want to be known as the pun guy dude you're funny funny in other ways but that's a you are you trying to be insecure let you let your talent shine you're very funny with puns I'm trying to show my full balance you have that too and ring don't hold your puns back when you know that they're natural that's the thing you got them right there they're popping and you're fucking crazy head you're right let them free you're right let them free Tony Hinchcliffe you're right let those fuckers free let everything Oh hunting it up yeah we're nice people so no we're not gonna repeat what we said before the show started where you were rattling off all those puns I don't remember them is there ever been a time in your life where there was something that you now think is really fuckin stupid but you believed in then like ghosts or anything goofy like that yeah I still think I there's a slight chance that I saw something one day at The Comedy Store it's silly but yeah I don't know what it was maybe I was borderline about to pass out maybe it was like a low blood sugar attack but I saw something weird one day out of all the days that I worked there for years in the middle of the day one day I was working the phones on the second floor in the phone's room were like the Booker's room is now yeah and I was going outside to the belly room to like smoke a joint or smoke a cigarette or something like that but that's a dark room and I was walking through there and when I was walking through there I stopped and felt like something it's just felt weird like something in my gut felt weird it sort of stopped and I looked to my right right where that other door is like if you're walking into the belly room from the belly room green and there's the green hallway and you finally come across so you're right in front of the men's room well right to your right there's that other door that leads down to like the back bar and the back gullet whole everything so those two doorways are right next to each and I stopped there and I saw some weird white silver floaty looking thing this was like could be years ago cigarette smoke so much smoking cigarettes over there and they blew some smoke no it was indoors I'm indoors somebody was smoking cigarettes indoors no this is back when nobody was at The Comedy Store I smoke cigarettes indoors this time yeah nobody else smoke it was more glowing than smoke like it had its own was it spooky smoke it could have been perhaps a reflection off of headshots but there was nothing on that side it was an empty bathroom may I suggest that this was during the day yes and the dust in the Comedy Store is world-class yeah world class the last time they run I'm on the fucking vacuum cleaner over those stairs is the first time they run a motherfucking vacuum cleaner over those tears walking up there I'm just kidding now it's pretty clean now but that's how it used to be for the longest time and you're you're gonna see like when the wind like a windows open and the Sun lights coming through you know that glint mm-hmm if there's so much dust there that like you could see it in those little beams like you could see it floating in the air he'd be walking by go oh great I'm breathing in that scary but the kicker's old buildings are like that right kicker with this one was that I didn't tell anybody about it cuz I was obviously like whatever I mean it freaked me out I didn't end up smoking I remember I slowly turned around and walked back to the phone's room because I was freaked out I'd interrupted you to try to be funny and I failed so could you just explain it one more time like you're you're walking you see this thing what do you see describe it to me it's sort of like human height but like glowy it sort of look like like I would say like a jellyfish shaped or human sort of sort of a little bit like it seemed like it had like Casper sort of yes as cheesy as that sounds it sort of did look but it was more it wasn't like a solid white it was like here's a question that's a good like why we're ghosts always depicted as being like wispy I was always ghosts were always wispy and flying through the air and the creepy thing is is that's what this sort of felt like it felt wispy like on the sides like there was sort of like a yeah like a I don't know like a sort of like how you see that with like a fish or something like right right like little tentacles or something moving through the air I know this sounds ridiculous but that's what I saw and yeah look it does sound ridiculous but again so do people yeah people sound ridiculous like if we weren't a real thing and you had to think about look if there was no life-form that changed the environment around it none the word the biggest thing would be like a hermit crab or something like that it steals a shell and lives inside of it if that was how the most in nature was like Bear Den now the bear dug a hole in the side of the hill that was it does the extent of people and animals birds making nests and then all of a sudden you went to a new place and you saw Manhattan you would you would be so fucking freaked out you wouldn't be able to believe that this one organism is capable of altering the environment around it so radically and it's the only thing like it the only thing like it by far crazy dude what we are is very crazy you know I mean I think people are awesome I enjoy talking to them I love what we do I love to be able to podcast and do stand-up and have fun and but just what we are just what the human race is is a weird thing man weird little multi-coloured thing that wears clothes yeah constantly evolving yeah crazy we have status some of it dependent upon what's on your feet wow it's got some fresh Jordans is that a thing still did the kids still say fresh bring it back fresh I'll bring him back fresh we need to bring back fresh you can't let fresh go by if someone looks in goes Jamie looking fresh I think thank you has to be looking fresh I've passed many generations of people thinking that things are cool and uncool I just missed a lot of shit no one really says cool though oh you know I say that all the time well there you go that's you look cool man I see ya Duncan would definitely do it yeah that's cool man yeah that's fuckin cool man yeah Duncan definitely still says cool it's funny though how those words sort of go in a cycle right like if people use them a lot and then like certain words you get you get they get used so much that you like totes you know people start saying thing like that like what like where's all this coming from why is everybody saying that there's a bunch of those little weird sayings that people start saying yeah trying to figure out some other ones that people started saying pretty recently can't damn it I had wanted to tip my tongue really common buzzy thing Budweiser I wise up everybody say what's up to everyone that was one of the first ones that's so annoying that was one of the first ones but there's been some other ones that people just like little weird pattern so that people just repeat over and over again they hear other people say you know it's interesting how those sort of get passed around they sound cool someone says something it sounds cool and everybody starts saying it yeah there's a bunch of um totes mcgoats you know what I say and I really mean it I say to my friends I hope everything's groovy I say that always say that in like text messages you know what I say I'll law in it only only in person but I would say what's cooking good-looking it's I found out people love it men love it women love it everybody loves why not right that's a compliment instead of just saying hi it's like hey what's cooking good-looking yep they tell you Tony hints Cliff's a fun guy yeah right away yep magic that was the only kind of song so you could listen a man used to be fuck dude imagine back when they only had a harp that's all they had fucking harp and everybody would just sit around going they're covered in blood if fuckin sword marks all over their body and some assholes up there playing a harp you supposed to take it seriously like fuck that harp I started watching Vikings hmm I'm on season 1 your watch biking's it's a good fucking show I like the first episode I was like oh this is very like TV show ish I was prejudice going in but it wasn't my first one is like a little slow sort of setting it up but around because they're setting everything up and they have to over long period of time and to get to about Episode four it starts cracking were you like whoa this is a good fucking show I don't know how much of it is historically accurate but it is in the History Channel but man the Vikings were crazy they were doing mushrooms and and having orgies and the women would fight in battle that they were there were wild fucking people man I don't know how much of this is like really really accurate or what actual historians think about it I mean we know that Vikings were incredible warriors big giant fucking dudes and that's like what you see still over there in Iceland like you know they have like some of the strongest men competitions like a lot of those dudes come from Iceland yeah like duh so those are the rapers and the pillagers yeah just throwing barrels oh man a thousand years ago those guys showed up on shore covered with armor and swinging an axe and you are fucked you're fucked everybody's fucked yeah those guys were crazy and again I don't know how much this show is horseshit and how much of it is you know actual historical data and how much it's just dramatic interpretations of what they thought would be cool that would happen mostly that right there's no way you actually know what they said thousand fucking years ago but your story's being passed down no pictures of the guy you know like yes things get real weird when talking about a thousand years ago but fuck it's interesting makes you wonder like how would I survive in crazy environment crazy III get I'm cold all the time all the time yeah all the time there's always a part every morning when I get out of the shower in which I just want to like die right right after shutting off the water before grabbing my towel you would die then yeah you wouldn't be able to make it with the Viking no I wouldn't make it you wouldn't be able to make it uh-huh you've accepted that though totally I like that because you're just not you're not fighting it she's like this is who I am it's been that way my whole life I've always hated the cold no doubt it's a big part of the me picking la over New York do wear footie pajamas no only because I don't have footie pajamas if I had a fucking bunch of people if you should set up one of them Amazon gift accounts they're like some gals have an Instagram Fame gals you know where people could spoil you if anybody wants leave me some footy pajamas I'm five nine about a buck 45 right now do this you need footie pajamas with like bugs bunny ears you need a full Bugs Bunny outfit yeah a tan rabbit outfit little sleeping hat up top yeah or yeah anything else it's like to dangerously furry like you can get away with just ears but as soon as you have a tail you have a tail bro I have a tail hmm it's not pajamas anymore man that's fucking costume yeah see right there that's not a costume that's pajamas but let me see his ass Oh was his feet feet it's it's clearly pajamas because you can't have a costume where the feet are heads to nobody thinks those feet of your heads that's ridiculous so those are pajamas he's got feet the feet are heads that doesn't even make sense how's that work imagine you got my big head then I go to little hair because I walk around on the fuck kind of species are you look at this leave this thing Wow so the ears are on top and then what you can't get enough mice so you have to have mice downstairs too is that what this is anymore rabbit dad sweetie I got you a rabbit costume you are rather but my feet are rabbits look at my feet aren't rabbits dad Debbie's feet are rabbits okay all right we'll get you the rabbits okay the rabbit's feet but no tail does someone demand the rabbit's feet that's what I want to know like how did it get to that it's did someone say what we were trying to make actual rabbit feet but they look stupid and then someone come on put it right under your foot yeah let me just see what are we doing here is this is this a new mythical creature we're creating it's got heads on its feet the fuck is that each feet with its own everybody just accepts it just take it home give your kid some fucked up anatomy lesson yeah dance on my feet how come I can't have heads on my feet that's how it starts yeah a heads on the feet is exactly where it starts do you ever wear anything weird to bed yeah you do Wow what I think everybody wants to know [Laughter] helmets loud that's cool you got a Superman I've got a nice one Superman seems to not actually have a cape too which is good a Batman seems to be a real cape said a real cape about man whoa so you don't wanna sleep with the cape and choke yourself in the middle of night die in your sleep you know you know just doesn't seem right the Wonder Woman one you know what drives me crazy about all this Wonder Woman shit it's men who get upset at Wonder Woman it's the same thing that drives me crazy about this Black Panther movie what drives me crazy about this Black Panther movie is people getting upset about this Black Panther movie on both sides first of all white people making a big deal like oh great oh it's all black people like what shouldn't just be all good people like of course this is the way the story was and this is the way they want to promote it why do you care like it doesn't I don't care but then it goes the other way and I do care where I've seen crazy liberal psychos and there were white people in fact saying white people stay the fuck out of the theater while this while Black Panther is out don't steal their joy with your white privileged oh my god I literally saw it something along those lines I saw a couple of those one of them where a woman was asking when it was appropriate to see it she and she didn't she didn't want to ruin it with her whiteness she was totally serious totally serious and those people are real people and they think that that's that makes sense like god damn it when when shaft was out do you think white people couldn't go see shaft when blade came out ninety-eight did white people stay home like what are we doing are we more divided now than we ever were before we so silly that you can't I want to go see Black Panther because I like fucking superhero movies and it looks cool the fact that anybody would give a shit one way or the other I guess if you're a black kid or a black guy was like hey this gives all of us hope that there's more opportunity for movies to be made like that the people aren't really racist and they can't embrace a black superhero the same way they can embrace the Hulk or Thor if the movies really good and I hope the movies really good and I hope that's exactly what happens but how the fuck did it change so much from one blade was around because when blade was around dude nobody even thought about the fact that it was a black superhero movie I mean I guess some people did but the emphasis was the fact that Wesley fucking Snipes was blade yeah and it looked good and he was doing karate and chopping vampires up with swords and shit it was a fucking badass movie that movie was super successful they did two sequels so like what's changed how the fuck has it changed from then until now with likewise now why is it a big deal if there's a black superhero but it wasn't a big deal then like are we deteriorating or is it just more noise because of social media do you get a more distorted sense of how the country actually feels because the people that are more inclined to chime in regularly and vehemently are oftentimes not the ones who are calculated you know assessing thinkers yeah they're they're maybe a little bit more aggressive shooting off the cough so what you're getting is not an accurate representation of how people feel but then you start defending it as if it is accurate and so then people start telling white people to stay the fuck home now you've got craziness and you've got craziness because of the fringe the fringe on both sides but in the middle most people like hope it's a cool movie yeah could you imagine if you had a friend and you were gonna you want to go see that Black Panther movie nah man fucking these uppity black dudes just really getting into this movie too much you'd be like what yeah you would be would have immediately stopped hanging out with that guy and you'd probably tell all of us you wouldn't know what that fucking guy said yeah and we'd be like what the call you know all that stuff is disgusting all of its disgusting it's disgusting on both sides it's like anytime you're prejudiced against white people even be critical about yourself being white that you should stay the fuck away from places that is crazy not talking about intruding on cultural rituals we're talking about an awesome movie everybody who can buy a ticket to buy a ticket it'll make the movie more successful you want giant opening weekend's if you really love this movie and you want movies like this to be successful you should be promoting it for everybody why people black people Asian people who gives a fuck go see the superhero movie it's gonna be fun he's got a pendant it turns into a fucking bulletproof outfit and he fucks people up you shoot him he gets more powerful it's fun go watch like he's a shit of it's I get the people that take pride in it they feel like something's happening for them that it's a black guy but the people that are white that have an issue with it oh my god you got to let some shit go you just got to let the noise go by don't let it bounce around inside your head and come up with it yeah but I'm not racist and why do I have to get shoved in my face and everybody's gotta meet in the middle it's a crazy time everybody's gotta meet in the middle there's way less tension and and conflict then it's being verbalized that's what I think I think if people just realize that a lot of the shit that we're clinging to is just some ways we've been thinking and behaving for a long time and then we can all just fucking communicate with each other just a little bit better I just don't think I don't think that racism has gotten worse I think it absolutely has gotten worse in some places I think there's places where racism exists and I think those I think when you have young kids that are raised with racism and family members that are raised at racism in a community that embrace as racism which has existed in the past you know and we don't even have to talk about today but in the past it was most certainly really racist neighbors Italian neighborhoods in New York where if black people moved in they were treated terribly and horrible shit happened a lot of times they weren't even allowed to move in in the first place there's always been stuff like that um so if there's always been stuff like that it's a natural human inclination that we have to iron out we can't just eliminate it by making it illegal or eliminating it by prosecuting people we have to figure out why people think like that it's a scary way to think scary to think that anyone speak look first of all all of us all of us and almost anyone listening to this in comparison to someone like Elon Musk is basically a chimp okay so he ought to be racist he should be racist about against this African guy that's smarter than everybody like woody that's a real African guy from South Africa Elon Musk yes Wow yeah he's a real african-american yeah like legitimately but obviously there's different Sheen black African and I believe is the Dutch that originally settled that area you know and that's he's the descendants of those people but my point is like we're all dumbasses compared to that guys just talking all uppity about why people you know having better GPAs and whatever other race you're comparing us to because you're stupid yeah compared to that one African dude like you're dumb for sure for sure like there's no way your vote should count more than his yeah right mine personally or most anybody's yours personally I don't know this idea that there's one race is better than the other race is fucking stupid the people that are really clinging to it usually don't have shit going on other than that that's the problem with racism it puts people in a camp of winners when they really don't have to do shit to get in to get into the team you know the entrance is instantaneous you just oh you're white you're in you know that's ridiculous that's a that's a ridiculous team that's the problem that's one of the main problems with the ridiculous nature of racism especially organized racism you're just gonna take everybody that looks like you that's it that's all not not how they think not what they've read not their life experiences not how you feel when you're hanging around with them not how they make you laugh no you want to make sure that they have blood from a certain patch of dirt yeah that's crazy it's so stupid and they moved the goalposts too cuz I'm a white guy now but when my grandparents came here they were dirty guineas yeah you know they were they were thought of the way a lot of people think about Mexicans you know same kind of thing no that's changed now Italians are full-on white yep totally we almost lost our distinction with Jersey Shore we almost lost it yeah we came real close to losing that close but we're regular white now again I feel pretty good about regular white yeah your whole family's Italian right yep crazy Italian everybody east coast of times crazy time it's almost redundant yeah right yeah my supposed Italians a different animal yeah my dad has an Italian restaurant though so it's a little bit like amped up family will go there on his side and my mom makes crazy spaghetti sauce oh that's what everybody wants for every holiday and everything so everybody's always trying to get like red sauce in their stomach yeah whether it's one side or the other of the family you know what's really interesting is that like that sort of style of cooking is not the same out here at all I literally last night for Valentine's Day my wife and I thought out a container of my mom's sauce that she sent out in a frozen block and had that instead of going to some fancy dinner that's what we wanted and it was her iceless and even then in our I mean every bite you're like holy SH it's like a New York bagel or something like that or it's just different like 70% better than what you can find here in LA yeah there's difference in the bread for sure there's no doubt about it and most people smarter than me attributed to the water they think that there's something different the water in these coasts like New York and that when they make bread it is a different flavor to it I also think that there's something to the humidity in the air they're actually being I mean we forget we live in a desert because it doesn't feel like a desert but it's a desert to bread it's desert that's a good point man yeah that's a real good point yeah pasta tastes better there yeah Pizza definitely tastes better there and bagels tastes better there they have a different thing they feel different when they go in your mouth oh yeah totally yeah they're just better they're trying hard out here some guys are getting really close yeah you really want to go cheat cheat you know get a good solid new york-style bagel out here for like a cheat day everything's different out here they try but it's not ever really the same yeah there's not as nearly as many of those Middle Eastern food trucks like as in New York New York those Middle Eastern food trucks are everywhere that of those killer kabobs yeah what do they call those things when it's a kebab sandwich inside a falafel or inside of a like a tortilla what do they call that shit it's a yeah like a PITA yeah it's warmer right yeah that's it and then they have that that white sauce that they put on it you only squirt all that shit on physique E sauce right and then the hot sauce on top of that whoa fuck you oh my God if it's like 2 o'clock in the morning and you've had like one more drink than you should have just one more you're alright I'm so hungry and you see that like yeah we have taco trucks here though yes tons of them yeah it's dirt ones that's true we have way more good Mexican food here way more but obviously dude there's a joint down the street I wish we had more time today I'll take it to like one of the most legit Mexican joints in the valley I don't want to say the name [Laughter] white ruinous people ruin my authentic Mexican place you go in there dude they got authentic Mexican TV shows plan barely anybody understands what the fuck you're saying when you're ordering things so you have to you have to order you know those kiss IDs you gotta you got to talk you got to read off the menu yeah a few of those guys understand English but the food is insane they have tongue that this whole bucket full of boiling looms lengua the anti chopping up making linguae tacos love look that shit why people don't know what they're doing with tongues what do they do they turn it into like some Jewish deli food or that's it yep but Mexican food they're like that's that's the move do lengua is expensive it's fucking awesome it's really good it's a weird sort of texture count on it's so good that's a legit place though and then you go to the they always have a real legit place we'll have those little aluminum chrome looking containers and they're filled with jalapenos and peppers and onions right and you scoop that fucking those that big clump of death out of there those jalapenos man there's always this creepy carrots for some reason yeah some people like those carrots take you off those jalapenos but those jalapenos kick your ass you use jalapenos and then it's jalapenos you find in those little dishes at Mexican restaurants when you bite into them and you're like whoa this is all seeds funk taking those seeds out just thinking that that place had a vibe where you got to kind of know what you're doing when you go in there yeah similar to that place you took me in New York it's a famous deli but I can't have is that where we went yeah yeah yeah yeah we got to know what the fuck's going on or yeah you got to know where the fuck your order in and then where you pick it up just it's not cut and dry yeah but how legit is that any place I just think is very unique to the coast because like in Ohio we have our own unique restaurants and food and all that kind of stuff but there aren't places like that where right it's a mission unique to that place you need to Ohio there are few places like that but it's not a similar style of experience place is always packed - always packed because the food so good don't lose your ticket how about that fernand how's that for an interesting restaurants yeah that's it's weird lose your ticket try to walk out they charge you yeah this Mexican joint doesn't do it like that but the way Katz has it if you've never been Katz deli in New York has been around since who got it it's I want to say more than a hundred years old I think or somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 years old but when you go in there you get a ticket 1888 Wow Wow that's crazy goddamn 1888 and I bet they ran it just the way they run it now you walk in they give you a ticket and then you walk up to the counters and then there's one guy that like cuts up meet another guy has like pickles and they'll give you like samples will slice off a piece of brisket for you and you're like holy shit slice off a little piece of that uh pastrami corned beef the corned beef is off the fucking charts and you eat it with real American steak fries yeah every bite of it is just better than anything else so good it's so good it's one of my favorite cheap meals last time I was there I was were there with little Jimmy Norton and Russell are not Russell Jeff Ross came over and sat down with us I was there with you yeah remember that was great that was awesome I don't know where those guys just show up yeah dude that was so good well Jimmy came to meet us there yeah um Ross we just randomly ran into it's awesome that place is like and there's just no there's no doubting in my mind at least that there's something special about a place that's been used for the same thing for a long time you know like a place where you go and you feel like yeah like this place like Madison Square Garden like walking around in mass the Square Garden we do UFC there you're walking around you're like wow like this place space feels different yeah like it's got a a resonance to it like maybe it's just my mind being aware of what an incredible building that is and all the incredible stars that have performed there but I think is more than that yeah Carnegie Deli is gone you know this is yeah it closes at the end of 2016 oh my god as long as they don't close Cantor's in LA I'm good you can't just stay open really fuck yeah hmm dancers not a Cantor's guy right this is like where he plays the heel in wrestling yeah he knows Cantor's is amazing he's like crossing his arm so he's the body mean you really believe that Cantor's look at him when do you go to Canter's oh oh Jamie's my real friend Wow I love you by the way I live two blocks away from there and I would have met me there and complained about the food well I mean if Panthers guy so he's a grown up pro wrestling Greenblatt's is great oh I was bummed out that they closed the Jerry's deli in Woodland Hills yeah I have to go to NC No yeah cuz they closed the one in Beverly Hills - that's wrong - that's wrong I think they have Manhattan Beach now in Encino those the only two to the left that's too bad old school real Jewish delis like that they have the most ridiculous chicken soup have you ever had Jerry's deli chickens yeah chicken soup that dare chicken soup with Tabasco sauce yeah and black pepper mmm get the fuck out of here mix that shit up whoo as it's going down you chunks of juicy chicken in there with the noodles and it's the broth is perfect they've been making that broth since Jesus was around Wow that's a scientific old old old recipe the broth there's Jewish food I've been making that broth since Jesus was around allegedly I don't know if Jesus is real but that broth real is fuck yeah which came first Jesus or the broth damn Tom Tom I wonder if they probably had chicken soup forever right wouldn't you imagine water in a broth no no you son of a bitch that UFO Sony you're talking about rescue 9-1-1 did you know that yeah Liberty officer Kirby melara her mole I knew this guy and he was a dick yeah so you think it's bullshit yeah I mean we'll say allegedly yeah let's protect ourselves legally yeah he uh this is Tony speaking I have no knowledge of this man whether or not he's honorable or not it's not my that tension see that's the cop I wondered uh there he is look his buddies laughing at him yeah that's Toby Millar Oh I'll always remember him you know what man if people find out that they can get attention from saying that UFOs are real if they saw him they'll do it I know it from firsthand experience I've told the story before but I don't know if ever told to you I was doing a show for CBS called game show in my head and what would they had was they had a setup where I had an earpiece in and the person who was the contestant in the show how to earpiece in and we would set them out in the middle of somewhere and then start asking them questions and telling them what they were they were gonna have to do would say you ready you ready to do this okay here is what you have to do I told this guy you are a newscaster now you showed up to do a story about a guy who was taken aboard a UFO a person who was taken aboard a UFO but this person's gone so you have to find a random stranger to pretend it was them and then tell you a story about getting taken aboard the spaceship and getting probed and dude people just did it it was the weirdest thing ever here so here it is so this is the young man and this young man was a look at me so so this dude just walks up to people will probably get kicked off here and to for use in any of us but these do just talk comes up and talks to people and he just explains to me I'm in a real bad situation there's there was a UFO of visualization or whatever the fuck he says and I just need someone to pretend it was them and dude people do it and when they do it they started they put their shit down and they start telling a story and not just one department guy I mean he got several people to do it Wow yeah listen to the guy while we can't listen to it right we'll get kicked off anyway you can go watch it people go out gameshow in my head the dude's name was Craig sorry Craig if I can't remember your last name but uh he got a bunch of people to talk about being abducted by aliens the thing was it was so easy to get that when people know that they're gonna be on camera they they get excited like the idea being on cameras like I'll just fucking make some crazy shit up and then all of us hit back or like Jane Goodall's like I talked to do Native Americans and they told me they'd probably give her why trying trying to get freaky with her yeah a seen Bigfoot I know where he lives and shit you know maybe but for real maybe Bigfoot exists if you take peyote and go in the woods maybe you can see him maybe only see glimpse of them maybe Bigfoot's are ghosts that you only see when you're on peyote I think if I'm doing peyote in the woods I'm definitely seeing Bigfoot on top of many other things let me ask you this yeah if you were if you could say like with a hundred percent certainty like what if you had like a thousand dollars to gamble okay do you think you saw a ghost or do you think you're just playing tricks on yourself and then the more you think about it the more you've added stuff to the memory and fuck with that memory in your head it's actually a little bit scarier I'm gonna be honest it's a little bit scarier than I even told you because get this that night after I didn't tell anybody all day all of a sudden Jeff Scott out of all the nights that I've seen him there and hung out with him there the house piano player of like 25 years out of all the nights without telling anybody what I saw earlier not a soul said that he saw that that night and I'm like wait what what you see it was like a white glowing thing like that and that's when I went dude I saw that thing earlier today here oh so there's the there's the part that I since you want to make it about a thousand bucks bet if I in imaginary money like that part has to be set out loud because that's crazy we were going to I've freaked myself out there before yeah a bunch of times you know what freaks me out the most the the belly room when the shows are off yeah that's what I'm saying that's where this happened yeah yes that's that's the spot that freaks me out the most inside the way is it's really contained yeah I know what not well not being honest the main room when it's dark freaks me out the most the main room is freaky when it's dark I don't even like him being in the back of the main room when it's dark there was a part of every day if you work the phones there you have to walk through that when it's pitch-black dark to go turn on the lights to turn on the power breaker for the whole marquee and everything so you have to go out there like five or six before it gets dark cuz the marquee has to go on before that that one of them tactical flashlights like the rock would in many of his action films Rambo knife and shit yeah you know looking ahead scary Oh James got one right there shit hits the fan who are you who goes there yeah yeah the building's freaky and that belly rooms got something because it is its contained and you got Mitzi's unopened sealed off office to the other side of that wall yeah power power that's where saurons eye is yep Sean's ring people don't even know about that that's the like think about all the powerful decisions took place in that one office yeah oh the the different comedy that revolves around that one woman running that one Club yeah crazy yeah you really stop and think about it what are the odds of that even being a thing like how does one person who really knows how to run a comedy club the way she did how they exist when no one else no one does it that way and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the way the other people do it and some of those other people I love dearly like I love Bob but the Icehouse dearly he runs a different a lot of people run it different what I'm saying is that she did something that was like that's a crazy way to do it let the image run the asylum like even that one when she you know she made an adjustment to put him in the 15-year anniversary instead of some other guy yeah yeah and that's what got him the next thing that got him the next thing that made him one of the biggest comedy actors ever yeah it's obviously everything was a Robin Williams Andy Kaufman baba bhot goes on and on it's stunning to think of how much comedy comes from the acts of one person the actions of one person look at that ring Wow oh are you in the rings or something look at that it's just crazy it's a gigantic black what do you think it is I don't know it's a black and white picture I think it's Ruby maybe that's something you can never wear right here we think that we would get progressive enough where you could wear Ruby's can't wear ruby rings how many dudes or any-any rappers like ultra super floss and wearing rubies I'm all about rubies I'm gonna be a new rapper that's mine my name is all about rubies them rubies or rubies them seems like cultural appropriation damn I'll just say all about rubies DM damn damn really [Laughter] this reminds me of the lobster challenge believe that yeah the lipstick challenge my favorite things we were high as fuck after the Comedy Store and we're trying to figure out some sort of a challenge and the loser would have to wear lipstick onstage for a year you'd have to wear for the first 15 minutes of your set after that you could wipe it off just enough yeah for the fair first 15 minutes you're set you'd have to have like a thing of butt wipes like sitting there on your on your little stool on stage so you do 15 minutes of your act with ruby red lips like Miranda sings do you know Miranda sings yeah yeah pull up a picture of Miranda sings on YouTube she's got a YouTube channel and a TV show her TV show is haters back off its but this was hilarious so that's her lips you're gonna have to do your lips like that go to a more attractive one right next to that one there you go now go back there you go now go back that one perfectly yeah that's it see that's what we're gonna do just over accentuate the lips clearly go above the actual shape of the lip one year a man and you should do a special about it yeah just do a special say this is all my lipstick material that I'm gonna burn off now because my curse has been lifted yeah one year wearing lipstick is he wearing Ruby's rappers Grammys at 22nd Maine yes boy Gucci Mane looks so much better now he's all thin and shit it's kind of interesting like he's always smiling too like that dude looks happy as fuck yeah happy was out of jail but also just looks like he's smiling a lot he's like it's interesting I think like if I saw Gucci and he's in all these pictures and he's just kind of like mean-mugging I'd have this one thought about him but instead I see Gucci in all these pictures now and he's always smiling now but I'll get that that bet that guy's a friendly guy you know he looks like he's having a good time and he's killing it now out of jail right isn't he like yeah see even I know he's killing it in the rap game back he just released a new album he's got a face in jail you ever listen to me goes no I think you'd like him who's me goes me go this is like a new suit it's like a rap group with three guys that remember the Gang Gang twins yeah so they're like the yin yang twins but better than like with an extra member powerful I think I think you would like it amigos rings they just got whoa and they're like hilarious they're the funniest interviews show me those rings again go go big with that that picture with the Fiat fists okay am I looking at like a half a million dollars in diamonds yes that's real yeah that seems crazy to do doesn't seem crazy to be walking around with a half a million dollars in diamonds hey better to be invested in diamonds than a Bitcoin or something like that right I mean every no dude that Bitcoin shit might pop the fuck off and you'll be sittin here hatin yep you don't even know right now I do know one thing about Bitcoin if you say I think Bitcoin stupid people want to fuck you up yeah if you could talk some shit on Bitcoin Dave those Bitcoin fanatics they're rabid it's like a little bit of religion just to touch Wow just a sprinkle I think it is right yes to sprinkle and not necessarily just Bitcoin either but there's a bunch of other crypto coins which I fully support I have no dog in the fight yeah me too yeah and we keep five of it which is all dedicated to Justin Renan any time he wants eaten cash out this is all from when Antonopoulos is in there so I don't really have a stake in it because that's all Justin Ren's money but real investment in Bitcoin if it's very fascinating to me because more people were interested in doing it and it eventually spread through the entire country everybody's decided to do it and everybody figured out how to you know make it as secure as regular money is which is not that secure I mean people steal regular money to if they could figure out how to make it more secure and better than it is now which just seems like they would be able to you never know like who's gonna be faster the hackers or the programmers it seems like only one was the one coin that someone stole a shitload of recently you were just telling me about oh yes seventeen million nano was stolen off of an exchange well you know what's a nano it's a different critic that's another chromium car in Colonia so what the biggest one is Bitcoin one yeah okay what's the second biggest one off of like notoriety probably a theory I'm gonna be the second biggest I would say do you think it's possible that one day artists will invent their own crypto coins and that's how they buy and trade tickets to shows and goods from the people that support them think about this golden Pony dollars yeah I'm golden Pony dollars is how people pay for your shows you set up like a bank of gold and Polie Pony dollars so your crypto bank I know how you do it you do some blockchain voodoo magic programmer type shit figure out how to do that then once you set that up people buy that golden Pony money in order to be able to pay you golden Pony money for things but you only accept golden pony money and only you you can only spend golden Pony money so the only people that accept your money the people that accept your mother if you want to buy a washing machine say I'd like to buy it with some golden Tony dollars they're like no I don't like never like you they go yeah Tony you're a good guy you're funny I really love you on kill Tony and your stand-up special on Netflix was a hoot sure we'll let you paid golden Pony dollars and then you could buy a washing machine with golden Pony dollars and that golden pony dollars will be traded exclusively through golden Pony fans and so like you really are reliant upon your fans in a way different way like all you're only getting paid by your fans and when they want out like fuck this golden pony money right I want to give me some of that simbad dollars don't want some simbad shekels but they still would have to cash out with me right no no they're not to cash out with you they cash out with somebody else's in the group like a certain amount of money just stays in the hole just like they do with Bitcoin like there's a certain amount of Bitcoin that exists and the price of Bitcoin will go up and down but the number will not change and so that's their remedy against the modern system that we have with inflation and printing new money in all that shit so there's only a certain amount of Bitcoin I don't if I'm butchering this I apologize I'm not smart there so I have a little variation to be okay and so if you did that with golden Pony dollars he would set up like a golden Pony fund like this is this is the Bitcoin that I you know this is I've calculated this out with current Bitcoin prices if I charge you guys 20 bucks for this thing whatever the fuck it is then whatever you call the number the name what you'll be able to do is you'll be able to pay for my shows only using that this is all I'm gonna accept now and then I want to be able to use that to buy things from your store let people keep using normal money it's very confusing no it's very confusing but the idea would be like say like you have some golden Pony dollars you got some George Lopez dollars you know like you could there could be a bunch of people with their own exchanges and it could be worth something to you worth more or less depending on how by other killing it right now it's very confusing it's super confusing what what I'm saying is it's entirely possible that someone like Snoop Dogg is going to come up with his own Bitcoin I can see would have to be someone a baller that everybody would want their coin you know it'd have to be someone like Kendrick Lamar dollars yeah yeah see if Kendrick Lamar puts out a Bitcoin or cryptocurrency and he says hey fans this is the only way you could buy tickets to my shows and when I buy shit I want to buy shit only with this stuff but it's real money so if I want to buy a Ferrari with Kendrick Lamar money better sell it to me bitch cuz that's Endre Kumar money is worth gold to all the Kendrick Lamar fans right it would have to be someone of like a super super high profile to do something like that some interesting stuff it's not really you look are you're falling asleep he's barely staying awake for me this is sort of you're sort of describing one cryptocurrency this is called steam or steam it which is the website that you can look at so this is like a brand no no this is what I like Digg calm looks very similar to this it's like how that started so here what would happen how you you would have to exchange some money or another cryptocurrency to get some actual steam but here is the for instance of you a person put up a really good article or a piece of content if you will you upload it and then that person gets a coin or money from you essentially gets a steam coin you upload it with a coin and that's very early or primitive agus describing of what you would do so like a person creates content puts it online and then the viewers then exchange a currency for view and that currency only exists in this in this platform yeah then you can exchange then if another exchange anywhere in the world wants to start up and say like I your currency valuable you can exchange it for my currency you learning another currency and that's where that's how value comes see now that makes sense and also especially if people are paying for stuff like if you're writing things or making videos or something like then then people are paying for that that's a fucking you know we're trapped in this idea of this system that we have now and far as like producers of television shows and movies and things like that that this is like how you get a job in show business that seems like I get the job at show business if you can make videos and and people will give you money for those videos I know what YouTube is and a lot of people make money off youtube right look we're dealing in dollars and we are in the old system but this seems like more next levels could be the new system yeah takeover yeah well fascinating too cuz it's gonna be a blog right it could be a video what else could it be this could be anything this is literally just links oh they haven't I don't think this platform has opened up to having like its own video hosting or music being hosted but that would be amazing if you could write like cool ass articles and people could pay you based on the article that might bring articles back man I mean not that articles are gone away but there's a weird thing right now where it's hard for people to get paid doing digital stuff as much as like most people don't want to subscribe to its I shouldn't say it's hard for people to get paid it's hard for people to get people to pay for digital stuff I like to subscribe to an online website or something done that's a tough sell you know medium.com has sort of filled that hole a little bit but you don't get directly paid from posting on there I don't believe people can get make a medium post that has then gone viral and gotten them paid in other ways like he's planing how they do a particular thing and then that leads to their store where they can sell some merch that way hmm other like they might make a video that's in there and then they get YouTube money off of that it's a it's also new but that that what you're describing could take off from here well it seems like if everybody decides to accept that currency then it seems like a would take off right if everybody decided accept that currency it just seems to me that there's if if bit cool there's a few tests right there's Bitcoin there's light Cohen this was a dogecoin dogecoin dogecoin there's a few of those that are still like volatile and still hang and I saw some article recently about these young guys that were multi millionaires from cryptocurrency okay real monthly millionaire or multi millionaire and cryptocurrency like what mean the same as like a sly person because they might have a bunch of money right and it's some of it's also in stock right but could they when how quickly could they liquidate it somewhat that depends on exchange is some of its 24 hours some of its a couple days hmm depends on the actual coin and the way the blockchain works hmm crazy interesting yeah it's very crazy it's very crazy it's um to be when I think about it I I always wonder how it's gonna take before we shake ourselves of this system because this system as good as it is and it's definitely good it's still super complicated and flawed it's very confusing what's legal and what's legal and why you have to pay taxes in one place but you cross the line and the taxes are way less like what like over here you don't pay state taxes at all huh but over there you do what like a lot of the stuff that we we operated a lot of the system that we have is fucking wonky shit the tax system is just one of them right yeah it's all messed up and then a lot of people you know you can just whatever build a account over-seasoned avoid it that way well it seems to me that what I was gonna say is that if something like a cryptocurrency can really take off and just get fully accepted you switch it's way more accepted now than it was a few years ago when Antonopoulos first started coming on here and i think you could sort of strap elate that five maybe even ten years from now it might be like really commonplace there's a lot of things you buy with Bitcoin now a lot of things it's really kind of interesting in that way you know that's if that works out and crypto coins become a real thing crypto currency becomes a real thing it's totally possible that can move into politics like that kind of thinking of organizing and like setting up a party and in deciding on important issues that all could happen the same way that all could happen through some sort of an online app where people say fuck all this voting shit you know we have this new super secure thing that Elon Musk figured out and now everybody all they have to do is have a cell phone number and they take a photo of themselves as they're doing it so it's biometric right so you know that someone's not cheating you can take a photo of you you put in your vote and you you have little videos for each issue you can watch little videos on your phone tells you exactly what's going on with these juicers here people who are Pro it here people are con it and it's like one of those things where like if you ever tested take a test online have you ever done weather yeah and at the end you're like press send and you press you know all the results all you got 90 percent right and so you move on that could be the same way I mean it could be something along those lines those things are so easy beatable I just had to do that for traffic school get out of it ticket a couple weeks ago it's so ridiculous it tells you which ones are wrong on the yes or no and they're like you want to try it again and I'm like yeah I don't think everyone's smart yeah I finished a fun fact I finished traffic school what's supposed to be this huge test and like I know maybe 9 minutes just next next next next next take the test whatever then fix the answers done they could do that with voting yeah they could totally do that with voting yeah 100 percent they don't want it didn't want it to be that easy and that's when there's gonna be real weird shit where like Logan Paul manipulates the vote like I don't mean II illegally I mean like saying hey go out and vote for this guy you know or Kim Kardashian I want you to vote for my friend you know she wants to run this butterfly like a cartoon character becoming the fuckin there you go leader black marrows is the best ideas I'm always late to the party I think it's coming I think Kanye could do it in 2020 if he runs a helpful part you don't do well under that code what we learn falling apart could get you the role he's not he's not that guy he's not like that trump guy it's Trump let's that shit roll off his back for most people that stuff's devastating like I don't think it's a coincidence that Kanye had that event where he talked about supporting Trump that he would have voted on Trump that's what he said it and everybody went crazy and then he went crazy and he checked himself into a yeah eight days for eight days in the hospital like it's not good all right that's not snot a person who's good I mean who knows what the fuck was going on outside of that but the Scruton T compounded it with no question at all when a bunch of people are mad at you and all your friends are mad at you and then you wind up canceling the whole tour yeah that's that guy shouldn't you know obviously shouldn't be president but I don't even think she's try I just don't think just seems like a lot of pressure for him and he's it's a fucking great musician make your awesome music the exact thank your awesome music don't run for president like when do you think we're ever gonna get off of this like people keep saying you know I like Baldwin can actually run and win for the Democrats okay maybe could you might be right he might be able to he's told it but when when do we say hey we need we need to rethink this whole fucking system we can't keep letting popular people run the country that's crazy life just be popular I like him more that's the whole thing that's been the thing forever it's weird it's it doesn't make any sense shouldn't you have to take a test and we find out who would be best at running the country like shouldn't it be a test like there's a test for the driver's license yeah this is it graphics test for traffic school why is there a test for president shouldn't you be like should you have to have some good answers just some questions they Posey it's the most ridiculous job ever because it was it was created so long ago that it has so many holes in the idea behind it but you don't have to eat at least know how to run the country like shouldn't people to know the results of your test you should take a test and people say look we got good news and we got bad news the good news is he can read bad news is he got everything wrong he got everything wrong he can't be President like all right well we got to find a guy who could pass the test it's also popular then people will try cheap for him yeah who can keep a budget who can speak who can Obama at least talk Congress or constitutional law yeah so you could at least think he would know he probably knows a lot Constitution I would imagine it was quite a bit uh-huh you ever heard of Trump University my friend a whole universe losses his own University how many lawsuits are involved in I don't know how many I think it became a class action he had to pick twenty five million dollars or something what was Trump University it was a like laughing Jamie yeah cuz it was like a real estate they show you how to like turn and burn flip houses and businesses and they show you how to become a real estate mogul for-profit education company that ran real estate training program for five years was it any good like where the sister success stories out of it yeah I don't know it was licensed by Trump University by owned by Trump organization but not owned by the Trump Organization huh probably a different LLC or something oh okay multiple lawsuits what an interesting idea who's just gonna teach people how to make money so the idea yeah it seems like you know one of those like infomercials or something like that he's a fucking character I'll tell you that when all is said and done that will be a guy that stands out in human history we're gonna look at that guy and go wow I think that's what he wanted oh he definitely got that do you think he's gonna want to run again oh my god yes are you kidding me are you kidding me this is what this guy lives for he lives for watching the news and seeing him on it every day is that what they think I'll show them that's this whole thing it's so real everything from the inside and everything I've ever heard about the guy says that that he's just I mean how much longer do you think you'd do it at what age do you start to get worn out by all this shit right we think of the kind of hate Kanye got for supporting Trump and I'll think of the kind of hate Trump gets that's it is some next-level stuff I mean the you have to have some crazy resolve to be able to absorb that kind of hate gotta be a little insulated from some of it though I'm sure but you know it might hide him from some of it but some of it they actually project on his building you know they project shit on his building they stand across the street with a projector dealing with that forever though not WWE Hall of Famer by the way yeah he's been so cold stunned been stone cold stunned yeah he was in Stone Cold Stunner how's that oh you don't want to know this one I don't know I'm gonna be honest with you Joe out of all the one of the many pro wrestling moves that don't seem to be effective this is way up there and the devastation that it leaves like guys are like out for like a minute after a Stone Cold Stunner and it's pretty bad I'm gonna be honest I love stone cold okay one of the greats ever probably the reason why we have the rock is cuz stone cold was so raw dirty' on the mic let me ask you this I want you to be real yeah I think that this Stone Cold Stunner exists why the shape was head because he lost a haircut match between Vince and between Vince and Trump one was gonna get set up Bobby Lashley yeah see I know my dude hell yeah you do so the Stone Cold Stunner Steve Austin has his arm up in the air he's call him four cans of beers that's another thing is that every time stitch other with cans of beer now they drink that drinks one and they let him drink one in the middle of the fight he doesn't really know the fights over fights oh look he's about to cheers Donald Trump Steve Weiser okay why is he wearing a shirt it's you wrestlers here as a ref in this he was a rough but he's still about the stun here you go boy he hit some bone so it's like he lands on his butt but your head is on his shoulder and it's supposed to just put you out wait a minute one more time so he steps forward good you could find the one there's a good boom BAM Jamie there's one we're stone-cold like stuns every McMahon and everybody in a ring like there's there was one epic one where he stunned like 30 guys in a row might be one of the faker things ever I've seen you repost some of bad things that have been happening it hurts every time well you know you need higher quality stuff out there see that's a stunner that's a stunner right there technically yes boom oh I'm rockin knew how to sell that that's Kane that's the Undertaker's brother goodbye yeah the rock made it fun right like it didn't seem realistic yeah I read a thing recently about his the people's elbow which became his big finishing move and it was sort of a joke that works so well with the crowd that it they all just laughed about it backstage and it just became this yeah okay let me tell you something if this guy did this to actually do this you it would not feel good okay this is this is not a real finishing move per se but that could fuck you up especially a big strong guy like and not that one not that one but some of them because what he's doing is he's grabbing the back your head and slamming his shoulder into your chin yeah like that's semi-legit like I would not recommend doing it that way look at the rock that's Shane McMahon play that one again boom oh that's hilarious that's a classic McMahon thing to oversell like a stunner like that like Vince does it the best he convulses and shakes afterwards you gotta definitely have that though because you're giving the guy your back yeah I don't recommend that at all that move now but he could probably do it to me yeah but that would hurt I'm telling you that's not it's not the best move in the world no but it's not a hundred percent illegitimate there's Brock now this is Shane McMahon this is actually a really insane thing that this guy did Tony do you know Shane right now is probably if I'd guess I'd say 47 no he's not jumping off about 30 feet 35 feet up at least probably I don't know if they actually say but yeah the fuck out Shane McMahon always does this he is like really wait a minute wait a minute wait on to a table come on yeah a real table The Undertaker's about move either way it's not a pad The Undertaker's like don't do it dude I'm not gonna show it on YouTube oh I see don't show it on YouTube so he lands on that thing so it's a giant spring underneath him now what is that thing it's just a breakaway table oh my it hurt ah that's insane that he did that we all thought he was pretty messed up here oh my god that's insane why did he do that for the show oh my god that guy had to get really hurt did he get knocked out he might be might be coming out of it we that's the one of the crazy things you never know what's real and what's not yeah mankind did that Mick Foley the guy who does the mandible claw he did that to the Undertaker once he had a tooth go through his lip let me ask you this when someone does something like that like did they plan that out to the point where they practice it or they just wait to the moment and then do it that seems like if you practice it and it hurt that bad I think they might practice it maybe with some type of something but I don't think they practice it with a breakaway table all these guys are fighting on top of yeah this is like the craziest one ever this is Helena sell 1998 mankind this is the Undertaker this is crazy Undertaker ends up chokeslamming him through the whole thing into the ring from the top of them you think you know more about pro wrestling than I know about boxing well it's a it's a wide field I think there's more in wrestling history you got to realize wrestling's when wrestling's been a weekly sport the most-watched program on cable every Monday since I was a little kid so there's a lot more stuff that's happened in Pro Wrestling right but you know results right yeah like if I told you I mean do you know any results from boxing yeah a little bit yeah I know way more about this than you know about boxing right yeah yeah you find that weird no I'm pretty big boxing fan I've I probably have more we threw him off the top yeah there you go he's just Christ yeah where's he throw him on to and by the way that's the first time anything like this ever happens so that crowd is literally like what what like I got fucked up yeah like you got fucked up for real I don't think you can fall that far and not get fucked up unless you're in falling into a giant pillow these guys aren't falling oh my god no Mick Foley has like broken every bone and like every injury to the mat oh my god you see that see him just do a backflip and land right there fuck that dude Oh water's good that's a good move so they're doing it like that ninja show that's obviously it was unboxes yeah obviously that's protected that's so funny those dramatic thing the girls were calling oh my god oh my god in the guys they're macho yeah I felt through this gauge oh my god that's supposed to happen was that an accident mm I don't know that may be what's supposed to happen look the way had fall he fell into the center I bet it was supposed to happen you can see how the center sort of gave in now how would they engineer something like that how would they make sure that they're okay like this is like a combination I got a leg did he I think so oh don't show me this is canceled can't watch somebody breaking their leg for a play it's essentially a play magic there's a play we break your leg I mean remember people were criticizing spider-man they had a spider-man musical people kept flying off the harnesses and slamming into the crowd or something no that's I think somebody might have died oh yeah severe injury at the very least what happened during spider-man musical is that I think they got it wired though think they figured it out well don't show it to me bro yes please show I don't want to see the guy oh oh the thing snapped oh my god Jesus Christ Wow oh my god it's gonna have to a Peter died no mmm spider-man listen I want to say that there's more than one accident yeah I thought it kept happening that's why they had this yeah I want to say there was a second accident but I might have been making this up this video I just put up here is the fourth accident Oh on that Jesus Christ right now stop and think about how many accidents they have in the Pro Wrestling world all the time yeah rhiness every week multiple arenas per week sound yeah and how many of those things must go wrong in those arenas people have died yeah yeah Owen Hart fuck you know about I wonder right yeah on the entrance yeah a character you he didn't even want to play dude hard way to make a living yeah all right Tony let's wrap this bitch up and head down to Bakersfield okay hollow begs field tonight where are we Fox Theater yeah I don't know two shows tonight Bakersfield two shows tomorrow in Fresno and then Santa Barbara on Saturday night yeah whoa I was hoping you're gonna join in on Ric Flair oh I didn't realize where you're going yeah whoa by everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
