boo ain't Andre we good okay oh sorry chatting about kombucha I just wanna say before this podcast starts you fucked up Baltar you fucked up you fucked up I've been telling everybody that Jimmy Smith's the best out there forever and you let him go that's that's that's a that's a huge error in their parts we can't talk about anything that is what it might be like some future news we can't talk about that we can die but the past is the past is up for discussion that's the pass is up for discussion present good thrilled if somehow another that we were able to work it out where Jimmy Spencer's at the UFC we shall see that would be what I would like to see we shall see how that goes I would like to see that we will that's a big fuck up yeah man it was um he said like just a little background slop you've been asking me I haven't made any real public statements other than Bellator hater someone say yeah yeah respect yeah I enjoyed watching and like the fighters yeah and I've always told everybody that you were the best out there thank you so much you an amazing job I really appreciate that um yeah it's it's not a it's not a belter they made they were great to work with they were great about the the whole breakup thing someone say yeah so what happened was I was I had a I had a deal with an option year and 2018 was my option year and when I was in Verona New York doing the Verona show my boss sat me down I said we're not gonna renew 2018 we want a different we want a different deal and when they come to you and say we want a different deal what they want to downgrade it's never it's never when you go for it come to you and says I want to talk it's never I don't give enough blow jobs that's never doesn't ever what they they never say that it's always I'm gonna be a better girlfriend exactly yeah it's always bad it's always bad so yeah that was it when they were like we want to change the deal around I was like okay and they did make a like an honor stepper to keep me they they they really tried but they just they didn't make an offer that was worth me coming back and that was pretty much a deal so comparatively amicable it's fascinating to me that in in the world of mixed martial arts professional mixed martial arts there haven't been that many people that have done you what you and I called yes small handful of people you don't you the weird thing is about our job really and I mean this from the bottom of my heart everybody thinks they got a guy it's one jobs that everybody thinks they can do that they really go we'll just throw a fighter and then he'll be able do it I've seen I don't know how many of them that they want to do you know even locker room interviews I want to get an ex-fighter to that and it's it's a job it's a it's really I mean it's one of those things where everybody thinks they could throw some way in and do it and I've seen I don't know how many try and it's it's tough you really have to work at it or having a knack for it it's it's not the kind of thing that you know it's almost like coaching I mean how many times you heard I've heard of great great jiu-jitsu guys like he's just not a great cut he's naturally really good he's not got good at teaching him because to him it just works and then you try and it doesn't work you know it's one thing for a great fighter isn't a great coach right rheems yeah a great fighter is in the show lee a great broadcaster it just doesn't work that way yeah some guys are just naturally good at like you or me a is naturally fun like when Rose namajunas knocked out you wanna you and Jay check he starts yelling like that's just pure personality like you either have that in you you can't fake yelling out thug rose after Rose namajunas chaos or you you can't fake enthusiasm right and that's I I think real enthusiasts you really care about the sport there are two things that that well three things that we have to do is number one is educate people I feel just most America it's weird because most Americans didn't grow up wrestling they didn't grow up to Mort I didn't grow up doing jiu-jitsu so a lot of our sport is at least partially we're introducing them to it my mom doesn't know the difference between a kneebar in a leglock she knows boxing she grew up watching boxing she has a background in that so you know we have to explain a lot number two is I got to communicate enthusiasm we're happy to be here how great this thing is you should want to be here too that's number two number three is the story every fight has a story and even if we don't tell the story we at least give them the option of the story yeah was Buster Douglas always a great fighter and we didn't know it did he have one great Knight was Mike Tyson unprepared that night was Mike Tyson not as because we thought he was we were literally just talking about that in the last podcast about how Buster Douglas his mom died yeah before the fight and he was just motive like he'd never been motivated before got himself in really good shape and had a mission right galvanized him like crazy the death of his mother yeah but it's our job to write and analyse it more exciting to see you know what are we seeing here always saying wow it's my just having an off night it's Buster just having a great night was Buster always great we didn't know it there are a million ways to see the story and mostly play-by-play does that but we do it every now and then about hey you know this is this could be a new thing could be an old thing it's our job to tell that story little bit well especially when it comes to results that we think happened and why they happen in certain fights and corrections that were made which is on the technical side of things the worst side of things in the ground too which is huge and you're one of the I mean how many guys are doing it but you're you're a legit Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt thank you thanks Bridget I think that's important yeah I think you have to understand transitions you got to understand danger you gotta understand when someone's doing the right thing and then the percentages of them getting sub drop substantially with each move you got to be there so you're seeing every step of the way going this guy's gonna bail on us any time now here comes a scramble what would I do how do I anticipate this going down and Beno explain to people as they follow along and when you do it and I follow along it makes it more enjoyable to me and that's so mean I think we talked about I don't know you know if we talked about this before but I called Dana white about you like how many years ago for Jimmy Smith hardened by the UFC like 44 years ago four years ago yeah I was like dude you want better people you want more people I go higher that fucking guy yeah I look guy he knows what he's doing man knows what he's doing he's excited he loves the sport and I was telling him you're a great guy and we talked he's genuine I go he's a real fan and he's fucking really good at it man go get him really love it I I mean I love the sport I love 100% no no the timing didn't work out then and then now I'm currently unemployed well you got to call some fucking bad-ass fights though man you know Bellator is welterweight division in particular is goddamn stacked right now you know what's funny there are certain fighters and I was thinking about it I was watching the sidewalk fight last Saturday there are certain fighters you meet and it's like stunning certain athletes when you when you meet LeBron James you go Jesus come on like I've seen him on TV but when you seem in real life you go holy that guy's big cyborgs one of those Douglas Lima is one of those have you ever met him yeah when you meet that guy you go God you make 170 pounds he is massive what do you think he walks around at 210 210 told me that's we told you when when when King mo fought rampage all right King mo was 218 he's steppin scale 218 I saw the night of the fire you know Doug's lien was her and I walk up to when I go you've walked it to 18 and he goes yeah he's like I want to eat too much like I shouldn't but I have he has walked around at what King mo walked around at cuz Kimo would you stepped on scale isn't cut to make you 20 I mean because the the weight class of 220 we fought rampage he walks around chemo sites like they are the same size that is so insane he makes 170 he he has the worst cut in terms of pounds of herbs he deals with it well but he has one of the biggest cuts I've ever seen you know he's really good with the Bellator wasn't under on any IV and restrictions I think it's by state we weren't as a promotion under it I don't think I think it's by state because I think the hardcore testing got instituted by you sada when David ski came along and I think that's when they stopped IVs I think states still allow them yeah as far as I know it's still state for us and so what would that people don't know what we're talking about what that means is and this is up for debate because Joe Silva claimed that there had been tests Dunn's what he was telling me and I believe him that showed that the correct way of rehydrating orally actually led to better results over a 24-hour period I've heard that yeah that the IV thing was good for short-term recovery from severe dehydration but to actually go from like a weight cutting weight to go back I don't know I didn't read any of the studies but I do know about the inherent dangers of severe weight cuts kidney failure you know there's some couple people who died over the last year a professional or every every few years the wrestler dies a young amateur Muay Thai fighter died yeah right yeah yeah the the issue for that that people have trouble understanding well first off I've to the IV point I've heard coaches say it's just for their head they feel better once they like they think they need the IV and it's a lie complicit I've had coaches tell me it's pretty much a placebo you can't do it that much more now once again I haven't read the studies but I've had coaches tell me that that's my quieter just needs to for his head it used to be like what we'd assumed you had to have like if a guy's gonna cut a lot of weight he's gonna have a guy ready with an IV how many bags you take that was the thing that everybody always probably yeah how many bags the two things that people don't really know when people asked me cuz I've been in this since about 2099 is when I first started 2099 you're from the future mm mm comma and anyway um guys didn't cut like they do now when you look at old ufc's and you'll get a size of these guys I Cheetos one of you guys who was right now a legit 205 Frank Shamrock is like my size yeah shamrock was very small for the when he fought when Tito Ortiz and Frank Shamrock fought it was one of the very first displays of defense and and cardio and how critical it was in victory you just he was lighter he was only like 190 when they fought dude and he was able to pull he clothed in 198 only taking stuff out of his pockets are like a joke like you're fully clothed so guys cut more than they did in other parts of sport I'm yeah they just cut a lot more and when people asked me well what do you do about weight cutting how do we change it one of the things about fighting in general and and this goes to with you know other aspects of sport you're asking people who already take a huge risk fighting is just a huge risk period to not take another huge risk just the mentality of if I have to do this to win I'm gonna do it it's you know you're saying all they need they can't take that risk well they're already you're already have the personality of I don't care what I have to do I'm getting that fight and I'm making it so it's it's it's a hard that it's you know what rule can you make it's it's hard to do you're talking about a a group of people that are already used to taking a huge dangerous physical risk to even get in there so adding on the weight cut they're gonna take that gamble every time you know it's crazy if they can one Fc though is instituting some interesting new rule changes and one Fc is doing hydration tests and they've done high schools not for us on then ended up for him they should and oh god who I'm trying to member who told me that this weekend but they're essentially saying they're gonna be able to ban weight cutting they're just gonna be able to institute the no one's gonna be able to cut weight you just if you if you pass the hydration test you're not gonna be able to cut weight so you have to pass this hydration tested every form at every turn you can't just get on the scale and you weigh 170 pounds Oh congratulations no no no you weigh 170 pounds but you're in danger like look at your body with your hydration what point are they are they testing apparently they're doing it hard falling apart course they step not you not you and a half the car falls apart yeah wonder what they did there's a win with this that's my question well they'd have to do it early and blow all the weight glasses up yeah that's weird we were having this conversation everybody on at least or if you don't even shift them one you find out like what what wait are you really you know I mean you could be like a Luke Rockhold dude who's a giant 185 or I mean Luke easily looks like he could be a heavy weight he's walking around is he he's like 220 or 230 or something like that and then he gets to I mean maybe he's mad at me right now I don't I might be exaggerating but at the very least when he gets down from down to 185 he's probably coming from 200 plus pounds and a big tall 205 but then there's other guys that just don't cut that much at all and but what gets me is there's no hard and fast body type rule like I said Doug Simon is huge he makes it every time you ever talk to him about how he does it uh he's told me little things he used to not do it well and he looked like death in the last few fights he's looked much better so yeah he just he tended to be wound up to like to 10 to 15 and he's American Top Team right yeah yeah coconut creek tub oh it's somewhere oh really somewhere down south where he's you might go there to spar or something but he's he's not at the main main facility muscle if there are they all like integrated like gracie baja yeah the same team so he goes around to get work but it's it's and then i have guys you know for democrats allah's' never makes weight and he looks like he's got something to lose he's not gonna shred it biggest 170 and it he always has trouble with it so it's weird certain guys you like now there's no way making it always does and certain guys look like they should we'll make it pretty easily and just don't it's it's strange there's no easy rules what I'm saying they're huge and he make it was a wrestlers whole life right he makes it every time he's a giant yeah I mean like how much of it is discipline how much of it is a really good game plan and a really good nutrition it's like cyborgs or excuse me no burger meant off made weight easily this time yeah and you know cyborg obviously had a hard time trying to 140 but at 145 she's been successful cutting the way yeah but for normal men off he says some real fuckin problems making 55 this time no problems amazing well one of the things you know once again going back to storytelling for us is when someone doesn't make it they don't make weight is it advantage the heavier guy or is it advantage the guy who if you don't make weight maybe something happen that last couple weeks a camp that maybe a little injury kept you from losing the weight or is it advantage the bigger guy yeah is it better coming big or did the guy who make weight was he a little more discipline at the end and he has an advantage in the fight you don't know at the time well the problem with nurmagomedov obviously was the last fight before this previous spectacular fight with Barbosa he didn't make the way because he had to go to the hospital so that's a different animal that's like you pushed it so far that they were they wanted to make sure you stayed alive so they had to bring it to a hospital so they obviously realized there's some changes that need to be made they made those changes and fucking hell on Friday aren't Saturday night rather fucking how unbelievable that was it's really weird sometimes when you in any sport I don't care what it is when you see somebody you know Jordan in his prime you just you just can't cover the guy it's almost like he's the only one on the court yeah never game enough it was like he was the only one in the cage it was everything was inevitable everything was inevitable yeah leadings were inevitable you know even if you hit them congratulations now you're on your ass getting punched in the face over and over again you can't get up you're getting mauled like immediately and it against an excellent fighter I just can't forget Barbosa is amazing amazing and he made him look like he's the look on his face when he got up when Barbosa was like hey you were better than me you know it was almost like a yeah like I sure I wouldn't even mad it was just when you see somebody much better it's it's back to the drawing board I was super impressed with barbozza being able to make it to the final bell I mean that was amazing just being able to do that that shows you what a dominant performance it was by a guy like habib but you also realize like what what a world-class fighter Barboza is that he did keeps throwing wheel kicks in the third round and even landed one of them it just didn't have much on an analogy anymore but fuck man he was still trying to win after a horrendous mauling for eight plus minutes you know what I really look at fighters when I really when I really focus on them especially the face in between rounds I look for that breaking moment of yeah you know Vitor Belfort Randy Couture knees sit on the ground just like beat this guy's beat it's it's when you look at them in between rounds and you see that like what am i doing in here that's when you know you know the men from the boys mentally speaking and you know in in belt or Patricio pitbull and when we fought when he fought Daniel Straus he's getting beat up for like four rounds and every round he looked like Lemmy Adam there wasn't there wasn't anyone and then you know toward the end of fourth round with a rear naked choke he just never quits and I always look for that breaking moment and that's when that's when you real that's what really separates the guys who are mentally 100% there in those one those one I think Barbosa got beaten but I don't think he got broken no I don't think if you think about the amount of time during that fight he was actually getting his ass kicked when I said eight families at rounds I met minutes I think there was like eight minutes of prolonged top time and beating in that fight yeah plus and then there's all the backward movement trying to get away throwing those inside leg kicks and doing everything he can everything you can to create space but for eight fucking minutes he never gave up you just or whatever it was fifteen minutes he's just getting the fuck beaten out of them he kept trying to win he wasn't capable of doing it but he never broke uh Teddy Atlas said fighters make an agreement I'll stop trying to win if you'll stop trying to hurt me oh yeah and he never did that I never went look just go away just like leave me alone and I'll back up and you can beat me he never did that he kept throwing the whole time which is incredible but just no answer how many ten eighths were there on the scorecards like well the thing is when and what a 10-8 every round it was least old it was the old scoring to the Nevada has an invalid Apted the new rules so in that four people don't know the new rules make it easier to make distinctions between a 10-9 round 10-8 round ten seven around which I haven't done to them no Nonna's not so that's an old-school ten eight yeah there's some ridiculous scorecards that seem to indicate some of us that even though the new rules are better and the states haven't adopted them the judges have decided to adopt them and some sort of a weird non declared way because it does definitely seemed there was a much large disparity in the numbers and the scorecards yeah but never coming off just just mauled him mauled him I mean mauled him in a way that you go oh god you're not even there he's just on such another level that you the odds of you beating him drop so substantially after the first minute and a half after you get you saw the look on barbosa's face there's like two minutes plus into the first round and he's trying to get up you see look at his face he's like fuck how am I gonna deal with this yeah like this is so next level you know what's really funny it's almost to me like a throwback kind of fighter in in a sense of if you remember back in the day guys that that didn't have a real solid wrestling and jiu-jitsu background when they felt that pressure they kind of went didn't have any experience with it they were so holy crossing a truck rolling over you you almost saw that look on his face like oh like I've never felt anything like this in life and for someone training at Barboza's level you know he's trained with high-level guys you train with all kinds of outstanding wrestlers introduce you guys to have that look like this is some crazy pressure that's insane because no one has secret techniques anymore it's not only it's not divided skill wise I mean you'll have great guys in every camp and the fact that you see on someone's eye and I say this to fighters either you don't want the first time you experience something to be in the cage yeah you want to experience this in training and then you can deal with in the cage Barbossa had a look in his eye like I have never felt anything like this in my life and that's incredible considering modern techniques well it seems to me that everything right now is his next level in comparison to a year and a half two years ago like dos Anjos beat Robbie Lawler recently and just fucking tour de force de force performance watch that fight I was like this is as good as dos anos has ever looked if not rich are fucking amazing at 170 but more importantly like that the output the the amount of shots that he landed the amount of shots that he fired that the endurance that he's showing everybody is on this complete different performance level right now what I loved about that performance is one thing that generally doesn't change weight class as well when you move up is power meaning Robbie law if you remember at 170 was not gonna be out 185 he was like so so the shot that knock somebody out at 70 when you only use a strike force 25 isn't gonna knock out jakka it's not gonna knock out babalu it's not gonna knock out these big 180 fibers so a lot of power punchers have trouble changing weight classes because the power shot just doesn't go with them dos Anjos looked like he knew that and when i got a volume guys 170 i'm not gonna knock anybody out with one shot at 50 any like I did at 55 I have to throw more at 70 I have to be more accurate at 70 I have to slice him up with all those little ones so I like all the adjustments he made for the new weight class he didn't try and fight like you did at 55 he's like I gotta throw more against these guys I can't go one punch for one punch with Robbie Lawler he has a huge 170 so I like the way his style modified with with the weight class change did I agree and I also think the use of leg kicks is critical you got to slow Robbie down rock is a big heavy guy and he immediately started chopping that it is crazy to me also that that low calf kick is becoming such a giant factor in MMA that cake is just dominant now everybody is using it no one man off did to him after he knocked man I fight and couldn't walk he knocks him out and was like limping over this corner gone I you know one more like I'm done that was one of the greatest comeback from behind knockouts ever I know he's eating all those leg kicks and Melvin is just coming out if you haven't seen that fight folks see it because it's it's awesome else is just owned in that leg got a little aggressive as Melvin Manhoef does and got clipped man with the haymakers Hail Mary man and then on the way down - yeah when he was when he was out and shot number that yeah TQ sitting there and lands with a shot yeah yeah Robbie was a brutal brutal knockout artist I always wanted to see a rematch between him and Nick Diaz I think everybody awesome how is it possible that that didn't take place it's we there are certain matches that that you wonder you know the the run family was on Wanderlei tour to never never yeah I mean there's certain ones you go man I can't believe that's certainly one I'm still good they're good hypothetically I mean we still sell like crazy I mean I wonder if Nick Diaz if you wanted to come back would only want to come back for a title fight I'm one of he's like that kind of money fight guy where's like yet obviously he's got some money and obviously he's not beating down anybody's door to fight no he's not you know he's doing whatever the fuck he wants to do but if you could get him back for a big money fight a wonderful to only be like a title fight that's increasing what's happening these days I mean guys oh my god I'm not getting PSP yeah it came back for a huge money fight and that's it you know it's funny Dana White said something crazy like yeah I just gonna pack up his money jack three suitcases sold all of it yeah he did big money fight stuff won the title and then retired yes I mean look as far as like legacy if you wanted to end it right there that's a pretty nice cherry yeah that's a nice one that's pretty nice cherry with a finish yeah that's pretty awesome come back up choke the champ asleep and say now I'm good now do you think do you think he comes back for any other fighter Michael Bisping was the perfect guy for him to come back and fight I think these perfect government he comes back for Conor yeah that's the fight but I don't think they want to do that I don't think stylistically it's it's I make it certainly Aven would certainly sell but you know we know how GSP fights a he's a giant compared to Conor he's a wrestling heavy style I don't think it's it's a great I don't think it would be hard for Conor to look good in that fight there's the West it'll be hard for him if he it'd be hard for kind of look good unless he caught him coming in which no one's been able to really do against GSP they would have to do some sort of a catchweight yeah because their body composition would just be so much different wouldn't work if they'd really did 170 and you know that was an issue that he had with Nate but Nate is a legit 155 er you know he kept so you could have some fucking attributes there like that Nate is a big long guy yeah and he does get heavy in between but the reality is he fought successfully made wait wait 155 on numerous occasions easily yeah you know fought in the Ultimate Fighter at 155 that's his weight and that was another one of those when he came up from 45 to 55 I think he was still in that one-shot mode and if you watch that fight again kind of hit some goes shit yeah he's still here because I'm in fifty five and not only does Diaz have a great chin he's a big 55 er he's well hydrated especially they fought first times 170 he's hydrated you know he hasn't cut at all he can take a shot and that one shot ability he had a 45 oh shit it's not here anymore yeah I think he was a little bit more prepared didn't if it's fun Nate fought at least twice at 70 in the UFC before cookie fought Rory Rory and who else who's uh who else a fight at 70 he fought he fought uh again at 78 we fought mmm right now we're being tweeted at someone's yeah yeah yeah totally I'm totally looking for the I don't remember what it was but he had I want to say maybe dumb stun-gun Kim at my favorite somebody's it might have been that somebody's looking it up right now for us young Jamie's on the case is that is it was it's a dozen I was wait-listed on the thing I was like won't you put it up so I can take a look at it now that we see what is it wiki yeah we're kind of let's go to the wiki MMA record no show it oh oh there we are two eggs right so he tried it for a little bit after he beat Marcus Davis he's having a hard time tape making the way and then he came back to 55 and beat Takanori Gomi beat Donald Cerrone beat Jim Miller yeah that's the Roni fight was a that was I think his maybe his finest fight he took strongly apart he mentally faster oni with the trash-talking yeah he got he got into Rona's head and it became very emotional for him well Donald likes to be friends with the guys he fights yeah well that yeah anything can happen yeah yeah he um he just he's a nice guy Donald just likes to fight he's a really nice guy well to loop it back to our early discussion about about weight cunning there's a reason guys do it I mean Diaz is a great 55 er is a so-so 70 and uh you know a fantastic BG benefits that to me the worst you never happened BJ Penn was when he knocked I'm Matt Hughes and thought I can fight it 70 he was 1 5 & 1 at at 70 which okiya not once then he knocked him out yeah I mean yeah and this is when he went 270 pounds yeah it was the only the only fighter he ever beat and 170 was Matt Hughes right and in the USA so what that did is that I think he fought 185 I'm on the rock we took on Gracie but yeah - Gracie's he fought to hold Rica - but once he had that idea that he could beat these guys at 170 I mean you saw what Diaz did to him I mean he just wasn't right Rory ate him alive it's just a great 55 er isn't always a great 70 robbie lawler at 70 is not a great 185 er to me hard to watch yeah which you know and then was it sort of accentuated back when BJ made his return at 45 and then you go okay well this makes more sense yeah like you were at 55 when he fought Diego Sanchez he was one of the baddest 55 years of all time ever he was a monster but for whatever reason he just you know never quite that that level was only attained a few times yeah you know yeah and he's one of those guys where where I mean I was talking to Josh Thompson recently backstage in New York and you know he's training with Frank Shamrock and and BJ Penn and said they were sitting there with an exercise ball and they'd already been training for a while and they said we're trying to stand on this exercise ball and we're trying to trying to fall in and fall in and BJ walks in like you know an hour late for practice and says what you guys doing is oh we're trumps down in successful and BJ jumped on it and went okay and walked back in they've been trying for like an hour to stand on this thing and you know I've heard a million stories of that BJ you know coming in late to practice smoke and everybody leaving oh yeah you know I never trained me I don't know but but you have that sense he's one of those who go man if I had if you had you know BJ Penn's ability which is off the chart incredible with the longevity and work ethic of like a Matt Hughes I mean he might still be champion it's unbelievable what the guy had really unbelievable be like you said it was in spurts and fits and then he left UFC for a while because he didn't like the Maya they got rid of the 55 division and you know these fits and starts man then he fucked Machida and have you seen it was over 205 sent over to a five which it was like 210 or sinka ratified yeah no he fought Duane Ludwig over there yeah yeah on a triangle choke him out and the rumble on the rock fights were fucking great all the go me fight is awesome I love that fight it was a great idea he's like fucking I make my own promotion yeah yeah I mean that's balls and Hawaii used to be a really fertile ground for him available yeah man SuperBrawl remote super Mike thanks were fucking great back in the day Pete or John Hasbro yeah feet or John Hess was over there John Lowe blame me yeah mayhem had a bunch of fights over there yeah big tournament mayhem an Egon anyway remember that you don't anyway got may having a crazy Kimora mayhem just kept rolling rolling out of it in one tap spanking a man hit him yeah Frank Trigg and Robbie Lawler back then remember in Hawaii yeah holy SH Miller Lawler that's really beat him that's right oh yeah that's right su-mei and Miller was a bad monster fucker monster partners I started with T punishment like two thousand nine ninety thousand and mayhem was there and you know rolling with that guy was crazy super skillful unbelievely skillful funktones crazy and great flexible and everything yeah yeah I mean I think his finest performance of skins Sakuraba that's what I think Mayhem's finest performers he was so like just technical yeah clean and just went through him just chop chop bang bang smash choke I think he was one of those guys looking back on it there are certain guys who I'm thinking around Josh Barnett a bit I think Shaolin a little bit who had these he didn't settle down a promotion right in his prime and really you know because these are my wife's pouncing around a little bit just Fernet spent his prime kind of bouncing around a lot yeah that time he made his UFC run he wasn't it was late in his career because memory fought GSP took a long break off and came back just wasn't the same guy you know and you wonder sometime I think maybe his prime Vitor Shaolin might be the best 55 or in the world in his prime but he was in Sciuto he would move around on Japan and just was off the US radar and that was a cavalcade to write jay-z's dad that was a big issue with him back in the day people were saying he was the best hundred fifty five pounder alive like a lot of the guys who trained with him by the time he came to the states it was he was just a little bit further past it yeah there's been a few of those cases right like Josh Thompson who were talking about at one point tom was the best lightweight in the world or one of them and then had some of his best fights with Gilbert who was also at the same time in the same bracket and they fought in Strikeforce while they were peaking you know fantastic fights they are awesome guys but but what people understand who maybe are new to the sport the ecosystem you can used to be different you can make good money I'm fighting for icon sports in Hawaii there wasn't a lot of incentive right to move around and guys moved around much easier it was it you know I fought here a couple times and here a couple times they weren't as restrictive with talent as it is now or it's you know Beltre fighters don't move over and UFC fighters no more until they're done with their contracts guys moved around a lot and yeah and so something like Josh Barnett could move around a little bit more and make more money than wouldn't settling down somewhere but it kept him off the radar of a lot of us France how about Eve Edwards Eve Edwards is probably the best hundred fifty five pounder in the world and the UFC got rid of the division you know it's so hard to explain that to people that they once cut the 55 division at the time he had just knocked out Josh Thompson that head kick off one of my favorite of all time oh man and they got really fed up on division right after that not gonna write that right in that era and once again by the time he came back he fought in Pride beat Mishima yeah beat Mishima over and pride lost to yo Keem Hansen by the time he came back it was even it was just two ladies at the end of you know yeah man he fought hard hospital in Bodog to me yes he did got knocked out yeah right here cuts him spinning back this boom-boom blood sports yeah that was when Eve was at the top of the food chain great guy well the best yeah strain with him a couple times when I first started skillful super nice guy yeah man um so those guys were you know cut lose they had yeah they had to go somewhere they had find a place for them and then Strikeforce became the spot where you had the the Gilbert Josh Thompson wars you had Tim and he had some great fights over there Guido that's where he got his start when he beat Josh thank you came from there that's right that's when clay beated beat Josh is a huge huge upset yeah man there were some good fights over in Strikeforce and they really were like the tournament format it was fun you know the heavyweight division was awesome at a time when the OFC division was at a low point the heavyweight division we've got a low point I thought Strikeforce was great it's just hard for people to accept talent levels of folks that aren't in the Big Show's it's like it took Marlin mirai's to come over and you know look the way he looked in his last fight you know when you see when you see like just engag come over from world series of fighting and see the the fuck in brawl he had with Michael Johnson yeah then the crazy fight with Eddie Alvarez realize like oh this guy's been like this all along yeah you know and then when Mirage knocks out Algie main sterling with that that was trying to kick him buddy hit him with the knee of it but I mean chaos on flat lines them and you realize like oh this guy is fucking for real this is a guy that just beat henan Burrell right al jamayne just beats Henin barão Maurice Starr Chisolm with a high kick whoa this guy was in the World Series were fighting people didn't really look at that it's like he's top shelf talent when Eddie came from Ellsworth yep he comes in and you can argue you could argue that Eddie was in his physical prime belts was a little bit younger a little bit sharper he comes over the US he does the same thing knocks feel out one's a belt and suddenly he's on everybody's radar and says well you know he was you might be lost donald first yeah he did he did Donald exposed the weaknesses too like yeah fights when you think about what Eddie went through when you go cowboy Cerrone then once Gilbert Melendez was next for him dos Anjos was like Jesus critters on yep and the dos Anjos ko was just crazy yeah Eddie always he's always gonna have passes savage he's a fun fuckin dude to watch and he gets dropped in like almost every fight he's in it was just like a thing when is he gonna get dropped boom and he gets up and keeps fighting it's almost like you did wakes him up well he's just so ferocious good guy he's a great guy he's so ferocious that it's almost inevitable that he's gonna get tagged because he's just so like throwing the wind let's see let's find out he's confident that he can get through it better than you can yeah so just like everybody's gonna get cracked like that's why the gang fight was so engaging like you knew this is what this fight was gonna be and he it was one of the rare fights that 100% lived up to the hype yeah it was exactly what we thought it was gonna be it was fucking madness from the beginning to the end and when you look at how many submit listed at how many champs from different organizations he's beaten in his career yeah he's beaten them all yeah he's beaten them all you know cuz he was one of those guys once again going back to what we're talking about where he moved around a lot in his prime a young kid from Japan two belts one was awful lot of fans radars he was like a like that the you know the people that really follow him maa knew Eddie Alvarez but your casual fan didn't until he made his UFC trans is he the only guy that ever won the title in both organizations Bellator no see yeah yes yeah right yeah no one else yeah that's pretty goddamn impressive that's a good I think the other guy was a chance is Lima or Rory depending on who wins that fight yeah the winner of that fight is right I would say right there right there with everybody I mean you can't deny it Rory beat Tyron in a very dominant decision completely yeah yeah I mean and he's lost two guys who lost the Lawlor and of course Lawler got knocked out by Tyron so he can't do MMA math doesn't work but Tyron is a champ and Rory beat him oh yeah that's bigger than that he's there yeah you know I think Tyrone is better now I really do yeah definitely hundred percent and you know maybe it would be different if they fought again but it's just statistically interesting he says the things when I talked him when he came over to Bellator I you know it's funny we do fight in fighter meetings fighter interviews where I sit him down and I talk to him about the upcoming fights everything and I don't pay attention to what they say as much as how they say it and I have to say were MacDonald when he came in I went this guy wants to be champion he's not he's not coming over here going I'm gonna get paid and that's what I mean he really has a fire in him to be champion he is 100% devoted and that puts him in rare air and Lima if you haven't seen that guy fight man I he hits you you don't know where you are he is fun he puts everything behind every punch and he can start anybody in the division the question is can you handle the takedown takedown defense has been suspect in the past and we'll see if he can handle them takedown don't worry yeah because that's exactly what Rory used on Paul Daley he just went right through Paul Daley any cracked Inferno president is he cracked him and it kind of made daily hesitate and boom takedown submission yeah you could see did he he wanted to let Daley know this is a fight I'm gonna I'm gonna be a danger on the feet standing and then guess what oh look I'm on the ground I'm not afraid of you and now you're getting strangled yeah yeah as long as he's not afraid of him standing up then there's no hesitancy in engaging and he wasn't mean he's the one who drew I mean he's one landed first he's top of the food chain in my opinion I think I think he's right up there with anybody at 170 pounds yeah in the world and I'd like to see him back in the UFC for selfish reasons of course you yeah I understand and I want to see what the fuck is gonna happen now I mean the whole division is just topsy-turvy right now yeah I know 155 and 170 it's all craziness this is so there's so much happening right now with our DEA just dominating Robbie Lawler like that and people clamoring for a title fight for him and now Tyron had to get shoulder surgery so Tyron had a toward labrum apparently tried to rehab it and eventually want up getting surgery so he's out for several months you know where he can't do shit a tough thing whenever you know belt or do you see or wherever whenever you have that backlog whenever you have a champ can't defend a title or something like that or he's out for a little bit the piranhas I mean they eat each other yeah you know if there's no oh we're gonna get this out you can go through your prime waiting for that guy to come back from surgery like the years you might whatever it is in a division that's that's stacked and these guys are killers you can go through your whole prime trying to climb up that mountain again it is tough that's the dictionary boxing and MMA right because in boxing the your manager would make you keep that number one contender position 100% yeah they would they would wait on that one let's wait on this one we're going to take a risk well you'd fight nobody yeah you fight some Joe Lewis bum of the Month Club yeah yeah yeah boxing yeah guys would take warm-up fights tune-up fights yeah and those would also be like highlight fights because you know you tee off on some guy that was below them and everybody gets super excited about this guy the Tyson's about to fight yeah whatever it was yeah that's funny I'm sorry Steve I talked to Steve Arwood today actually he ended up chatting a little bit he does the boxing for Showtime he's the unofficial scorer that guy used to be editor for Ring Magazine for like 30 years you can't stump him about boxing at all I've tried I've added some obscure stuff he is phenomenal everything he knows we were talking once about the heavyweight division oh it's not really good right now Andy he looked migos it usually isn't he said the the heavyweight division usually isn't the most stacked division in boxing we remember the airs when it was because that really stands out to us but generally it's not that good usually 47 is the marquee division with great fighters in it he's like me the reason Tyson stands out so much is you talk about all there was nobody man fight in the eighties because well they're usually what they're whole decades well aren't that good you know what happened Tubbs is a champ yeah Tony Tucker remember him sure there was a lot of you guys yeah post Larry Holmes against uh just a massive amount of guys yeah Trevor Berbick I mean sure guys are kind of lost to history at this point yeah that's who Tyson be remember there was a champ felled fell down three times from one punch that was I remember oh well minute Mills Lane was a referee he was 20 right yes sorry about that youngest heavyweight champion of all time coughing I'm not sick that's almost like I feel like I have a you don't eat pistachios let me get one of them little not the not the shell put that little outside layer or the pistachio almost feeling they had a little piece down in the back of my throat could be hmm was just that jinx of have another commentator across me you know you try makes you cough project more you know you're trying to battle bro we're good we're good come on I want to know what the fuck is gonna happen with Connor yeah that's I mean you and everybody else because be you and everybody else after this performance have you set it up to a place where he's the most terrifying lightweight contender in the world then you have Tony Ferguson who's a motherfucker who's the interim championship champion and then you have Conor who knows what's gonna happen with him and I think the UFC is gonna give him a little while I'm gonna give him some time you know hey let the holidays pass see what the fuck happens and they're gonna have to make some moves but they want to do a Russia fight yeah and if they want to do a Russia fight I know a guy I know a guy little sell some fucking tickets in Russia baby yeah Tony Ferguson khabib nurmagomedov in Russia what could you use it on Twitter about this Connors what kind of shit I skin your pets and only wear once that's mighty God truly truly get on your fucking knees and beg me otherwise I don't give a bollocks my whiskey is out this year and that's diddy bread so he tweeted the the bear thing and then it was I skin your pets and I wear him once oh yeah that's was comparatively witty slaughter your pets and wear them as coats and only wear them once but there's a lot of it's a good trash talk I like it have you ever seen a documentary called a bobby fisher' against the world no follow chest there was a there's a document about blood fisher called bobby fischer against a woman whether or not you're in the chest you should really really watch it I'm into Bobby Fischer yeah okay it's called Bobby Fischer against the world and yeah he was and anyway they interview one of his his friends his long friends long lifelong friends named dr. Anthony Sadie and their last conversation before Bobby cut him off he said Bobby if you don't play chess eventually they'll come a time where no one will ask you to play chess that's the situation is you know you can keep doing this and tweets but the reason you're famous the reason people you have that what you have in front of you is because you fight and there comes a time when like I said the division with the sport in the division everybody it'll move past you now economy have enough money doesn't care about that but that that's always a risk you I mean you know you're an old school you know Sugar Ray Robinson tried to be a dancer entertainer and I get old and they went you want to see you fight and that's all you're gonna get paid for now yeah he may not have enough money he doesn't care about that certainly possible but there's no sport there's no division that won't move past you eventually and that would be a shame and he thinks that money yeah but he's spending like Floyd Mayweather yeah I mean he's going off if you go off like that after why you gonna run out of money yeah I mean it might be 20 years from now but you know to see him till 20 years yeah and your window to make monies yeah this big in professional sports right you see yeah I don't know if that's I don't know if it's sustainable I don't know if he's got enough money to live the rest of his life but he certainly doesn't if he just spends like crazy I mean he might just go through a phase and then he might decide to cherry-pick specific fights to make tremendous amounts of money and there was some talk about a Pacquiao fight in boxing who knows what he's gonna do but his only sustainable avenues MMA yeah meaning once again in boxing let's say he fights Manny Pacquiao let's say he lose the argument sake let's say he loses that fight right people in retired of spending 70 bucks on a pay-per-view to watch him take on a great guy and for Vice Tony Ferguson in a unification fight in chaos Tony Ferguson then then fight Manny Pacquiao all day long exactly it's it's MMA that sustains him Tony it's just that for instance a possibility for argument's sake yes I'm taking the devil's advocate position Tony Tony got mad at me wearing the hat changing you Ted Planeteer bro what were you weren't I don't know how to say polka oh that firfer come on it's a gift it's a gift to wear that and and listen just because he's got a problem I love Tony but I also love kabhi kabhi was a bad motherfucker did not to deny that it's right let's do it so alright I got to ask commentator co-chair all right what's what's the what's the the maddest a fight has ever been at you for what man I don't know cuz we all have these stories not many of them usually I can watch better buddy I get along with just about everybody too and if there was every rampages were mad at once I remember that as I was saying that he'd needed throw more leg kicks or something like that but it just cuz I wanted him to be successful and when he does he's I just think that guys get a little too - knockout heavy sometimes and I'd like to see people be more Nicole and mix it up in addiction and you're never gonna get away from the power that rampage had and has he's always gonna have that power my thought was like what I would like to see as a person who's a fan I'd like to see him mix it up more yeah you know and become more technical he's always gonna have that ridiculous chin he's always gonna have that unbelievable power those those things are not going away his first guy ever grappled with that's the first guy ever grappled with really you got a legit studio I grappled with him once we were doing something for some television show some inside that's right that inside the UFC thing that I used to do like way back in the day that was like when spike first had the UFC we did some stuff and he was getting ready to fight Chuck and we did some stuff together like a lot of people didn't know who he was he came up we drove around La in his monster truck he had some crazy monster truck was like Jack three feet up the air no no of course we ran into one of the woman I was with rampage we ran to one of the wu-tang clan you know weird section of LA on Hollywood Boulevard the loot was coming out of a check cashing place which guy it was we were having a good fucking time though that was before anybody knew who rampage was I misunderstood cuz he was going by the slug once again like 99 2000 I had finished at UCLA where I first like got my taste in jujitsu at UCLA and then I got graduated and I went to teen punishment and I get on the mat and Fabiano IHA was coach there at the time what the best arm bars in the day Monday good foot last year was sick especially far side and so we I got on the mat and I shake hands with his dude and I said hey my name is Jimmy and he goes I'm rampage and I thought like I misunderstood him I was like I can't sit you know I was like it's a Randall or something and I just misunderstood him and all I knew is I knew armbar in a foot lock at the time and he was so big as I was gonna float like him and and I went for Ollie straight foot locks on right get oh my god oh my god I'm got him and then I got an armbar in him and he lifted me up to the ceiling with one arm and just aronia at my ass just went boom dropped right on me and Fabiano comes running over mad start screaming at him and he walks off to me he goes that was cool right yeah we're fine man I'm a wrestlers you know no big guy and slam before and that was it Simon met Quentin man back then the cage like a second fight is for I was there right after his first play before like literally we just get started like living in his car stuff and now he's come very very far he's one of those guys I'm really glad did he find that Marvin Eastman like one of his first I was his I believe it was this first his first fight at king of the cage Brad Warner was Marvin I think he fought once in Tennessee or something but yeah it's perfect Marvin Eastman lost by decision cool man I mean did you started beating guys up started long history this sport has now and you think about it it's interesting because it's all just sort of accumulated like the different styles and the different abilities do you learn how tough especially in California in the early 2000s the local scene was a motherfucker oh yeah dude it's because you see like MMA was big it was not baby it was pop it was cool it was like it was popular it was fun and there weren't many big shows so guys had to fight on the local level for a while to get enough fights to get there and also once again the contracts weren't that restrictive so in-between UFC fights couldnt have that many guys could go down to king of the cage and make some money so you'd see some really talented guys at king of the cage so it's weird Battier Tunisian shows MOBA casino man it's where I fought first time I felt like for my fights up there there was a bunch of casinos that would have it and it all had to be Native American reservations is about their own rules yeah it's illegal waiting on a bathroom scale like literally like on a bathroom scale in the lobby of the hotel and Ted would look down and go yeah you're good you know whatever the doctors test was like can you find your nose can you stand on one foot you stand me up foot okay get in there it was literally that was it it's crazy it's Wild West man do you remember when the king of the cage it got rainy and they decide to let everybody for Wow bro wet and wild that was crazy that works phone that cárdenas Jeremy Williams did he really I believe so from Team ng team next generation man yeah I do yeah yeah how's the solid team Chris Brennan's camp man back then yeah solid dudes man yeah there was a to Jeremy Williams right it was the one two boxers on Tom getting locked up Jeremy the original one who took his old mine yeah dibs on my very sad story was a really interesting huh I was super talented too I found a grappling match against Jerry at No Limits murmur Noonan's yeah yeah Owen we're calling Tommy soup anyway so I got a call from the guy who ran No Limits and he called me say they have a grappling tournament coming up would you like to fight just didn't you know I was doing grappling terms of the time I said yeah sure no problem man and because yeah I'm super fighting is Jeremy Williams no because I had seen Jeremy Williams you know he was yeah locally in California he was known and we got in this ring or whatever when we fought and I caught him in two old and I and he tapped in and I went back into the locker room and he's bawling like bawling bawling bawling bawling but like devastated and I remember thinking at the time that's that's like it wasn't a grappling arena got God I mean it happens and like his whole team was around him like like like a funeral or something and I and I went up to him I was like man I've always been a huge fan which is true I mean I on the local especially at that time he was like here he was he was a level above most guys and I told man I'm a huge fan and it's just an honor to fight you he said thank you Andy hug me but I remotion so devastated what was gone is life a time and when I went to Japan for fight quest I I read that he had taken his own life and I that that was tough man that was tough wolf yeah it's not all sunshine and rainbows any my man well it certainly isn't well it isn't in any combat sport right it's like what happen and it's hard to tell what is what's happening is it what leads you to it in the first place is you have this burning desire to get back people and your emotions are in turmoil and every everybody's different yeah it's one of the things about Rory that's so unique like people have this idea of him and then he did my podcast and one of the things that people said like oh he's fucking normal like he's like a regular guy yeah he just when he's fighting he's really serious yeah but when you talk everybody like thought he was like this complete like total silent psycho yeah but then he's doing the podcast he's joking around he's self-deprecating he's super honest about like what and when you change too much no he breaks down yeah he can't do it anymore and I always like scheduled training differently he says fucking he's not like I'm some Superman I can't have stopped I'm never tired I'll fucking keep pushing there was none of that yet people always ask me about jail like what's that dude he said he's a totally normal guy his violent yeah he's funny he's engaging self-deprecating tear you know I talked about the Tito fight I was like you know he comes up to us and we're you know we were calling a fight after you'd already fought it and we're calling this fight I know how you doing goes well I'm a competency shot the bathrooms balling and now I'm good he's a funny dude he's a really funny guy when he choked out choke gun he said something to the effect of he goes he goes if you think I'm gonna sit here and listen to a middle-aged comedian probably what to do I just choked out a world champion you just wait for it you just whatever like when I interview him and by the way for people now it is for you interviews are if not the hardest part of our job The X Factor's in interviews because everybody asked me and this is kind of like a behind-the-scenes thing don't know whether or not we do an interview is a production call 100 cent we don't decide I don't decide personally whether or not somebody gets an interview when I was doing Bellator we have commercials so they have a commercial inventory we got to get to them if fights in quickly we get interviews if they don't we don't it doesn't matter who the fighter is and what they're doing but it's not my call they're geeked up on adrenaline they're like all over the place the producers in my ear going you know you have one or two questions however many I have I'm gonna have time for they can go off crazy you just don't know it's the most X Factor part of our job because it's off the format you're up there holding the mic and they could say whatever that you have no idea what they're saying what they're doing trying to keep them in one place yeah people don't realize that people go oh you guys are always touching the fighter if they start moving all the cameras move guys and it ruins the shot we're trying to keep them in one place and I put my hand on the guy what I'm trying to do or gal whatever I'm trying to keep them in one place so the two cameras get a shot of them because we kind of sense it together really work but when they have adrenaline they'll start spinning around or they're trying to address the crowd and they start turning around you're trying to keep them in one spot I one guy when the weirdest tweets I've ever gotten was sometimes you'll catch me on camera pointing at the ground and what I'm saying is stand right here come to me and stand right so that's where the camera shot is you know I'm not right and so every now and then you'll catch me doing that what I'm doing is yeah stand right here because my director you saw I was get mad because I would go to the fighter and would like ruin the shot right he wants them to come to them so it's Center we because it is so racist the way you point to your shoes that's what I swear to God he said like you point to your shoes when it's a black fighter and the last card had heavy black control it was crowd trouble crying lasting kid from fortune dude it was hell but like how demeaning that and you point to your shoes when it said what do you like explain to you how it to shot works it is hilarious where people get mad at me because why did that fighter get an interview and I'm like it it's literally a timing thing yeah you can't read that stall you can't that's about it I don't engage with anybody I don't have better shit to do you can't get upset at people that don't understand the format it's crazy you're legitimately upset know what I was doing not the fucking Jew yeah they really get they really really lose it over it's a small percentage you know there's a million people watching and you get one shitty tweet you really got to think about the number oh yeah yeah well the thing to me too is like when I when I left Bellator when I came out whatever was the 26th the response like kind of blew me away I mean I was hearing from people that I mean you know they knew who I was just you know everybody it was just it was a huge deal I couldn't believe it you know I didn't expect all the support I got and I really appreciate anybody listening I really really appreciate it when something like that happens you so first time I heard for me it was when I left bail for the first time yeah when Bjorn was you know being v1 and I left and you wrote me when may I keep your head up it's gonna be great I was like you don't know you're kind of cut off you have no idea but the support you get when you really need it's really amazing mmm well if you're a fan of the sport and you enjoy watching it you want a commentator who appreciates it and knows what he's talking about and is is entertaining like you take good paths you know when you describe things I like thank you you criticize referees if they make shitty calls you do the right thing you know you speak up for the people that are watching that's you know that's something that's so hard you have to do it yeah even if you love the referee even if you love the referee but a lot of things were like when I love this in Big John if you're listening I would love to hear an explanation this is one of the funniest moments I've ever had commentating was it was Marlon Sandro versus Frodo hospital live at 1:45 in Bellator and I forget who got a cup shot but somebody got a cup shot boom kick kick to the nuts and Big John walks up him and goes and he was Mike so I could hear it he goes that wasn't a bad shot I'm only giving you two minutes and I went I'm on air going I don't think he can do that it's either five minutes or he didn't get hit he has to keep fighting there's no but he went up to that wasn't bad and we'll give you two minutes and I went so I ma I have to explain that to an audience and go I as far as I know he can't do that it's either five or it's nothing when a referee does something like that you you I'm trying to explain to the audience what he might be thinking like that didn't look bad to me but here's what he's thinking yeah and then fighters and then a lot of people think you're defending the referee no I'm trying to think about what could possibly make him do that you have to ride that line yeah and go this is what he's thinking I disagree about that but I bring in geometry the good thing about the UFC is you bring in mark Ratner and Mark Ratner goes over the the actual law and or the rules rather and how it's set up the one of the things that's interesting we did a show in Detroit and I believe it was in Detroit and Michigan they make use of the replay but when they use the replay the fight is over Wow they make use of the instant replay but if they do have to go to the instant replay the fight is over for what for a no contest yeah is it for anything oh it's a no con but when would that even be useful well it's some sort of an injury or if someone claims that a shot was in an illegal area so to declare a no contest yeah that's the only way it could really work well the owner the only way they can go to once they go to a replay so if the referee makes his call and then they request some sort of a going to the instant replay the fight is over there's no fighting after the instant replay is played you know it's it's weird it's so funny when when when people asked me about you know why there's so many controversies in M&A in MMA I'm sorry combat sports is the only major sport boxing and MMA where the rules are kind of subjective the scoring is kind of subjective when a fight is over is kind of subjective there's just so much room for interpretation in every facet of our sport you know I want to fight when it referee stops a fight it's his judgment as to whether or not what intelligently defending yourself is the case you know the scoring 10 8 10 9 that's completely they make criteria but it's in the end effective striking an effective grappling is subjective you know and so and also the fouls when I was in Israel a guy took Jeremiah laviano took a groin shot and then shot the back of head in referee to point to different infractions a lot of referees won't do that you have to have at least two of the same infraction the ref took a point away he's allowed to do that so so much the sport is subjective that's why there are so many arguments about this sport is you know so many subjective elements in it you know that's why it's so important to have really good referees and sorry to find them they don't get any praise and they only get they get hate when they mess up yeah that's about don't get praise and they do the job well it's a it mean what you said is perfectly the the most locked solid is the rules that's the most locks out but the scoring is very subjective and what we're talking about the khabib fight the even though they were using the old system I mean the scorecards were crazy yeah I mean it could be was way ahead of him see if he could find it Jamie Kabhi was way way out in front that's something I do not miss doing is scoring scoring yeah I don't I don't think it's smart I do not I know they used to make you do that over it belt or I don't miss that at all I mean I'll mentally kind of score fight as I'm going along but yeah but the thing and what's so funny is people's reactions to it's not that I mind doing it it's that people you know Steve farha don't like I said I just finished talking to who does it for Strikeforce he's like oh yeah it's you can't make a scorecard that that everyone agrees with no we're on a 10-point must system mean ten or less and we have 30 25 30 25 and 30 24 for a three-round fight so clearly this is these are extraordinary scores so this is twenty four is ten eight in every round ten eight in every round say the other two were ten eight in the last two rounds yeah my guess I think it's right though I think thirty 24 is right 100% I was a mauling what I used to look forward before the rule change was complete dominance it's gotta be one-sided and there has to be moments where I go that this should be stopped there has and there were a couple of those moments in every round with within the coming fight we talked about a between rounds Dominick Cruz and I after this after the fourth round we or the second round rather we said do you think that it you know this is a good argument for stoppage right here that the corner could be really within their best judgment to say hey this is enough the people I was with turned to me and they said what do you tell your guy at this point I say show me something if you don't show me something first minute of this fight tal's going in you got you know you got tell your guy look you're getting handled here we got to start thinking about your health and your future if I don't see something in the first minute and I'm I'm calling as much yeah could you imagine if Edison landed a flying knee three minutes into the third round I mean if it did turn that fight around I mean it would have been one of the greatest comeback what she was capable doing he's a guy who could maybe throw that kind of thing it just didn't seem like it was gonna work on could be he just he was mauling him to an extent where he was draining his energy to the point where Edison would get up and he was trying to be mobile but you could see the wobble and a step he just wasn't steady he wasn't able to uncork and he was just under assault also silly under herself there's a difference between a guy who can knock you out and a guy who's naturally heavy-handed everything they throw was hard Barbosa is a knockout guy but it's essentially his accuracy he's very very precise with when he throws he's not heavy-handed enough to like necessarily Club you with a shot and knock you out he's not you know it's or his kicks ya know what kind of guy you have in a sense once again produced you a pit bull and belt or that do just heavy-handed you can hit anything that's gonna hurt you so if your guy is that kind of guy maybe he wins it lasts 30 seconds the last round but if you're a kicking guy who needs accuracy and timing and a guy's coming forward like Kabir was coming forward what do you don't have a ton of options you know I mean know what kind of guy you have you know yeah you are in a lot of ways well in a lot of ways it was it was a giant test for kabhi because we wanted to see what he looked like against one of the most elite strikers in the division but a lot of time off - yeah it also was a big test for Barbosa it's like because you're gonna have to use your hands here a lot and that's never been as strong strong suit has been his kicking well he didn't have a negate that he moved for the whole time yeah a federal cro cop Fedor step forward the entire time yeah knowing that cro cop needs an outside game for you just said the footwork traps and it's so difficult to move back constantly it's so much more exhausting constantly moving back and you know Barbosa was just getting chased Congress machen if that fight was in you know we have two cages we have the smaller cage they used for the Ultimate Fighter and then the bigger cage these four I kind of like the idea the smaller cage for everything I kind of think that you can move around a certain amount that big-ass cage let's get some more seats in this bitch put the little cage in here I mean no problem is I find some tiny cages they used to have some of those local shows real little ones like smaller than this room whenever I trained it was always never more than like two steps backward she hit the cage you just will you start hitting the fence you can get morning so whenever we train it was two steps left to stuff trying to save my dad second the day nearly limits a lot of your striking hundred percent yeah have you ever thought about like alternative venues like what would be a good alternative venue for everybody we talked about on the podcast with the fight companions all the time where I think like a football field or a basketball court I think like something will you fight in the center and you have plenty of room we never go outside of it and you do get out there like Lionheart and shit like that like an underground basement member they found a pool well if you want to know that we we show hand lands in the same arenas where they have basketball games right yeah we got all these dudes running around on this area but then when the fight takes place you know also we got to put up a cage how about you just like keep that same size area the guys stand in the center and you know there's warning track where people are waiting on the outside edges tell them to go back in but there's never a time we can press someone up against the cage try to get a takedown it just doesn't exist there's no cage so you don't have that extra thing that's in there that's a factor because that is the cage is a fact 100% it's a factor in your backward movement it's a factor in your ability to get back up it's also a factor in some people's ability to hold you in place and to defend against submissions right the cage can't roll into certain writings well if that wasn't there that would change a lot of what a wrestler can do inside the Octagon for sure it would either be awesome or absolutely terrible there's not a lot of middle ground yeah after I think to remember when Frank Shamrock tried to do something like that he had a thing called shoot box do you remember that yeah I do yeah yeah I know I saw it was like a shallow bowl and you would fight in the middle of Yama did that yeah so did Chuck Norrises world combat leave and they have kickboxing and that kind of a thing I'd like a little Raymond Dan was fun yeah be good I think Wonder Boy might have as well it's a piece yeah I think it did crazy yeah John way Barbara dude man in the sport 40:41 still smashing people dude unbelievable yeah yeah yeah Bellator kickboxing that's one thing that I really enjoyed that they did that they really focused on world-class kickboxing you know I mean guys like Joe shilling Raymond Daniels they have like some of the best people from the kickboxing world that came over we're competing for them and they're making a big deal out of it and just put on exciting stalkers baby he really loves kickboxing I know it does yeah yeah well didn't used to work for k1 yep there's this thing man yeah that's we started back in the day I think I got tickets for him from the Bellagio like way back in the day when Peter Aerts fought Stefan Leko oh oh such lumberjack man yeah man brutal yeah it was awesome I'm a big fan of kickboxing I like the fact that Bellator decided to engage with both of those things Kevin Ross Gaston Bolanos but I just wish they would have like a completely separate thing we make it a Bailey and they calling it Bellator too and people get confused in the Bellator that's kick Bach like Bellator kickboxing yeah what they do is it obviously they piggyback off the MMA shows it's already exists we shoot them together right so they just changed the ring to a coin to take they have it it lowers from the ceiling it's actually really cool if you ever since yeah so what happens is they start out when they start with the ring have the ring set up and all they have to do is change the the mat and they cheat they take out the ropes and then the ring I mean the cage comes from a ceiling they haven't suspended up there with the lights and it comes down and they play 2001 and they latch it in and then MMA starts do yeah that's pretty cool fine well you know what's interesting Bellator weather intention intentionally or not they nailed the correct shape for a platform in which our rings hits on yeah because the Bernard Hopkins fight when he fought Joe Smith jr. and he got knocked out and he went flying through the ropes and fell and hit his head I was like how was this not protect how do they not have that figure it out well the way to have figured it out would be to have more space on the outside of the ring yeah the idea that you could just fall right through the ring there's nothing there to catch you all you would need is an extra four or five feet that's what we have perfect it's perfect you guys okay I figured it out with that stuff to me they not them anymore pretty I know okay eventually they fucked up who's gonna take your spot I have no idea I really have no idea I've heard it I mean I have a couple theories but I don't know I'm not now when it goes over to the paramount network yes when does that happen now is this to look at this yeah see they lowered from the ceiling and they use a round one yeah we use a round K channel so it sits right in I like round two no need to have sharp edges but the Octagon it's like it is what it is it's a thing now it's a thing yeah rounds pretty dope though not bad man works pretty well um I'm sorry what'd you say who might you might replace me I don't know yeah no idea but have they ever thought about changing their name no they did years ago where years ago what were the options I don't know I think I think at one point they were thinking about using the network name so it'd be like spiked MMA but I don't know how far that winner and how many options they had I don't why not like HBO boxing yeah kind of like that yeah yeah it's biking I think that's the way to go yeah yeah the UFE well now let's sign work the paramount network in MMA which doesn't roll off the tongue exactly spike MMA sounds good yeah yeah paramount they were considering that well yeah the 18th I think they change over yeah yeah and then their first first belt or showing airs on the 20th two days after hmm no Spike TV MMA yeah why paramount network paramount come on you had spike for a long time I'm not the HBO boxing champion though right you know when they do bell that's true yeah that's true yeah that actually is a very good point like there should be some sort of a sanctioning body yeah I mean they tried that remember Whammer made or won the championship I was there was affliction yeah so what happened was they tried to make a belt that was independent of any particular promotion yeah meaning the wham a belt would move when that fighter went somewhere else yeah just the way MMA works that was never gonna fly but people like well why not I mean it does that boxing why not there's no good answer so well the answer is that the brands are much more protective this is Donald Trump that is Hi Larry was there Sylvia versus phaidor yeah that was the first way my belt right yep do that that's when Shinya Aoki wanted beating somebody and forget it who's got that Wow about know who's got that bitch some of you have to find out now like maybe we need to bring my on my back so whatever became of Fedor Emelianenko swam a belt anyway yes I do not know that's there's things that you wonder like a fighter's union like Earth maybe work you know a sanctioning body outside of the UFC it seems like the momentum is so strong in the fact of the UFC being the dominant organization it's like q-tips you know it's like that name like cotton swab yeah oh but there's the q-tips like the NFL can I have a facial tissue what bloody next come on bitch well alright so one of my pet peeves that I'll explain right now that falls in line right with that I hate with a passion I hate explaining to people what I do for a living really I fucking hate it when I was a builder why because you work for Bellator no because what happened was like I'm in a cab leaving your IAC's and they go and they go uh hey so what are you coming where you coming from oh you know Miami what you doing work what kind of work do you do I'm a commentator for mixed martial arts fights and you just get a blank stare they just have no idea what you're talking and then you go you know where they put people in a cage and they fight and then they go oh you know it's I got explained that MMA is a sport and belt I've had this conversation 50 times it's just your average once again if I say I need a cotton swab or I need to clean my ears with it you want I need a q-tip okay I got it don't rubs coming up with the XFL he's rebranding it Bri bringing it rich the XFL yeah he used to have the XFL yeah now he's coming back with the XFL again no Donald Trump it was uh Vince McMahon I'm kidding Vince McMahon yeah just joke around but it wasn't didn't John Donald Trump have something to do with the XFL he did right but now Vince McMahon's Vince McMahon except NFL return dream gets closer as WWE head Vince McMahon files to sell shares no he's character dude fund unbelievable jacked his fuck at 72 one of the jacked one of the camera guys in belter is a guy named Bubba Dean who worked ferb name yeah a great name he worked for Vince for like 20 years who's Vince's guy this guy's stories you guys come on son got all his teeth knocked out by Stone Cold Steve Austin while doing a shoot Vince did know the camera guy oh yes he's crazy stores doing stuff on him guy's teeth knocked down on stuff and all these crazy Vince stories it's nuts Vince's remember when Vince blew his quad out he jumped into the ring and slammed his muscle on the edge of the ring accidentally and just literally separated his fucking quad muscle from the bone and just sat there on his ass and kept going unbelievable I mean just that alone man selling it like that I mean he couldn't even walk dude and he's selling the whole thing we talked about behind the scenes about double you know what goes into it it's really incredible Jack - Jesus Christ he's so jacked that's the most Jack seven year old of all time overseen who's that fake Mark Coleman behind him does it dude get some the juice goes straight to Mexico that dude he's got wears a prosthetic face I think at that age it's like anti-aging it's legal anti-aging technology oh let's be honest he's on more than that oh yes quite a bit that's not normal stuff he's going deep fuck it you like Stallone you know if you're gonna do it go No why not I was tell everybody stolons my canary in a coal mine just watching TV when a pro about rising and you know they don't give that what do you say I don't give a fuck they don't you I think arises jig Gabby waited talk can't believe she's 26 pounds overweight please Japan yes if I could beg of you anything don't let Gabby go see you beat up anymore grandma's literally really think it's funny they grandma you know what no I'm sure this is something I've talked to people about a lot old school fans us for it now that prides gone you know pride forever and Brad never died a little pride pride had some matches that made you go what the fuck is going on here they love that shit love freezers for the Japanese audience so they would have got weight classes were suggestions they didn't test anybody they would throw anything you know experience level meant absolutely nothing and there was a member does your Matsui of course sure that guy they loved watching that guy get beat up he fought everybody's mashed loved watching does your math so he get his fucking face beaten and they will damn it's like I didn't like him they there's something in the cup they love that shit and I'll help you look you know pride head did have some great fights and also had some fights that were crazy ridiculous unbelievable mismatches yeah the weaknesses that mean what that their appreciation for a fighter struggle was if not yea if not more important than the fighter being victorious it's like the fighter being just being valiant in the face of overwhelming odds was almost more enjoyable to them I like Bushido more cuz they just didn't pull that in Bush you know they they featured the lighter guys and I don't remember and Bushido any any fights often oh my god this thing's I think you're right now that I remember like Bushido a bit more it was great they were all great that was when quad rose and was a Quadro sand goddesses were the commentators he was it was in the moral moral quadrants or more robust those you know why I to they only had one or two shots at it that one guy who was a he was like some sort of a radio sports guy what the fuck is his name Mad Dog or something like that god damn it he only did it once there was one guy for a pride yeah one guy who was the play-by-play guy with bas Rutten once he's fun it's like kind of silly guy but a little out of his element a little out of his element didn't didn't necessarily like we were talking about earlier like it's very difficult to find someone who's a play-by-play guy who is also a martial artist and also looking really really invested in the sport whereas a guy like you a color guy those geysers it's there's more chance that you're gonna have a technical understanding of the sport and also be able to be entertaining about it yeah whereas they just have to be entertaining about it and read the script they don't necessarily it so it's super hard to find a guy who's as knowledgeable as you but that isn't also a play-by-play guy I always say I always said Brian Stann should do it cuz Brian Stann yeah maybe by play and he could do either/or but it would be different because Brian Stann has in my opinion he has the voice and the personality and the delivery that like the strength in his like the way he formed sentences in an entertaining but powerful way like he could be a really good believable play-by-play guy yeah who's also super legit martial artist so you'd be like the only guy that's doing it that well the problem the problem with having a play-by-play guy who's too knowledgeable they start doing both of them sitting there and that's a problem the guy is like a freak fan or thinks they know about sport they start doing it they start doing color as they're doing but I think that's only as long as it's as long as everybody is aware like no one that one person talks too much and everybody kind of lets everybody go get in you know and and that you like one of the things that I like to do when we have DC or when we have Dominick Cruz or whoever sits next to me sometimes I like to ask them questions yeah I want to I want to go in I want to give them a position like do you what do you like to do here like how do you approach this like what's your thought process here or like for DC DC's amend Dominic was amazing to this weekend about breaking down clinch work and what someone's doing wrong or why this is stagnant position for them and well yeah you know like I think if you had a guy who is a play-by-play guy just as long as he knows as long as everybody's cool with everybody like everybody's flow you know like that I think but that is one of the things that came in really well with me and Goldy because we'd work together for so long since we knew how to slide things in we knew we knew when to talk and when you know and sometimes we just talked to over each other like some shit was happening and you know but that's okay too yeah you know I've gone through four for last year Wow year and a half I did a few different guys back in the day I do a few hey what the fuck cut that out the show yeah we can do that right cool um I worked with a few different guys back in the day but one of the guys that people forgot who was amazing was Bruce Beck Bruce Beck yep Bach I worked with him in boxing that PBC yeah he gave me really good advice for what you were talking about it's difficult post fight interviews you know he's just gave me advice and you know having things to say and planning things out and you know how to how to you know how to word things you know I didn't know what the fuck I was doing Matt Mitrione when when they hired him to do belter kickboxing we were in Turin Italy and Matt Mitrione I think it was a boost back actually at that time hmm he hadn't flown yet so Matt Mattoon is there by himself has never done color commentary before and all the kickboxing fighters are showing up I've already done MMA I wasn't in kickboxing time I take Matt and I go okay cool I'll walk you through this so I stayed and helped him interview all the kickboxing fighters and he's sitting areas like need some advice he'd never done this before and I said the only device that game was don't say anything my mom knows if my mom's watching boxing and something's punched in the face and turned mom I'll go but that guy just got punch in the face my mom will go yeah I know that I can I can see that my mom knows when someone's getting punched in the face my mom doesn't know how the footwork set that right hand up that's your job is not that guy just got punched don't look at that it's not it's not fucking radio they can see it okay so your job as the expert is to the things that a layman if someone not experienced in sport doesn't quite know like footwork accommodations stuff like that and I said stick to that I go just stick to filling in the gaps that your expertise will help fill in don't say oh you know you don't say everything in the world and when everybody talks everybody loses that's how you have to think about he knows when to talk and I don't talk we don't talk of each other everybody loses yeah if when we talk over each other the same time we both sound like crap so just no one you know you'll get a feel for when they lay out and when to go in but my number one advice was don't say anything that someone on the street could look at the TV and figure it out it wildlings can yell it at the TV why are you here we don't need an expert anybody could say that what do you feel in it made him feel way better and they look just feeling the stuff that your average person wouldn't know that's a very good game plan that's very wise very personal yeah use its power for good yeah yeah that's why we don't say what my mom you get caught up in and there's right-handers you know I have to call every they can see that now the hard part is the grappling people are a lot of people totally lost we have to call a lot with a feeling a lot more of that because you also sometimes want to react to certain punches that get landed - you just got to know when to when not to it's that develops me yeah just get a feeling for that no yeah it's a weird thing that you're thinking of it at least I am when I'm doing it also is like it's a product like you're contributing to a product you like you're adding to it with sound and with description and with the entertainment value of the way you distribute your words you know a good broadcaster knows they're not tuning in for us yeah we can make it better we certainly can we certainly can well definitely 100 percent you can also detract from a broadcast and got to be careful about detracting is the worst yeah I mean I think probably both been guilty of that at some oh yeah any moment is not your free-balling you know you're doing a live thing and you have to mean when you're anticipating things happening and they're happening or something's different than you thought was going to happen and you're trying to put the words to it correctly and in in the moment live on TV it doesn't always work out when I make a mistake man I'm mad me too fucking until the next show yeah but it may look something like nobody knows it I'm the one that that's mad at myself but that's why you're really good that's why you're really good I mean anybody who is really good at anything you get that way because fucking up on it just seems horrible you know just really messes with your head yeah any I've just come to accept that weird feeling you know and use it and go alright whatever that shit feeling is where I flubbed that word or forgot that guy's name or whatever it is and I'm conflated the two people whatever it is get over it keep moving just do your best and that feeling because the fact that it I can't just blow it off I can't just be like who gives a shit I don't have that in me right yeah I do so that's why I try and that's why with every broadcast when I get through it and it's good I'm like okay we did it you know I still get that I still get that juice man I still every it's funny I'm known for disappearing after a show I'm known for that for like the show's done and everybody I don't drink so I'm out of that loop completely but what about your heroin use you know that's a home thing I'm gonna bring it on a plane brookie anyway so so anyway I'm known for disappearing after show because a show just takes a lot out of me like everybody else let I have to borrow doing labyrinth I go to my room and I I just download you don't focus starving after shows or that yeah and the problem is that a lot of times it's you know when I'm out in in in Vacaville or something or I'm out in like a vein Kansas and you're at a smokey casino and there's one place to eat a fight just let out and like you know it's like a real decision I have to make a lot of times am I too hungry to sleep or am I too tired to eat which one of those am i sleep I almost you sleep almost always you sleep well yeah I just disappear I just go to my job cuz it's hard it just takes a lot out of you I bring stuff with me anyway I always bring protein bars I bring canned oysters I bring different things that I can eat that I know are healthy I bring like a bunch of cans of canned oysters because it's like they're soaked in olive oil for healthy bang a few cans those out go to sleep what is your family time what's that what is your family oh gosh dowdy mostly Italian a little bit of Irish all my friends Greek my mom's Creek okay cool rest your German Irish yeah all of those big part of olive oil is the shit that is one of the best fucking things your body could take in olive oil it's fantastic and what a pain the dick it is to make think about all the stuff they had to go through like when you see and I had olive tree in my yard and the olives have fall down his nasty little fuck yeah like I thought it all of came from a tree like an olive well you just pick it like one of those green ones no I grew up in San Joaquin Valley they had the whole thing set up there man totally nine years old yeah love ya buddy mind makes olive oil in his yard he's got a shit ton of olive trees in his yard and he he set this whole thing up with the hopes of eventually making his own olive oil from his from his own yard okay good luck dude you sure it's much easier to pour the diet grown-up mom cooks a lot man it's phenomenal for you man you know it's funny my my mom had had cooked for the belter crew before really come over house and she cooked for like the whole crew 25 people goddamn my mom she's like a caterer all she loves that shit Wow she loves that shit anyway so literally you know I I had my my I left Bellator and literally one of the people went your mom your mom will still cook like we want mom in the divorce and I was like okay cool my mom's okay with that mom loves everything bell talker and they love my mother so it was kind of funny she had him all over for dinner and so I hope they were really really upset about my mom I hope Bellator makes it and I say that with all due sense to me to 90% now that we're both yeah yeah it's like I was before like maybe they're in competition with UFC the corporate entity but my in my opinion it's not it was never that they were in competition with me my thoughts are that they're valuable that it's important and that the more competition you have the better and then I also felt like having a guy like you out there who's doing commentary is kicking ass makes me better I know that you're really good at it I would listen to you very sharp I listen to people and I'm sure you're the same way that they're uncomfortable or clunky doing commentary it it's it's makes for an awkward experience when you're watching it yeah but we listen to it a lot I mean I really listen with that ear because that's our job sure you know you really listen with that ear and and you know you're probably overly critical we are at least listening to but to our peers and and yeah I do the same thing I'm like bad commentary can really hide just kind of if you get good like a producer can hear things where you go I don't even you're that sure something's a little off and just bugs yeah it's just clunky you know especially for someone who's called and seen as many fights as you have your idea of what's clunky is like you're the date at chunking that you're doing that is very different it's very much more high-level than the average person it's just not a lot of people doing it with ten years man ya know wasn't when I was in art no I was doing and one before that who was an affliction to those were both before but was Jason Chambers the first Bellator the first year he was the belt organ when it was on ESPN Deportes and it was just a web series in English so she could just sit on the website in English it was an ik and Jason jammers holy shit that's crazy Jason and lived weirdly parallel laps yeah you guys both have that show we all travel we fought each other he was my last professional fight he was a guy built or before I was there it's great yeah it's really weird yeah really strange yeah he was you were on what shows I was on fine yeah so funny story when I first got the call about my quest they said so to go back a little bit further I fought Jason in my last pro fight and and remember Jimmy Walsh just trained me yeah used to be my personal trainer yeah she taught me about kettlebells that crazy and crazy he's one of John's jocks black belted I mean yeah yeah great grapple grapple against him twice anyway so I was gonna fight Jason at his promotion called Pangea and he told me all about this show he was going on he's a man if you beat this guy man he's gonna be bad be great for you and I was like he described to showed me travel around and you do different martial arts like man that's what sighs it's a great idea and then I beat Jason with a reverse heel hook and you know how dangerous those are and Jason really held out and and it tore pretty good and anyway a couple days later I get a call from I forget who and they said and they said yeah this that they're doing the show and they you know give this producer call in New York okay I called the producer and she described the show and she described the exact same show and I went oh fuck I heard him and they're looking for a replacement and there's an unwritten rule in MMA that you can beat somebody every new whatever you don't take food out of somebody else's mouth you don't want to hurt somebody they can't fight for a year it sucks you don't you know I mean like Google fight but when it's over it's over you don't want to like injure somebody to where they can't make a living that was awesome day when the hooks were like sort of shunned and jujitsu a little bit yeah MMA fight I know but I mean yeah but that's what I use and I thought I injured him and they were looking for a replacement I just like deep impact Armageddon thing yeah exactly 100% and so then I found out that I realize they're on different shows and it was so funny because people have said since then that I was chosen because it'd be Jason they know that's their assumption which makes sense but they had no idea the producers of the show once I got the gig we're talking this is yeah is not show on History Channel I went yeah I fought that guy and they looked at me they went what did yeah I fought him like a month ago mmm they literally I'm serious had no fucking clue they had no idea it's just so weird they both came out exactly the same time what you think they ran a few months before me been one of those shows since there hasn't been one before it's like it's like what kind of weird shit Hannigan's were going on but I was the root I didn't produce a thing so I don't I don't know where it came from I have no idea but it wasn't I didn't go hey but it's just weird to me that those shows become interesting and popular and then they stop being it's like someone tries it out and they go this is it and the two companies are willing to invest in two different channels are showing it Murr this this is this is a way back one in one summary was the abyss Deep Space Nine and Leviathan where all these like underwater horror movies that came on the same summer yeah and then you know we're seeing with the asteroid movies deep deep impact and oh my good Armageddon both of them came out exact at the same time that was weird it was really strange yes fucking Hollywood's bizarre like that it is to find out like would it you know yeah I almost don't want to know I don't want to know what you know weird shenanigans we're all three fuck heads are coming up with underwater yeah yeah what's going on I have no I it's like they find out that someone's doing it so they get ahead on on they try to release it first and there were two Battle of sexes movies a Will Ferrell was supposed to play Bobby Riggs in a battle of the sexes tennis movie what in this town was doing the other one yeah then they found out Steve Carell was doing one and they canned it that match happened in like nineteen in the 70s that was a Jean King Billie Jean King wow that's crazy oh yeah anyway but but 40 years later they make a movie and two studios I'll do at the same time it's we're in both with comedians yeah it was really weird well Bobby Riggs was that guy yeah Steve Carell so goddamn good he just knocked his awesome Park he was great playing that fucking creepy DuPont guy - did Johnny DuPont yeah Fox guy I remember when Dave Schultz got killed would you deal that was but it was just he was so creepy playing I'm in the movie it's like you bought it you bought that he's nailed your guy wrestling with the department chin them and shit and they just like letting them do it weird weird weird weird have you seen the documentary about it it shows all the real footage and everything I've seen I've seen some of the real footage but I don't think I saw the documentary there's one thirty thirty to one and then there's one on Netflix and I've seen both of them one is like more focused on Mark Schultz the other one is the other story and it's once again is fuckin creepy really out there yeah wrestlers just had no outlet to make money back then and this billionaire says I'll put you up and make this amazing team that wrestling never had a real actual professional not there's anything wrong with Pro Wrestling yeah the Pro Wrestling obviously is a show there's never been like you think about like how many people love wrestling how many wrestling fans there are how many people wrestle in high school and college like and how many people like to watch it in the Olympics it was always a big deal like why didn't they ever figure out a way to make some sort of professional venue out of it never they did a real pro wrestling yeah they tried that and and you know it's funny I died I used to teach I should be teaching what I did before I was fun way to teach the longest I ever taught was I worked for long beach in high school kid school district I need a bunch of stuff for them so sometimes I would teach sometimes I do this testing stuff the longest ever thought was seventh-grade math which if there is a hell Algebra I only talk that what happened was my mom's a teacher and the girl the lady two rooms down from her got sick or had some kind of breakdown and mom went can you please come in and teach for a year and I went okay Kobe's made it easier on her I flying so I end up teaching so what you have to have a degree and okay and I had both of those so you'd already plan on teaching or you had it as a possible side game yeah psyche it was it was always what I was doing kind of while I was fighting but anyway I had a teacher tell me one time he said if there's a sign at the zoo that says please don't throw tangerines at the elephants it may not make any sense to you all it means is one time somebody threw a tangerine and an elephant something really bad happened and I thought about that a lot when when whenever you think about you know Hawaiians poor us and caressing well there was a time when it was real and I was too boring so they started scripting the endings to it and so it became pro wrestling you know they it was there were catch wrestling matches and they lasted three hours it was you know I was like the old Gracie fights they just lasted too long you know guys couldn't catch each other and so they started scripting innings real pro wrestling was an effort to make it work and if it had made money it'd still be around you know so it sucks and I wish wrestlers even had more of an outlet than MMA and resting itself has gotten bigger in terms of I went to my old high school to watch a duel meet and back when I was there we had like one varsity team like half a navy team they had varsity JV fresh off on a woman's team woman's team you could at full women's team you know whatever I'm fourteen weight classes all right now and we couldn't get anywhere near that while I was in school like it just wasn't that popular now MMA has made it huge like wrestling now I mean people really follow up you got to be a real geek to follow college wrestling you know well when you slam it off smash Edson Barboza using essentially just wrestling yeah and vicious ground-and-pound you realize like okay like that is so fucking important you have it is the cornerstone or it's rather the foundation of MMA yeah it forgot like and I think that fight really highlighted crushed really really showed like the dominant super dominant wrestler over the dominant striker if the Donna wrestler can get a hold of domina striker the the less the strikers close like that's one of the things that was most impressive about Mirko was that when merkel started fighting for pride his takedown defense got really good really quick yeah you know I mean he fought some fucking tough guys but figured out a way to keep the fight standing a lot what I liked about him so much when you watch him is not only was this southpaw he was so good with the range of his footwork that he never he never lost his distance while throwing he was always really good at picking you apart from long range so you were shooting from outside you were shooting from way far back he could see it coming his footwork setup his takedown defense so well yeah it was amazing yeah he also was very powerful so his explosion was a big part of his fight style when he was a kickboxer so unlike maybe Peter Aerts or nesto hust who had more of a like methodical technical style of striking crow cop would throw those 1 big shots all the time yeah and that really works well in MMA and he was able to use that explosion that fucking left high kick and the one to the body that he hit Heath Herring with you member shot collapsed him well you see he herrings body just wrapped around Crowe cops leg yeah whoa herrings taking it the worst now the thing to me is when you watch what I tell people I said when you watch Chuck Liddell's three fights against Randy the third one against Randy Randy is just shook by that power he's felt it before and that kind of you know bull in a china shop Greco style to get inside it's not there he's just thinking about that power shot the whole time and that's what a power striker does against a wrestler he gives you that kind of barrier of to take me down you got to get through here yeah and here is fucking dangerous and I think Kabhi what he knew is long range is dangerous against Edinson so if I keep moving forward like you're putting pressure on him and take away that spinning range he's not gonna knock now with his hands and that's why he was pushing forward so incredibly hard as he didn't worry about that second wall it really didn't concern him yeah and Chuck would make you fight him because Chuck was a very good wrestler himself the thing that made chuck so unique is that Chuck was a striker you know hackle Minh trained Kempo karate all that stuff in a lot of in a traditional sense but also have very good boxing skills and serious fucking power in his hands and kicks yeah but he also knew how to wrestle so good luck taking him down so now you're forced to stand up with this long powerful striker who has an iron chin and just had this psychotic desire to move forward and land bombs yeah he also did slow yeah yeah yeah he was and that's where Hawkins place is still up there luis obispo he was something and interesting because he was one of the very first wrestlers that was a feared striker yeah so he had the wrestling skills great date on defense very good at getting back up off the ground when you hit him when he when he got down to the ground but also destroyer on his feet yeah so that's the gunner guy that we need gonna need to test khabib gonna need a guy who can keep the fight standing who can test khabib on the feet some guy who's gonna be able to stuff some of those takedowns those guys don't come around often well not with him when you see what he did to RDA he ragdoll dos Anjos which is crate I mean I do not know there's a timeline of dos Anjos dominance right it's that strong seven yeah yes is a strong seventy but this was a different time yes no son just training and I think dos Anjos made some giant leaps when he started doing strength conditioning with Nick curse on yeah he started doing it just had way more output inside the cage and but the crazy thing was that dos Anjos is one of the best grapplers in division yeah and you see what he was able to do with Neil Magny leg kicks Neil Magny gets to the ground smush ISM you know I mean his fucking ground game is really legit so to see him get ragdoll by Habib you like how is he doing that to RDA you know it's nuts at 55 yeah yeah he's something special so it's like who is left at 55 especially now that dos Anjos has moved on successfully to 170 who the fuck is left that's gonna be able to keep the fight standing you know that's the tough part I don't think there are many answers I really got to put put together the first and fight pretty quickly not I mean that's it's a big fight that's that's the fight that's the fight the question is is going to be for the title is it gonna be Ferguson and Conor get stripped and Ferguson and could be fight for the undisputed title because they'll just make Ferguson the undisputed champion if Connor gets stripped which I don't think is a bad thing no look Connor still fucking Connor if Connor comes back a year from now huge he's still carnage doesn't matter he's still fighting probably for the title right away everybody's gonna want it everybody's gonna want the pay-per-view money that comes with it hop on board but Tony versus khabib it's very interesting yeah very interesting could be was the guy you have to get his respect yeah I don't have a reason Tony knows how to fight off his back very yeah very dangerous off his back not just get dangerous off his back in terms of submissions but very good defensively off his back you know he's he's got really good composure very good wrestlers chokes are fuckin nasty man he catches chokes from weird angles you know it was good at sweeping you he's he's legit he's legit champ but that's the fight yep I mean that's anything else is it fans of me comfortabe yeah it's just what do you do though like what do and how do you do it do you strip Connor that's how was the question cuz if Connor is like fuck it I want to fight Tony in Dublin she decides to if he decides to come back and fight Tony and then the winner fights could be even Russia the world explodes I'll be huge I'll be the biggest be fantastic the winner fights khabib in Russia for the undisputed title you ever call in Russia no but could be was gonna ride a bear out to the cage gangster man put a cage really it's a mobbed up place is it that's fun there yeah how many times you think for Bellator no when I was with m1 that's right yeah yeah that's right st. Petersburg and then I did did you enjoy no man had a great time yeah yeah how's the food over there Foods good I don't like the way he's had good we're on the ship in the neva river and it's owned by one of the guys who runs m1 and yeah so we're on the ship in the neva river and it's got a restaurant on it and we're sitting there in shock we like mobile Brassica broadcast partner is very persnickety about his food he's person taking about a lot of stuff and we're sitting there with our boss and everything and the guy who runs this ship of this big heavy in st. Petersburg who's affiliate with m1 serves us this borscht which is like you know beat students to basically and he goes man we're really proud of our borscht it's a big deal here and oh we hope you enjoy it it's it's a point of honour for us and he walks away and Wheelock looks at the bowl and goes I'm not eating this I don't like it and our boss goes you will like a seven-year-old and he's like no I'm not eat like folding his arms like I money no way no I eat so fast people white people I eat so fast that I already ate I like borscht so I just used a tit and I set my thing I'm a guy who was all proud of his boorish turns around is heading back to us in my boss looks at me because points to Shawn's food and I grabbed it and I drank an entire bowl of that shit and threw it down before the guy came back and he saw the baby oh thank you so much Shawn which is refusing to touch it persnickety is a nice word I like how you use that it's very selective amount but it's a nice way like nobody can get mad it wasn't like he was like persnickety yeah you're not saying they're a complaining bitch no oh I know there's been some talk about doing a UFC in Russia and I think a lot of it is probably based on the idea that could be at 25 and oh is most likely somewhere along the line I'm gonna fight for the title I mean if everything continues to go well as long as there's no injuries or something yeah especially now that he can make the weight like he made the way pretty easy yeah it didn't look bad not at all that would be huge fight fucking you have enough Russian talent that you know oh you know oh just from Dagestan alone you could fill the whole roster yeah Dagestan vs. the world you really could you almost could win a fighter in Bellator Shaba watch normal life and it can shot like five times in Dagestan he's illiterate he left leaked he went after some gangster with a gun or something in a club and crazy tough world we're so soft over here Sean Wheelock need to go camp it over there for a little while dude like you know the wrestlers in Chechnya are amazing sites you brothers and the greatest ever well fuck man if you grow up in Chechen it's like either be a stand-up wrestler or I don't know pick up a gun and you know be a gangster they you know dudes amazing yeah it's interesting to see a guy from that really hard part of the world coming over and just dominating in MMA you know with khabib you know that a lot of his technique a lot of is being trained by his father a lot of it is iron sharpens iron he's at aka he's wrestling with big giant guys that are really skillful all the times of amazing roster over there but a lot of it is this fucking mental toughness that he must have picked up some of that from being in Dagestan yeah this has to it's true I mean the Russian fighters that I have Excel twig you could know them and call it Tom fights with them and they'll still come with me like they want to fight you or something you know I know that hey how's it going then they kind of like break character there's always wall you got to get through almost every time you know one of those great fighters on that course scoff guy that guy's a fucking monster that guy's a beast that was one of the most impressive Lima fights - you put that guy to sleep I was like whoa yeah but he was late kicks that set it up he was kicking the shit out of that leg and he I think course Goff went like I got a trade now I gotta get this guy out of here you know it's not gonna work in the courts cough in my opinion in a lot of ways was when the first guys to validate belt or 170 pound division from the performance he put against Henderson like he shot Henderson down and teed off on him teed off on him and let him know like this is I'm a real welterweight then NUMA made him look like maybe he's not like maybe Leamas that's a real welterweight he's a lot bigger he looked bigger yeah way bigger yeah and then you know it's one thing where that was a that was there was a big disparity between what people within the organization and people how did the organization thought cuz a lot of people thought Henderson was gonna come in and clean house and have two belts and but there's one jinx eye that I have seen more than any other if you're listening fighters this is - you don't talk about two belts before you have one belt have you never out dude am I wrong Freddie Vera was training Vera I'm gonna be a two belt champion he didn't win one belt Benson Henderson talked about winning two billion and when one belt yeah you know talking about two belts before you've won one belt is a huge jinx don't ever do well but I never seen it be guys seen it a couple of times Benson's never worked out when he left the UFC he was you know one of the best guys in the division my own three and it's just this 170 pound weight loss was just not right for him with a big guy like chorus cough yeah you know and it would have been more prominent if it was against Lima did you see like their way in yeah I went different like you know it's where we think about of a guys troublemaking 55 well he's a 70 right he's not there's this needs there's a huge like a big 50 fiber and a natural 70 they are not in the same class and course cough look like a giant compared well the difference is limas just not gonna fucking make 55 it's just not not in his DNA if you can make the weight yeah make the way make the way yeah yeah it's boy it's one of the most unfortunate parts of the sport isn't tough then you shouldn't be there almost like if you could make it easily you know it's tough man as long as it doesn't drain you because everybody's different - right in their response to dehydration but Andy foster what he's done in California by instituting a bunch of new weight classes I really hope that people follow suit I really do I really hope there's one every ten pounds I just think giving people more options is gonna there's some fighters that are just on the cusp or it's just dangerous you know and then maybe if they fought like dos Anjos goes up to 70 that's up but that's up 55 to 70 15 pound jump that's a lot of weight man yeah fifty percent more than if it was just ten and I think ten is the move I feel like 10 every 10 you're not watering it down too much you're making it reasonable just bang everything down to fives 55 65 75 85 probably 95 205 225 heavy weight so we were having a discussion with this once again boxing I was talking to Steve far hood and I said when they initially initially weren't that many weight class in box and they ended up adding a bunch of them I said when they initially added those were they seen as secondary weight classes anyone yeah yeah yeah for years you know until you know 155 got any respect it was considered people who couldn't hang it welterweight how about cruiserweight yeah crews would never got reduced only field never gets worse when a whole field fought Dwight Muhammad Cowie there was the first time anybody gave a fuck about cruiserweight yep and who else was cruiserweight like who the fuck else was there white Muhammad Cowie cruiser saw it was sad Moscow was um who else Michael Moore didn't you stop at cruiserweight I think I went from light heavyweight to anyway I think he did - he did he didn't stop to it I've just been one of those weird weight classes like why not her in prior fucking monstrous fighter but he fought at 40 right and just right other than the Alexis argüello fight there weren't many stars at 40 you got to go to 47 to get paid there's a reason you know I'm every talk about all Floyd can't knock anybody out boy it's like a fucking 35 he's really a lightweight if you've ever met him he's not a big dude right he had to go 247 to get the big money fights me that's why you know Roberto durán went from 35 to 47 because he just couldn't make money 35 guys get tired of making the weight class but they also they realize like you got to chase the cash or the money you have a certain amount of time my partner's Crawford moving up yeah yeah that's the problems it's very hard in MMA or any common sport 47s Khan your limit below 47 that I've had some great fighters it's hard to build an interest below 47 or 45 an MMA boxing's had the same problem yeah so what happens people keep coming up so if you added a bunch of weight classes guys who wanted at 160 for a while would be seen as all the guys who couldn't make it at 55 so it would take a while maybe a star in that division before it would become a a legit division that would probably be a lack of a few years when you go all the 180 pound champ is just a guy who couldn't do it at 70 it's almost like there's too many fighters now and too many events it's almost like you couldn't have enough UFC events you would literally have to have UFC fights every week yeah like maybe that would be the future model where they have fights every week on television and then they have pay-per-views like rarely like every four weeks or something like that it would take a lot to fill up or six weeks four or five extra divisions that'd be tough yeah you know it's hard to fill up the ones you have depending on how you look at it yeah it would be but I mean man I don't know I mean I never get tired of watching fights if they had fights on every week I wouldn't be complaining it's just I wonder whether or not it's sustainable yeah I wonder what that's not it that's the hard part that's always been the hard part so I went to see something that isn't Nowitzki Zahn tomorrow right Jeff Novitzky from you formerly of you Sodom yes now working for the UFC took me to the UFC performance Institute this week holy fucking shit man that place is insane I don't know how much money they spend on that but it's just like this is like some science lab for for training fighters I mean everything you could imagine they have in this giant ass bill all right every fighter on the roster can go there anytime they want and they have they feed them they take care of them in the cafe they make them healthy food though they have all these different things that monitor your body composition your hydration levels all these different modalities for healing and recovery everything you fucking name it they have it is super impressive super impressive they have all these video systems that around the Octagon constantly with their monitoring sparring from like a bunch of different angles they can give 3d video of it they can rotate it while they watch you spar from any angle your coaches could point out little weird things that you might be doing that you're not aware of but pointed out they always have the angle they get every single angle it's amazing they have a thing there that like these punch registers you know yeah like the video game except much more scientific yeah here's little trivia you know I was told is the number one pound-for-pound puncher Francis and Gahan oh by weight class no by weight class my weight class by weight class like who's the number one for pound Justin gaijin that's what I was told damn yeah that's impressive Forrest Griffin told mine I wonder how many people punched it though I don't know this this is this is what I was told by my Forrest Griffin well he's hard as fuck there's no doubt about it yeah I mean God oh just anybody period blew it out of the water by some insane amount of thousands of pounds of square inch they said he's been Drago shy whenever he hits he destroys bra he's they said he's like getting hit by an escort like a Ford Escort that's what it's like yeah I thought of a totally different escort for a second yeah there's they got a video of it of him hitting this thing that's uh Duncan French boom so they have him do this thing and they had this this limit before or this record before that actually I think was set by his Tyrone Spong no surprise there yeah he's a interesting fucking character Francis in Ghana you want to talk about a guy that is literally right out of an author's pen really you're gonna have a guy who you know like Robert E Howard when he used to write the Conan books yeah like he used to work in a sand mine he was to dig sand when he was a young man like him ouch fucking hard work it is digging in the sand every day and carrying it away I'm just getting strong and stronger it's literally like when construction the freaking mill yeah and then he was homeless five years ago moves to Paris wants to try boxing someone sees him in a gym and goes hey you should be an MMA he's like okay so he goes into MMA goes to the UFC in two years he's fighting for the title and he's a big favorite over the champion who is if the champion wins breaks the longest-running title fight streak winning title fights in the heavyweight division which is only two it's a great story it's amazing story five years ago homeless that's that's nuts yeah it's like you know Henry Armstrong great was working on a railroad newspaper article about a guy winning a fight and said fuck this railroad shit and went and started boxing came one the greatest of all time yeah or when Jack Johnson first became the heavyweight champion I mean everybody kind of knew you know you saw Jack Johnson like oh my god these guys are fuck yeah it's all downhill from here yeah yeah him versus DePace very very interesting and I'm just I want to see if Steve bate could figure out a way to avoid the big shots close the distance get a hold of him and if he can take him to the ground here's my advice for anybody calling that fight you included I would look at everything but power in terms of who's got the better footwork who's moving the heddle a bit more it was a lot more defense cuz man that's gonna be I think tell the story is when avoids getting hit and because they're both they can both knock you the fuck out did they both search and to knock you the fuck out but Francis doesn't in the weirder way he doesn't know like superhuman way were you like we see the angle of his punches it's like he's trying to rip your soul out of your body man the options a left hook uppercut combination punch that that shovel hook was just one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen anybody get hit with in all my years of crawling sports look like a PEZ dispenser you know head all the way photos so crazy it's almost like like a really bad action movie where the guy who's like the guy was rising through the ranks just blasting everybody in the orbit you you go to snoop even talks like those people it's crazy yeah every now and then you get a story like that it seems like it's like Adam like Justin ran that then your story is just ridiculous yeah no he's amazing you know the the other thing that about and is the way he trash-talks is hilarious like steep a said he's not tim dated by any man and francis girls don't lies deeper don't lie he's so calm with it and it's so fucking terrifying he was doing a press conference with Alistair it was like Thursday before Saturday's fight they're facing off we weren't wearing their suits and Francis goes Saturday night you go to sleep Saturday night your sleep that trash-talkin bothers me he's so confident about it too and he was right well but like Roy's like that like yeah well yeah and I will take your health yeah yeah and I'm holding the mic like who okay I want to hurt him so bad that he goes to the hospital never wants to fight me again oh and you go oh Dave he's not yeah that's shit either shit and you know they're just trying to put up a bluff yeah like there's some even great fighters have said some shitty night have believed at the time like when BJ was saying to George st. Pierre George we're gonna fight to the death and I'm serious George I'm gonna try to kill you remember that yeah I remember it well yeah that but it didn't work out that did not work out that way at all yeah he might have believed it when he was saying it but man when you're in that dark dark moment big ass french-canadian dropping knuckle Tiffany oh man yeah that was another one where you're like there's a big give scene a big 55 you know because he put it on him that night well he was so fucking strong and George was in his prime back then and he also was a really good guy and he was very motivated by BJ's talking shit to him and really pissed him off cuz he's a nice guy yeah I mean the best way to fight a guy like George is like be respectful if he's gonna kick your ass gonna kick your ass anyway yeah it's nothing extra ass whuppin motivation I think he had a little extra ass welcome to motivation for Bisping though I really do Bisping talks so much Jay to him that when he got his back put it on auto man how did on him put it on him standing up too much just starting to wear down to just my thought man maybe the tights are cuz you don't piss being his whole thing is he's not a particularly hard punchers wrestling isn't great it's he wears you the fuck down absolutely 180 fiber no it's just he wears you the fuck down he's also particularly effective off of his back with me was I was impressed with the cut George up with those elbows off his back that made it a real problem because George is having a hard time see him and that blood was everywhere you know what a good fight its I kind of liked the story if George just retires it doesn't bother me yeah I like it I like it he bucked it he bucked the everybody who doubted him came back won won by finished like yeah take it easy now I'm out say no no I'm seriously yeah no really this time minute yeah or it comes back in a year in 155 but Whittaker Whittaker Rocco yeah I like that a lot I like that fight a lot that's a dangerous ass fight for both guys you ever chain woodchuck I know dude he was one of the first guys and I was a blue belt he came by and he was getting ready for Pan Am's and this is Beckett when he was like when he beat hozier world broke his arm still won yeah that was insane yeah would not town wouldn't add Rosie down they change the rules after that you know that really yeah because jacory literally stuck his for people who are listening and don't know about it Holger Gracie broke jockey raised arm in the absolute division in the world's 2005-2006 2004 run their mid 2000 sad it snapped it good but jock Larry gets out like so he breaks it but he steps over the head and gets out Jacare stands up and hold your looks at the referee and goes I broke his arm and Jacare takes his broken arm stuffs it in his belt and wins the match cuz he was already a head he just kind of like yeah you know stalled out for like two minutes and won the fucking match against the greatest of all time with a broken arm so I trained with that boy he was like in beast mode it was unbelievable it's like being in a washing machine he's the only way I can describe it because once he grabs you it's like you're you just flings you in like a head you see your feet flying to the ceiling it's crazy now there it is man yeah I remember this man I remember it he just snapped that arm pulls it out and it is look at his left arm it is just just jacked done yeah and he went out of bounds right and then he gets up and hold her at some point I think right that tells the referees aren't broken but that's it and Jocketty stuffs his broken arm in his in his belt and she's fine which is beastly on he did a seminar at our place and at the end he fought everybody in the room there like 60 people there Wow and he fought everybody attempt everybody else yeah in his prime in particularly -
