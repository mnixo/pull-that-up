haha hello freak bitches so let's talk about this rematch which one Nate Diaz and Connery what are they fighting at 55 I do not know I don't think that's been solidified I believe that Conor has asked for it to take place at 70 which is where he was so he can say like I can do this exactly the same way and then it won't be a factor you know but also I think he was really healthy at 170 I think he like was Connor I think he felt great leading up to the camp and leading up to the fight he just had a bad game plan and his ground game kind of got exposed to weight classes above where he wanted weight classes it's not true first of all they both weighed in almost exactly the same no two weight classes above where he won his title yes but not really all it is is they're not cutting weight it's two but he's not a whitey I'm coming with right but he's not fighting like Demian Maia who used to fight at 205 or 185 and he's cutting back this is not idle shot at least not title shots where it's like you don't deserve a title shoutout to weight classes above you it's just a Nate Diaz fight well this isn't a title shot like I'm saying at least it's right well you know the whole story behind it there was a fallout Hafele dos Anjos is the lightweight champion was supposed to be fighting Conor McGregor he breaks his foot 11 days before the fight Nate Diaz takes the fight on a drop of a hat with no training whatsoever yeah I mean fucking none hadn't done anything he was at the store yeah he was hanging hanging out and Nate you know posted pictures afterwards of him drinking tequila and hanging out in Mexico you can talk coach it so he was just having I bitch he's just living his life right but he's in such good shape that he can get away with that because he does so much triathlon training he's constantly biking and swimming and running he's entered into a bunch of triathlons he's in very good shape and so he was able to pull it off because his cardio base was so good and just he's a fucking damn good fighter he's a damn good fighter and inside-out too and he's fought legitimately at 170 twice he lost he lost a stun-gun Kim and he also lost to Rory MacDonald at 170 these are legitimate 170s and Rory being one of the best as well yeah okay he got ragdoll a little bit by Rory but you know that was a wake-up call for him he went back to 155 and at 155 in his last fight against Michael Johnson he put on probably the best performance up to the Conor McGregor if I the best performance of his career he was funny I was when I do Nate Diaz I view I think of him as a 55 er he that's what he usually competes at but for this fight like you didn't want to have to cut weight only 11 days out it's a little heavy so he says look let's make it 170 they both agree Nate weighed 169 Connor weighed 168 or maybe vice versa I think that's it though so I mean they're basically the same size well will they fight that one well they fought it 170 what do you mean I mean when Nate said I'll fight it what's up where was he walking at probably a little heavier than that he probably died it and worked out real hard for seven or eight days of the 11 I'm Connor the last couple know Connor didn't have to cut anything I mean if you cut anything probably a couple pounds so which is not tied downstairs it's a knot not a biggest if that happens to somebody but there's not even ten pounds different so the same weight like when they got into the Octagon I guarantee you they're within a pound or two of each other in the Octagon okay okay but Nate is longer and taller and he's a very good boxer like Nate's bars on a regular basis with Andre Ward who was one of the best pound-for-pound if not the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world now the Floyd Mayweather's quote-unquote retired yeah Andre Ward is a motherfucker and he just fought this Saturday night on HBO and I just watched it the other day on DVR it's fucking amazing he's so good dude he's such a he's just nasty and he's not fighting at 175 he's gonna fight sergej Sergey Kovalev who's like the best 175 or in the world so he fall so nate spars with that guy that day on a regular basis like they're friends and you know Nate also spars his brother Nick who's one of the best strikers in the UFC definitely one the best boxers you know he's a very good boxer and and he also spars with Joe Schilling all the time who is glory world champion kickboxing world champ and he's a motherfucker man so Nate is sparring with like high-level world class strikers like legitimate Andre Ward Joe schelling two world champions and two respective disciplines so he's he's a bad motherfucker I just think that people who see him swearing and sticking up as double fingers and they don't realize all that put all that she'd aside and observe his movements yeah observe his movements in a fight like in the michael johnson fight in the the Gomi fight in the markets Davis fight in the great Maynard fight observe his movements he's a motherfucker dude yeah when he tees off on you he comes at you like a snake he's got long ass all that's at Cerrone if I was the most connections of all time was like 80% of his strikes hit strikes hitting the first round he lit Donald up it was like what the fucking mist he let Donald up he fucked Donald up in that first round in five years ago oh yeah they all start coming back with leg kicks the only guy who's ever really successfully like put him away in the UFC was Josh Thompson Josh Thompson is one of the most underrated guys he's he's Josh Thompson when he was at his best left to go over Strikeforce and a lot of people missed out on some of the fucking wars of the out over there the Gilbert Melendez fights over there and he went through you know a lot of wear and tear on you but like skill for skill Josh Thompson is a motherfucker he's now he's like 36 times what starts to get everybody but at his best and I think that like his last fight with Nate Diaz when he had kick time he stopped him it's one of like his best performances ever then they had some losses after that but again it's like it's hard to stay healthy and get through a camp when you're 36 years old when those guys get to the late 30s things start to get so he has one loss but the loss in my opinion I mean one stoppage loss but the loss to Thompson's like what he's one of the most underrated guys so it's like solid loss fuck yeah she doesn't get doesn't get looked at as solid as it should be I think Thompson at his best is he's a motherfucker so if okay so let's say he's a natural 170 or let's say he wants to fight the Conor but if said he's not he just wants to fight this fight at 170 to prove his point that he would want to fight exactly the way they did it before and to come in and fight in a better this what happened if they're gonna do that in the meantime they slip Frankie and Aldo fight for a title I'm hella worried Kate the belt you haven't defended once max Holloway should be in the mix as well you know I think they also offered Aldo a shot at McGregor and he didn't take it could be a Brazilian thing if you know what I mean oh he's in ceramides yeah well I came aid the injection like heroin they'll do that they still do that but make sure it I would say it was more like he's just unprepared and out of shape and they wanna get knocked out again I mean the guy just knocked him out with why I fucking punch a couple months ago I remember a gut but I mean he's like give me that rematch cos every much no see he didn't know that Connor was gonna get worked when Connor got worked by Nate Diaz changed the whole game is like everything changed man everything changed in everyone's approached to him when you watch a guy get beat up and strangled like that I'd pee again yeah good dude go dude talk about that don't worry about it man but my point is for the folks listening when you watch a guy get beat up like Connor got beat up against Nate and he shoots for a takedown and then gets taken down naked on top of them beats him up and then chokes him a taps real quick like Nate just dominated him once it got to the ground he was already hurt when it got the ground then everybody goes hmm okay could ha fell dos Anjos do this could and for a guy like Connor I think one of the reasons why he wants his fight back is to prove that he fucked up that he tried to take Nate out with big power bombs he gassed out he got tired and then they boxed him up in the second round Nate start tagging him had him hurt Adam xu4 takedown so a guy like Connor you don't get to be that good you don't get to be that far you don't get to be that successful you don't get to knock out aldo with one punch and beat the fuck out of Poirier in the first round like you called it and beat the shit out of Sivir and stop Chad Mendes when you wanted to bet millions of dollars on it I mean he's a legit 100% motherfucker but the game does not care about personalities the game does not care about confidence it doesn't have to interaction of fists and face and chokes and necks and kicks and bodies it does not care about anything other than what works so when you see a loss like a Ronda Rousey getting knocked the fuck out by Holly Holm it does not mean that Ronda Rousey sucks it does not mean that Holly Holm is the greatest ever just means the game doesn't give a fuck who you are it doesn't care you want to charge face-first at a counter striker and she clips you with that first punch you're already at check already at check you got rock like the first punch and then you beat up for four and a half minutes after that and then the second round comes around you don't even know where the fuck you are your ears are going you can't see your fucking eyes are blurry must be so weird terrifying that's what I love about UFC I suppose the boxing nobody goes 29 I know no I mean if you go six in a row that's like wow that's why John Jones is so spooky yeah nobody's beaten John Jones John John John Jones has one loss and it's a disqualification it's Matt Hamill and where he was crushing him yeah on top of them and it's a dumb rule so I could twelve to six elbows from on a clock face if you drop an elbow down from 12 to 6 the people that made the rules thought that that's somehow or another was dangerous it's no different than any other kind of elbow this is a rule yeah stupid rule it's a rule that they put in place because the people that were on the Commission this is coming from Big John McCarthy himself the people that were on the Commission at the time they they thought that if you dropped a 12 to 6 elbow like those ESPN karate shows so you could break bricks and shit you could kill somebody no so they they made it illegal meanwhile it's not even 12 to 6 it's like 1 to 7 it's stupid it's stupid really I can fight again it's really almost never 12 to 6 it's always at a slight angle but either way it's fucking dumb it's a dumb rule doesn't make any sense yeah um by the way we have Nate Diaz calling indoors sports podcast punch-drunk sports ID really well picnic this OH Nate Diaz fake they always call him glad you had a fake one how good at it big ones yeah amazing really until the accents are great and they talk about 2:09 so Matt they're always talked about they're going pontoon boat shopping where you come on come on I gotta hear a man they're great it's Danish no Neil they're so fucking good at it for a while they were dating Ronda Rousey and GSP was all upset about it because he wanted to date Ronda Rousey and they they catfished him and buried him in a buried him in a on a refrigerator box in the desert no doubt and now GSP is addicted to kitty litter hexa kitty litter a computer spray job his addictions doctor the aliens all the time they told me I missed that to him two minutes my life that's hilarious I got a hit is that I'm on YouTube anywhere uh no not you too but punch-drunk sports.com i think i get clips the daily motion was i think they're all open dailymotion dave and that stuff yeah we gonna click that shit and put it on youtube yeah why don't you have clips i just don't like yeah i mean there's no i can't give you a good reason that this is the reason why I think the rematches is huge okay this is why you have to do it okay first of all cuz Conor McGregor up until that fight is one of the most spectacular fighters ever attached some people are talking about him yeah just it's the spectacle in that sense of spectacular guy gets on stage and screams the weigh-ins and the crowd goes nuts the Irish flags are galvanized the nation and I don't even know what galvanized means means like a coating oh great and you get nails so they don't rust okay um he's spectacular right and his results inside the Octagon other Nate Diaz fights have been incredibly dramatic all in exactly second mid second way out I'll kill him with an uppercut and knock him out and then it's like what but when a guy like Nate Diaz beats you yeah I'm beat you the way he beat you the right thing to do is to have a rematch and this why because the rematch is where the big money's at the rematch with Nate Diaz is god damn scrooge mcduck Giganta huge two million plus pay-per-view guys still a table like if it goes let's just say he goes to 45 then maybe 55 again there's always gonna be like well I mean maybe he'll beat you you exactly not only that but here's the other problem what Frankie might beat him sure everyone by the way max Holloway might be in my rematch who knows you know Joe's a aldo might beat him now now the josie especially julian open yeah if Josie Aldo patience comes in real help Jose Aldo is a fucking nine-year undefeated alter great fighter who got clipped with one big punch so what if Aldo fights like in a similar way to how Miesha Tate fought Holly Holm takes his time where's that motherfucker out and look around two or three and just stays on the outside and leg kicks the shit out of them yeah if Aldo just chooses to of mean all that was so mad he tried to take his head off the left hook and he got clipped he loaded up and he got clipped but what if he doesn't do that what if he goes in there and plays slow on the outside starts kicking his legs what if he initiates a clinch because let me tell you something about all those jujitsu it's fuckin world-class yeah like you watch our Aldo vs Mike Brown in the the UFC or the WEC rather when you want to Walter with the featherweight title can't get anything right when he won the featherweight title dude he takes his back like a fucking world champ and it smashes him so cyborgs in the UFC now - yeah that's amazing I just heard that from you were open pool yeah finally mm-hmm finally yeah at 140 at 140 yeah the piranha thoughts it fights at 35 yes and she's gonna fight leslie smith who fights at 135 she's it's the girl at her ear exploded her got torn off by jessica i what's the problem well it's not a problem but it's a 140 pound weight class instead of a 145 that's the 145 is what she's champion of in Invicta and i think the idea is that they worried that they don't have enough 145 pound talent i just i think they didn't have enough honey i know for sure that it didn't have a 115-pound town but some of the third about to give somebody a third rematch in five years like come on man what you mean miesha tate yeah it's like you don't have a deep enough weight class if that's what you keep doing well sort of but I mean that's the same problem they're gonna have right now at welterweight the same problem you're talking about at 145 which outfit of talent there's a lot of talent 145 of men's oh yeah you know so this is what I think I think first of all she's fucking terrifying we're talking about like one of the scariest female strikers in MMA cyborgs terrifying and Tony and I got in trouble because we said some inappropriate jokes about what would a roast be like with her all jokes aside even before that I tweeted that I would love to see her in the UFC for sure she's the name she's a monster and I think also we shouldn't have double standards as far as who takes performance-enhancing drugs whether it's from mana for women like yeah they like to think you're kind of is I think the way people look at it what a woman is taking testosterone versus a man taking testosterone because you know it's already partial body yeah but you know honestly like some of the things that men have been caught with have been pretty unnatural as well like superhuman levels of testosterone they don't even exist in medical books you know so it's you could argue that it's dangerous because a woman does change her Anatomy whatever they're testing or now yeah but your Anatomy changes all right but you have to make a weight class it's it's tricky man I mean always seen before this Holly Holm thing happened and that's all fishy - what's fishy like Rhonda won't take a fight won't take a fight against Holly Holm and then it's suddenly like me should take ones like I'm ready to fight now it's like no she's not necessarily ready to fight now no she she's not she can't find T like November she's through she has she's got movie obligations they got moving around see that's bad right there when movies get in the way yeah of your fights yeah like you got to pick one of the other go in between yeah for months to say I as soon as my fights over I can do your movie for the next three months and I gotta back to training it's got to be hard though when you're you know a super celebrity and you're getting all this love and you want to put you in all these different things there's got to be hard to say no to certain obviously the same shit happens to female comics yeah but it's way worse with a fighter because a fighter has to be physically tuned up to go in to do battle and get kicked in the fuck yeah it's way worse a fighter it's just similar where it's like you're not concentrating on the thing that got you there so the thing that got you there is now suffering maybe you don't care anymore maybe you just want to do movies okay you
