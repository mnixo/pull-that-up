hello freak bitches when people heard about this like and you see the headlines and this is another like problem with I clickbait journalism the headlines look like I was fuckin accused of rape there was a one article that used the word sexual harassment sexual misconduct was in all the headlines what is that I have no facts in eight years I've seen that one about people connected to Harvey Weinstein yeah like about Ben Affleck they called it sexual misconduct I put it what does that mean like put in something that you don't think they should do what's really crazy Egeland and I almost lost a job I did just lose a gig because when you gue can be it's like sexual misconduct stuff and like that's really scary and again I don't want to be like you know who the real victim of Harvey Weinstein is Jamie kills Dean but like let me just stop you right here if you say like one more time my fucking head's gonna explode patoot I get comments like that it's brutal isaburo is it as bad as alright I'm gonna I just want you to slow it down I'm gonna use it every now and then let this coffee you're breaking like the like meter I'm gonna I do it to men a lot of people do it it's an easy one to do I'm gonna head so much to water but that word is a it's an um it's a people use it as I know I know it's okay I do it too yeah we all do it but it's just you know it's nice to know ya know it's also a very progressive thing like there's a weight like that people talk like when they're really progressive that like you don't hear like left-wing people talk I keep getting fucked over by the progressives it's a way of appearing what's the word submissive or yeah yeah it's not it's not an aggressive way of communicating alright what if I said like but like I kept like punching the table like as I did it like I'm gonna fucking like how much you know like gonna like step to me just smash up apps I can't um so so you got a bunch of people that were upset at you because you had embodied the quintessential allies so it was there nobody had a reason to like me or to defend me on 1/2 of the Twittersphere you had progressives who thought I was a sexual creep and then on the other half you have comedy fans who are like fuck this dude he's the one who called everyone a sexist you don't need to read the article if you see a headline I mean god I attacked so many people without fucking reading the articles right of course there are people to this day that would come up on citizen radio that I don't know why I was mad at I would just figure out the story as we were covering it and be like yep fuck that guy I guess of course and so nobody there was no reason to root for me there wasn't a strong enough fanbase it wasn't like if you know a bigger comic gets accused of something well he has thousands or millions of fans and then this small community who accused me of something I had sort of nobody and when I burnt all the bridges and in comedy and you know I never just showed up at clubs to do sets and stuff like that I just had this audience and sort of thought I could never get fired you know like when when Ali and I sort of became more platonic before the open relationship I mean there were days it was it was so uh you know I mean I would sleep on the couch but there were days I would go on the road and I would not cheat and I would go back to the hotel and jerk off and like my orgasm was better because I'm like I saved citizen radio like I was trying so hard not to not to do anything like that and so anyway I lost yet there was no one to root for me I just had this small audience the small audience either thinks I'm a predator or they're too nervous to say anything well you fit the quintus that you you there's a classic view of what a male feminist is and that classic view is a sneaky guy that yeah like getting in tight with women and saying all the things they really want to hear and the classic story is that those women are never attracted to that guy anyway and one up and go and fuck some jocks I'm a half a guy I mean that's literally what happened it's like yeah you don't say like do you the royalty of this this enormous movie Empire right and we find that particularly offensive this not just he's not just a creep trying to get laid he's a guy that was trying to hold that power over people and use it against them and then on top of that he was like physically forceful so you got like your worst-case scenarios and then you have like guys that are just trying to get late and you're like okay how do you what we are we demonizing aggressive heterosexuality like where does this go like where does this go into sexual assault like rubbing up against someone physically touching them and they don't want you to well that sexual assault sure but hitting on someone right mm-hmm that doesn't seem like sexual assault or anything it seems like someone just trying to get laid like where does it but then when someone's the boss you go okay but then you're not supposed to do that when you're a boss right I was more I was very interested in the in the dynamic between which specifically with Harvey Weinstein and his people under him for many decades yeah about I was trying to put myself in this position of like how does this stay quiet for so long even though there's little rumblings like they talk about Seth MacFarlane's joke at some award show Kevin Spacey - yeah right a little kid was running away from Simon locked in Kevin Spacey's basement it's amazing that like this stuff is kind of like an open secret and that's a but still doesn't seep out or really and I'm it makes you think about the pot the power dynamics and how fearful people are in these positions because it's easy my initial instinct was like why didn't anyone say anything similar to the Bill Cosby's thing I'm like why didn't anyone say anything but then you realized people were saying things they were they were being given hush money they were being shut up but these are really really bad people but I agree with you that it you know I've never been a an aggressive flirt flirt err as it were I've always been very passive with women cuz I never really believed in myself that much and all that but I've known people that been very flirtatious and and you know and all of that I'm like I wonder what is the line there now and and is it okay to be flirtatious to call a woman beautiful at a bar or to do something like that as opposed to you know kind of what if a girl likes you that's the thing like if you meet a girl at a bar and the girls like Colin is a really cool guy god I'm so into them and Collins like you're really beautiful and she's like oh my god thank you and then next thing you know you guys are hanging out or you meet a girl at a bar she has nothing she does want to have anything to do with you she's sober you're drinking your breath smells and you're like you're really beautiful you're like ill gross get that fuck away from me you know could be exactly the same attempt but the person is just not into you when you become a creep right exactly so I'm yeah I I don't I don't look at the situation now in 2017 with you know on college campuses and all these things as desirable for anyone because who de who the hell knows the rules of the landscape you know now I think a lot of it just comes to down to mutual respect and all of that unless you look at merit and character you're fucked yeah like if you're like um whether or not you think white people are special and then you should keep them down or boost them up it's both toxic I think like when it comes to Rachel Dolezal like her problem is not that she wants to be black and she's not her problem is that people give a fuck about what she wants she just didn't have that Lange I just didn't like imagine her whole world could be exactly the same the way she behaves could be exactly the same the way she dresses her actions everything if she didn't utter a few words look like I'm actually black and people like wait what like and then they go into her history no no you lied you wanted to be black but you weren't black look we have an impostor and that's just quick quick quick it's his eyeballs Shawn King I mean he's a part of black lives matter obviously he wanted to do good obviously he wanted to spread good ideas and help people the people that he really identified with if those tweets are real and I don't know if they are hashtag wrong skin and hashtag translational and all that stuff and that's literally how he felt he didn't feel it because he hated those people he felt it because he identified with them and they're more attractive to him than than what he actually was so if he just paul walden and never said i mean Paul wall right though the rapper with the grill I mean isn't that essentially he's he's they have a deep love of black American culture right there's a lot of people that just would just be themselves and go in just go in this is what I appreciate more there's a lot of black people at golf clubs with fucking polo shirts on right yeah why because they identify with that culture it's appealing to them what just let people fucking cultures everything man that people be and the irony is is like Joey Diaz he's gonna get us grills you heard about that and the irony is is like inner-city black culture like think like comes to my shows and thinks I'm funny because they like that crazy shit like like man you're fucking funny you're happy to talk about things right they just think it's funny I think I last a day it's annoying cuz it's like of course not all black people find funny but like that culture that black redneck white liberal culture it's like I'm from a culture that's more similar to American southern or urban black culture than a lot of the Liberals calling me names and it's just a type of culture that bonds through shit talking and I'm like Boston where it's like if you talk shift someone's like oh you're dead you're dead X like a home on my Greece my dad's didn't kill himself you know and then your friend cuz it's like you've hit the darkest shit and then you're like I will make it through a winner [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
