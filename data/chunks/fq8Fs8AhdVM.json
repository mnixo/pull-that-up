and we're live even words ladies and gentlemen you're one of those dudes that has that book cover for your phone I tried to rock the book cover after why I'm like what am I doing here with this extra step I gotta open up a book to get to my phone I like it because I forget things a lot so like I don't like having a wallet and a phone when I leave somewhere like especially even in the house I leave the house in my phone but I don't have my cash on the cards so I got a solution for you it's called a motherfucking fanny pack yeah that's right you're a cool dude you're cool enough to rock one of these like are you cool enough to get past the social pariah aspect of this bag that you wear around your waist I don't have that much shit with me most of the time it's not that much shit there's a lot of shit in here but this is a weird day I've like keys and I have a knife in there and stuff but most of the time it's just light a travel light with that look at that whose get who that blood quavo from me goes I've no idea who you just said popular rapping but that is a ridiculous I know I'm an old man who listens to the Allman Brothers alright but that one that he's got on is preposterous you might as well have a laptop hanging around it's way he's also get like holes in his jeans yeah that's ridiculous would you get attacked by a tiger sir jewelry all that jewelry in the 80s yeah he's kind of ridiculous looking go but but make that make that bigger again so I can take a look at this gentleman light version - I pray I could have found a better piece he's got a lot going on those pants are preposterous that's the most preposterous thing like I guess the shoes if you're like you want to go out but you also want to go bowling you might wear those shoes this is a roast vest let's go I can't say anything bad about the jewelry I'm not into the jewelry I mean I mean that's not my thing but he looks like he's well-appointed like he has two watches on though fuck yeah ballin hashtag ballin I think the one on the right is probably just is that a Ray slit bracelet yeah it's just a fancy ass bracelet but the pants are ridiculous I don't know how the fuck did that ever get started where people ripped up pants I try to talk to Brent and shop about that that dumb motherfucker wears those music videos just like what are you doing when it's like Pat Benatar I don't have any fashion taste don't listen to me but when I mock some shit you might want to listen to me like don't wear what I wear like you know don't don't I mostly wear either love wear like these things which are like trail running sneakers they get no sneaker cred or I'll wear like converse allstar look at this look at this teen beat Donnie Wahlberg yeah exactly from the 90s is hard not just slip right out of that one on the right right hand side that one on the right hand side come on silly fuck you saw the hesitate like I don't know I see that and I feel like the guys would probably wearing a thong under that too yeah I would imagine there's something going on now see like with the women like it's so much nicer yeah right now this is where I'm a hypocrite like would Beyonce right there she fills it out yeah she's a dot see that's kind of different because like a woman's legs and everything are very sexual right so if you see extra leg it's like just shut your mouth and take the bonus yeah right yeah you don't want to complain about it yeah but a dude wearing something like that it's like it's it's literally like well not literally but it's so much like a guy wearing a dress like it's a fashion for women I believe it's trying way too hard like this look at this fella he this like seems like the 80s though cuz he's got a jacket on I mean you can look at the quality of picture yeah right that's true that hairstyle the suit suit jackets never came back though he's got patches yeah I remember when they used to do all that art on the jeans - mmm yeah that was those businesses those pants are ridiculous but ripped up pants men allegedly ripped up pants and and and skinny jean I'm like I'm still 100% against skinny jeans you know what I say that I'm against gain jeans but I wear these things called barbell jeans you ever wear those no they look like skinny jeans because they take that tie - but they have oh I know this is they're made out of yeah shit they got some some elasticity yeah man they're like we're in sweatpants like you don't you don't feel you go throw kicks in them like you could like for real I'm too old for it do you train anymore yeah I still train uh-huh I haven't trained the past few months have been a little bit hard but now that things are settling down I'm settling into this new life things are good been training with Joe a lot chillin oh okay Mickey Carl just moved out here are you in that area yeah in the downtown area yeah and Eagle Rock oh nice nice so I like it over there the yards a great place the yard is awesome that's a great place to Train I've been going there for a while I saw Mickey training with Joe on Instagram yep yeah nice down there too yeah good move for him that's what he needs right is striking his ground games very good yeah his ground is really good he moved down here about a month ago and they actually he's my roommate now no shit anyone with Mickey gosh that's cool that's gotta be fun it's fun it's it's fun also because he's so young yeah it's almost like having a son that yeah you did you know that's a great resource for him to talk to you and questions about the game we sit around and watch fights sometimes it's good Eve Edwards I saw you fight in the hook and shoot in like the fucking 60s like you were wearing bell-bottoms he came out to the cage I was there was one yeah I remember you fought Aaron Riley I think you were like 12 years old how old were you that's about 20 I was still a kid those were good fights no man those were good fights that was um I was watching that Phi actually Mickey and I watched that fight together a couple weeks ago is it weird it is weird does it seem like you doesn't seem like another life it's kind of another life it is I called you now I'm 41 when you when you think back about yourself at 20 like how much memory do you really have of that you got like little flashes yeah like I could see little pick images of shit I have a narrative that I play out my head that I think happened and so I could repeat it there you go look at that 20 year old Eve Edwards bouncing around Wow dude ya know look at it here Wow yeah you have nice curl thing going on yeah that kool Moe Dee thing going on too I was you know I was representing wow this is really Shirley days this was Jeff Osborne show yep fucking shoot that was the first time here and I thought yes - and he's a really good commentator man is he working I don't know I know he just like shut down hooking shoot yeah it's gone and I don't know what Jeff is doing I know he had a lot he was he was involved pro wrestling a lot - mmm but now I haven't spoken him in a long I did a couple shows with him in the UFC when I first came aboard he was he was doing the UFC back a man yeah I um I was just was another thing cuz that's another thing going back and watching these old fights I went on fight past I was watching I think it was like you see 33 Wow um we're in Louisiana when Bustamante and Linden that card yeah that was the restart fire exactly remember that yeah this my top Tim hopped him again and Big John kind of screwed it up and yeah man you know that that was the early days - I think nowadays I think Big John would have just said no no no yes / yeah yeah absolutely I mean we were all learning back yeah yeah yeah but that was still like UFC middleweight championship you know it's like they had had 30-plus shows it was like it was something that you wouldn't expect yeah for sure laying low is so it is so crazy didn't he bite somebody and what he was wrestling Linlin yeah yeah in the wrestling days he bit somebody here's Bustamante versus Chuck Liddell this is a different one yeah this was a fight were boost Dumont's was out power yeah he was just too small Chuck was just so scary back then and he loosed too much wasn't taking Chuck down well Bustamante had fought some big fucking dudes though man yeah that was the thing that he hadn't taken Chuck down he had fought some big fucking dudes remember he fought Tom Erikson yeah in like world combat something or another I don't remember the organization I do vaguely remember the fight I don't remember watching it but um it was it was a it was a Matt I don't feel like he was on a mat and there was no cage or a ring I'm happy you might be right that's what my dream is my dream is to do MMA fights in a football field I feel like I'm thinking for football fields know so you can't get trapped up against the cage I feel like if a guy takes you down and holds you down he should be able to hold you down because there's nothing there but the ground yeah but a cage you can wall walk up the cage there you could protect yourself against submissions up against the cage there's a bunch of shit that happens against the cage that just doesn't happen if you're in a basketball court but then because of that you got to develop new technique alright you guys develop something to deal with that situation yeah are you um like do you think the rules are okay no what do you would you change I I would definitely change the twelve to six elbow that's one yeah I you know what that one's illegal right yeah yeah so stupid I used to watch those these come on late at night on ESPN I used to watch those things all the time I still love him too even what even when I was fighting I was still watching those things because it was at a Damon though they they get they get so intense to you know the athletic commissions really thought that you couldn't do that to a person because you'd kill them so they made that technique illegal at all the shit like we have that power cube thing in the back we're gana registered that power punch if you go out there at elbow that thing you'd be shocked at how we cast your elbow yes especially a drop-down elbow like it's just not that much power it's it's just I mean when they're breaking those boys yeah they're using that that joint as a letter post as a letter exactly and they're just putting their body weight behind it yeah that's all it is you can't necessarily do that when you're inside someone's guard right you don't want Jon Jones elbowing you in the face period exactly but there's no difference if Jon's hitting you with a an elbow like he got disqualified for when he fought Matt Hamill or if he's hitting you with a sideways elbow he's just smashing you you know what that downward elbow is gonna cut a lot less unless it's the point on the top of the head that's true that's that's that's that's a very important point like that was always the the argument against no gloves was that you'd cut you'd cut people want yeah III agree with that I mean that that skin getting pinched between bone that's be you know just get torn yeah really cut but do you think that having wrapped up hands and having padded gloves like is that an unrealistic sort of thing because like if you're if you're striking sit like if you an ax dude we're just fighting right you're just fighting like there's no like hey this is a play fight or we're gonna have rules this is just a fight you and a guy are fighting you can't just hit them with bare hands the way you can hit them with gloves on with your wrist taped up you know you got to be very wary about punching them full blast in the forehead you might shatter your hand there's a lot of things you have to think about yeah but I guess as as if someone has done it and trained to to try to knock someone out but you're not thinking about you know we're never throwing punches at your skull right you know we're aiming for these targets that are soft for sure so like when you're in a street fight like those things don't turn off right so so as a fighter I know I'm that's not a concern to me in a street fight situation when you bring that up but I know it can happen I mean it happened in some of the early UFC's guys guys break their hands on skulls that's what I'm saying is it unrealistic to put gloves on someone and tape their wrist up when they don't give them any other advantage for striking any other way you don't let them cast up your ankles or do something where you you know you protect your shins and make it easier for you to kick hard because if you had like some sort of spandex thing with a like a shin pad like like the same sort of thickness of shin pad as you have on the knuckles you would just be slamming into everything yeah elbows arms who gives a fuck you wouldn't worry about it just slamming in there boom it would change the game it would completely change the game but it would slow it down a lot or I mean in MMA fights now you look at a punch gout for MMA fight versus a boxing match yeah of course they can only punch so-so punch counts higher but your hands are getting hurt you know guys guys will lose fights simply because they can't continue going into the second round sometimes will that be the case or will it change their style it will definitely change the style but without having the gloves and hand wraps and and that stuff there there is going to be those times when it's still gonna be it's just gonna minimum not minimize but bring the number down you know it's not gonna stop it though I agree I mean I think if I wanted to look at it in terms of just pure entertainment value I'd say leave it the way it is yeah absolutely changed downward elbows change up 11 things like I like the pride rules man yeah including with the judging with the pride was judging on fight judge the whole fight I agree with that I like that I agree with that and I think more judges you know but I think that's a big one I was talking about with out with Pat Miletich the other day we're saying like five judges or more you know yeah yeah three yeah I agree I agree with more judges you'll get a little more diversity also though I think you got to change change the the scoring criteria I mean we are using a boxing criteria but like like when you talk about wrestling and when I see guys go oh he's going to take down when a guy goes down he pops right back up I'm like it's not a takedown it's not two right you know so so like why can't we implement some of the things because we're taking aspects of all these different styles of fighting mm-hmm like the route the scoring system and the values for things should should come from that to some degree yeah takedown with the immediate stand-up like if someone takes you down you're right back up that is not a whole lot different than you blocking a kick yeah you know just blocking a kick count if you get your knee up and your elbow you catch one right here are you counting that as something that guys yeah right no no not so you know who does Greg Jackson he's a great coach I don't he so he I think he does his psychological thing I'm letting the cat out of the bag with this one because I'm in the cage with with Isaac Valley flag and Isaac throws a kick and I block it it's a great kick guys a great kick ike that landed me you know and i'm like and then he does something else and it doesn't affect me but he's cheering him on like it does and I'm like is he doing that for the rat for the judges I'm like and I went back to the corner I told Mike I was like Mike he's cheering him on getting kind of getting the judges on his side Mike like don't worry about that this is what you need to do yeah you got to get that shit out of your head yeah for sure for sure but if he's right there look if you see where one corner is and then the other corner is when the fight is not going on there over there by the stairs the judge is right there yep the judge is just a few feet over and if they're like enthusiastic yes you got it you gotta get those judges a certain percent let's say 30 don't know what the fuck they're watching and so they're very same no no let's not say because I know what we'd say we'd all say the same name unfortunately nice lady anyway this this fucking situation it's there should be way better judges for sure yeah I think guys were former fighters guys here martial arts experts guys who like really care about the sport you have no shortage of them you can go to any MMA school any jujitsu school any kickboxing School any website any website all across the country and you will find hundreds and hundreds of qualified candidates yeah people that will tell you why that's a bad decision people that will tell you why that doesn't work people who tell you why this shouldn't mean anything and we don't have that right now for no reason there's like zero reason it doesn't make any sense it's not like wow man there's not enough money like what is this no there's enough money for it this is this crazy this is no reason it's not like well you know water is wet and that's just how it goes no I would think would be a good thing also now that like the second generation I I have like in my head I have this three generations of MA and that's where we are now in the third starting to move into the fourth and I feel like with the first two generations being done pretty much yeah like there's a lot of guys that are highly qualified to to weigh more you know then it may mean the sport is giant yeah there's so many good writers out there yeah if you read MMA articles they're real good writing and a lot of these like mainstream websites select a lot of experts out there talking about stuff that's why a fight like next weekend is so fascinating because between Tony and khabib nobody knows what the fuck is gonna happen it's one of those fights where everybody's like damn I don't know and you got all these people breaking it down on one side and then you got people making compelling arguments on the other side you're like hmm okay this one's gonna be weird I've been I've been bouncing back and forth between my pick for that fight mm-hmm but um I guess because I've been bouncing back and forth this isn't necessarily where I'm gonna stay but I feel like okay I don't see how that can change but again like you said there are people in making these arguments and if somebody convinces me of something that kind of defeats this argument then it's like man now you open the door for this again and what I think is like what I've heard my first thought was Kabhi was this guy he takes everybody down and he controls you and beat you up right and you think he's gonna do that and then but Tony is this guy he just does not he's like one of these submission first kind of guys you know without argument submission opposition Tony wasn't even too worried about position he'll create scrambles he's he's aware of where he is at all times and what he's giving up so I feel like he would just continue to scramble he'd be able to get back to his feet at least and then I go back to Kobe even and seeing Tony against Kevin Lee and Kevin Lee kind of controlled him early in that fight you know he was able to pass his guard and do some some good controlling things now if a guy like Kobe can do that right then he's not getting back up and Kobe was going to be able to take him now and he is the best wrestler in the game like yeah good arguments good arguments you know I think another argument is that Kevin when Kevin Lee fought Tony I think everybody knew Kevin had a staph infection I knew I saw him walking to the cage I look at his chest yeah I was like holy shit that guy's got staph I knew he's gonna be weak I knew in compared to the Kevin Lee the destroyer that you see when he's on point and in shape it's like this guy's gonna be compromised and he's also a big 155 so it's a hard cut for him whereas Tony makes it I mean Tony could get pretty heavy but he's super disciplined he makes it easy Tony's endurance endurance is off the charts off the charts impeccable he was posting the other day that he went on a six six mile run at one o'clock in the morning it's like extra credit he wrote hashtag extra credit I mean he's an animal I mean Eddie Bravo trains them up there and Big Bear all the time mm-hmm he says never seen anything like it so the dude was just everybody else like pacing everybody up the hill coming back down there still trying to make it up the first time he's running past in the second time he's a fucking animal he wants it oh he wants it bad but so he knew that Kevin going into that fight was compromised so if he knew Kevin was compromised maybe he decided to just let him work let him work that first round you know and Kevin's don't you know joke Kevin's fucking dangerous very skilled very skilled very aggressive very strong very dangerous you know so Tony he got in bad positions in that fight though didn't get mounted he got outed he is got past pretty convene usually early in the fight mm-hmm but that's crazy because if he could if he did take that time off even knowing that a guy like Kevin Lee was you know compromised that's still a high-level guy to be um take this time off you know it'll be a little bit laxed ya know I mean it might just been Kevin is that good I really wish that fight took place with Kevin healthy really wish that fight took place with kick I think Kevin is an interesting guy cuz he's he talks a lot of shit yeah he's really aggressive he fights well he looks the part when you look at him he's fuckin jacked you know that's a bad break for it ended like that he had like a golf ball grown out of his tit yeah that was crazy I mean it could happen again relatively soon depending on how his fight with with Barboza goes yeah yeah yeah that's an interesting fight for barboza to Barboza's got to recover from that mauling that can't put on them that was horrendous there's no I'm an opponent Leone yeah exactly and I want to look back at the Barbosa fight but when I when I did look at it he defended he defended some of those takedowns early you know and I mean it's against could be even though yes you can defend you're gonna be the strongest in the first round right still there's not a lot of people defending could be used take those no you know there's a great New York Times article that was us just on like three or four days ago about wrestlers from Dagestan yeah and about how wrestling is their way out because so many of them trying to prove themselves they wind up joining those Islamic terrorist groups and that these coaches try to take these young aggressive kids and give them something sentences or something else and give them another alternative really really well-written article interesting stuff about like how powerful these guys are and how young they get him into it and when you see khabib the thing about him it's like he's not doing different things than everybody else you know what I mean like some people are doing different things like Wonder Boys doing different things like he stands totally sideways his hands are down he's throwing front leg sidekicks he's doing a lot of different things you know like oh okay this is um a new thing to adjust to could be doing standard shit but he's just doing it at not just a notch but several notches past what everybody else is doing I think that's the thing about these daghestani guys it's crazy because like this American wrestling style folk style wrestling of being on top and having that control that's a big deal but like Nik Lentz that's one of his strengths you know and Nick gets on top of you it's like a dwarf you know like he's not going anywhere but he can also escape that a lot of guy same thing with Mike Brown but um Nick Lance got ridden out at the win in the fight in Brooklyn I forget which car that I'm Holly Holmes and Jermaine to me you know that card he won by guillotine right no the last one which fight I forget who who he fought I forget he fought a daghestani guy oh but he just got ridden out against his own style like that so these guys are better at what they're what the American style is but like for something like that I want to see one of those guys against a guy like Gregor Gillespie ya know cuz that style of wrestling of being on top and grinding on you that's a high like a high level wrestler like that mm ah no fault four-time all-american National Champion kind of guy with that kind of conditioning who's not gonna break but I wanna see that battle that's like cuz that'll be like a national championship with two guys that can punch and kick a bit well luck a guy like Jordan burrows Jordan burrows getting into MMA yeah like what happens when he fights one of those daghestani guys yeah exactly but see there's Dagestan II guys and then there's khabib he's another notch above them yeah he's a notch above them like there's a lot of those guys that are real good they're real tough you know but he's another level he is a scary level i when you see him on top of guys like like especially the Michael Johnson yeah that was helpless that was mauling and horrifying I had having a conversation with him leading with him to give up you must quit that'll shut this mine you know title shut the deserve ma'am just keeps and he's got his arm tied behind his back he's punched him in the face it's horrific yeah it's horrific I mean he can do shit to you that like it's like white belt black belt beat-up yeah it's against the best guy yeah world against the best guys in the world Michael Johnson but Michael Johnson clipped him now but here's the thing about that fight what's interesting to me khabib came into that fight with the same problem he went into the Tony Ferguson fight that was cancelled he'd cut too much weight and his liver apparently shut down make him wait for that fight so then they went into the next fight and he didn't make weight at all you got rushed to the hospital then he hires a nutritionist looks fucking fantastic event against Barbosa has zero problems make him wait now he's got it all under control but you got to wonder if he was compromised in the Michael Johnson fight how much of a factor did that play is to him getting stunned yeah you got he got clipped yeah he got clipped and you know as well as anybody that when you're dehydrated or you have been dehydrated you just don't take a punch as well yeah dehydration conditioning those things you know those things help you recover when you when you're hydrating your conditioning is is up to piano yeah I don't know he you seen him take some punches he always backs guys up he's always coming forward and he does eat a lot of shots coming forward but you know if his conditioning is fine and that's the only time that I can remember him getting hurt in a fight from taking shots like the same thing about both Sbarro's who was throwing at him hard hard you know yes of everything he's like a zombie he got wheel kicked a couple times it's nothing yeah club in the back of the head with wheel kicks nope sorry not good day just constantly charging forward man he's a fucking tank terrifying God but this is the fight to me that's most intriguing other than him fighting Connor him fighting Connor for the name value is like chaos right like holy shit like they might do that if he wins I do that Russia dude if they do that Russia Connor better bring his own food tell you that he better bring some fucking corned beef and cabbage you don't want to take any chances yeah but when to be when Kobe was fighting Tony the thing about Tony is that Tony's so creative like he's very unpredictable yeah you don't know what he might step in and throw an upward elbow you know he know he'll do all kinds of weird shit he'll do Granby rolls on you he'll die for a leg you know he might try to take khabib down who knows what he's gonna do and stand up he's got legit knockout power legit and he can take a shot rolls with punches real well doesn't mind when he gets hit hard he just kind of rolls with shit comes back like the Barbossa fight the barboza fight with him was a very interesting fight yeah that that fight was fun to watch like I can't I can't remember all the details right now but I remember thinking I remember tweeting man I'm watching this and these guys are savages I I can't I can't believe I fought one of these days I have bad daddy Castillo is like man I fought them both but yeah that fight was fun watching that's that's that common opponent thing that you say in yeah I don't know it's one of those things also though because you know with the rule fighter ABC that thing doesn't play out like stout beats like stop Jeremy Stephens beats thought I'd be Jeremy yeah you know Jeremy that'd be to me it's this crazy crazy thing where it just doesn't add up it doesn't add up MMA math just doesn't work it's one of the reasons why someone like khabib is so impressive it's cuz he beats everybody everyone undefeated yeah who the fuck is undefeated at that level of the game I think he has 25 victories is that five a No twenty-five of tho him and that's the other thing like I still call John I call him one defeated because John Jones yeah cuz nonsense you know when you get smashed exactly he dominated that fight 100% it was a it's a goofy rule and I don't even know if he totally violated it I mean he's trying to get through the guard while he's finishing a guy guys covering up stupid makes me mad I feel like I hit a nerve at that time at the 12 to 6 help Oh makes me mad because it makes me mad cos it's still there because they changed the rules like they went through this new unified rule system I'm like oh this is good we have some new regulations as far as like putting a hand on the mat and getting taken a knee you know like when when can you hit a guy with a knee now it's one hand now you can do with one hand great I like that what Dennis twelve six elbows still in see here's here's what I've learned since I've retired is that all of these formulas fit into something else so right now you're like well you change this one thing well all of this other shit is wrong well you look at society and you look at the world right right like these little changes of what happens it's never everything that's wrong isn't fixed at all times it's always this one little things fixed this other little thing is fixed there's our little things right know what I mean so it's gonna take a while it'll happen eventually but man there's so much in this like there should be something that changes every year yeah I agree I think they've got to figure out something with I pokes yeah I I feel like there's I think some I don't know he might have been you I feel because it was it was a an announcer or a commentator or something talking about it but having like a glove just the covers the fingers but it doesn't really change anything even even so much so that like it's a webbing yes and that your fingers are still virtually individual mm-hmm you know but you can bring them all down together or you can just put those two on and these two are gonna be tugged at but takes no effort right what I mean yeah something's are covering like that with the padding over the front so then it doesn't go in the eyes as a single point you know but our is it is there anybody even playing with prototypes or something that and doing an exhibition or demonstration - good question I haven't seen anything compelling I haven't seen anybody come up with anything yeah it was my idea my idea was to have it like um like like a like a old school bag glove yeah yeah Joe Louis with those old school bag gloves there's it's a very thin glove than would like cover the tips and these to hit the back with them back in like the fucking 20s yeah it was just like leather yeah and then maybe that's what it is like um Keith loved and just kind of a topping of that type thing that makes so much sense like yeah why would the tips of the fingers like you don't in grappling you never use individual for knows you cup everything is done like this yeah it wouldn't change anything nothing wouldn't change a single thing the only thing that changes is is yeah because he it doesn't even change this no I'm still it makes it better honestly you have more grip yeah like if it's like you know like um suede yeah material like something's a little rough you could actually get that right yeah that's true it would help grappling cuz gloves definitely hurt some submissions to get in the way a rear naked choke it's one of the reasons why George's submission over Bisping was so impressive because he went this way you know he way out deep back of the hand to the back of the neck the real way which you don't sometimes you don't see because the guy can't get the glove in there yeah that's that's the one that's on the on the display image of like yeah jiu jitsu chokes yeah i mean that one was fucking tight that was crazy to watch George do that but yeah they got to figure out something you don't need to have these open it doesn't affect wrist control it doesn't affect any kind of grappling and in fact it would make it better what is Bellator yeah Bellator has done what pride did yeah are they curved it I like it they use a never last ever losses their glove manufacturer obviously they make fucking killer shit but what they're doing is having it so it's it's more difficult to open your fingers up that's a smart move it's a little little thicker to know you didn't see a lot of I fucking tried no you didn't that's the point right yeah it was very you have see those gloves it's almost harder to close than it is to open yeah and then I don't know I feel like maybe it was just the Commission but I feel like you know you always break your gloves in you try to break a mantle it cuz they're stiff when you first get them they're new but there was at least one commission they wouldn't even let us like you know break the gloves in they wouldn't give you the gloves you had you didn't get them until you put them on that must be some amateur shit like some omission that doesn't know what they're doing yet you know a commission doesn't know what they're doing not not the Commission um the hospitals after the after the fight itself in New York really mad in Brooklyn I had the the crazy well I had it wasn't me Dustin Poirier had the craziest trip week so after that fight with Jim Miller with all those shin kicks right were both they both went to the hospital with a calf kicks and Dustin's calf and shin was swollen and they were I'm giving him some morphine in truck we got there and they the doctor came in and they wanted to perform a surgery on him there they wanted to slice his shin open and relieve the pressure because they were saying you're gonna lose nerve tissue and your nerves are gonna die and and I'm you if you start not feeling when they go it's no and there's no coming back you can't fix it you can't fix those things they were really pushing for this state it was just a crazy situation right so we're like a dusted man and then I called Mike Brown back there and we started out in this discussion about it's just like it's leg kicks we've seen this all the time and buy and whatnot no and they're not and Dustin's like yeah I don't want to do that then they started he was like yeah I want to get out of here basically he was like can I just have something for the pain and it felt like they were like no they said no we're not gonna let you leave here on pain medication and I felt like they were trying to keep him the enticing mistake the fuckin pain medication it was just a really weird situation and we were there for way too long and they were really pushing for this like three or four different no three different doctors came in trying to convince him to get this surgery done oh it was crazy just for some swelling just swelling in the calf that doesn't make any sense it doesn't honestly like what they think that it would cause nerve damage to have so much swelling the the swelling was pushing up against the blood vessel supposedly and there wasn't circulation coming through that - what was happening this is this is what they I can this is like over a year ago so I'm trying to remember exactly and I'm not a met I'm not a doctor right um but the the swell and they were asking him about because he was having some some loss of sensation right and in his toes but he had just fought you know I had given him morphine and all this other stuff so um maybe no poking at his toes with the pin or something you feel that he feel that he's like yeah a little bit no but you know all these different answers and they would they claim to be concerned about it they were telling him that this is what this is a possibility this is what's gonna happen and we want to prevent it they they weren't like well this is guaranteed that this is what's going on this is just the realistic possibility and we want to prevent it and it was just like he wanted to wait as long as possible and they they would just they they just seem to be really pushy about wanting to do this so where were they're gonna make the incision in in the shin up the shit like it was it was big it was as long as my phone what so that was dense tit that's why we were like yeah this is kind of crazy and they were just want to drain it and they want to drain it they want to release the pressure right and then they were like well we can there's a test that we can do can't really see it from that angle burst in the hospital yeah nasty they were they were like there's there's a he when Dustin was like I don't like that idea I don't want to do that and they were like I don't think that let's just wait and he's like what they were like well there's a thing that we can do but we have to take a needle and they wanted to take a knee a long needle stick it into his leg pass the bone into the muscle and like do a pressure test on it and he was like yeah I don't like it was crazy because he doesn't like needles right that's the hates needles yeah fight to live I'm scared of needles I'm the same way about needles but I don't have the tattoos that kid has but he's just like I don't want to do that I don't want like he's like no cousin eat they wanted it would have been this much in the inside his shit yeah I don't know how long it would have been but it was it wasn't there yeah it wasn't just like looking for a vein and they were just testing for pressure they well they were like talking about saying they wanted to test a tire gauge in there and sure so anyway they didn't happen the dust we started Dustin's out again frustrated and and and they really pushing for it it was late at night and and I don't think I was helping the situation because I was like these guys are probably interns they're probably back there with like a chart in there like they get they get bonus points for whatever surgery thank you you know you never know man people are really skeptical about that kind of stuff but you know yeah I mean they definitely do surgeries on people that you don't have to some doctors do it definitely can't happen you'd hope that you're not running into one of those doctors but they have done it before yeah I mean there's a doctor that got it just got arrested recently and it was a whole story about all the different surgeries that he did that he didn't have to do and including cancer surgeries like he removed cancer are people that didn't even have cancer yeah yeah that's that's a scam oh it starts driving fat Mercedes I got to make those payments he should just got into the plastic surgery business I know right you could talk those crazy ladies into anything anything and everything you need some uni you need to take some of that meat out of your butt and put in your lips yeah that's the move meaty but lips so were they ice in the shin the entire time they were they had ice on it Lee not a drip like a morphine drip to kill the pain why don't they just wait a couple days why they want to just go right into it right now they wanted to take they wanted to do it that night and they said they said they didn't want or the reason why they didn't want to wait was because when the nerd nerve damage happens when the nerves die that's it they're dead there's no way to you know Brian to bring those things back so man I just I wonder that's right I don't want to be it's it's not right because Dustin fought again after that and he's fighting in a few weeks like one was his leg better um shoot he got on the plane the next day so I had had real quick little side note I had had some problem I was helping him for that camp and I had an injury and I got tylenol with codeine in it and man that stuff that's that's powerful medicine I was like I couldn't Dustin took me to the hospital I know I went in I was in so much pain and they were like they prescribed that I took one pill in about 20 minutes later I was like this is the first time I was able to relax in like three days the pain was so bad and I was like when I get bad I got to the end of my cap my thing I like two pills left and I was like I don't need them I'll keep him in case I get hurt again some point you know and fortunately I had him because I was like dude like this that that pain that you're going to when you get on the plane cuz I was in Japan I had busted my foot and then I had to fly 16 hours and my foot was swelling on the plane it's like the pressure yeah high altitude it was miserable it started in my in my in my foot in my ankle and it swelled up into my shin and count all the way down into my toes but it was so I was like that's I don't want that to happen to you so like like it's gonna be miserable just take this with you and take a pill you know I mean he just took one pill he said it was a great feeling it helped with the help with the flight I got a hold of some of that old school nyquil back one day I've only taken it like maybe two or three times ever in my life but the last time I got something was like 20 years ago I took some I was sick and I took old-school nyquil and I was lying in bed and it was like my my bed was just hugging me my bed was made out of love and it's just hugging me and I was like huh anything give a fuck about that cold house is so relaxed like old school night was amazing I remember that I own that's coding right isn't it I think codeine was a nightclub it was nice man back in the day Tito Ortiz III called Tito at one point cuz I was real sick I had a fight coming up too and I was like man I don't I don't know what to do he's like here's what you do you take three packs of theraflu and you put that in one cup of water right you boil a cup you boil the water and you pour that and you put that past their flu in there I was like I started to do it and I was like man Tito is a light heavyweight - that's a good move I'm glad you did because I was out for 18 hours why I got laid down I woke up and I still I felt like I could I just don't want to get up and I slept I slept for I was in bed for 18 hours I did wake up feeling better though like I would imagine you probably weren't thinking about the cold at all no so the stress was gone and you get in that rest you're out cold I know I was laid out the best it that's one of the best arguments for like cold medicine is that they let you go to sleep like if I'm sick and miserable I can't fucking sleep yeah but if you take something you just fucking theraflu was a good one yes it cleans you out like you could breathe and you just caught the fuck out and and isn't that when you um what does this chain mean that old-school night call it had a suit ephedrine in it which is whoa is used to make meth oh Jesus well keep you up says sudafed oh this I get to Google what it was this is what yeah but sudafed is not nyquil sudafed is very different sudafed is a stimulant sudafed to the stuff that cleans your nose out right right this is what that's like that uh nyquil had sudafed your neck Oh equal the original green death formula nyquil is behind the pharmacy counter now because gasp it has the evil sudafed Runet oh so you can buy that shit still some people are looking at house an article someone was looking for it in New York that's 2013 I gotta get a good doctor to find some stuff mm-hmm interesting that stuff fucks you up yeah you go deep with that stuff I think it's the chemical that it's mixed with probably fuck it's the suit ephedrine is probably what keeps you alive codeine let's drag it down into the grave the suit ephedrine shit keeps you alive that's the thing about about sleeping all right that's when um when your body everything else is off yeah all your body can do is is he'll you know what else happens man you make good decisions like that term sleep on it that's not a joke yeah there's something about going asleep with a problem waking up in the morning and you have a new perspective you like that's not that big a deal all right it's all right I don't care all right you know or maybe I should do something about this or maybe I should apologize maybe I should you know something about sleeping on something I don't know what it is man but it gives me a truer compass as to which direction I should go there's a thing about that too there's um sleeping on it I I had to teach myself some things about like car mechanics and I had a problem but somebody's like that's your alternator it's like what because my engine wouldn't stay on you know it's like really it's like how much does that cost and I was broke that wasn't I was just fighting you know I wasn't there was no UFC even on the horizon yet and um I'm like how much did that cost I was like too much shit I was like he's like I can do it for you like you can do it it's like how many you gonna like I can't afford that either but if you can do it I'll figure it out so I went to the store I was like hey I need to buy an alternator for this this model car they were like okay they bring it out and they're like they weren't gonna they weren't gonna give it to me because you have to give them the other one back you have to exchange it really yeah like at least this is the way it was in like 2000 Texas you know okay so but fortunately one of the managers at that store is one of my students is recon street from my gym so I was like he was like here you can take it just bring the alternator back I was like awesome because I didn't know what an alternator was my plan was to grab it go look at my engine and like fine this is fine the like thing right so that's what I did I found the like thing I put it in there I changed it I took the other one back but I couldn't get the belt on did everything that I was trying to do everything and somebody was like the tensioning bolt I was like I don't know what you're talking about and I slept on it I went to bed that night I went to sleep and I woke up ran downstairs connected it you know like cuz overnight yeah there was something about being relaxed and not being like stressed about trying to find it right now it's right in front of me I'm just away from it and I see the whole engine in my sleep and it's like you put the ratchet in there and you pull on it and that's that's the tensioning bolt I have a crazy spiritual idea about that I think when you go to sleep you go into the spirit world when you come back you're refreshed I think you live a new life every morning I think you live on the momentum of your past life yeah but I think you have a new life every morning you just returned from the spirit world with the mess that you left behind you gotta clean it up clean it up and figure it out and like oh yeah yeah I should have just cranked that bolt over there okay it all makes sense there's something to that because I got some stuff going on now where I'm just like when I wake up the next day I'm like you know what it's not that big it's not that big of a deal yeah most things are not that big of a deal if you're still alive and you're walking around and talking ultimately it's not that big of a deal like you I give things like the 10-year test look if you look back on ten years how much of a big deal is it's gonna be yeah not that big of a deal yeah it's fucking alternator yeah that big of a deal the ten year test is a good test yeah that makes a lot of sense you know but people operate on momentum that's a big problem with people you know like when you go to bed you wake up in the morning you just still get the shit that you left behind the day before piling up and bills you got to pay and chores you got to do and all these different tasks that need to get done like fuck you know you can't ever get behind it it's it's it's a good day when when I feel like okay everything's done yeah and like this day is completely mine yeah man that's fucking that's to have like our clean slate in your mind in terms of things you need to do there's no way to underestimate that yeah that's giant you can't under emphasize how important that is yeah overemphasize rather I completely agree with that Islam I'm one of those guys to my brain I feel like as soon as I wake up first thought leads into the next and to the next and you you can't stay ahead of it I'm not staying ahead of it you're kind of being dragged along being pulled by these thoughts in all these different directions especially when I'm trying to organize something sometimes I don't have a list or something like that I'm not gonna get if I have five things to do let me get one thing done if I don't have a list you know what changed a lot of my life I started working out early in the morning my day almost always starts out today's one of the rare days where it didn't like today I'm gonna work out after the podcast but most days I get up in the morning and I work out the only reason why I didn't do it today is because everyone in my house is sick everyone and I wanted to get some sleep yeah my kids a little petri dishes man they're just always sick everybody's sick hmm so I'm I'm the only one so far that's been able to fight it off and I woke up yesterday and like oh I got a sore throat like it's coming I fought it off yesterday and I fought it off today I got in the sauna chilled out but something changed in my life when I started working out in the morning my thought process became clear it makes more sense because I clean out my mind when I work out so I get up and the first thing I do is just go work out and clean up my mind my mind gets cleaned up my body's like fully elevated in terms of like my heart rate got jacked up I'm sweating like a pig I already strained already pushed already got over some shit already made it to the end and then whoo so there's already a victory by the time it's you know 8:00 a.m. yeah that that to me like then my day just starts off way better like I start off with a clearer perspective yeah I guess mmm it's similar when especially when I was fighting because you woke up get a run in eat something head to the gym no no and then yeah I'm trained now that especially run fasted yeah I like I would that would be the first thing I did I brush my teeth and go for a run you know I I didn't I didn't like eating anything this is when you were living in Texas this is whenever I can even to this day when I run like especially especially in Texas because in the summer yeah you gotta go in before it turns into a barbecue outside exactly but what I was gonna say is in Texas you did mostly flat it's mostly fun yeah especially especially in Houston Austin has some hills mhm but Houston is there they're the only hills in Houston with overpasses right yeah but now they're out here man there's some ferocious trails you can run yeah yeah there's a there's a hill on my street that's all I'm a quarter-mile oh that's miserable yeah this is a miserable shit in the Hollywood Hills like whoa yeah if you wanted to get at the bottom and do some sprints going up it that's so good for your knees too because you know you're not really stomping down you know you're you're pushing yeah you're pushing up so it's just it's basically like doing a bunch of lunges you know yeah you feel in your ass dude my ass is way bigger than it used to be was good there was a there was a drill when I did this a couple of times they would incline the treadmill mmm said the to its peak yeah and turn it up to like 12 or 10 or 12 and you're sprinting for like 15 seconds that was miserable I would you'd feel that really really hard is great until you fall off yeah exactly how do you get off that fucking thing when you're sprinting you got to grab the edges and hop did you know what I just started using the other day it's a motherfucker is that versa climber yeah oh yeah god damn I've never been on it for an extended period of time always in a circuit oh yeah I did it in a circuit to be the last exercise it's miserable I was like motherfucker this thing like you do the first two or three strokes like I can get through this and then you're like ten in you're like oh shit you're like how much time I got left a minute and ten seconds how's that possible I'm like I am NOT gonna make a minute in ten seconds of this it feels weird because like with every stroke and then it doesn't it's not heavy or hard to make the stroke it feels like it's nothing but you're also going nowhere right yeah just like you have you're making this motion and I don't know cup to read the shit you know you look down here like this like how I say how is that possible I've only been doing this for 15 seconds I you know I like that and there's a thing called the echo bike that rogue makes that I have out here okay holy shit it's an Aerodyne but it's like an Aerodyne built for gorillas like if you're gonna put an air dye machine into fucking gorilla cage if you'd make like this rubber this is a thick ass fucking steel thing with dick ass handles everything's like super beefy and jacked-up goddamn that thing kicks you gotta kill me that I try it it's the shit man it's the shit I do two bodies on that so I'll do 20s and tens 20 seconds work 10 second break fuck it's fucking hard man those air time machines look so they're looking like nothing that's one of those things where you look at it like how could that be hard yeah it it's hard to when you when you alternate yeah you know what I mean so you're riding them both together but you're doing a conditioning workout and your coach is standing right there and you take your feet off of the pedals and you're pumping with your arms yeah Cyril that's miserable it's fuck it's so and I also don't like not that I don't like it but one of the in the conditioning workouts the parts that was so hard and kind of draining that all I don't know what you call it but it's the with the hydraulic presses oh yeah oh that's miserable too because every direction yeah like there's no rest on that machine there's none it's kind of crazy when you go back and look at like old school strength and conditioning workouts that fighters used to do and you know comparison to what with all the crazy shit that guys do today whoo which which camp well it's an argument so girl but which camps I'll go Cass because I feel like there's two which camps really started that that that the conditioning thing who are ahead of the game I always think a TT I always think of them because they were like when Lambert created that place Dan Lambert the fucking man that guy that guy's done a lot for MMA and doesn't get his horn blowing enough respect he he put a shit ton of money in the American Top Team and one of the things that they did about it was make it a full like they have everything they have great wrestling coaches great striking coaches great jiu-jitsu huge facility everything state-of-the-art and I was felt like those guys were at a very high level early on like I remember Thiago Alves was making weight this back when like Thiago Alves was a gorilla remember how big he was at 170 you know when we fought Matt Matthews and he didn't make the weight and he looked like he weighed about 400 pounds he was so jacked well he was making weight once and it was a fight that they did I think it was at the Hard Rock I don't remember but it was somewhere where they had maybe was at the Palms somewhere were they had like the smaller ring I think I don't know why I remember this but what I remember was he was warming up for that day's fight he had made weight and then after making weight they had a workout that they would do to put weight back on him and one of the things that they would do is really burn him out so they had him he was in the gym I wish he was here I could ask him exactly what this was because I'm talking many years ago and he goes through this really hard pad workouts like I got that bam bam bam and they were saying they wanted to pump everything up full of blood and then they fill him up with carbs and it would just everything would blow back up so like the muscles get super dehydrated because he's draining himself out big time you know he was walking around north of 200 pounds you know cutting down to 170 and then after the weight cut they would swell him back up again so they got to put 30 pounds back on him in 24 hours and that was one of the methods that they used was exercise followed by fuel I guess it kind of makes sense right it also confuses me which confused me too cuz I'm a dummy and I was listening to him talking about this oh okay okay why is this like what's happening how are you doing this like what's like I get the principle that you're saying but what's the science behind right that's where I'm at science he looks like a gorilla when he fights yeah he really put that weight back on well and they had glassing and nobody is bigger at 1:55 in glassing t bow claisen t bow looks like a fucking light-heavyweight he's so big and somehow I know they makes it down to 55 like when he gets on the scale it's like you're yeah it's like Yoel Romero when he gets on the scare you like okay am i seeing something wrong like how is that 185 how's that pasta it doesn't make sense like I'm watching him weigh in he is 185 the guy says 185 he steps off and you're like what in the fuck am I seeing how's that possible I get I get that like with Tebow I've been in the locker room with Tebow a couple of times at ATT and I'm like a Tebow what do you weigh right now - like oh my friend like 190 I'm like you're not one night he get on the sched no you know I get on the scale i'm karis to use like 210 get out of here that one night he's so big he's huge he's so big yeah look how big he is look a hundred fifty five pounder look at the size of him and he zero five eight five nine yeah built like a tank he's so big he's so strong dude he's the most diesel guy that I've ever seen at 155 like it that is about as thick as it means there's no room for error there and he made weight a lot yeah I mean he might have missed it he missed it like once or twice but he made most of the time tbo made weight he it was miserable for him well go back to that one picture that you just showed oh it's him fighting somebody no none of that one right there that's um tractor yeah no not tractor no no no um Oh God I can I know he talking about Brazilian care Maseo room what's this my friend ooh yeah what is that crazy nickname god damn I can't remember his name the same here Ronaldo turn our doctrine on yeah turn Aldo 485 at UFC Brazil did he fight anything about 480 by 485 I believe I know he fought Nick Diaz also at 70 I feel like teeth I don't know if - I fought in the UFC at 85 though no I don't did you do it yeah but when you were saying that thing about um when you said about what you said about ATT mm-hmm I agree but I mean even further back than that the earliest guys yeah Frank Shamrock was wondering shamrock and then the mill and and militant yeah the rank shamrock was the guy really figured out conditioning yeah that's how he beat Tito yeah first time yeah for sure he was so small in that fight he was tiny he was like 190 and that fine Tito was a gold Willa he was a big fella yeah Wars out that was when the weight class was 200 pounds - yeah he had to make 199 yeah that was a the early days you know yeah it was very different back then man I was um I was scrolling through five pass watching the whole like the entire events mm-hmm and I get down to like mm I guess like you scrolling through it's like 2017 has all these events across the screen you got a scroll 16 the same thing 15 starts going down and you get to 10 it's like it's still less but you still gotta crawl across the screen then you get to like 7 or you get to like 8 and it's like five events right five events five events and that's it you know like mm-hmm I have 21 UFC fights under my belt but there were five ufc's a year back then yeah like like now there's like two months you get like six seven seven cards well I feel I felt like you got fucked and Josh Thompson a lot of guys in your era cuz you they cut out the 55-pound division for a long time and then you went out and fought up Bodog and all these other organizations there was no 55 for how many years right you yeah like 2004 - mm 2005 - like 2010 for sure they don't come back and tell don't fight her yeah like that's when Gilbert and Josh Thompson we're having those epic Wars over in Strikeforce yeah it's like those years like there was those guys like you Thompson and I feel like Gilbert Gilbert staked his claim in the UFC and had some epic fights in the UFC but I honestly don't think we see the same Gilbert that we saw instead force ya know we know one you know one could say better than you because you've been in there that how much those wars will just take out of you they will and a guy like like the wars that Gilbert and Josh went through that Strikeforce and Gilbert is that kind of guy he's just like his following the aerials you know that's it they're not they're not backing down and they got the chins to take it yeah you know there's not there's not a lot of guys that can that can take it like that I haven't been in a lot of wars that that were back and forth even if the fight had some attrition there was a lot of times it was um I was winning the striking battle and it wasn't taking as many shots as those guys have taken right um and they hey you have to have a chin to do that yeah man like I couldn't imagine it to this day having been in having I have like my record shows like 60 something fights I have like 80 plus fights overall and I still like I look at some of those fights like Diego and Gilbert and I'm like man I'm so glad Joe I remember as a kid I was laying on my couch watching Vernon white and pancreas I'm laying there watching and he's getting his ass beat and he gets to the third round and he turns it around knocks the guy out right and I'm like I roll off of the cow's I get on my knees and I'm like God please let me have fights like that those are the kind of fights I when I please please bees I'm like this young kid you know I just and I want to do that I want to have epic fights like that right but now that I'm done and I'm looking back at it like there are times I watch that style fight when I get hit I'm just like oh oh it's it's still it hurts it didn't hurt then but like it hurts now I can feel like a slight physical pain from it not like it breaks my heart it's yeah that part will always hurt but I mean like that looks brutal it's painful it's not but it looks that way but you know those fights with Gilbert and and like Gilbert and Diego mmm when they're still in it that shit hurts yeah you know well Gilbert didn't have to fight him that way that's why I was so crazy yeah as a Gilbert decided to use his skills and fight a technical fight he would have been you know he was the better fighter technically at the time but he just said fuck it let's go to war you know yeah like I mean it's just not a whole lot of people that are willing to do that yeah that I think that's what it is um like Aaron like my fight with Aaron Riley I was able to figure him out and I could pick him apart so a Terran is the kind of guy who would go to war with you mm-hmm like if I figured you out I'm not gonna go like this I'm not giving you a chance fuck you right now that's why I don't have to prove to anybody else how much of man I am and on the other side of that whole like getting hit that shit's nonsense that prove how much of a man you are by getting hit that's that's nonsense I like when guys like Gilbert choose to go crazy and go to war but that's on him that's because he wants to that is on him but you know like there's a guy who did something like that and he was willing to go to war but you can see he still kept his technique when he went to war and I'm talking about max Holloway when he when he went he with Thomas when he's like right here right now he started trading but he wasn't just sitting in the pocket trading he was throwing his getting out coming back getting something and getting out yeah that's how you do that yeah you know you don't just sit there and go okay I got mine now you get yours now just bite down on that mouthpiece and wing punches yeah thought that I mean that's Diego specialty Diego's the best blood-and-guts fighter ever I mean every single fight he's ever had is blood and guts I always go back to his fight with Martin Kampmann lost the first two rounds he's got its face hanging off like literally like like I was aam be yeah and he's chasing after Martin Cameron and he wins the third round wins the third round against Ellenberger he's fighting Ellenberger who's at the time you know a strong powerful 170 big punch Diego's got his back in the third round he's beating him up I mean that's just blood and guts that guy's got more blood and guts than virtually like 99% of the population of the planet Earth Diego is one of those guys too that he's a scary individual when you when you look at him is like okay that's a potential opponent specially in his prime mm-hmm but away from that he likes now he's it really especially now I was um when he fought Riggs like I felt I feel like like those two kind of personalities they're just gonna be like added at each other all the time and you feel like that's how they're gonna be always but like a guy like Diego like look at what he's doing with with with the guys in in Albuquerque's hell I forget the guys name but he's helping out that guy that that his big UFC Fan the down syndrome and you know yeah that's amazing but like like he's committed to this it's not like it's not like and it's not like hey check me out I'm do it you know what I mean never lie all the time like he's with the guy like Diego yeah he's a good dude he's a very good dude yeah that rigs fight was crazy too cuz rigs never thought that Diego's got kale it's deafening ko2 when the right hook like early in the fight - it was like and Riggs is one of those guys that see I don't think that he ever totally showed in the Octagon what he was capable of in the gym and he also is a guy that peaked during like the kind of like the Rich Franklin era you know like when he fought Matt Hughes didn't he miss wait when he fought for the title yeah he missed a weight against Matt Hughes and Matt Hughes Kimura 'dom and but the what I do always heard is that Joe Riggs in the gym was a world beater yeah like people would spar with him they'd be like holy shit like Joe Riggs is like a world champion like he's that good and that he would be dusting up all these like really high-level guys in the gym there's there's something though about being in the gym and I know you know this but the thing that about being in the gym versus being inside the Octagon it's that the stakes are real now like in the gym a lot of guys will open up more because you can't really lose there you can't you know but when you're in the fight itself yeah you are you you kind of you don't want to pull all the triggers because if this bullet misses right right I'm exposed I got no defense to that usually you're not you're not putting everything on the table that you would in the gym because the risk is so much greater and I think that's where we're the guys who can perform who step up to the game I believe that's the the aspect that they have to their game that that's missing from some of these guys who are world beaters in the gym but when they do they just can't bring it to the field yeah it's a mental strength for sure yeah and it's a confidence in your technique in in and the outcome some people think that the word against them you know there's an attitude that some people have like never works out for me fucking no more I can't catch a break but it's it's interesting because those are the guys that can't catch a break and you always wonder he always wonder what came first the chicken of the egg is it the attitude that is making their life this impossible puzzle to solve or is it they just got they just keep getting shitty rolls of the dice I think it's the attitude probably it's like it's a snowball effect from the very first decisions you make real early on especially when competing you know like everybody knows that there's times where you can quit everybody knows there's times where you you know you didn't train as hard or you didn't push his heart you didn't and some people don't some people don't learn like they have those moments like when you're a little kid and you know maybe you're wrestling or something like that and you got scared you didn't perform well and then you go back you know okay that sucked I don't want to do that again I got to figure out how to fucking toughen up or I got to figure out how to just perform and some people just don't they'd some people just run away from me I run away never they never see that thing again yeah it's like this the weird little moments in fights that you could see happening where guys are exhausted but they dig down you know what fight I always call upon like here's a dude who's got impossible mental strength Darren Elkins Mirsad BEC dick Marissa BEC dick is lighting him up like a Christmas tree in Times Square I mean he's just fucking him up he is on point he looks like a future champion he looks fantastic Darren Elkins won't stop he won't stop he keeps coming he keeps coming he's absorbing punches he's covered in blood he's getting punched and kicked and shinned and fucking elbow keeps coming keeps coming keeps coming boom he catches them you see Becht akuaba and you're like oh no boom head kick like what the fuck Darren Elkins has pounded him out and then the referee stops to fight and then Elkins steps off him is like it's like goddamn like that is that is the reward for having indomitable speed like that that is a the kind of victory cry that you only get when you went through hell and you did not give up yeah that that fight itself after the second I believe it was you just like this is like this should be stopped right this should be stopped these dopes there's no chance and I don't really watch them get beat up as much so I'm like tweeting about the fight and watching and I'm looking back and forth and their holy fuck upside down I love that guy and then Elkins chokes out Michael Johnson it shows people yes skills that's that's that's the other thing there it is right here I mean we're Saad Beck tick it was super fucking talented like just an undefeated coming into this fight and Darren was covered in blood and he got crucifix tear and he's getting smashed with punches and elbows but L can't he's just one of those guys Darren just doesn't give up man and the other thing about mossad is miss uh I've trained at massage massage trains hard his conditioning look at that his conditioning is on point look at this that's great that's so crazy you know there's another scream like that when cat Zingano beat Amanda Nunez yeah it's another one like that one number her victory dude that one is bone-chilling you hear the scream you're like whoa hmm like it gets you here like I might I got goosebumps just thinking about yeah listen to that dude that meant a lot to her man you can hear it yeah dude that's some shit you can't fake yeah no there's something that about what you were saying though about um people like walking away from for these things it's it's it makes me think of like of a kid I'm sorry this is this is gonna be like a bunch of things tied into one thing but babies when they're first born like first thing to come out of baby usually cry right right and it's like my thought on that is like this is the first time they felt anything outside of that womb right and and they don't know what pain is like a pain tolerance the first time you got kicked it it hurt a lot more than it does now yeah right so like every sensation is new for them right and then you're growing up and you grow up to be these people and your parents are telling you can do anything but at the same time they're telling you don't do that right right so it's like like the mind is your brain is this this is blank slate when you're born and um you get all these different influences and this goes back to the people that are like I can't catch a break I can't catch a break it's like oh we are we doing this right because for so many people to have this attitude yeah you know like what where where is that coming from because it's there are so many people like that and then there are people that are like that at times and then but they can they can either come out of it and and start having good things or and then they go back into it they bounce back and forth but why are people the way they are like that the mod the human mind to me is like the most amazing confusing like ever it's everything but like there's no rules yeah I mean everybody's different there everybody's similar but everybody's different and your attitude has a giant effect not just on your life but on other people's lives around you that's the other thing about it those I can't catch a break guys yeah get them the fuck away from me I can't I can't be around those guys I don't want to hear that shit I don't want to hear that shit I don't buy it cuz everybody has bad breaks yeah I've had a shit ton of bad breaks but you know what I did I stayed up yeah and I thought through it and I and I figured out what the fuck I did wrong and then I went back it's like I fucked up everything I've ever done a hundred times there's no way there's no other way to do it and I've had a bunch of shitty breaks everybody has but you got to realize when you have those shitty breaks what that is it's an opportunity for you to reassess reboot get better figure out another way find another way through it's just a little challenges and the people that look at those challenges with world wars have these challenges they're cancer those people are dangerous to be around they were robbed you of your enthusiasm they don't give you any fuel they're the opposite of fuel yeah like the fuel people they're the holy people that are kicking ass the people that are out there just fucking hustling always always getting things done got like my friend Jocko every morning I'll check his Instagram page 4:30 shows a picture of his watch get after it he's out there working out 4:30 in the morning he does it every fuckin morning why because because he doesn't want to that's how you do it you go and get after it you don't make any excuses and those kind of guys are fuel but those I can't catch a break guys they're the opposite of fuel they're just pissing on your fire they're no fun and though and then the people that surround them are all idiots cuz only idiots want to be around I can't catch a break guys yeah only a dummy stick around after a while even if they're your good friend you got to be like bro you got to fucking stop you got to stop at those I can't catch a break bullshit all the time you're complaining you could be instead hustling you could be instead chasing your dream you could be instead figure out what you're doing wrong trying to prove certain aspects of your life getting your shit together reading a book meditating something fucking something but this I can't catch a break shit is not helping anybody and it pushes everybody away from you but some people they get caught in that pattern and it might be their parents it might be how they were raised somebody might have told them they were useless real early on it's stuck and they just they always they never feel like they get enough reassurance they never feel like they get enough motivation and they feel like other people get more and they look at all these other people who computer how come she gets this how come he's got that going on and that all that's bad for you too that shit ain't no good for you how much of that is tied into not paying attention to yourself not not knowing yourself you know how much time how much of that is it's time has tuned in to are tied in to you always on like oh your brain always outside of yourself you you flushing with your flooding your brain with TV or Instagram or this you know and not not something that even even reading a book I believe is is different oh when you're watching TV what you're watching you know what I mean if you're watching something that that has a message where you have to think where you you can see yourself in that and you can put yourself in these situations and you're like oh well that's I can empathize with that or I can this but when you're just watching Oh spending money on cars and and we're making it rain and this and that you know um and wonder how much of that because like the thing I found is like entertainment isn't what it used to be and this this is I'm gonna sell all this shit back in my day entertainment like entertainment wasn't what it is now now it's just like bright lights and flashing bombs right first is like something that you could actually feel I feel like it's a lot less of that well there's some entertainment that you could feel like TV shows you watch black mirror that'll freak them how do you make you think there's still some good shit that's being made stranger things find it so much more like I feel like the the bigger things like the things that most people have access to I think that's what it is right right but is it that they have more access to that or is that the easiest thing the easiest thing to to consume it's very easy to consume it's mindless and everybody wants cars Lulu the car everybody wants money look at his money you know it's like you just get sucked up in it and it's a very low level frequency that everybody sort of has like a little bit of it and you see this I'm dude with his open shirt all these chains and he's all these girls behind him in their underwear everybody's dancing is like this guy's life's a party yeah my life is a party I can't catch a fucking break I'm over here I can't catch a break it's cool it's it's cool sometimes you know yeah but like Tom's silly yeah exactly there's a point like like you know who's a deep guy fuckin chillin and shells very deep yeah and he he he pointed this out to me through a different way but there's a point where everything becomes a bad thing there's a point where like humility is a bad thing there's a point where having fun is a bad thing it's like yeah you can't you can't like eating doesn't isn't always a pleasure if you're constantly eating if you're never hungry you don't appreciate it as much as if you were hungry right yeah is if you're if you're starving and they feed you and you're you start you you're full and you have to keep eating that's not fun right right right yeah so there's this moderation thing that I feel that's missing and I'm trying to find that balance myself man with what with life with with there's a bunch of different things with with how much time I spend doing this first this especially now that I'm not fighting because that was for a long time that was the biggest part of my days you know just just trading and everything else and now like I still get to Train but I have more time and a lot of time by myself in my own head so I'm back to reading I wasn't shilling the guard that exposed that crime kid yes for being a racist and his family was alright and then his mother said something like contacted shilling about keeping money in the what with the whites or some shit yeah Joe is um Joe reached out because he wanted that you wanted to know who wants like bring the kid out a training ballot or van yeah kid the kid it was a viral we shouldn't pull the kid up Jones he's a little kid he's you know I don't feel like we should give the kid any more exposure yeah well it's not because the kid didn't do anything wrong right right he was just crying the most well yeah and everybody was like AWS poor kid you know now I don't I don't know this to the part of his part in the bullying thing but what we're talking about is is his his mom's conversation else and that's where it got like that's where it got twist and it what's that proven that was his mom it definitely wasn't someone trolling i I don't know everything is fucking a mystery today up is down down his office a lot of trolls out there man I feel like I feel like there's been there's been reports that it was and then there was reports that it wasn't and I didn't pay so much attention to it that I could be like positive as to what what the ruling was yeah put on the conversation that she had with Joe was Big Joe reached out to bring him out and she was like look I'm just trying to put some money in this account basically yeah and um Joe was like hey I'm trying to give him something more valuable than money and she said something want something out go fun go fun right and then there was something else joe said like what's the money going to oh yeah pure bullion with money yeah I could eat but I forgot how it turns memory chips and the money within the white yeah it was something something yeah she said that but I don't know like like why did she even bring that up like what in Joe's context made her go to that card white dude shaped head covered in tattoos took a chance she took a chance she took a chance it's like white power I don't know man maybe she's just a fucking dummy I mean though the family is like conserve Confederate flags and shit and some of their photos that's that's still in the flag the state flag in Mississippi yeah no I didn't that's crazy see that that's crazy to me because like I didn't grow up knowing about that like I like as a kid in the Bahamas like I didn't even know right what the I knew I came at 15 yeah so like you know the years when everything's being set mmm I was in the Bahamas they gave me your brain so when I got here like I still had no idea what the Confederate flag was I I told his people it's like I didn't know a lot of US history you know we learned Bahamian history in the Bahamas and when I got here I didn't know anything about that the Confederate flag didn't mean anything to me until I was in my 20s man Wow and in Texas to this day my daughter where she lives where her house is maybe like four miles away I was visiting and there there on the corner with with a trailer out and they've got like Confederate flags for sale for sale on the corner just line up they have them out you know just line them flying people still drive around I was in Florida with Dustin and um we were driving and there's a truck with a US flag posted on the back and Confederate for them not like posted on the car I mean when a flag pole flying a flag pole as it driving if you love the South the South needs a new flag okay you can't have a flag I got no problem with you love in the South the South's got a lot of great quality huh you guys need a new flag you can't have the flag of the dudes who are fighting for slavery yeah you can't have that anymore Joe they weren't fighting for slavery yeah that argument is a piss-poor argument that falls apart that argument is one of the shittiest arguments and people try to they try to like soldier up and use big words and and try to repackage that argument they wanted slavery yeah period they're fighting naah mcc's yeah slavery they wanted people to work for free that's like a big part of what it was there was a lot of other shit going on as well that was a big part of it that was a huge part of it and I mean it's it's representative in the laws that came right after slavery was abolished did you know that there's a reason why you know when people think about people from the south people think of them as being like slack-jawed and kind of stupid that's like the worst stereotype right right southern people yeah there was a hookworm epidemic in the south for years where a substantial portion of the population had hookworm where they were walking around barefoot and they got shit in their feet and those parasites infected their brain and compromised the way they think and severely diminishes your your level of thinking so does that pull that shit up Jamie does that mean we that came up out of a podcast right didn't someone bring it up to us I feel like it was Rhonda Patton no was it Rhonda someone like that some smartypants when that happens does that does that however that affects your brain does that pass on you know a Russians because you're little change your DNA I bet it does I bet everything changes your DNA here it goes how a worm gave the South a bad name here it is make the show better for more than three centuries a plague of unshakeable lethargy blanketed the American South began with ground itch a prickly tingling in the tender webs between the toes soon followed by a dry cough weeks later victims to come to an insatiable exhaustion and an impenetrable haziness of the mind that some called stupidity adults neglected their fields and children grew pale and listless victims developed grossly distended bellies and angel wings emaciated shoulder blades accentuated by hunching all gazed out dully from sunken sockets with a telltale fisheye stare the culprit behind the germ of laziness of the south of fliction was sometimes called was Nick Kate or americanus the American murderer Wow better known today as the hookworm millions of those blood sucking parasites lived fed multiplied and within the guts of up to 40% of the population stretching from Suffolk southeastern Texas to West Virginia hook swarms stymied development throughout the region and bred stereotypes about lazy moronic southerners so wait as you're reading that fuck yeah that's gross I remember learning about hook worms as a kid in the Bahamas but as you're reading that I'm like you know what maybe this is I go through this whole thing in my brain as you're reading maybe if they didn't do what they did to Native Americans because those guys had moccasins and they probably had moccasins because they learned about this a couple hundred years ago no shit right if anybody was gonna be barefoot it'd be the Native American right and they're like no not a good move gotta cover your feet man this bunch of shit gets in ink it's stupid yeah I gotta find the Buffalo anymore that's way that's a sharing information comes in handy man that's a good point that's a real good point because I always think that when I see that those survivor dudes that like to walk around barefoot yeah those crazy dudes to get the thick calluses in the bottom of their feet and the idea is that you know like hey if the world goes to shrimp you're gonna need to be able to walk barefoot yeah that's a sort of sense maybe maybe you make shoes you fuck you know there's a bunch of shoes in warehouses well yeah exactly yeah how would you run out of shoes I mean if you just if you found out the world was gonna end you bought 20 pairs of shoes that might last you to your dead yeah maybe depends on what you're doing what kind of hiking you're running a lot you yeah you gotta you're gonna have to be on your feet more because you got hunt now that's true you're gonna have to be hiking yeah maybe you need more in 20 you don't need more than 50 50 pairs of shoes probably repurpose them too yeah but that's what what the Native Americans did right my collegues yeah they they they used every piece of the Buffalo yeah I know they were smart too because they didn't develop like imma I'm on this barefoot running kick I run with barefoot shoes yeah I either run with those Vibram FiveFingers which are my favorite but when it gets muddy out this doesn't have a lot of traction and I like this other company called vivo barefoot plus they don't you don't look as dorky divided the five fingers one you're committing to the project right you gotta walk around with gloves on your feet and people mock you mercilessly like Jamie he mocks me mercilessly but the vivo barefoot ones are just like they just have no padding that's but they have good traction so I like running in those too but when you run in something there's no padding at all you do all the muscles in your foot develop because that your toes have to work and push whereas like these things these things are way stiffer than what I run with most of the time these things are hard man it's like a cast like this shit is like a cast for your foot you know and so the idea is when your foot is in those kind of like a normal running shoe it's not really squishing and pushing and your all your muscles aren't getting activated and so they're just not as strong they're just they're just weaker you know and that it's not good for anything it's not good for your balance not it's not optimum yeah better to run with running shoes on than not run but in terms of like foot strength and like just maximize your ability to move correctly and have good balance it's not nearly as good it's it's you can feel it too when I first started doing MMA for a long time until I went down to Florida and was that American Top Team there were certain things that I didn't do without shoes on like if we were kickboxing I would put on shins and I would wear my wrestling shoes really I just didn't like wrestling without my toes out like that you know especially when I was throwing kicks right but um over time I got more comfortable with it but over time getting more comfortable with it I could feel the difference when I would have my shoes on versus not having my shoes um yeah versus not having my shoes on and it's I had I felt more dexterous I felt more agile yourself more in connection with you know with yeah growl yeah what I was doing yeah that's legit that's I mean that's what I do with these barefoot running shoes I mean I believe in them 100% I think there's a bunch of good companies that make them morale makes some good ones too but I just feel like we have too much padding on our shoes your yeah I lift weights and do everything else totally barefoot I just feel like or we are like I like chucks like converse all-stars yeah those are good too yeah because they don't they're just flat you know those are good for lifting weights sometimes we want like a little bit more but most of the time I do a barefoot I would say 99% of the time I do it barefoot it's just I think it's just better for your feet you know I just think the same thing when I was saying with gloves and punching I just think it's unnatural it's unnatural I have a bunch of shit underneath your foot your foots not designed for that yeah yeah all right when you and you say that I start thinking about um how people I design and what people are designed for and then thoughts and they go everywhere sometimes my thoughts like run into another hey that's a good idea like you come together but when you say that I start thinking about when you talk about changing your DNA where we started with the hookworm thing and your feet if you take someone from an area that is where they have to be agile for and you take them to the place where you just have to be strong you take a child from from the agile area and you make them grow up in the strong area in an area where you have to be strong physically strong does um how does that child fare in that environment as he's growing up does he adapt not as fast as the people that already have those traits but does he adapt and be able to survive and then can he go back to that to the agile lifestyle and with and take some of that strength depends on how big he gets you know like if you were talking like strongman strength those guys are not known for their agility right they're giant you know there's there's a trade-off for sure there's a power trade-off you know that's one of the things that's so terrifying about Francis and gah know is that he's 270 pounds cuts down to 265 but he moves like a panther right it's like he's not missing anything like you know I mean he's got ridiculous power but he's also fast as fuck like that left hook that he hit over him with it's like Jesus that's like a welterweights left hook fast as fuck but he's hitting you like a nuclear weapon it's just a different kind of power on his punches a different kind of power in his body but he also has the ability to move fast like a smaller person most of time when you get a really powerful person there's some sort of compromise that has to be made and but what if you take what happens when a guy like Francis in Ghana you develop his wrestling so that it's like a Cain Velasquez could you though at 33 like that's that's the problem yeah like you know and how much does the time does he not like to wrestle cuz that was the word that I had heard is that he wasn't doing any groundwork it was very little groundwork being done they were just trying to keep the fight standing the problem with that is you can't just do what you like to do you you can't just do what you're awesome at he's already awesome at putting people in another dimension yeah I mean he hits harder than anybody I've ever seen I've never seen anybody that hits as hard as Francis and Ghana and that's that power cube thing shows it I mean he got the highest registered punch Tyrone Spong was number two his punch was something like 10,000 pounds more power or more than the Tyrone spawns which is crazy he's a maybe shouldn't be allowed to hit people he's a monster he's so powerful but it's like all things balance out right like steep a just said yeah you're powerful for about five minutes yeah and I'm not gonna be there for those five minutes I'll be over here and I'll be over here and I'll be ducking and getting the fuck away from you he took it took a few it takes a guy likes deep a that can is smart and fight smart and knows the game like knows like you can't keep this up but Kane be able to do the same thing they expect so Aaron Cain young Cain for sure like the Cain two fought Cheick Kongo the Cain have fought Ben Rothwell that came Jesus Christ that Cain could have done that to anybody but I think what you deal with with Cain was like a mental strength that no one's body can hold up to yeah you know I mean like he just drove forward with so much tenacity that his body's like tires are flying off and bolts are breaking and there's just too much strength in the mind when you say that I picture I see it in my head and I picture him moving forward a lot like nurmagomedov a lot just with better striking what people forget and never ran off was injury written as well yeah he was constantly plagued a lot of guys at 8 8 you know I had three or four of my UFC fights because Josh Thompson got hurt you know Brian I can think of I can think of off the top of my head two of them where where it was because Josh was hurt and they what do you think about that do you think that they trained too hard or do you think that that is just the way you have to train if you I mean if you won't look at world-class fighters aka is one of the top gyms in the world Luke Rockhold Daniel Cormier Cain Velasquez Josh Thompson and you can keep going down the road there's a ton of like guys that people haven't heard of that are top-level nurmagomedov obviously ton of guys also that are training out of there that are super super high level it's a big fucking tank filled with sharks now you look at their success and it's just undeniable they have incredible ratio of success like world champions some of the best guys ever but a lot of injuries now is that just what happens when you get both things I believe especially with those guys where those guys are concerned it has to do with the number of quality guys that they have that are fighting at the same time mm-hmm and only they're only being so many hours in the day so they're in the gym at the same time having to do the work that they need to do to prepare for a fight yeah but they're all on the same mat and guys are running into each other right like so Luke is over here and khabib is over here but they've got five different guys rotating for them and one of those five guys is the reason that no Magomedov gets hurt run all right that's a problem right like that doesn't happen in boxing you never see world-class boxers sparring in the same ring as other world-class bar same time the same time it's stupid yeah that's a size issue in terms of the gym size it's definitely a thing in that in that regard um also the the layout of the gym you know like a boxing ring you could put them in a quarter off area right and nobody else could be involved right you you section off the mats but then you have to have coaches in between peoples or when these guys starting to come together the coach comes in hey guys who start going back to your area you know there's there's just no no borders right and without having borders and a guy like Hector Lombard coming after you you know you're gonna move yeah I don't crash into people yeah yeah I think that's a real good point I think it's the level of talent the aggression in the room the level of ambition in the room all the above yeah and the fact that they have that philosophy to just go hard I mean they go hard yeah like I talked to DC about he's like sometimes Cain and I spar and sometimes we fight yeah like damn you know you have fights before the fight like legitimate full-on you know fights that happens that happens yeah I remember being um being underneath t bow trying to come to my feet and he stole big punches with little gloves on right we're wearing little gloves sparring MMA gloves and he's hitting me and hit me in the face like three times and I'm like that's entirely too hard but if I don't get up he's just gonna keep going right but like that's what it is man when you're in the gym there's some guys that they just they just they only have one speed yeah yeah and a lot of those guys are the guys that could perform when it's time to step in eh you know well that's the story about TJ Dillashaw all the alpha-male guys were saying the TJ when he was spar would spar real hard and then when you would hurt or me try to kill you yeah you know just how we go but look it's a fucking world champion for a reason to time you know you know that that tenacity you know that makes you sometimes a problematic sparring partner that same mental strength and who knows who's telling the truth because this is obviously alpha male they were a little salty after he left and you know I don't think they're lying but I think there's two two sides there's two sides of story and there's also you know people accentuate their position yeah I mean if you get if you you watch a video versus hearing two people though a story right you see three different things yeah man I've had people tell me things like man you won't believe what happened and then I watched a video I'm like wait a minute what did you think you saw cuz I didn't see that I saw I saw something pretty reasonable but when these guys go back and watch fights and they're like I won that fight yeah like no you didn't that's a real problem yeah like some some people and again those are really the same guys is that I can't catch a break guys the ones who think they won when no one else thinks they want yeah watching like Queen man what fight are you watching like you definitely didn't win look at your butt your face yeah the fucking judges man that that is really the number one problem if all the rules all these different things those are all problem the judges are the biggest problem by far like every it seems like every UFC I'm waiting to interview the fighter I'm in the cage and they're reading the scorecards and I just go like every UFC it's like one fight at least well I'm like what what the fuck did they just say 3027 who how what yeah guys getting their asses kicked taken down getting fucked up on the feet and they're winning rounds 30-27 yeah ten nine ten nine ten nine what yeah I've seen that I saw I saw a fight recently I can't remember what it was when when the judging came up I heard 30 27 and I was like there was no guarantee that any guy won any of those oh sorry there was a guarantee when I heard 30 27 I thought this guy won because I'm like he won that round so they thought you won the other two right you know and then they gave it to the other guy I'm like how does that how did he lose that one round it's full incompetence man it's just full incompetence is it what is it like now when you're you're working for UFC and you're doing the Fox stuff like Fox coverage of UFC deep do you do you have like a set schedule like how often you guys do it um so there are like seven actually there were seven when I started I think they're more guys now in that rotation hmm and um you don't have a set schedule so they just call you up hey you've around Thursday well they give it they give it to you a few weeks out not yet plenty of advance notice so like the next desk job I'm working is the Barbosa Lee fight which one is a that's on the 21st of April okay no I think that's Atlantic City oh yeah that's Frankie Edgar's fighting who's helps one sub Swan I don't so about that fight I don't like the fight I don't I don't have a problem with it like I feel like Frankie just got knocked out yep and that's really soon to come back if anybody can bounce back from something like that it's a guy like Frankie yeah but I felt the same way about Bisbing fighting after he didn't get knocked out he got dropped by George and then got choked unconscious he was like yeah shouldn't take that gasps no fight so soon yep I completely agree like and I feel that way about this fight because I feel like Frankie wants this fight because he wants to get that taste out of his mouth mom but like it's still gonna taste the same any time you go back and watch that fight you're still gonna have those feelings right you're going to win your next fight more than likely you're Frankie Edgar yeah you don't have to rush it like let your brain rest recover that's how I feel about it but that's only because I'm 41 now if I was 26 I maybe I'd have been and I know Frankie's like 30 to 36 rank he's 36 when he's 36 um find out for us I'm pretty sure Frankie 36 but I'm like you want to go out there and do it but when I think about brain trauma and the things that I forget I've always liked my CDs flaring up yeah well you know he fought Cub just a couple of years ago and mauled him and got a last-second submission maybe he just thinks look they're a fucking thing in the world this guy can do to stop me yeah you know I fucked him up before I'm gonna fuck him up again it doesn't matter I'm not even gonna get hit I'm just gonna get a hold of him rag dolls like I did before but Cub Swanson King crack he can crack and he's got a kid now and he's got a second kid along the way and that doesn't quit does not quit and that makes dudes hungry and that fight is probably a massive motivating factor for AB Swanson and he eat there's a cub his Cub is still around and cub is still number four because he takes the lessons from these fights yeah he learned something in that fight with Frankie I can't see that fight going I mean there's a part of me too can see if I go in exactly same the same way but I can also see cub having made adjustments because of the lessons that he learned from that shore and then and he had to learn from the Ortega fight as well look at how Ortega handled Frankie he handed him very smart very creative I mean Cub fights a different way Cup is more of an in and out guy and he explodes on you and you know he keeps his hands down low with sneak shots on you know he does a lot of weird shit Cubs he's real creative he's got to watch out for the takedown and the wrestling control though because that that's a big factor in the fight that was giant that's where you got controlled but I mean it's a great fight I just again I'm just I'm just all about what's better what's better in the long run right you know well it's Toms River the problem is he's New Jersey and this is gonna be in Atlantic City you know the boys gonna come down and yeah I'm with you 100% I would like to see this fight but I would like to see this fight in six months yeah yeah I mean it's a good fight it's good fun fun and four eight Frankie could walk Frankie go in there and and wipe him out or do exactly what he did last time or it could be a battle and nothing comes of it but it's just like I'm like ear on the side of caution some good fights on this card man David branch and Thiago Santos I'm looking forward to that one that's a tricky fucking fight that Thiago Santos guy is a Mercker that died that dude crushes people and he um ever since his lost as spicy he's been like it seemed more focused he's a fucking animal man very dangerous striker and David branch coming off of that performance against Luke Rockhold he had Brock hold hurt yeah he had rock hold her and you know he wound up getting dominated I wound up getting mounted and beaten down got his back taken and smashed but he learned a lesson in that fight too for sure you learned a lot about conditioning when you fight a guy like rock Holt yeah Rockhold is one of the best in the division at top control he gets on top of dudes like what he did with Chris Weidman Fineman is a stud wrestler he gets on top of him and it's like he might as well out a building sitting on him he has a his body type is is is something that's hard to deal with but just how long he is but how good he is at jujitsu and the controls and positioning that's a problem man when you because you have to make that extra effort you know when you start hip escaping and and on a regular guy a guy that you're comfortable with the size you know you don't have to make as the movements or as long but Luke double his build in the way he is and his understanding of positioning that's a hard he's a heart out for a lot of guys yeah he's got that hogr Gracie type body yeah long yes strong it is it's weird it is just different it's like when I first rolled with like those guys over the the judo guys like amber see Manny Gambier Ian and Carl those guys I roll with them and it's like they're they have this Jiu Jitsu style that's like the timing is just off a beat somehow and hitting all these cameras and it's like it's it feels funky I feel like that's how rock holds body is Cody McKenzie was like that mom when I fought Cody I was like I'm really good at escaping back control and I peel him off and it's like fucking it so how much leg do you have what I mean is just keep going yeah yeah well that's what makes the Yoel Romero fight all the more impressive yeah you're Meryl shut that shit down entirely he's terrifying man but he's seen everything right like wrestling all the best guys in the world did you see the podcast I did with him and Joey deer I watched some of it and I was I like to listen to your stuff when I'm going to bed but like so it's all in my head sometimes when I follow up and I was in Texas I was driving all the time so I would listening when I leave leave Austin drive to Houston I would hear like 2 or 3 episodes because I can go in there and then coming back that's three hours or two and a half hour drive each right out here I'm not in the car as much so I get I get a lot of snippets right so I got some of some of the yo mail but I haven't got the hole that was amazing just talking about the program the wrestling program coming up in it what it was like amazing yeah I heard I heard some of that about how you know they're in a pyramid and and they they what was it the the top guys they get the best they getting some of the best food the best food the best accommodation they get three meals a day the other guys get two yeah yeah like everything is better that's and they're all working out with each other all the time so they're all around each other all the time and he's like everybody knows you hurt your wrist Oh everybody knows those the guys you're gonna have to go against yeah yeah that's see that see that that is a representation of capitalism Yeah right right it is exactly what it is it is capitalism inside of communism yeah yeah yeah just but keep people poor and hungry and like the best in the world the best they can do is get three meals a day right and live in a better place it's how we got pop we got political yeah but it's political and it you know people need motivation they need incentive for your actions people that think socialism is a good idea have never accomplished anything there's no way you've competed there's no way if you're a competitor and you understand the benefit and the value of competition I'm not talking about capitalism competitive I'm talking about just actual competitive in anything yeah anything where you're trying to get a position and it's a very difficult position so you want to work hard in the other people around you know about merit-based performance like you know like you you should you should achieve based on your merit based on what you have actually shown to like how much work you've put in what you've accomplished you should benefit from that the idea that everybody should be paid equally and that everybody should just have oh man we'll just contribute and just I'll give a little you give a little those fucks never give their share they're never good they're never the best at what they do they never know how to compete they just don't they just don't it's not saying that you there's not some aspects of a community where we should have some socialist ideas like I believe in free education I believe that without a doubt our nation is wealthy as it is can afford to have better health care better education yeah those two things I think are gigantic factors in just having a healthy community but if you want a quality of outcome you can suck my dick that's nonsense there's no such thing as equality of outcome if you have real freedom real freedom you're always going to have inequality of outcome because the real freedom is a guy like Jocko wants to get up at 4:30 in the morning and work out everyday whereas some people just want to sleep till noon I'd rather just lay in bed man I like to go to the beach and hang out I'm not I'm not in a hurry I'm not in a rush good I hope you enjoy yourself there's nothing wrong with that but if you want the same amount of money as that motherfuckers up at 4:30 in the morning hustling constantly cranking out got three different things in the air three different things going on projects constantly always in the middle of something yeah always push and always try and improve always look at themself always being self-critical always analyzing what do I have to do to get better and you're not but you want the same outcome for you I thank you I completely agree with that I feel like there's this the world or especially the country is in the best place when there are more people in the middle when there when when there's these extremes and I feel like the peak of people that were in the middle they've somehow been dragged further out to these extremes because yeah having um like going far right with some things right um no you don't get anything you don't get this unless you you work for it you're like yeah absolutely 100% and and and but like some of some of the things that go along with that yeah but then this everybody gets a trophy every like no everybody that doesn't get a trophy there-there's like you should get a trophy if you were able to compete to the level that deserve that's deserving of a trophy and that's it like everybody shouldn't get one you lost you shouldn't get the same thing that the guy that won got you did well and you lost me too and there's a big competition with a big group and you did better than some of them yeah maybe you get some of the some of the pie but like this whole thing of yeah everybody's equal I come I disagree I feel like but I feel like there's there's aspects of everything that should be everywhere so when I say that what I mean is like capital isn't like we thought we saw capitalism inside communism and that exactly right well inside capitalism there should be some some some socialism like like like let's look at the major league baseball right the Yankees they they they're in the playoffs every year because they can afford and they can afford to buy the best player but like look at look at Green Bay Wisconsin small market team they can win a Super Bowl because of the of the revenue share because of the socialistic revenue sharing inside the NFL you know it's it's it's a weird dynamic where there are things that that apply in different situations yeah but like people can't compartmentalize enough so that these things can happen and we can all make it work out like I feel like like you said about health care and education yeah health care and education we have the funds for those things to be to be good across the board but why is it that the schools in this in this rich area are always better they always have the better scores but then when you take that same you take the same type of effort and you put that somewhere in a poor area their scores come up and and they can compete right if they have the same effort from the faculty and the staff and whatnot but the same thing with like law enforcement law enforcement is is better in these areas where like it's like there's no crime here in this world rich people live and this yes but like if because they also have better law enforcement their kid their police patrolling that area in a different fashion like it's it's this weird thing where it's not equal it's not equal and it doesn't like those things should be equal but but as far as these people live in a poor area now and these people they they don't they have a lot of money because of a family wealth because of work ethic because of all that yeah like everybody everybody deserves to be safe everybody deserves to have that at the very least right so let's let's enforce the laws and and patrol and do those things in this area just as much as we do for this area right and put them put the money into that because that's a community thing now when we're talking about what they have they have nicer pools well they pay higher taxes and they do this thing okay well if you want that you've now that you you're safe enough and your education is where it is let's start reinvested in that community you know that's not let's not get get to the point where we can afford to be here so we go there know let we can afford to be there and but let's just try reinvesting in this community to make this community more like that one but if we have the protections to do that then I feel more comfortable reinvesting in this community yeah it's it's a weird all these things are all over the place and you got to put them together well we don't treat our country as if it's a giant community right if it was a giant community where everybody's equal we would look at all the problem spots and say okay well there's these crime-ridden poverty-stricken communities that can't seem to catch a break so the people that come out of that even though we're saying hey you have there's an open playing field to compete that's not true right because they're coming at it with a massive disadvantage from the jump education disadvantage an environmental disadvantage and what they see around them all the time they're around a lot I can't catch a break dudes right and a lot of trap a lot of criminals a lot of bullshit a lot of different ways you could go wrong a lot of things that could set you down a terrible path in life and it's around you all the time and if we tried to engineer society to say well how do we how do we have less people that are disadvantaged how do we have less losers what's the best way well you got to go to the problem spots all the problem spots we should be dumping money in and and I'm not saying that we shouldn't do anything overseas because I think a lot of the things that we do overseas probably help and protect us over here yeah but there's a lot of shit we don't have to do and that shit we could take that money and just fix cities just go in and throw a ton of money and compassion and education and community centers and make places safe for people to learn how to be an adult you know what the US military budget is your name since you have any idea no don't it's like 600 billion I think it's higher than that it's higher than that and the trillions in the truck that's like that that is crazy that that kind of takes me let's guess you say 600 I say success I say 1.3 trillion Wow I'm crazy though dude 600 billion I don't even know what 1.3 trillion looks like what is it dun-dun-dun we both technically both yeah the thing that when you put when I googled it the last one that was reported I suppose was 2015 it was 579 five nine seven billion what's year 21 2015 hmm the new one that Trump just signed that was approved is for 1.3 trillion that's must be where I heard it oh that's a lot of cash how much for education mr. Trump we don't need no stinkin books I think that's actually the whole bill that's 700 billion of that is for the military oh what's the rest of it for everything else cool yeah someone just said 700 billion for schools he'd be like what yeah we're we're not fucking around anymore yeah ready to take over we're gonna invest 10 years with 700 billion dollars a year in a school system man that sounds nice right what do you think the education budget is for the country if you had to guess what's the overall public education budget in the United States primary through high school I never thought about it that's awesome um we we go at 600 billion for the military I'm gonna go with a hundred billion I'll go a hundred million a hundred million dollars as of 2011 discretionary budget was 70 billion whoa that's up from education budget yeah 2006 it was 56 billion huh so it's it's higher than it has been in the past 70 billion and what does that cover this to me fucking pee yeah I would say that what I covered all what it's supposed to cover what actually covers is a different thing know what you'd supposed to cover I have to look deep into that you just said there's too many people to so many people so check this out i I've I think the same thing right and I did some slight research 1955 I think it was guess what the population of the planet was oh we did that the other day I was like 2 billion right yeah right two and a half yeah a half billion and now we're at seven and a half billion we went with them when I was in high school we went was like 85 I think it was five billion so just since 1985 to today it's gone up doubled from almost from this 50s and now it sees we've added another half to that 50% to that but like like I was thinking about that and I'm like looking at it and like if we're if it's exponential mmhmm right in 50 years we will have nearly 20 billion people on this planet yeah that's crazy that's crazy yeah everybody everywhere it's gonna look like Los Angeles like imagine if there was still like I think in like 18 in the 1800s they were like still millions of people on the planet not not billions Herod is right any other presidents 2017 budget provides 69 point four billion in discretionary funding is that but that's education yes for the education bill 139 point 7 billion in new mandatory funding for the US Department of Education the budget supports implementation of every student succeeds Act which embraces many of the reforms in administration along has long supported to improve outcomes for all students it also makes crucial investments that build the administration's work to advance educational equity and excellence support teachers and school leaders promote college affordability and completion these include I think college should be free I think we could figure out how to make College free I'm with Bernie Sanders on that it's a rare thing I just don't think you should be in fucking debt up to your asshole by the time you get out of school I think it's crazy it's a fucked up way to start your life and people like well you want to make a look at this it separates the people that really want it and the people that know bullshit did you get stuck in debt and you can't even get out of that debt it's not even regular debt it's blood debt I'm weird debt but doesn't doesn't having a more educated society help everybody everybody in the long run sure like like what how everybody make more money and everybody would make more money yeah like I don't less nosers but you would have to like make sure that whoever the fuck is teaching these kids like you have to be real stringent with what you're letting get pushed through if you're gonna throw that much money on it there's a lot of shit bag and teachers out there we'd have to clean that up you know a lot of people there's a lot of shit bag teachers out there now they want to give that's the dumbest shit of all time I'm like oh that is the dumbest shit of all time can't you can't expect teachers to become soldiers that's crazy that's not what they do they're not they're not warriors they shouldn't be out there having firefights with pilled up you know formal former high school students yeah it's fucking insane I don't know what the solution to that is honestly I do not know what the solution is you know the NRA thinks it's having guns everywhere the anti Second Amendment people think it's getting all the guns away but you're not gonna get all the guns away the thing about like people say guns don't kill people people kill people I'm like no people with guns kill people they definitely do here exactly how much the government would have to spend to make public college tuition free how much what do you think it is okay let me guess one trillion a year wait wait wait less weight less yeah I would say really I'm already to this article okay what does it say on about it well what is it again what is the website the Atlantic Atlantic it okay that's a left-wing website but it come out ridiculous I got updated this so the article says sixty two point six billion dollars a mere two but there's updates on the bottom of the article that said that's some readers say that's in addition to what they already spend so that makes it maybe double well you know here's one way they make it really fucking cheap have it available for free online everybody should be able to get an education online that's I've really firmly believe that I think they should have courses that you could just sign up and take them like a regular college course you don't have to be in a physical location anymore that's so retro that's so unnecessary get in your car and get to traffic and go to UCLA the only thing good about that is you're in the room with someone like a jordan peterson or some really good professor that's really inspirational and you're in there with him they talk to you and like you're like okay and you get to like be in their presence and see like oh this guy was probably like my age one day and he figured all this shit out and i go maybe some extra juice to that i used to have a bookmark saved I think it was Harvard it was a long list of recorded lectures that were from any class I think mmm there's probably was a limit to what they were doing definitely not accessible anymore especially for the public but it was fully accessible anybody that wanted that's why I had it saved hmm I don't know Joe I mean when I think about that like I said earlier like all these formulas fit into different things mm-hmm you say that and it's like you can be at home looking at them on the screen right and um learning versus being in the same room and it's like yeah but like you could also go to a strip club and watch strippers dance or you could be at home watching them porn and when you're at home watching him you can pull it out rip what mmm you know right so you're saying I'm saying is like if you're at your location home you're just gonna be to officer that's a that's a real problem you know louis c.k was saying once that he has a computer that he writes on it's not connected to the Internet yeah cuz you just can't get distracted force himself to I think I that's what I'm saying the problem is the distraction with having having access to everything right there that's true but you open the windows with the teach it that's that's that's the best part it's discipline its discipline and that goes back to what I believe that ties back into what I was saying before about all this entertainment out there everybody everybody's it is always like scratching at you like hey hey pay attention to me give me something to do so this is some online learning Harvard edu so they allow you to study the Pyramids of Giza ancient Egyptian art archeology and it's free this is a whole course on that that's nice there's a bunch of them how many courses do they have that are available for free tons another nice one that looked interesting excellent they have a methadone Oh medicine oh that's nice no problem you don't get credentialed so that's no one so you to have a job for it you can't show them like I took this freak rush past it but that seems to be less and less of a factor in in the future I think having a degree is going to mean less than it means now I I think so I feel like um with the internet yeah you can't if you have the right guidance you have the syllabus from from it from a college course right and you have the Internet without getting the paper that says you you've done it you can literally learn what you would learn in a classroom it's like a test for the job you do except you're a car stereo installation person you should have a real deep knowledge of the electrical systems in an automobile and what electronics sync up with that and how it works well and what makes them work and how does a radar detector work how does the CD player work how does it you should we have to take a test based on whatever the job it is you're interested in yeah you know and if you want to be a doctor obviously we're talking about different ball wax you know then you should have a full understanding of humans you're cutting people open and drain their shins and shit you should have a real deep understanding of the human body but like how does that do you any good if you want to be a mechanic or if you want to be you know whatever the fuck you do for a living there should be a way where you could like if you're an advertising executive you should take a test to find out how much you know about the advertising business and there's a lot of shit that you don't need to know that you want school for degree yeah there's there's some weird things that go along with that though it's like you have all these things that you have to take these courses to graduate yeah general education yeah yeah you have to get a general which is a good thing right yeah definitely understand you want to understand the world right right but um there are things that are more important you take that back to high school and we could talk about like everybody knows the Pythagorean theorem in high school but you can't fit you you can't do your taxes and you yeah you start working most people start working at like 16 when you start working at McDonald's or a gap or something at sixteen seventeen you're still paying taxes yeah yeah right so having having doing that in February and March in school in your math classes how is that not something that happens right you know it's just it's one of these weird situations where the education is important all right but let's learn the things that actually apply to life yeah I feel like you should get out of high school with a basic understanding of most things yes right like general education high school makes sense right but I feel like once get into college whatever the fuck you're trying to pursue well it should be very specified mm-hmm very specific to whatever the fuck your your you know your business is you don't need to take Gender Studies class but also you probably don't necessarily need all the textbook knowledge because there is um you know there especially there are certain jobs that actual experience matters more than a quick knowledge you you I don't I couldn't tell you exactly which ones well what Jamie does is a problem with a job he went to school to be an audio engineer but all that shit that you used back then like that shit's all useless how much of his useless I mean the hardest test I think I took was after we were all done was for Pro Tools it's basically for a computer programmers they get certified that you know this program very well like what's almost what you're explaining that program is like version six of the program it was it was back then I think they're updating it maybe once every two years it's been updated like four times this year probably they're on level like eleven now so it's like completely useless said I know all that they've updated all the limits are completely like unlimited things now so it doesn't even matter that you know all that so someone getting out of school with just the education that you got in school literally can't do it today you'd have to go back and do it again sort of they offer that at the school like you can go back and refresher right yeah for free that's part of the benefit of going to this school I would say they like to have the time and the ability to go back to Florida and stay there for a month so I could go take that class like can't take a month off of this I'm like who's gonna pay for my apartment down there and here it's a really tough situation you put yourself in this that's a lot with a lot of anything that has to do with technology right where it's constantly changing and and thing about technology it's like if like there's some savants in that you know these kids and these people that that pick up on technology and they understand it so well and they have no formal education with no real formal education technology is one of those things that I especially I feel like it's the most apparent thing where you don't have to go to school you have to have the experience yeah and you have to be engrossed in whatever the subject is exactly yeah but then again it comes back to what we're talking about with discipline like how much time do you want to spend to work on things and look that's applicable to finding like you you knew so many people in the gym that just did not put the time into drilling techniques and learning them and really getting a fully comprehensive understanding of why you're supposed to do something a certain way and they just kind of like listened a little bit worked out kind of hard and maybe they had a little bit of athletic talent and then they would come back in but the guys who would stay and drill and think and learn and take notes those guys always moved past yeah they always moved further and also the guys that were willing to do what was uncomfortable we're going to do things that they're not good at like um I didn't I didn't like it I like I said I don't like getting hit I didn't like getting hit I mean I accept that as a part of the job but I didn't like it when I first started training I probably feel like my first 1015 fights I was like showing up late to practice because boxing was first I didn't want to spar I didn't want to get hit Wow like I and so I was like well I don't like getting hit I got to avoid getting hit but I gotta be I gotta have studying things coming at me just to learn how to avoid that Wow so I wish I started showing up in time I started doing more boxing and I started doing more boxing I was like oh this is fun this is I like this I'm enjoying this same thing of wrestling I know how to sprawl and I knew how to shoot a double a basic double you know that the 1990s double but um then I started training with Tyron then I started training with Steve Brown and Dan Valmont and Jordyn lean and you know these these d1 wrestlers and starting to learn all the other aspects of wrestling there was something I did in the fight with stout where is an ankle break I tried to it's not it doesn't actually break your ankle it's just the name of the technique where you actually watch the tape and you you call it like a standing heel hook right where I have his ankle single-leg and I try to trip him and crank his leg down yeah and um like I would have never done that if I hadn't been wrestling with these kids and learning these things and there's so much so much about it and it just became a whole lot of fun now like I used to hate wrestling I used to not want to do it at all like it's all kind of like all I want to do you see that with everything you see that with jiu-jitsu guys getting into striking you see it with strikers getting into the ground game wrestlers getting strike it yeah they just don't want to do it they just don't and they also particularly don't want to get involved in something they're not really good at like if you're a monster at one thing if you're a monster on the ground you don't want to be a white belt a kid kickboxing yeah the legs chewed up and get your nose bloodied every time you spar and you you're covering up in the corner I can just grab this guy and make him my bitch and you can't even you gotta just eat shots you know yeah nobody wants that you saw that a lot with kick boxers in particular that would go into jiu-jitsu class and just did not like how they would get humbled you know they did not like it at all because they were literally starting from scratch if you don't have a grappling background and you go in there and get some black belts and killers they make you feel helpless yeah they make you feel like you you you are not safe ever all they have to do is grab you and it's over you're a hundred percent getting choked that's too fucked up for some people they can't handle that shit they feel like and then that's the case also be like a slow plodding grappler that fights like a dynamic striker and then you have to stand up like woo and you get leg kicked by Edson Barboza fuck all that yeah fuck that I've never been leg kick to death but I've taken two or three from Thiago in a practice when I first started training American Top Team I was like III feel good about checking kicks you know I'm comfortable there but he landed a couple I was like yeah fuck that I'm like so I would work with Thiago a lot and I feel comfortable now checking kicks you might get one you might get two off but um I'm not gonna let and I have not yet letting you do that to me he had a good whipping right leg yeah - he would whip it in there you know like his his kick was like super textbook man when he especially when his in his prime he would throw that jab one he was used to throw a one two or a jab and then just slam that right leg in there whoa I think he's popping into it whoa like that's how I feel like as in barbosa's like the 2.0 with Thiago you know he's a little faster yeah edson stunning like especially that switch kick he throws that squish kick and you're like what yeah his left leg switch kick is probably the fastest kick I've ever seen anybody throw from that stance I'd love to see like something lined up where you time like a regular person South pause right right kick I'm sorry they're left kick yeah and you you time his switch kick to that yeah well also put his up against somebody else's switch kick he's got like a Muay Thai world championship caliber switch kick yeah like you see like a real high-level Thai boxer they've got that same kind of speed to it you watch his and you're like there's no comparison in the Octagon you're not countering that you you should be lucky to react to react in touch you just taking it taking it yeah it's real quick yeah but again we go back to that never coming off fight as good as he was he got fucking mauled yeah that's what's really crazy because he didn't get mauled in the the Ferguson fight it was a good fight it was a good fight Ferguson was winning you know it was a good fight until Tony caught him with the Darce and sucked that choke in but then again that's a few years - yeah definitely it's a barboza might be they better everybody should be better all three of those guys should be getting better at this point yeah but yeah it's it's it's dangerous and I would like to see I mean Barbosa he's shown improvement after that after every loss that he had he showed improvement after the Tony loss you know so this fight with Kevin Lee let's see that's right into the fucking heart of things - yeah like right out of the frying pan right in the fire for both guys though fuck yeah guys yeah it's kind of crazy he's kind of crazy Kevin Lee may get beat up in that one oh yeah man he might get real kicked yeah you know he might get Terry Adams remember that fight you know in that crazy that that was the first time a wheel kick ever landed in a UFC fight first wheel Yeah right yeah I think Seth Petrocelli landed a wheel kick but he didn't knock anybody out with it you needed someone with that kind of speed though yeah whoa cuz the game has changed but then you know Vitor landed on a rock hold a bunch of people of landed wheel kicks since then but that one wheel kick was so crazy so perfect and laying it right on the jaw and just shut the lights out man he went danke I got tree yeah he was out going down that was in Brazil I was I don't know Barbosa is a fun guy to watch man I'm excited to be on the desk for that one you know um it's good fire especially those two fights like I love watching Cub and Frankie fight like I still feel the same way about yeah about mmm I think I would love to see that later I'm not necessarily even love to see I'm not crazy about the fight in the sense that I've seen it once and it could go that way again but I am excited to see the improvements that cause if Cub is able to make any adjustments and go on into that one but it's not a necessary thing there's some fights that I don't I don't like them just for the mathematics of the fight like God Dustin Poirier and gage he I love Dustin he's my boy right but I don't like it because Dustin and Eddie the fight with Dustin and Eddie the fight was going one way there was a was it called in no contest for a disqualification I'm like that I disagree with that I know I'm biased but I feel like my argument is strong in that the ref herb came back to the locker rooms and he explained to us that we're using the old rules mmm so if by the old rules all three of those knees were illegal right it doesn't matter if it was intentional it matters if it's illegal that's that's the way I understand it right so that's so that's my thing I so you feel like you should be disqualified and should be a loss right yeah coming I think that's a real good argument it's a real good argument and I don't think Eddie's a dirty fighter no but I do think Dustin was winning that fight up into those moments yeah I agree he had heard Eddie and it stunned him on several occasions the Eddie came back and cracked him there was a lot going on in that fight but those those knees were they're supposed to be a disqualification for something like that right that's what the whole idea is about doing something illegal you do something illegal and the guy gets really hurt from it yeah that's illegal you weren't supposed to do it it's a disqualification I think he's in the heat of the moment you probably didn't even know whether it was legal or not legal is just trying to land knees yeah who knows he's been rocked you got to put that into account as well he got hurt real bad that I Dustin cracked him yeah yeah like so mathematically would you like to see the rematch I would like to see the rematch um definitely I mean Dustin was lobbying for the rematch also and then on top of that mathematically I feel like it doesn't make sense because Eddie just beat gay Chi right so like it's like script porn this disqualification happened and this one guy got to step up the ladder right but you've now if you want to step up the ladder you have to do exactly what he did right that's a good point yeah that's a good point well that that essentially is solidifying the position as a no contest right because you're making you think he should have won I tend to agree with you and you think that he should have a better position yeah I think a rematch would be the way to go but I still I see that fight as a fight fan yeah Katie Poirier mmm-hmm Kate she's an interesting guy yeah tough motherfucker and he throws leg kicks from like a foot away from you he's like right on top of you and he he swivels his hips and chops down with that leg he doesn't care about getting ran over with a takedown either mm-hmm no he's a very good wrestler yeah very good wrestle that chooses to stand and bang you know and just breaks guys of this will done Michael Johnson fight holy shit holy shit when you stop to think about that right after I said that I'm like goddamn Michael Johnson's been some fucking war yes he's been in some wars with um with Ferguson I mean well he beat up Tony a bit but Johnson Johnson is one of those guys you can't count out either no but he heeds his inconsistencies what throws me off yeah you know it's often times very good like in the pour a fight when he knocked out Dustin he's very good in that fight and you know and then he's had his moments and then Elkins just takes him down strangles them he's like wow I wonder if that cut had anything to do with it you know did he get cutting that five no the weight cut him sorry oh the wig just make him 45 for the first time I could very well be I mean he looked real lean real lean who knows how he felt doing it for the first time it's probably real hard yeah doing it again or is he gonna go back up to 55 I have a not I've not heard I mean it may be out there but I haven't I haven't heard anything about it as far as if he's going back to 55 or not what's the most you ever cut I didn't know what I was doing the first time I made 154 to fight room in asado I thought I got 17 pounds in a day whoa that was ridiculous did you have to fight day of or day after day after how'd you rehydrate IV bags no I didn't I drank Pedialyte did it work I don't know the fight didn't last very long it saw it's on fight bass and it's it's hard to see but as the fight happens I throw a jab and I hit Sato as he's coming in I turn his head over and bang as he's coming in we clash heads and I go to my knees and I get up and I grab the ropes and I'm just holding onto the ropes and the ref is like screaming at me slap my hands tell me to get off the ropes and I'm just looking at him like what are you talking about and then he jumps on my back and he starts choking and I'm fighting and I'm falling back and one of the ropes peels my hands off and he just sinks in the choke all happens in like 20 seconds but like I like after learning about rehydration yeah I didn't know anything this is like 1999 royal after learning this the first time I fought at 55 after learning about rehydration and the brain and all that I'm like was was I out from that like I this was when I was a kid I don't hear any more about the result but I'm like was I out you know was i it was I can't send my car I don't remember any of that but I watched it on tape and I see it and I know what happens but I don't know yeah so you don't know how much of a weakened state you were in because it was such a quick fight yeah a chance to assess how your body how did you feel like walking to the range I remember feeling good but I was a I was a twenty something like 21 year old may be fighting um a guy who I look up to in a main event in Hawaii on it on a show on SuperBrawl you know SuperBrawl has some great fucking fights man yeah like that's that's old-school yeah never Egon anyway versus mayhem Miller holy shit Egon gets mayhem in the Camorra mayhem keeps rolling those impossible joints damn great great lights wasn't that Vito's debut against John Hess yep Shack was in the audience never Shack John I didn't know that I don't remember that half feet or lit John Hess up that's when John Hess was like one of the last remaining bullshit artists he was a SAFTA guy up like street combat like one of those guys poking people in the eyes and shit that's what he basically did in his UFC debut he poked the shit out of some guy he fought so he fought some short guy and poked him in the eyes well yeah this is Vitor this is back up a little bit yeah but just back up a little bit because this is right before the fight starts yeah there you let it go here oh it starts with the beating it was a weird video okay look at this doom doom doom doom look at him he's out yeah that was super fast Vitor I was training with Vitor then oh yeah vetoes 19 years old man that's when I was at Carlsen Gracie's on Hawthorne is right down the street from the Comedy Store man I was so jealous of Vito and that UFC brazil when he fought Wanderlei because I was like this kid my a to agree the same we was born the same year I guess it's like he's my he's already in the UFC I wish I was 200 pounds like I remember Rod Woodson was this safety for for the Pittsburgh Steelers and I was like he's five nine 200 pounds was I that we there were only two weight classes back then and this is one Dre telling me yeah I fucked I tell he's only 200 pounds back then man when he fought in his UFC debut he beat the shit out of scott ferrozzo he was only 200 pounds and he was shower ed ed just shredded was oh oh was it against Vandelay telligman telligman was his debut froze oh right here that was the second fight of the night this is the first fight that I worked with in Alabama in 1997 when did he fight vandala he fought Vandelay in 96 I know 98 I think in ultimate ultimate Brazil this is I fought tank Abbott this is when Vitor was getting bigger yeah but he was still uh who's still fast he was like probably like 215 or 2:20 then and then he fucked up tank Abbott but then as he got older not older but later like here he's still pretty jacked but then when he fought Randy Couture he got I remember this is Joe Charles that might have been effects ever see that fight he didn't throw any punches their friends just grapple got him in an armbar it that was like they kind of had a deal here's the Vandal a fight you gotta meet remember the Vandal a fight was when he had slimmed down he was after Randy had already fucked him up okay it was after yeah okay well Randy fought him Vitor was 240 and he looks like a lion yeah he'd even look like a person see if he could find Vito this is pride I posted a picture of that a couple of weeks a couple months ago about Vitor at that point before the Randy fight yeah cuz he had no known weaknesses no known weaknesses he lost his soccer Rob in this fight he hurt his hand broke his hand early and this is also this is Vitor after his his sister got kidnapped and murdered he was a different guy then Sakharov was so fuckin tough to Sakuraba but just knew how to survive see if you can find Vitor vs. Randy Couture because that's the crazy one when you just look at his build yeah he was so big man it's like his traps were coming up to his ears here it is right here this is him versus Randy so this might be he says young Vitor Belfort so it's probably only gonna show you the good stuff yeah he was so thick back then but the thing I remember is like how big his neck was like it started at the top of his head and worked its way down sideways a 40 degree angle those are the Wild West days man you know I mean how many guys did you fight were you like oh shit this dude's definitely on this on the juice I didn't even think about juice back that I don't even know what it was I thought I thought there's a video on YouTube I fought this guy so bas Rutten was coming to Texas and I was like I was this huge bas Rutten fan and he told my coach he was coming I emailed my coach emailed he said I could be that he's supposed to fight in Dallas that night I called a guy up in Dallas cuz I had fought for him before and he shorted me on some money I was like I'm not coming up there man I'm not fighting for you and I went to this arena where Bosh was gonna be at and I told the guy hey anybody I walked into the rules meeting I was like if anybody doesn't an opponent I'll fight and I'm they gave me a guy that was like - something big jack dude and a big like a man and I was a child my roommate was like hey did you see opponent I was like no he's like man he's like six tubes probably like 220 jacked it's like I was like and boss was like Eve Eve Eve he's drinking he's a thief you got there and you fight and you win I'm gonna be like you fight the new news I'm gonna be like yeah fuck these people they don't understand what it takes to get in there you don't worry about it I will call you and I was like I was so excited is the coolest fucking thing in the world just having boss fruit in your corner that's gotta be what a motivating factor that is right like III I was as excited kid I was watching all these Pancras videos I had pictures of my I had before I even knew the guy before I had any idea to possibly meet him I have pictures of myself doing that double front kick I still have him it's horrible but um like and then I meet the guy and he's he's willing to corner me and whatnot yeah I'll fight anybody no that's incredible fight dance every 7 was that like I'll fight him right now oh that's incredible without that that's good man I um yeah sorry are you taking me back yeah man blitz that's one of the beautiful things about MMA is that especially with a guy like you Z you were there for them really at the beginning like the early early early days man you were there when there was no money you know no notoriety no nothing yeah five five shows a year that type of stuff like Josh Thompson posted a picture a couple days ago of him at Hermes and Hermes Frank oh yeah I forgot about that dude that was a good fight I remember watching that and thinking like Josh is he posted something about that fight should have made him the number one guy because like we were the guys at that point Hermes and Josh and when he beat Hermes I was like I gotta fight these guys I want these are the guys I want to fight then I fought Hermes and then I was like that's it it's just Josh and I we got to do this right you know that highlight kick that you landed on - it's like one of those UFC pre-fight video highlight reel think they would play with that the who song yeah the Bob Bob O'Reilly play and that you would land that jumping roundhouse kick to the neck that was a crazy highlight reel ko finish man now that was just old school good times you know like those those are the guys that I remember those those days I remember when they had that tournament with um with Dean and uno and Matt and um who was the third guy BJ you know they had that tournament for the belt and I was like like why am I not in this tournament I was angry I was I was young I had a little bit less fights than Dean at the time a little less experience at that high level anyway and I was just like I could fight these guys I could beat these guys I had just lost the decision you know it's like yeah I know I know how to be on this level I should be in this I was so pissed and um no I remember those days man those those it's it's fun thinking about them it's fun going back and watching the whole card because like you start getting these memories of being around that preparing for those days being on the card and seeing those guys and you know fights were like in Bossier City Louisiana you know some small small town these small arenas where I'm close to Texas families driving over and then when I first went to Vegas to fight man that first fight in Vegas was right after 9/11 empty the casinos were em I remember that does when Tito Ortiz fought Vladimir Matyushenko yeah I remember that that was there for that yeah I wasn't even working for the UFC then no no no I was there as a guest I was there watching and that's why I remember Black Nick was there yeah one of the ways I got the job was by become I became friends with Dana and Dana and I would like go to dinner and I started asking them questions you know I'm like have you ever seen Genki sudo you know you ever seen this guy you ever talk about this guy you know she should try to do is get some of those k1 guys to come over I would just be telling them all this shit about fighting and he was like you want it too commentary I don't want to work ma'am he talked me into doing it that's that's literally how it happened becoming friends with him talking to him oh and he found some old he found a video of me on the Keenen Ivory Wayans show talking shit about what would happen if Steven Seagal fought in the Octagon yeah yeah I remember that Kenan had been in some movie with Steven Seagal and I was fucking with him about the movie I just was just joking around and mocking it I remember those rumors of you and restless nights' getting in that was supposed to happen it should have happened you know I think he just needed money man I think he just needed tax money yeah you know and it was at a point in my life where I was just dumb enough to do it I was like I'll do this that's like man let's do got tapped out by Andy Dick I got tickled out this that tickly doesn't work right now that we've done that in a fight like you any man feel it in a fight nah you wouldn't even feel it hey wake up someone like wasted time like come on you just hit him is that elbow right in the mouth yes I might imagine if someone like was so ticklish that you could open up a submission like a ticklish ticklish net scoot over have a submission that's whore you know what you you might be like if someone's turtled out knowing your back you can hit that rib tickle Ronnie B I'm gonna try that in the gym yeah in the gym it might work I mean I'm gonna try to rip dickelson me in the gym and I get their back next time there's anybody here's a question does anybody ever knocked a guy out where someone's on your back and you hit him with one of these knock them out I've never seen that I've never seen it either but I've seen keep people keep trying it they keep trying right I don't think anybody's ever knocked anybody out with that like can you practice that like could you get a guy to ride your back with the pads on and you'd hold up pads and you it sounds dumbest shit sounds dumbest shit yeah right yeah I would I wouldn't do that that's no what does work that you can't do head-butting yeah like if a guy's on your back and if you got wrist control and you just mash your head into his head that is a legitimate technique you're smashing the back of your head into his nose that's legit yeah that's legit but it's a head but it's a head but it's illegal but it opens up very naked yeah but it's a good it's not the best defense the best defense is proper jujitsu defense but there's something to head-butting someone who's got your back that it's another thing they have to think about yeah but if you lot head butts then you would allow the ultimate move from the rear naked choke position which is him elbow and you in the back of the head that's the ultimate move yeah that changes the whole position yeah but also head butts changed the guard position yep never a Mark Coleman when he fought Maurice Smith in those old days Coleman would get on top of guys and just smash his fucking head right in you know there was there was an event from Australia from way back in the day from I think the late 90s where this guy won one and one of one of his fights in the tournament or maybe a couple fights from inside the guard head buddy whoa and then I remember that remember the guy who put his chin in the guy's eye socket mark Kerr that was Kurt Kurt did that okay Dan Bobeck fought Dan bhavish got on top of him got the back of his head stuffed his chin into his eye socket and lifted up the back of his head and crushed his chin into his eyeball yeah he's gross that's as gross as it gets it's horrible man you see I seen a lot of seen a lot of those you know from the old school you see there was these things that would happen that would never happen today right you know and it's it's fun to watch some of that old stuff in this guy he's just he's running in wow that's crazy is that gonna work that's all exact art and it looks like it and the right for a second I thought it was Oleg right yeah no he would never do something that that's that's that's a question I like to ask young like you know like when they ask um rappers what do you think of Run DMC right like that's a question that's a name that I'll drop one in young fighters like Oleg Taktarov a gerrymander Solander you know Jerry Bohlander became a cop yeah Wilson cavia became a cop too did he yeah he's like a SWAT cop no sure yeah he's a talented guy he's like one of the baddest SWAT cops on the force I hear yeah I would imagine he was a talented guy yeah he was a guy that I was kind of surprised didn't further Wilson was one of those guys who I believe couldn't put it together inside the the octagon as well as he could in the gym and also had a little bit he could have put more effort into preparing mmm yeah well that's oftentimes the case the difference between someone who just does fantastic and someone who just doesn't quite just someone who falls off short yeah I think it also comes from like you know the the way you come up in the sport some of these guys they come up and they're the best guy in there in their area for a long time and you kind of get this attitude or this you start developing this persona of like I don't have to do all that work cuz like I'm not even doing that much and I'm still smashing everybody in here well that's where it's crazy about garlic John Jones he actually can do that yeah he's one of the rare guys that actually can do that man I like I wonder how much money he's left on the table with with all these problems especially with the attention that Connors brought to the sport yeah and a guy like John Jones yeah you know I know good as he is good as he is and I feel like for the longest time to he's trying to push this goody-two-shoes image and everybody was like well that's not you yeah this is fake and then all of his problems sort of forced him to just be himself and then people like we like you are now yeah and then he ones I've tested positive for something else which I believe him it was accidental I believe that it was accidental in this in this case because it doesn't make any sense any other way because if you look at how he tested positive and what he tested positive for and how recently tested negative before that and how recently afterwards you tested negative you're talking about something that was a such a miniscule trace amount there's no way you could consider taking something like that and having it have some sort of positive effect you know performance enhancing effect now was that the the substance is it oral is it can it be taken or we take an or okay yeah so I've heard I've heard know how true this is I would expect it to be somewhat true but I've heard like in boxing you know you main eventers they've had these these issues where they would only they would provide their own food because they don't trust the staff or somebody you know spiking their food with something so they just so I don't um I mean that sounds far-fetched but it also sounds to some degree reasonable his position was weakened by his testimony in the California State Athletic Commission hearing because first of all I said that Malky had forged his signature on one of the documents and one of the things that he was supposed to have gone over like what you can and can't I don't know I think was he you sada paperwork or maybe was California State Athletic mentioned Commission paperwork he apparently admitted that his manager forged his signature and they asked him have you ever considered getting a new manager yeah and he joked around about yeah he has I said no I'm just kidding but that's not good and then there was a bunch of stuff in like what he provided as a possible source of that stuff you know like he didn't he didn't have in these a lot of the things that he provided as a source of stuff in his list of stuff that he had taken yeah you know there's a lot going on there man but the real problem is like John at one point tom was being represented by Nike I mean he was representing Nike he was he had a huge Nike contract yeah that's and that's huge I mean not damn that was giant pre Reebok - yeah that was the pre pre Reebok days where he would got all the juice he would got at all and you know what can the could have shit of what a shit goes on forever and on top on top of that um it coulda woulda shoulda of that being pre Reebok and it being Nike with everything that's come to the sports since then imagine if John like he could like he could have done it got a Jordan route in some sense you know yeah way he's got a whole line of John Jones shuri type shit that's nice right you know he could be the heavyweight champion right now who knows I mean who knows well he could absolutely absolutely he could be in a super fight with steep a yeah absolutely 100% absolutely there would be a huge fucking fight man for MMA John coming up to heavyweight I mean it's a huge fight with DC coming up the heavy weight yes you know and the only got the only guy to have a best time is John and not just best him he ko'd him yeah you know I mean he hit him with that left high kick that that DC said you're not gonna hit me with that left kick yeah literally said that because he was saying he exposes some tendencies like oh you mean the left kick you're not gonna hit me with that left high kick and then boom he lands the left high kick now is that like the Titanic a little bit like it only sank because they said it wouldn't yeah maybe that's kind of crazy yeah we are a couple a couple weeks ago I saw you The Comedy Store and you asked me about your boy Brendan yeah and like you you would ask me about you it's explained the whole thing to people that don't know the story Brendan said something where he was talking about UFC tonight right COC tonight yeah well he's talking about the Fox had the Fox Fox panel and he said something about I get it Fox you're not racist like saying that you have a bunch of black people on it yeah yes yeah and because they're not racist myself tyrant and and Sharon Bryant with a three that were on the desk that day but also a lot of times were shot a lot of times DC yeah and so it was like I but are you checking off boxes because are these the best brains and the best speakers for the job right and it was like and you know I some people see the point that he was trying to make the point that he claims that he was trying to make but the thing is when you when you start when you start in on this race thing you're saying effectively that these there's a person or a group of these people are only there because of the color of their skin right you could you could say all of that without without the whole I get it you're not racist your are you checking off boxes or whatever right because if that doesn't matter to the question that or the point that you're trying to make then why bring it up bro you know that's I feel like I know Brendon very well I love him he's one of my best friends he's definitely not a racist but he definitely talks too much yeah and I don't mean that in a bad way like he talks too much I mean like he says he's too many podcasts and too many things and you say things and I'm a hundred percent guilty this you say things and you like well I don't even say that and then all sudden you're defending it and then you're you're caught up in a you know just like a wave of just trying to sort out what you're saying without someone being there to say well look here's thing tyron woodley UFC welterweight world champion eve edwards arguably the best 155 or in the world at one point in time massive veteran in sport you can go down the list Rashad Evans former light heavyweight champion I mean you're talking about top-flight champions former champions elite mixed martial artists but you also have Bisping y'all said Paul Felder you also have Kenny yeah Kenny Florian you know you have just they're just elite top of the food chain fighters and analysts I think it was a bad path to go down I don't think it made sense I just I think he thought it made sense in his head when he was saying it I think maybe he was trying to be controversial maybe just I don't know you know it didn't make sense to me yeah it didn't make sense to me either but like my thing about it wasn't okay you're being racist right like it's it's a thing when you bring race into the fit to the situation - right but my thing wasn't you're racist because you say this my thing was you're saying that I'm in this position because I'm not good enough right you're saying that I'm only here because of affirmative action or whatever you want to call it you know there's not a quality to my work and that's where I'm like yeah fuck that that's that's not the case I know I know that I'm good I know that I'm good at the sport I understand the sport and I'm good at explaining what I see Brian who would you know the other thing is like who would replace them as a we deserve white people that are missing out yeah I'm the gig yeah everybody everybody went to an audition yeah who's not getting the job though is there like someone who's like wow this guy really speaks really well but they're holding him down because he's white has that even happened yeah some people that probably like that to happen but I don't think that's actually happened yeah I agree completely but so we kind of we kind of went through that you know I um he sent me a message he apologized about that and I was like cool like my thing was not about the race thing my thing was you said these things and you're either saying somebody or a group of people up there aren't qualified for the job you're insinuating that a group of people that you belong to right not qualified to the Jews oh so that without that's where I was coming from with it yeah and then I thought it was squash then he said some other stuff after that and that's where I'm like man what do you say afterwards um Hughes I think I forget the guys name Luke Luke sorry I remember Luke Thomas right use on this guy Luke Thomas's show oh and easy saying stuff he's specifically talking about me now it's like yeah I talked to them we're all friends I talk to eat and he's like well see Eve there's something Eve seasoned himself and I'm just like man you're not you know what he said yeah like he said I feel like that's something Eve seasoned himself he was aggressive and they say you know he said he said he was um he was emotional and it's not and I'm like like there's an I never said to you I was emotional none of these things so like you're like this bus is coming you're waiting to throw me in front of it or some shit like that and I'm like yeah no that's not cool man like we're not friends we know each other the extent of our friendship is like a UFC last summer I saw it Brennan across the aisle and some guy rolled up on him and stalking him for like ten minutes and I'm looking back and I could see Brennan's like try fuck like I'm like let me let me go try and help him out so I go over then I start talking to Brendan and then the dude just hangs out I talked to Brendan for about 5-10 minutes and then it dude just hanging out behind us and I'm just like that's all I got man I'm going back to my seat that's the extent of it I've seen him at different places beyond that you know Brian and I are cool so I've seen him some times when I seen Brian but like we're not boys we don't know each other that's and like she and you're not a psychologist you're not a psychiatrist so you're not qualified to be speaking on my mentals i didn't know that he said that I feel like now that I'm remembering it you might have brought that up at the Comedy Store the other night it didn't make any sense it doesn't make me I'm Brendan's friend and I can't defend him on that because it doesn't make any sense it just didn't it doesn't make any sense yeah but sometimes he says she had that doesn't make sense and maybe if you were in the room with him he wouldn't have said it or maybe he would have said it better or maybe he would have you know said are these really the best minds but here's the argument if they're not who are like you really if you say are these really the best minds you really should provide better alternatives so who are the better alternatives who's the better alternative I mean there's there's a bunch of really good guys online Brendan Dorman does some really good stuff Lawrence Kenshin does some really good stuff about analyzing stuff I don't know how good they are on camera there's a bunch of people like um you know that do good robin blackness and real good breakdowns and stuff like that I mean maybe woody there's an argument that he would do a great job at something like that for sure but you got to provide if you it's not like this like some overwhelming absence of the best guys where they're saying hey why are you going with these black guys instead of going with the best guys why don't you have blah blah blah there's no blah blah blah like there's no guy out there yeah you never saying like who would that guy be I have no idea but there's also a formula I mean like you and Jimmy Smith kind of are the exception to the formula and the formula is to have you know the the color guy and the play-by-play guy in the by play guy is usually the one with the actual experience you've been doing it so long you're as close to having the experience as anybody can without having it you know and Jimmy's right there next to you and that Jimmy's more experienced than me because he's fought in my man right yeah he had some he's had a couple of fights right not at that level but he understands Robin Black has had like two or three fights also I don't know so that's the formula though you know Karen is on the other side of that Karen just her role is similar to Goldie's you know um she is the the person that that asked the questions that has an idea but doesn't have the experience right right she represents she represents the fan for the end she does it in a non robotic way right very important like for the person watching if you've got some guy who's like a radio DJ come on those people they know how to say the right words and they can do it and seem professional but you know it's you're not smooth whereas Karen knows how to be fun and she can be loose and she's non robotic wildly knowledge professional yeah she has a knowledge of this yeah some degree and a passion for it exactly the passion is what makes it makes it even more out of her you know I was watching NFL the other day and I was watching it was it was with you whatever it was I was like that's that girl really the best person to be interviewing these fucking Giants wasn't you I was like is that Christina but she's hot yes fuck I was like does she really know about football or she's just a gig because she wants to be famous you know I mean like there's a lot of those whereas you would say okay there's got to be someone out there that's better who really understands the game who could get in there and ask questions to this dude and find out like why they chose that play what went wrong what was he thinking when this happened like someone who really is a fan of it that's what I want to see with fighting you know I mean that to me fighting is so much more personal so much more intense when I see someone that's that's interviewing someone I want to see someone who really fucking cares because I know there's a lot of people who do care and I care like if I'm interviewing someone after a fight I'm trying my best to figure out like what was happening in their head there's some critical moments I want to know was this there was this a plan did you see this in advance this is something you saw in training when you're watching tapes I've questions like fan questions so I do my best to relay those that's what I do my best if I feel like someone's phoning it in or this isn't a job they're interested in or they really just want to be and you know some other sport the other wanted to be a fucking baseball commentator but there was no gig yeah they're just fucking half-ass Annette you know it's just it's weak terrible III one thing I loved one thing I always tried to do I always wanted to make I try to make you laugh every for every post-fight interview anytime like it was like I won a knockout okay I'm in doctor Jo let's let's see what he gives me see if he gives me something I could try to make you laugh sometimes I came with something set up but um there was one time I forget who it was I think it was a Jeremy Stephens and um you would ask me to take you through the replay and I was literally watching it and you would ask me a question and I wasn't even paying attention to you but so it worked out perfectly you you were like - I was like John sorry I was watching that and I was gonna ask you to ask the question again it hit me I was like and I was just thinking damn I'm smooth and I got that reaction that would be a natural reaction he said that I mean I also liked helping the guy celebrate you know yes there's moments like when someone does him that where someone almost has to tell you like how amazing that was like you know it was amazing but I want it I want to let you feel it even more I want you you know like like when Rose nama Eunice beat you wanna like that to me it's like one of my favorite all-time post it fight interview yeah because she's like y'all just be a good person [Laughter] out there you know so unusual and to have you know her walk through it like this impossible underdog coming in and and even if she won everybody thought she went by submission didn't think she'd just step in and cracker with a left hook and then drop her like what that was crazy like watching that fight was crazy here's a good one for you on it on another big fight I feel like there is a moment right in a fight especially when you get a finish sometimes there's a moment that comes just before the finish that you recognize this opportunities there and you jump on it and then there are times when like before the moment happens like before the shot comes just like this guy's about to fill just right hand and I know I'm gonna slip it and drop and drop my right on top of it right but then there are times when you hit a guy and it's like oh this is my chance then you jump on him and you know the end is near and all that rush when the referee steps that that's the moment that's the biggest moment when the referee stops the fight that's when you come right you know what I mean so like if you can if you can figure out how to ask that question because because getting get getting someone to explain that moment is is if they can translate that that's so sweet cuz like I like I can think of what my Latin one of my last fights with Stevens like when I hit him I didn't I knew what I was doing and I knew I was gonna land the punch and then as he went down I was like oh shit here's that moment right when you jump on it you know being able to beat that's that's what the best thing to get out of guys and you you ask that question well but also if you if if they can see it coming Ron man seeing that coming that's the thing that's when it's like this chick is hot and I know I'm gonna get it this bad moment is like oh this is actually happening what do you miss the most about fighting like what don't I miss it's I love that challenge man like that's why I still like training and whatnot but but the actual fight itself it's because everything's on the line there's not about doing grappling competitions or anything where there's no strike and I I have not I've been I thought about it once or twice but not been committed to doing it I'm starting to train more now again I had some some things happening in life that were changing for me I just moved out here and I didn't have the the team the foundation behind me I didn't have the group that I was with all the time anymore I had to find a cut and find a new group start to build a new group and now that we have this group I feel more comfortable I'm back in the gym more I'm able to do more like that and like I'm still in good shape and yeah I feel like maybe I want to compete again but just for the fun of it you know not for not to try and be a champion anything as in MMA or compete in jiu-jitsu I still love ever me it doesn't make sense so right you know they're definitely some fights that I wish could have happened or that I would have had like what what fight do you feel like you missed out on fighting told me at one point mm you know when go me it was go me yeah like throw those fucking fast pitch baseball punches man like the pride tournament mm-hmm I would have loved to fought everybody in that tournament you know every individual I've fought hats and that was fun they smell like ass but that was what was horrible do you think you did it on purpose one of those he does that every fight just doesn't smell doesn't wash it is is bad um shoot soccer I like fights like that you know but like now there's there's still some guys I have a lot of respect for I I talked to Joe lausanne about it I was like man I'd love to fight a guy like Joe Lauzon you know but that was right after like the first year of being retired how many years you've been retired now 5 3 since 2000 was almost for almost 4 November before it seems like longer for some strange reason because I did you just miss me til I do you just miss you know I do just missing that right left leg kick put off no it's it's one of those things where you you love it so much there are times when I'm watching fights man and there's some guys that are like just outside the top 15 I couldn't tell you any names right now but like I go like Jake Matthews when he was a 55 like I feel like this kid is good and he's awesome he's also been much bigger than they were back in my day they're still I'm like man sometimes I watch fights and I'm like man you motherfuckers are so lucky I'm not 25 things you know not the thing right the older fighters have way more knowledge and understanding of what to do but their body doesn't respond that way anymore and that's sort of the balance of it all is that the young fighters have all the piss and vinegar and fast twitch muscle fibers and they don't know that much I for me I feel because I still move around I still spar so smart like Joe and I making in those guys and I I can I can do a lot of the things that I've always been able to do it has to do with for the most part for me the recovery like the next day if I go hard today I can't go hard tomorrow I can't I can't go hard four days a week anymore you know I could go hard once or twice a week and as a getting better shaped like the twice will be more consistent but the recovery I can still move very close to just as fast as I've always been like I think that will go away at some point but I still have it and I can't take it like I used to you know you know that that's a difference I don't like it in the gym I can still like I still walk through some things but I don't know about in competition when when it's all on the line cuz again I think your brain kind of you're in a different mindset you know you think about that when you're sparring right now because you you really don't have a need to write I am I still love sparring I don't I don't do it nearly as much as I used to I do think about that so fun though it's so much fun you know and I'm like we got one right yeah I got one I don't I don't I don't want to be you don't want to live the last 20 of that one drooling shitting pants I don't want that so I try to exercise my brain as much as I can but what do you do you know reading I do a lot of a lot of the the cognate but brain cognitive games like you know a lot of things with numbers and crosswords and and and I just that's a hard thing for me to not do something because if I'm not if I'm awake and I'm not occupied my thoughts are just going so like that's something else i've been doing i've been i've started to write things down I've been doing like some stunt work acting all right so I've been lately I've been watching old shows and and just watching it for the acting and and I'll find a script and I'll stand in front of mirror by myself and just do some things like I'm just like I'm just I'm just going through all of it I uh I did I did I did a small move they're doing a movie about Nick Newell right and I I so I fight the character guy that's playing Nick Newell and one scene early in his career Nick Knowles the fighter was one on one arm does the guy in the movie have one arm as well no but he did green-screen it oh so so he's he's the whole time he has his green sleeve over his arm and he has it out here and he's moving it and we have we choreograph the fight and we have to kind of attract at for all of that in the choreography with the green-screen all that although but I got a couple lines did some lines and the first time I did lines with Kevin Pollak so I was cool for oh that's pretty crazy yeah and then um and then I did an episode abolish for the next season so that was cool did you work with the rock no I worked with Ricky so so JD Washington okay so that was cool and I had met I didn't I didn't I watched these shows I didn't know his name was JD wash I just knew his name was JD from being on set I always called him Ricky I was there somebody told me he was related to Denzel Washington and then I find out that his last name is Washington when I'm on set and I'm looking at the call sheet and I'm like hey you lady Denzel and he's like yeah he has his look on his face like fuckin you know you know that and I knew he was related but I thought he would tell me how at the time and I didn't know but I later I found out that it was his dad oh no shit this is dad you know some from what the information that I've got oh and um so but but I'd met his dad also work with him on equalizer we were for the equalizer too we were we were help helping him build the scenes we choreographing the scenes and teaching in the choreography for that and I have this disarm this thing where he's giving me voice lessons I have this thing with Denzel Washington giving me voice lessons I'm sure like he's you know these these these tongue twisters that he says to practice enunciate oh you know it's kind of dope so so wearing in the gym we're working out and he's like so he tell he says them to me and he's like you should write this down because my buddy tells me yeah he does stuff on fought on the Fox test for UFC and so he's like he pays a little more attention to me at that point he's like yeah he's going back to theater he wants to do some theater cuz he wants to clean up his stuff and so he's like you should write this down I'm like look fuck I grabbed my phone and I start recording and then he sees that I'm recording so he comes over and he's like he's speaking into my phone and I'm like I have this shit on I have this one Denzel Washington voice coaching me super dope right so that's what you're out here for that's what you're gonna do other than Fox desk you're doing some acting it was shit yeah it's like I'm a I'm a kid again right and I have my site I have my side card so I have a I have a ticket to the theme park so why not just try the rides yeah fuck it it's something new to do yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm doing I know Bisping is doing a lot of work bears being is doing a lot and and I did a movie with Bisbing well he had a big role in the film con we did a lot of shit families doing a lot and there's quite a few guys like Jay here on Jay is doing a lot of stunts you know I stunts are great especially when you're doing fights but I'm 155 pounder right I mean like I'm not gonna be doing a whole lot of fighting in movies a guy like like Tate right right Tate's in Tate's and doing movie Dyer exactly yeah he has he has the look and he's a big guy so he's getting a lot of work in that capacity but as a stuntman I'm a smaller guy and most of the time when that you want someone my size you're gonna want someone that can do other things like a lot of the gymnasts rah and that type of thing and I can do some of that but nowhere near as good as those guys right um and I'm not learning how to get hit by a car on fire you know all on a motorcycle yeah that's not happening I'm not doing that so I want I want I want to get better at this acting thing and try that out some because cuz it's fun also I played myself on the episode of ballers and I was like this feels good like I don't think that the acting thing it's like this is fun this is a it's it's it's a different kind of rush ya know it's a new thing I'm gonna pick your brain when like I'm gonna ask you for some some advice didn't you do stand-up I did a couple I did a couple stitches at the darn bar I did I'm yeah I'm gonna do it again yeah I mean I've done it a few times I like it if you do it I don't feel like I'm funny that's the problem you're funny dude you could do it it's it it's worked for everybody yeah yeah it seems a lot easier than us it's not easy at all no seems like it it's not easy it I was just talking how can that be hard but see that's the thing it's like people like man you you fought in the Octagon you fightin me people isn't that it's like yeah but I'm not looking at them you know the thing is to all new things are difficult it doesn't matter what difficult things you do try taking up chess for the first time it's difficult to try anything everything that's hard to do is difficult doesn't matter how many difficult things you've done you might have a better understanding of how to perform under under pressure yep then other people do but it's still going to be hard it yeah nothing nothing worth doing is easy no because if it was easy everybody to do it that's the thing a guy I am the other thing that I'm doing is I have I do a show in this platform called Pluto to have the show called a thug Jitsu master and squid show and Buddy the squid we got we interview we interview guys that got fights coming up we do a lot of stuff with fighters will get coaches we get people that have nothing to do with fighting but um we make me make it fun because what is this song on Pluto what is Pluto Pluto so Pluto is a platform you can get on here like iPhone on a gal it's an app it's an app you can get it on like the PlayStation or an Apple TV and all these things right huh and um do you know what it is you heard of it you know they have a fight channel they got oh they got a 24-hour glory channel running 24/7 what's they got a fight channel where they have that so help me all it's a glory Channel glory channel holy shit yeah okay and um yeah so so that's we do it over there we got a thing we do a thing called fight party live where we we watch the fights but we just hang out with it's cut it's watch the fights when we just hang out and basically do a podcast while we're at while we're doing it and no TV it's free everyone's free no shit 100 plus channels find what you want they have they got everything you seen this before no you know what I'm thinking of there's something on the Amazon what is the thing that's on TV the Amazon fire put this on that is that that's what I think I've seen it I think I see a dude who had it there was a whole channel that was dedicated to the Montreal Comedy Festival yeah yeah yeah they have a stand up chat huh okay nice they have everything right so what is this show called again the thug Jitsu master and squid show all right dude 33 o'clock Wow we've been doing this for how long now over three hours crazy right yeah the time warp how the fuck did that happen that's how it goes it's weird yeah man thank you very need to say anything more about the Brendan Schaub thing did we cover it enough man as far as it goes it's just like that's what we mean we'd like we need to talk him and hit you you know yeah so it's a weird situation for me because I love the guy and he's one of my best friends and also I can't defend what he said cuz it doesn't totally make sense yeah and so like what I'm saying what I said he talks too much I do too I say stupid shit I don't mean to say stupid shit I don't say that stupid I'm - I didn't say that thing I wouldn't say it like that yeah but sometimes you say things you don't even know why the fuck you're saying it you know and a lot of it also was like just ranting like you go into these rants and you say shit and then you like see if you can back it up once you said it yeah like just don't revisit dumb shit that's like it was insensitive it didn't make sense and it was insensitive and I bet he regrets it well I mean I don't know like that's an assumption we're making right yeah mod I know the guy that's why I'm saying it yeah he's not a bad guy yeah mister like the imagination he's awesome I'm not of the of the I'm not the guy saying like you're racist for saying this like that I'm like my thing is when you're talking about the first initial part of it and I conveyed this to him you know was you're saying me or my brother or my sister aren't good enough to be here so like that's that's disrespectful because I fully believe that we all are yeah and that that that so that part and he apologized for that and we're cool there you know and then and then why are you talking about like this is what I see myself because no Dawg that's not that's not how it is no no you're not you're not a psychologist you know a psychiatrist you have no qualifications to to speak on my mental state like like it's just weird to that you guys haven't I think hmm I don't know I think sometimes someone says something instead of just straight up saying they fucked up they say I fucked up but yeah you know I fucked up but you know he's his issue is because of this or you know it's something else is going on with him that's making him react this way yeah yeah I I'm more concerned with his pants let's shred it up pants and worse those disturbing way more than what he said I can't can't defend either one yeah just don't wear women's pants I don't think they're women's they're just a vet man hold it um Sam hold it on cuz it's like we went through that at the beginning of the show and they have hold it him it depends on how many holes right like the pant leg holds up little well if you earn those holes like if you work construction you got it like a real hole yeah you get you get your pen snagged on it yeah you gotta do what you gotta do if you're a farmer you got a real barbed wire holes and your pants that's a different animal you know that's that's okay you earn those holes you wore your jeans out they started ripping in places okay okay you can't afford to buy some new ones yeah but if you paid a lot of mine for pants that are already fucked up you saw that shit in a magazine somewhere that's what bothers me about Brendan fucking pants I thought this bothers me too but I what really bothers me I like you a lot you're always been cool and I think you do a great job and I said that very early on when you first started doing it yeah I remember I tweeted it or something actually and you said it to me - the last time I was here I was in Joe and I came to do a glory companion with you and I remember that I remember everything you say Joe like even even even though I did because I don't especially when it's about me there was a time when you were like look at joshi's so scar look how he just gets right back up he's just he's just he's the stronger guy oh I love it because there's a couple times went on you're not like disparaging of either fighter but there's a couple times when you you start seeing a strength and another guy and there's two fights for me where that happened and I was able to just clip him right as you're giving the other guy some praise perfect I was like yeah Joe shut up some love give him some love ladies and gentlemen thug Jitsu master on Twitter is what's your Instagram same thing same just imasu all right and thug Jitsu master and the squid and squid
