the gyro can experience any Bravo what's happening cocksucker what's that you're a month away from having a kid you sitting there like fucking Buddha with no fucking food I love ready for this man are you ready this you gotta be fucking picked a name yet TV show on discovery I wanted to tell me you went the uncle's house and change some diapers a kid for a while and we tried that you know this was planned it's gonna be a fascinating experience you you a different fucking man for sure changed me as a human being first it was the reefer when you came to me you said you had the best ice cream sundae in your life yeah any problem the way you gave it to me that was beautiful and then next thing you know mrs. Rogan came on the scene I seen the whole yeah I will never forget the day Eddie Bravo got me high we that we went and had ice cream sundae and I had the most massive revelation of my life I couldn't believe how god damn good that ice cream sundae take me to meet you that was the first time he ever straightened up before then you were fucking ape he was still bent over fight through your banana you need to fucking peel seriously your back you will back your chest whazzup shit well you guys know me I don't know me as well as you guys know oh please that was you you will walk on all know imma tell that fucking I'm a different person I'm a lot more relaxed and everything but it must have been interesting much more for you to watch someone change their personality with it it's a fucking beautiful thing man I love to see evolution i but people watching I love to watch people show you fucking man you know don't say that but think coming from you know my background you know doing martial arts competitions my whole life and then just transition right into comedy I had never relaxed I never settled down I never I never learned how to just be calm you know it was ego my whole body in my brain my personality all developed under duress it all developed under you know a physical combat all the time on a regular basis constant training constant fights constant tournaments that was no that was my life from like ten mohs 15 till I was like 22 all my formative years was all spent in in stress and I remember when I first decided that I wasn't gonna fight anymore it's like the first time ever in my life when I was like 22 it's my last kick boxing fights I've the first time ever where I could relax I would always like be nervous like when is the next tournament when's the next fight when's the next thing I gotta get in shape I can't be drinking this I can't be doing it I couldn't live my life because I was always worrying about getting my ass kicked I was always worrying about like I have to make sure that I do everything right I had to be prepared I don't wanna get fucked up you know so it's like it's it wasn't the best mindset to go in a stand-up comedy for that's for sure it's like a constant battle good stand-up comedy you got it totally the opposite you got to not give a fuck you know you got a you got to be relaxed you got to have fun don't settle be tense and ready to go at any moment's notice you know you sent me by the way whatever Issa means doesn't work one of them doesn't work the other two do check her emails yeah I just you sent me two things and both of them are like movies that are one second long what dude I know I know it's good my father ascended okay I fucking 15 to 22 my mind wasn't fighting them I was gonna fight it but I was in a different type of hell I was in my own hell I was putting myself into you know it's so weird and I became a comic what six seven eight years later there was something like that and how I took that wildness into the fucking comic and nobody understood what I was saying to my met you guys thought I found the fucking home I was always I used to travel on the road with Tribble and do all these little road remember when I first met you the store everybody was fucking terrified of you yeah I was crazy nobody knew you and I I remember being like the only guy like when I first met you that was like he's great what are you talking about I love that guy and there was a girl here comes Joey Diaz like where's yet I like would gravitate towards you I was because you didn't scare me you were nice to me you know it was you a unit you weren't a scary guy to me you were a regular dude I could you were like one of the only guys there that I could relate to there was like a lot of guys that I couldn't relate to I knew dudes like you you know I mean not you but you and my friend Johnny be the pool very similar characters man very very similar characters you're both way out there you both like not give a fuck guys and you're both guys that were like polarizing some people would love you to death and then everybody you know there was a large group of people but for whatever reason they'd be upset at you like I never have to defend you even the Dahmer era even da Marrero is hating on you calling everybody everything I don't yeah and I loved it I fucking loved it because that's why you know it's so weird that this whole surgery thing really taught me about fear my fear has fucking done wonders for me because that's why when I wake up in the morning I stop and do is grab my fucking cock because for years I was scared I'm always insecure that immigrant fucking thing's chiseled into my fucking mind since the streets of New York City with the immigrant thing not knowing the language not feeling good enough like everybody else not being a fucking American and it sits inside my fucking soul so for me everything has been written on fear every time I get on stage like the other night fear was real in Chicago I got on stage in between the reefer and whatever was going on in the lights I got fearful man but you know what that's normal to be scared that's a great emotion especially when you're a stand-up comic because we're more scared you are the better you're gonna fucking do especially in my case the more riled up I am two minutes before I go onstage the more energy I'm gonna give that fucking audience but I've looked at my life and I've seen how much fear I was petrified to go get that fucking needle even though I fucking knew nothing was gonna happen I was gonna walk out of there but I went in I took the needle after I walked out at me like for the fucking kill ten fucking people with my bare hands because you overcome one of your biggest fucking fears till this day I get little emails and people you know I suffer I suffer from a social miss Florida and I don't know what to do with the answer ain't taking a fucking pill it's checking your fucking confidence and grabbing your balls and walking into a circle insane fucking I'm here you know my mentality was always going to little mouth of the line and put a chair down and sit the fuck down and let the pieces fall where they may and if you're not gonna live like that fucking more I'm at the store two fuckin nights joe rogan the first fucking night Eddie Griffin bumps me you know how embarrassing it is you become a regular on a Sunday the first fucking night EULA eleven people come see you your landlord comes and you get bumped by Eddie Griffin and the second night I go up there
