lots of lots of challenges growing up and then all sudden when I was actually away from all the stuff that I was familiar with people that were familiar with me was nice to be able to be in a setting where I was actually excelling and achieving things anonymously you know there was things that were happening that all of a sudden I was shining in a way but not you know none of my people back in where I was from knew anything about it but I was doing really well the discipline and resolved in doing any difficult endeavor is so important for a young man you know and that's one of the sort of the themes we've brought up on this podcast many times is it is there's no coming-of-age rituals in our culture anymore and there's a reef I always thought they were retarded when I was young like you know what are these fucking idiots hanging themselves by their tits and you know or you know but putting their hands and the bullet ant you know bins like what the fuck is wrong with these people why would they like I'm 18 I'm a man done no not really you really need to go through something you need to you need to you know you need to have that's why so many cultures have either psychedelic experiences that you know young people go through or with we talked about this yesterday ordeal poisons where it's it's not a psychedelic because it's none in their area so they take something that almost kills them and then when it's over there they're so happy to be healthy again and alive that they sort of realized they've gone through a tunnel they've made it through a passage they've they've reached an actual new level and we're missing that man we get out of fucking high school and then we're just lost we're panicking completely terrified we're going to starve to death it's clinging on the first job or the first opportunity for some sort of security that we can you know the only good thing that I could ever think about having sort of some sort of a mandatory military experience for most United States citizens is to twofold one so people can understand what the fuck the military is really all about right it's nonsense rah-rah Chicken Hawk bullshit where people support this idea of sending our fucking trained killers to these places where we don't know anybody and fucking them up in the name of justice or whatever the fuck it is we would get a better idea of what that is and it would be harder to pull the wool over people's eyes because it's so easy for all these people that will have nothing to do with shooting anybody ever to say we support the troops and support your are heroes and you're the reason why we could be free and nonsensical statements that mean the reason why that shit flies is because we got a nice blanket this blanket of security the USA whatever the fuck it is throw it over your head you know you don't really have to think about the actual horrors of military if we forced people to join and I'm not saying we should but that won't the only benefit that we would get out of that is it people who kind of get an idea of what reality really is yeah I think it's there and there is that fine line there's no way to really kind of know to really be able to direct that experience it's really as an individual and an individual thing there's gonna be people that figure out a way to make that work for them in terms of being lazy I got out of shape in the army when I got when I went in really just because back when I hustle this is when they when I went in they they wanted people in so they weren't really you know pushing people to heart and was in a period of time when we didn't have a lot of obvious conflict going on so it seemed like everything that's sorted itself out and why am I going to the military other than just getting a college fund out of it and then it's fucking her off but you know so they were kind of like kind of lowered the stands are a little bit to kind of get more people in I think that was a mistake but you know I still learned a lot of what your was this this is from 80 to 85 I came real close to joining 85 when I got out of high school it was they had an army Taekwondo team they would you'd get a shitty easy just job but they would pay you to train and they give you they told you they're gonna try and see what they did the bait and switch with me to like oh you want to be a mapmaker oh that's a great because you're an artist awesome let's bring it on down let's sign up and get you there then you like you get on the bus and you drive all the way to Detroit and they get you there and they go oh yeah that one's full that's that's bull okay but you know what you can do you can run out and catch bullets yeah I had a a a fucked a dude that competed on the national team this guy Bobby Clayton nose out of the US Army team he was the one who was getting me to think about doing it he always freaked me out because he was really religious and when I was 18 I was such a a godless loser that I really religious people scared me like I was the one thing I was scared of competing against was religious people like when I was I wasn't scared black people at first till I beat my first black guy and then it was it was religious people because I would see them sitting down like reading the Bible before they'd fight I'm black motherfucker Stew's got cotton aside like he's got ganas I don't even fucking know it's in the Bible I went to Catholic school for one year all I could think of was this fucking guy's gonna have Jesus on his side he's gonna kick my ass but this Bobby Clayton guy every time he would fight he would he would sit down and read the Bible before he would go out there and he was on the u.s. army team came real close to fall on that - its footsteps he was a couple steps ahead of me in the the tournament scene and I was I was it looked up to him so it's like wow maybe that's the move maybe the army and I look back on it now and that that the weird feeling of indecision that I had when I got out of high school it makes me so sympathetic you know and that's why whenever anybody tries to criticize the actual people that are over there the actual troops I'm like man that is correct you know well they're through there the one who's actually pulling the trigger then the one like man you don't even know what kind of momentum is behind being a part of a machine like that and being a 20 year old man or an 18 year old man and you know and wanting the respect and admiration of your peers and your fucking your CEO is telling you whatever the guy is the head guys telling you that they'll give you an extra leave if you kill a guy with a knife and have you ever seen those guys the describing this there was a there's a video I don't want anybody to look at it right now but there's a video called American soldier throws away his medals it's one of those Iraq Veterans Against the War videos where this guy talks screw extremely candidly about his time in Iraq and killing civilians and I mean it's intense shit you know this guy's not proud of this and he's swallowing his words and he's talking incredibly honestly but it's fucking his chief officer whoever the fuck it was the head guy I told him they'd give him four days leave they'd kill a guy with a knife so they had an extra incentive to kill a guy with a knife Wow america fuck yeah yeah fuck yeah freedom yeah whoo yeah it's a it's a and it's a I think you know everybody in some way I think I think you're right about trying to figure out a way that have some some more perspective on you know just putting this situation putting people in the situation where they have to kind of go through that for themselves and kind of discover your inner warrior and like that vicious that kind of becoming a person male or female just trying to figure out what that next step for you as separating from the nest and and becoming your own person and you know - we can we can talk around at all you want but at the end of the day there are monsters in the world most of them are us and you know that's that's what comes in there we are we have the capacity for amazing wonderful things we have the capacity for some horrendous awful things as well and I think part of that having that warrior awakened in you is is more about understanding the monster in you and understanding how to keep that at bay and understand how to keep that in check so that you know making it a global global perspective and I am in no way am i a hippie or you know you lose you know about like we're just gonna have World Peace someday it's not that's just not the case you know you have to we're gonna be struggling with our inner monster forever and some you know there are monsters that are just out more in areas and the reality is we have to keep that in check well we lack any sort of a logical use guide for being a human you know we we essentially go on the experiences of people before us and occasionally we get wisdom like that poem that you read or that s-sir excerpt that you read is genius and brilliant from a man who lived 200 years ago yeah but you know more than likely you get a fucking moron for a dad who pumped bullshit in your head and till you're 18 and then you leave and you're like these fucking niggers are trying to take our jobs like you know poor fucking kid he's an you know you really here's a shovel the job for you oh you're quitting there you go it's a it's a it's a it's a weird thing I tried to hire your nephew as they keep living morons are allowed to raise morons and you're allowed to home-school them too you allowed to sit them down and teach them the same idiotic nonsense that you learned and and keep the same pattern of fear and ignorance going it's it's very strange it's very and there's no way to cure that either I mean who is any man to tell any other man and until we have some really incredibly sophisticated ways of measuring confidence that are just rock-solid and you know like like a litmus likho you know I used to do a joke my act about if you know you could find out you're an idiot as easy as you can find out if you're pregnant you just go and lick something and look at him I'm a fucking idiot there's no way this is broken you throw it away it'll be a pile of idiot detectors up to the fucking moon you play bullshit you fucking throw it down and grab another one until that happens how do you say a man can't have a baby how do you may say a guy you know can't raise a family and teach it its own his own values you can't I think there's you know I'm not gonna want to get all 1984 but I think in terms of like say for example health benefits if the if you go in to get some kind of you know something for your cold or your you're just basically sick now you know your your your arm got chopped off okay that's like we understand that but like as far as just general health if if for some reason you go in for that kind of general health stuff and they just I think they should be able to run your credit card statement to see if you've been to McDonald's lately you've been to McDonald's you know drinking Coca Cola's or eating the candies or hitting you know hitting the it in the fast-food it's like no now you don't get anything I've had this idea for a long time that the the way to strengthen America is really to make less losers so anytime there's any sort of a situation like that there should be some resources dead kated to pulling people out of that in a really enthusiastic way the same way this research is dedicated to rebuilding Iraq after we blow it up I mean there should be a way to like let people know the infrastructure of America needs to be rebuilt - the infrastructure of humanity the infrastructure in the age of information with all the all the stuff that we know about what it what what's important about being a human being we should invest some resources into that and developing human beings in that way and if you're gonna provide it with free health care should also provide them with some sort of an education in some sort of a some actually acceptable form where they're gonna really absorb it of the fuck you're doing your body stupid and taxpayers shouldn't be paying for this and you know we might have to put you in a state where everybody eats Big Macs I'm gonna to force you into someplace you know you're gonna have to move to South Dakota cuz that's the Big Mac state you want to keep eating Big Macs all right well you can still be on the government nipple I was writing a story at one point but it was kind of like that where it was some detective and he starts realizing that there's some people that keep disappearing and you know it's kind of a missing-persons case and it kind of turns into like a lot of missing people and he starts kind of looking over you know I kind of put the board up they got their faces up there and realize all these people are really large and then all the sudden have turned into this whole sci-fi thing where it's like actually the the aliens have like kind of infiltrated the government they've like engineered this thing of this the corn products saw the office syrup and they're basically like the government's like yeah for you know for whatever technology we'll take this and we'll feed our people this and the aliens are harvesting the fat people dead in the rocket ships the oil where fossil fuels like was kind of harvesting why not large people we had this I said Rob wolf yesterday they offer author of the Paleo solution brilliant brilliant guy but he was talking about government subsidies in corn the reason why there's so much corn out there and corn syrup and it's used in so many different things and it's so terrible for you and it's like and it's not even economically feasible he's like the government is actually paying these people to grow this shit because there's not a lot of profit and growing it like somehow or another some hustle has button been put into place and yeah the wrecked result of it is a billion fat fox it's harvest yeah that's amazing if you're coming they're gonna suck us up they're gonna put us in a fucking engine yeah the twist would be on and leaked all of a sudden there's a very large family and and they're not being harvesting like what's going on say well that's just they're genetically that's that's their that's their genetics they had they they haven't been fed the corn syrup so they're they're just being passed over so it has nothing to do with actual like large people it has to do with people that are specifically like getting gorging on the corn syrup well if we really do encounter area alien life and that alien life actually eats biological matter we're gonna be fucked yeah just the same way pigs are fucked the same pigs are fucking smart man and there's I stopped eating pork for a couple of months once a couple of years our sleep looks like a nightmare it's pretty rough time I saw my brothers I can't talk to you anymore have you ever seen the documentary my brother's keeper it's about these slut they would they were slow they had some sort of a mental retardation and they ran a farm and one of them was accused of murder or something heinous and but they were probably most likely been pinned on him because they were slow well these guys were running the farm they went to kill a pig and when they pulled out the shotgun this pig saw the shotgun oh my fuck and the pig is fuck and running left and right trying to get away from this guy recognizing the gun and freaks out and finally he gets in shoots and I'm I remember thinking man pigs are fucking so that I can beam pigs because you could shoot a cow in front of another cow and that the other cows barely react and you're like a look at them don't I don't have a problem with that but I'm not shooting that pig it's kind of fucked aliens are gonna treat us just like all due respect and my boat you know my my Pig brother bacon dude apparently the slow cooking method Rob Wolff was explaining is the shit you're supposed to put a grill electric grill on 200 and cook it for two hours and the bacon becomes insane yes that's I'm not ready to commit to that the crispy sounds great I feel like an asshole sounds like like he said it would be like it like an in like an incensed almost the whole house would smell like bacon for two hours while it cooks that's a good way to become a fat fuck twitching but if there are aliens and they are a million years more advanced than us they're gonna eat the shit out of our yeah we're law for that we've been stuffing ourselves with all this fast food and it's we're grain fed cattle cattle aren't supposed to eat grain neither people you know it's what that have they finished him on that shit that's what they get him all nice and fat and juice trainer shoo finish him are you still working on a perfect circle and are we ever going to see another album cuz I know for a while you were working on something and then it kind of dissolved into I don't even know what happened but but yeah you never know it's always there's always possibilities my ex-girlfriend had a perfect circle tattoo and I always had to look at it every did you I was just on it yeah right on her butt so every time I I'm not very comfortable so let's go back to when the power went out man we were talking about Hicks you guys put Hicks on a you thanked him on a CD because you got ahold of one of his cassettes and you enjoyed it and but you never you guys never actually toured together but you know we closely we planned on it it was basically a plan we were kind of setting into motion in like mid 93 we were talking and that's when it's not moving he came down and that was kind of part of why he was coming down we're trying to figure out what we're gonna do comedians and rock musicians like that it's it's a weird combination the Bobcat Goldthwait did a lot of work with Nirvana he opened up for them we have him in here and he told some hilarious stories about them just fucking talking shit at him screaming at him and fucking murder in their eyes yeah stop fucking Hey meanwhile he's friends with them when they want him to go out there it's like yeah like I actually approached David cross a couple years ago hey now we're gonna do another shake no I would say no to no I wouldn't want to yeah you don't want to eat dick in front of a rock crowd it's just it's not right to put coins and stuff is all weird combination it's like you're not providing them what they're there to see you you've got attorney me might work I've seen guys do it and pull it off and it works with it works with Puscifer yeah because it's just it's just that the nature of that project is silly it's it's just there's just all this different stuff going on you got film and you've got you've got video and you've got animation you've got we you know for wonder where we had Neil hamburger opened up for us really you know so that's just and then in the middle of our said he would come out and interrupt and go I forgot a joke and you know just bomb the audience out for a minute and then wander off from that can take my drink in my chair and sit down and like in my spot and take up space for listen here what was this song that you guys did where you film the video inside of a trailer it's sort of a conditions of my parole yeah that's great is that you really your Airstream is that your person I'm so jealous that I want to buy one so bad we're talking about getting one is a portable podcast studio I know we should do do that and then come to people's towns and do you know cuz we could broadcast out of a 4G just you know a 4G connection for Verizon it's pretty goddamn sporty if we just find a place that can support each show we would have to have a we would have to have one for each show like would have to contract for each show because then would go over our data so it would have to get like 50 of them we would have to get a sponsor and well this ting ting wants a sponsor us a new yeah video some new rather cell phone company maybe they could do that that's cool so you what you um when you got into Hicks for me I was a was a young comedian living in Boston and I was working at the comedy connection I'd been doing it probably about a year so I just probably act in 1989 where'd you live in Boston I live in Newton okay other than leaving the Davis Square how did you really oh cool I used to work at Boston Pet Center down on Lechmere oh really it's not there anymore nice it's an awful something there Boston's a great place to grow up but a terrible place to die and I felt like I was dying there yeah it's it's look the people are cool they're smart it's interesting it's cool it's a real town but it's too fucking cold it's just too fucking yeah I feel like it's it's like I kind of there's I feel like there's a parallel between San Francisco and Boston in a way as far as that bitter cold take San Fran every day son I'll take San Fran all day I like San Fran maybe a hundred times better than Boston yeah but I and I I guess like yeah I'll take that I just I think the San Fran should just changed like they're licensed places so you're doing it wrong yeah do you think they're doing it wrong they just know it what is it you're doing a lot no matter what you're doing wrong there they they go over the deep end but they go over my preferable and they goes they go over the lefty deep end which seems weird coming from like a cage fighting commentator type dude but I don't you know I I like people that are kind and I think that even if the people on the left are doing it the wrong way and even if they're crazy and self-righteous and pretentious I think the the idea behind it is they're trying to be as kind to as many groups of people you know and offer a commensurate environment for as many groups of people as possible so I support that even though I think a lot of what they think in this nonsense and doesn't go along with human nature and behavior and you know I want to alpha them sometimes they grab the neck and shake them like a fucking child get it together bitch yeah do some squats have a fucking steak you're you're on planet Earth bacon ah yeah get up bitch get up have a fucking shot of whiskey and let's do this I just Boston it's just Boston is liberal in the same way too but just angry oh yeah there's definitely some there's some Irish anger going on there and cold yeah I got really in trouble once I toured there and like it was like one of my first times back in bosses like back back in Boston dry cunt capital of the world crickets like no like as many fans as being out in the others were like yeah we're done we're done it's hard to find a good one in Boston and when you find a good when you cling to him like a cork in the ocean please keep me afloat please I saw Hicks at the comedy connection and I saw him because he was on the Rodney Dangerfield special and I you know I was a aspiring comedian so I went to see everybody was on the Rodney Dangerfield special when they came through town you know and Boston was one of those pit stops it was like Chicago Boston you know there was places where people would come through and you know you would guarantee that they would be in your town eventually and Hicks went up he went up at the comedy connection or the first time I actually saw him was that Knicks comedy stop and he went up after this guy was a incredible hack the guy was like cop donut jokes cartoon smoking pot and like them on all the most hackneyed obvious premises and he was hailing audiences filled idiots nobody knew who Hicks was me and maybe 50 other comedians in the back of the room out of 300 people who were in the audience place is packed by 20 minutes in this show half the people have left you know I mean literally cleared out at least 50% by the end of it it was maybe a hundred people left and it was 50 audience members and 50 comedians and we and he didn't give a fuck he never can i with if one joke would go wrong for me I would go into a tailspin I would panic I would rush my jokes I would say fuck too much I was just I would I would not have any confidence he's in the middle of this bit about how Satan fucks John Davidson who don't remember John Davidson was the host of that's incredible was the you know one of them was like the internet before there was the internet so he it's a demon with his thorny cock is fucking John Davidson in the ass and John David Davidson swells up in the off season because he's pregnant with Lucifer's baby and he shits out Oprah Winfrey or or Geraldo Rivera depending on where Hicks was at and so Hicks is standing on stage shitting so he's pausing I mean this fucking minutes man minutes of just just straining and people just getting up and leaving and he looks up in the middle goes yeah this usually clears a room crying laughing I got to see him bomb horribly but yet still kill for 50 to 100 people and then I got to see him you know kill all right the whole the whole crowd but what an interesting guy it's like oh he was doing something that nobody else was doing I mean who's like it was injecting Noam Chomsky and and you know and philosophy and Terence Mckenna and it was like like whoa what yeah I didn't even like when I first saw Kennison Guinness it was the first time I ever thought I could do comedy I was like you know I thought saw these guys rolling up their sleeves talking about did you ever notice and it's like well I kind of kind of could do that I guess I kind of could do that if I had to do that but then I saw Kinnison and and you know fucking screaming I was buried fuck and he was angry and it was funny and I was laughing I was like maybe there maybe there's a comedy for me maybe I could find my comedy right and then when I saw Hicks I was like oh this guy just flipped the whole fucking thing on its head like now it's now it's you know it's about formulating a philosophy on life and that there is a possibility outside of the direction that we're going in and then it is possible for the human beings and the you know the human civilization to rise up and and and be about love and be about understanding it be about intellectual curiosity and and to be free of judgment I was like this guy's a fucking comedian like this is the crazy shit I've ever seen yeah it's almost like his jokes were an afterthought to inject his philosophy into the audience I think partly yeah absolutely yeah so what open but I've loved I you know I kind of like you spend a little I spend a little time in that little comedy world for a while was very always very inspiring to me to watch comedians like him basically just stick to their guns and finished their act without getting that nervous sweat I mean I was always inspiring to see that and it's always my favorite comedy clubs to go to were the ones that you know you end up if you're sitting out front of the Mann's Chinese they give you tickets to go to this free comedy club go then because if it's a good comedian on you can like take bets to see how quickly the rooms gonna clear that's you know and we had a that I think I remember one time he had Andy Kindler did a whole thing we brought everybody he knew down there kind of have like a little side you know side seats with all the comedian's that he had an abyss sleeve and they did a whole like debunking comedy like a like a hack hack class and they had everybody come up and just do like the hack thing in front of this audience and this all these people that just kind of one ticket from you know and got ticket to the man saying isn't there just I don't understand like that's funny hahaha why is that hack that's funny like and then you know that whole thing went on for like an hour you know hour and a half I was just I'm in the back of the room just peeing myself watching them go through this and then some dude gets up after they met their act and does everything that they just went through and the audience is like ahaha that's so funny can I have another break like and then David Cross gets up and then just clears the room was awesome an opening line just you know I saw Sandler's this the other day I met Schindler's List finally saw it it's not that funny this whole table of people just get up and out the door like in a just every joke that he said it was like we're watching like he just set off a bomb there he just set off a bomb there cleared the room Oh David Cross is rarely credited but in my opinion of watching it all happened he's the originator of the idea of alternative comedy because I saw him do an alternative comedy in 1988 he was in Boston yeah catch in Cambridge he would go up and he would do I remember one time he was doing this this exercise video where I would teach you teach you how to stretch so he have played the exercise video he stretches like I really do feel a stretch and he was like doing this like long and people like nervously giggling and not showing we're not sure where it was going and then anywhere and everyone but it was amazing you know I felt I felt he was like a better version of what Andy Kaufman was doing because Andy Kaufman would get up in front of like colleges and like read The Great Gatsby and I was like well that's kind of fucked it's not really funny it is now yeah it is now yeah it's like a delayed reaction like witness it it's great long-term absorption yeah but cross was he was funny while I was doing it was it was weird he was just so silly it was actually funny while he was doing it do you like comedy I I like music because I'm completely unmusical I don't have any skill I don't have any talent I don't have it I don't understand it I don't I see those bars that might as well be Tibetan you know Sanskrit I don't know what it is so when I see someone perform music when I'm in awe it's like to me it's a beautiful wonderful experience do you feel the same way about comedy because you don't do comedy do you watch comedy and just get a free sense of enjoyment that you might not get from watching something you actually I generally enjoy more scripted like a film comedy when I see a group of guys who have figured out not a formula but there's just a there's a rhythm to their comedy and they've actually created a character behind you know that actor brings something to the table that you want to look at and then their timing in this scenario where it's clearly they're just play-acting it's like hey we're just playing dress-up pretend and you still laugh because the writing solid but the what they bring to the table with the writing is solid so like you know when you're seeing things like the movie Super Troopers it's just like those guys had to have a lot of fun making that film because everything was just like the writing was perfect it's a quotable film it's like every step of the way it's that every every scene is quotable and they're just having fun and then you see you know almost almost any Will Ferrell those guys just yeah and john c reilly is like just a master he's bringing his thing to the table and then making your script come alive it's just a great that to me is like and i and i look at that and i go what the fuck did you do that i have no idea how they did and I have no idea how to be funny just so I'm watching them just like nail these things out of the park like you could put all that script on the paper and show it to me I would just go which I don't have where do I start like you know how is this funny one of my favorite all-time comedians is Mitch Hedberg and one of the reasons why mitch is one of my favorites is cuz none of his stuff was funny on paper it didn't make any sense like you would see he goes you know somebody asked me do I want a frozen banana I said no but I want a regular banana later so yes you know now if you saw that on paper he'd be like why is that not funny the fuck is I might have butchered his joke I don't know that's great thing it was pretty close but I love that I love that he redefined comedy in a certain way too because he made some first of all I was a heroin addict and he had only clean comedy I mean his stuff was squeaky clean meanwhile he was gangrene in his leg because he was fucking shooting the same vein too many times it was really a strange guy and his material was also odd and if you loved Mitch Hedberg it was awesome but like Mitch Hedberg would go on after these guys that would like sing and dance and do song parodies and you know they would close with a rap and he would eat dick he would eat dick so bad that the club owner would try to switch him with the middle act and say listen the middle acts been doing stronger we're gonna have him close we're gonna give him your money and then they're you know his manager would call and there would be like a big problem and it wasn't necessarily that you know he was not not a funny comic it was like it was the completely the wrong setup for his type of comedy whereas it's a delicate environment well you could take a guy like Kenneth's and it didn't matter who went on before him when he stormed that yeah this fucking room has changed the environment has changed Hedberg would get up there with sunglasses on you know and it just goes barrel never play tennis against a wall they're relentless [Music] and you just you just start giggling and it would it would be a slow build and he was one of the rare guys that would have non sequiturs everything was being non sequitur every single bit I'm sorry what is that drawing on the wall that's a vagina that's what a child would draw like in high school maybe true that that's Brendon Walsh's drawing of way he thinks Barbie looks like and it's right next to Pam and we had we had an artist on one of our other podcast night sorry I'm all right didn't mean to interrupt you but I just was I kept screaming at me from this whole place is a giant distraction there's a flashlight right here our former sponsor there's fucking cats all over the table oh poor Mario Brothers behind you plan yeah there's a mannequin Ted stormtrooper helmet ron paul's in here somewhere well ron paul's over there somewhere she's leaving yeah yeah it's it this is a weird little setup we have here what is with that fucking painting man that's what i me want to ask you oh yeah burn that thing know if you look far away if you if you look at it far away it looks like a naked girl we have a close-up looks like shit thanks Jeff appreciate it so I only said that for humour so I have I have questions for you and it's regarding Anderson Silva I want to know what you think is coming next so this is he gonna are you on the inside of that is it what's happening yes cope most likely it'll be one of two things depending on what they can talk him into and Anderson is in a very rare position where he sort of gets to choose his opponents hmm for the most part it'll be there you know based on like he didn't want to fight Chael Sonnen because he talked so much shit he didn't want to do it but he also did because he wanted to silence them so they just had a financially motivating it will most likely be either this kid Chris Weidman who's the best up-and-coming 185-pound or one of the best he hasn't fought a lot of guys but he's uh I think I've heard about standing pretty solid dude just destroyed mark muñoz who's also a top-ten contender and the way he did it was just so just complete and total the way he anticipated all of his moves countered him almost strangle them three or four times the first pretty young yeah and then spectacular wrestler so it's him he might get it but he's he's a bit of a tough sell because there's a lot of folks in the mainstream that don't know who he is he sort of more of someone who he he can beat Anderson Silva I mean look who the fuck knows what's gonna actually happen but it may be possible that he could pull it off he has the right set of skills but he's not known as well but the other option is if George st. Pierre beats Carlos Condit okay then then they have some fucking crazy Souza is that the guy that they mentioned at the end of the fight yeah when they were saying so you know you're gonna fight him and he went now I want to fight him oh no that's John Jones okay Jones right yeah he said he doesn't want to fight John Jones but John Jones really isn't a totally different weight class not just Anderson has dabbled in the 205 pound weight class but really he makes 185 pretty easily he doesn't have a problem making 185 and John Jones could never make 185 John Jones is 6-foot 3 240 pounds 230 at least when he's walking around and then he cuts down to 205 slowly you know over his camp you know cut probably cut losses the last you know probably 10 pounds in water weight he's just a way bigger guy he's way bigger and he's a really strong wrestler and stylistically he's a nightmare and apparently they have a mutual admiration for each other that's it can it can be bypassed no with the right amount of money and both guys probably agreed to it if the right amount of money was on the table but right now you know they both stated their admiration for each other and they're probably number one and number two pound-for-pound fighters in the world right now people would like to see that but honestly I think George st. Pierre and Anderson are more physically the same size it's closer okay George has a struggle to make 170 whereas Anderson is a he makes 185 pretty easy George can make 185 and be that basically the same size and that would be an amazing fight that I think if if George can get through Carlos Condit and I think I believe they're gonna fight in the fall depending on George covering from ACL surgery okay so much yeah yeah I've had to and if George gets through that and everything's cool that uh and if he beats Carlos Condit which is an F you know Carlos is really good he's very tough but if he beats him then they go to probably Dallas Stadium probably doing that big giant fuckin 60,000 square foot heavy awesome yeah I'm just looking forward to the next you know I'm looking to see what happens next cos I was that was a pretty amazing yeah Anderson's a he's a ninja I mean he really is he's a real master martial artist in a way that like what what he does there's maybe a tiny handful of human beings on the planet who can move the way he moves right and so I think going back to some of that you know that relaxed state we were talking about before I just it's really watching him watching him operate it's it is like Jordan it is at his top the top of his game it's just this this Panther this this art this ballet movement just just fluid yeah and connected and I think a lot I think a lot of that just this seems like a lot of missing from the UFC these days right here any mixed martial arts forum it seems like there's that you know there's the awesome gladiator gold you know what to just bang it out but there's that art that I just kind of missed from the earlier days of watching it be the the bracket system where you have to kind of you know suck it up and get through three dudes in one night mm-hm you know the old wrestling days well what Anderson is is so much better than everyone else that you get to see that art where it's like you see a couple of dudes that are really close to each other go at it you don't they don't have that that that that giant skill level above their opponent whereas Anderson does like when it comes to striking Anderson's the most accurate fighter we've ever had inside the Octagon like no one has been as accurate with him and he's he's so he's so fluid in the way he moves he does things and this opponents don't even realize he's done him until they land what he's like the master of like sneaking shit in it's a really unusual dude and the reason why he's able to do that is you know mixed martial arts as a whole has really only been around since 1993 and we're seeing this constant evolution of it banana Sun represents at right now what's possible the furthest the furthest evolution of the game as far as it's ever gone but the reality is in his individual disciplines he's not as good as the best guys there are a better kickboxers than right there a better jujitsu guys in him and it's like one day we're going to see a guy who can do - Anderson Silva when Anderson Silva can do - chance on him I mean we haven't seen it yet but we're gonna see a guy who has Hicks and Gracie jiu-jitsu and Badr Hari type striking right you know and when that happens means a man and that's what it's inevitable it's the the sport is moving in that direction it's like this constantly accelerating process and right now it's the only people that are successful are the completely fanatical and obsessed you can't get by and share athleticism right you see some basketball players that they probably don't work out as hard as they could and you know they may be known but but they're good enough to get by I have enough gifts to get by in the pro basketball yeah tall and arrogant when you get to the when you get to the top the upper echelons of the Ultimate Fighting Championship there's no room for anybody but the fanatical there's no room for anybody but the obsessed and the right the Rory McDonald's of the world these like young guys that are coming up that are just insanely good and every time you see him they're much better than they were six months ago that's the future and that's that's one that's inspiring because it's it's a it's definitely that that chess game that we spoke of earlier I feel like it's it's more interesting to watch because although I don't have necessarily the frame of reference for what's actually happening when you actually go back and look at the tape and go click by click you go oh my god yeah exactly what you're talking about John and your corner just going this yes and then this yeah it's it's a chess piece and it's it's millimeters and with a guy like Anderson there's no one to tell him to do that because he's that guy right you know Anderson really doesn't have it I mean he has guys that coach him and Muay Thai and coach them in jiu-jitsu but it comes to I'm a hopefully Joe he's gonna tell others on what to do it knows exactly to do he's at the top of the mountain it's beautiful to watch someone who's at the very best of the the like the the peak the apex of whatever that is right now you know whether it's fucking motorcycle racing or whatever it is gymnastics when you see a guy who's at them there's a quote from the movie Vision Quest you ever see that movie has Matthew Modine remember that movie good fussin movie man why are you laughing right now that's why am i laughing it's a great because I forgot all about it I haven't watched it lately don't have it held up we should watch it down we should what's that girl's name in like the girl with the black hair was hot as fuck remember she moved into his house and he was cooked caught smelling her panties remember the Sylvester Stallone yes anyway there's a scene in the movie where the guy is Google that now the kid is the top you know he's like one of the top wrestlers and he's about to face a state champion wrestling this huge thing and he's blown away by it and he's working as a delivery man at a hotel he's working as a room service guy and one of the cooks in the hotel and him have this conversation about the guy seeing Pele or I think was paler but it seems some incredible soccer game and seeing this guy do something that just for that one moment you you rejoiced in that guy's movements and his ability to do something astounding and for one moment like it raised the entire group of people that were watching it for one moment we were above the Apes we're above right the shit chucking monkeys you know Linda Florentina she was so hot she was ridiculous whatever happened to her a sex change she's no she actually doesn't look that bad now you got a Google photo over yeah I mean for being up take it you know take it nostalgia candlelight I am one candle court of the room don't see that much everybody's good I apologize Linda Sylvester Stallone she was in Dogma weird weird that you even know who is in dogma did you see Dogma yeah I am same dogma I win okay good let's do the old all right so uh supposed to John Travolta grease oh yeah have you seen grease yes I watch it all the time I have not ever seen ever in grease did you reject it I think it was one of those things kind of went by and then everybody all my friends were like yeah we you know grease great and I'm like you know what I've decided I'm never gonna see that that's how is decision the doors movie and grease AHA the doors he's the season finale of lost was mine I said he watched the whole thing and then up to like the season finale he decided not to so he doesn't know wise why did you got me enough you made it hit me with enough nonsense bucks yeah you were a wise man yeah what did you just bring up as an example what was the other one the doors moving I don't know just one of those things I just all of a sudden just didn't watch it that's right before Val Cameron went to New Mexico and grew his head that was forgotten he became Jim Morrison for a little bit in his head apparently like on the set he was like so method that he was like you know being Jim Morrison fuckin did a great job of Jim Morrison other than John Malkovich did John Malkovich play Jim in the words of the Marlon Brando why don't you just try acting yeah that's a I love that he said that the whole idea people talking in character like I've read once that Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight used to get on the phone and they would have full conversations father and daughter in character and I was like that's a crazy bitch okay and she's broken he's broken he fucked up raising her she's a mess now I was talking to a friend of mine like we were somehow Jennifer Aniston came up and then we kind of segue from Brad Pitt you know off into Angelina Jolie and we both were like we kind of pause from my one fuck dude how crazy is that how like Brad's just gotta be kind of sitting there like just kind of going it's just for the press cuz this like you say that but I bet chief fuck the shit out of him I bet she sent him for us in a sexual ride that Jennifer Aniston is completely incapable of I bet she's way too self-control I consciously controlled - you know - reserved Angelina Jolie had billy-bob tattooed on her fucking arm she fucked Billy Bob Thornton tattooed his name on her arm and carried his blood in a vial around her neck that bitch is loked outta Jody's got some big old buddies pull that up man pull that video up you remember that was a just fucking great that was a great song that's just and I think for some reason maybe I Lindsay Lohan I don't care I don't care what kind of bell-rope she tugs I just I think the crazy just completely outweighs any of that just you're right the drama that's attached to any of this stuff I think it's just like not a part of my my friend Tony always said it best though he said psychotic and erotic our next-door neighbors when they really they're so close to each other I could see that and the craziest girls I've seen it yeah the craziest girls of every day there was a bet with the best at that this is Lindsay Lohan's got some big-ass titties if you see cups of cups this is a different song now this is just you're just you just remember the chorus with Angelina Jolie got something gasps this is a different version this is a different version because the other one was more singsong Angelina Jolie got some big-ass titties it was like more rhythmic I think these guys bit them a big problem in the rap community big crowd in the comedy community which is brings me back to Bill Harris I didn't I was a big huge fan Denis Leary for about six months until I saw Hicks right and then I went with the fuzz guys doing the same jokes right but and and I mean no disrespect to Bill but I think as you've probably seen mostly in that comedy world the the beauty of Hicks was that that was his world he was staying in that world this is this is his whole purpose is to do this thing right most people during their during that period of time where they were their head they're like then we'll have their eye on the Johnny Carson position oh yeah do this and then you do this and you get this show and then you did this thing and you get to be Johnny Carson and someday kind like the subject of uh shakes the clown and like watching everybody try to be you know you know yeah you know binky's trying to get that position and interfering there shakes and all that and mines you know that's dead but I feel like Larry was you know whatever you want to lay on him as far as like you know biting that style it doesn't matter because as it went on what he ended up doing with all of that he ended up becoming a making his own thing so even though kind of maybe you know it clearly just clearly carbon copy that yeah but you know in his defense I feel like you know back then it was war you know you're trying to make your make your way and I think yeah I don't give that I don't give him that it wasn't Lee he could he could have come up with his own shit yeah but I think you know I had the same problem with him for many years but like just you let it go I let it go because he's funny yeah you know some of those watching the rescue me there's some there's some tasty bits in that in his the movie he did oh man where he was a burglar and he's stuck in the this houses jon lovitz and him is that what it was no no man he could he shit and spider-man there did you know he was an inspired he sucked in spider-man's I'm just stupid why is he in that movie someone needs a dad not gonna just get anybody else I'm not a fan I when I find out you're full of shit I'm sorry oh yeah I can appreciate that he does well at some things but until he comes clean about being full of shit in the first place he can go fuck himself and I'll call him out yeah not interested I'm gonna get him and Bill Murray in the same room in a minute correct is two guys lie no we're three guys we're I know with it were when they died rich Jenny cuz it was just so crazy the the committed suicide and Kinnison because he was my first influence and then Hicks I was at this club and Connecticut Hartford Connecticut and me and this other comic are in the green room and this girl came in and goes Bill Hicks just died like it was like overnight and I was in I was in a hotel in Detroit they were flying to Europe the next morning and I woke up in the middle of the night like just bolt upright you know whatever time that was I came her what the time was but like I basic was awake and then we got the next morning and my pager beeper got a message from Duncan his manager and it was like bill passed last night and the time that was quoted that he passed was when I woke up in bed whoa and it was pretty creepy Wow your stomach actually went via where he was through Detroit to tap me on his way I was like dude I'm sorry to make you go to Detroit it's probably a really quick trip when you're in hyperspace it's probably right next door yes probably reaching over and president found out about his I found out about his problem because I had a awful nightmare and when we were I was at a one of those kind of motels where you got that you can pull your car right up to the outside and it's kind of like the two stories and you're gonna walk through the the breezeway between the thingies and there's like a hundred people there and everyone's just balling their eyes out and bill wasn't there and I was like well half the fuck is this dream of us I called I called his manager the next day and I'm like I had this fucked up dream about Bill and he goes yeah I can't really talk about it and nobody cuz nobody knew yet that he had pancreatic cancer I had this fucked up dream and I called his manager and went what I had this weird dream about Bill what's up and uh he's like yeah I can't really talk about it where do you believe I mean there's no way that was coincidental no no way no no way what is that what's going on there yeah Sarah zero zero zero dimension that is like a next-door neighbor that you can tap into then I have no idea that it's you know what the fuck is that yeah I don't know but it was it was pretty you know and I had a couple moments like that with him over there time that's what I'm saying like when he died like I was just you know yeah of course I woke up in development I never I've never had anything like that happened and I absolutely believe it's possible yeah it was a weird it was a weird time they see the most provable form of any sort of psychic phenomenon is the ability to know when someone's looking at you they said that statistically you can prove you know you can have people stand and have their back facing a group of people and they can statistically tell with you know certain amount of uncertainty and guesswork but you could show on a graph that people can tell when people are looking at them if there is that if that is possible that's valid then these other things are definitely on some level valid because and its energy have you ever heard of the work of Rupert Sheldrake he's this guy who believes in the morphogenetic field and he's done like research showing that dogs can tell when their owners are coming home and he believes there's some sort of a frequency that we're all tuning into that are all of our consciousness connected to some some type of grid and you can recognize when that's in motion you can recognize things events things that are happening and it it's just a matter of us being sensitive enough to tune it in mm-hmm you know and that's I think that's really one of the weirdest things about being a human being right no no he's not doing that I don't think he is he might be i doubt it if he does he'll be okay he's just a mess he's from Ohio you know it is I rescued him from Columbus I I want to believe that we're slowly but surely moving from the phase of you know grunts to language to written language to Internet to psychic ability to communication to me I want to think that it's but there's so much room for fuckery there's so much room for fake sidekicks oh yeah so when I hear a story like yours I can thank me know that I have no reason to lie about that it's not like it's gonna make or break my career you know yeah so what does sound cool it sounds pretty cool pretty bitchy to bring up at a party especially if you're in front of a fire touch me [Laughter] everybody wants to fucking claim psychic everybody wants to claim it it's so hard to trust people don't take no shit it's and I think the the problem with all of that is that we're I probably on some you know Universal level we're not really allowed to completely be able to tap in and rely on it although I do firmly believe that you know each one of us has to kind of really listening to the intuitive side of ourselves to kind of just follow your heart and know what path you're supposed to choose because we all kind of have a role to play yes and you kind of have to like find that happy medium between like making yourself happy and making sure you're fulfilled but also kind of doing doing your part you know even in work the intuitive is such an interesting point because you're an intuition depends on your respect for your consciousness spend it depends on your respect for your honesty about your own actions and your own thoughts and your own ideas and I find that when I am the most at peace with my own actions then I am a much a much better in tune with other people and I've met people that were completely full of shit I'm like how does this guy not know that he's full of shit not know that no one's gonna buy this I'll tell you how cuz he's lying to himself because like he's lying and negative you know in a way positive reinforcement for his negative actions if he keeps winning yes even if he's negative yeah that's just gonna reinforce that actually reinforce that behavior when I'm most honest with myself as when I'm get the most intuitive reads off of people I had one friend my friend Bryan Callen and I used to he was like the worst guy for like being involved with friends that would turn out to be crazy and idiots and thieves and nuts and the worst the worst connections with girls and and I would always be I was like a big brother email I was okay he's worried about you doing coke me yeah you doing coke what's in your hand Bud Light is powerful yeah if you wanted to come down tonight who knows maybe someone won't show up but it's mad flavor aka Joey Diaz Brian Redman the man to my Josh McDermitt our good friend from that show 30 and fucked in the ass or whatever it and me and 10:30 here ice house did you ever experience uh experiment with any drugs did you ever do like mushrooms or anything growing up no this is on the Internet Oh people can hear this yeah dude be careful what you said I'm just Joe says Christ I'm not supposed to talk about something you looked at me like I mean I mean I just let your chair on fire younger when I was like in 93 I went to Lollapalooza and I was really a hippie kinda back then and and a tool was one of the because I used to be a nine snail fan growing up then I became some hippie and I know I remember seeing tool or like why am I not was so 1892 I'm moving on in 93 fuck of them but a lot I always wondered that because I mean especially your old videos sober you know I just the visuals on that was just you know amazing when you're on mushrooms but did you ever play with any of that kind of psychedelic stuff never never never yes dude what was the song you did to the Fibonacci sequence and now you're on drugs he's he's he's beautiful he's beautiful on what he is you can't fake a Brian I mean he is just that that's who he is yeah there's no was the song that you did to the Fibonacci sequence I believe it was Foggy Mountain breakdown really no it was one of those songs one of those songs yeah whatever it is you can find it online google it but um that the the Fibonacci sequence I watched a documentary about it once where they showed pine cones and pineapples and sunflowers and all these different show that there's some sort and some sort of a mathematical code to nature right and and I think the funny thing is like people like myself actually trying to like force those numbers on a song it's kind of it's kind of funny it's kind of clunky because the song is that any song is that so you know to kind of like drive worse these it's like it's like you know my kid playing blocks I look they're square and they stack yeah every everything is that so it like actually like write your face work force that into a song as well as a little sophomoric so I'm reprimanding myself for being a little silly oh yes not you you would I thought it was in all Maj to the the order of the universe I didn't think there was silly at all but that's as a fan and I I enjoyed it but I it was just short for fanatic and I have to go and that's why you know you look at someone with a nose job and you go what the fuck is going on here something's wrong on the sequence yeah you've ruined the Fibonacci sequence you know you've got to make you gotta make lemons out of lemonade you gotta you got to make soup out of the ham hocks and the beans that you've been given it's just it just is what it is when when you need when you really find out that there it truly is a mathematical sequence that the whole universe is based on it's one of those things that really makes you step back and go see we are man we might as well be fucking cavemen because even though we like to think that with our 4G connections and our satellite dishes and our cars and we somehow another have elevated from the biological like Bob was so we're still so base we're still so stuck in though though the rut of the mud you know we we don't we really have barely wrapped our heads around how complicated and insane and diverse this whole thing really is and the Fibonacci sequence to me it's like one of those real real mind fucks it makes you just pause and there was a particle physicist recently or a theoretical physicist that was talking about when they they study quantum mechanics they find that there's some sort of an embedded code to it all that it's not just an embedded code it's a recognizable code that is used in mathematicians and they said that's fucking the whole universe is a program it gets a program you know whether you call it it's whether it's a biological program or whether there's intelligent design it's been done by some engineer like from Prometheus movie whatever it is there's a program to this right and that you know I kind of I was always playing around with there just a story where you actually the only way to time travel would be to somehow connect Indy at the base of your DNA and there's actually a time code in the DNA and you have to like reset it so that all of a sudden you just end up in this other you know time zone but then you wouldn't your software wouldn't be compatible so this whole script fell apart just before my eyes was yeah I imagine if you did decide you would go into another dimension and you go into the other dimension and you would just be engulfed in complete madness because you don't have the tools to deal with that new all right fuck that's like that like you go to go you but I can't enter and you're like oh I forgot a zero when you're like [Music] kaleidoscope until the end of time yeah it's like that movie or the the Twilight Zone episode when was a burgess meredith was all just all he wanted to do was read and just leave me alone leave and he's in inside of a library and a nuclear explosion happens and everyone's dead but he's surrounded by all these books and then he breaks his glasses he's like oh fuck just forever and this downward spiral of inability to perceive his environment I'm worried about him nice alright yes you know I was worried about him for the first five years I knew it we're gonna we got it we got into a groove like kind of never know know knows exactly what he's doing it's the only way to kill the hangover he just started when he starts slurring you're gonna get nervous but it's he's okay yeah he's always looking at you man he's got monitors too so even when he's not looking at you he's looking at you through monitors and what you really need to think about the fact that so now over he's playing a solo show tonight at the thing yeah the ice house the ice house he'll be up there he's a comedian it's got some funny jokes yeah you should come tonight I'm working [Laughter] yeah you should let people invite themselves that's that way you don't get rejected I'm actually pouring wine tonight at the other three boys oh you if people want to go see where is it it's every some Royce it's an old old Pasadena down the street here I've heard crazy stories about you at these at signings I've heard it shows their shows shows that you've done we tone you and tire back to the audience during the entire performance have you done that I have really an awful sensitivity to flash flash cameras flashing so if I if the if you just can't if people can't control themselves I just have to I I can't I can't focus on what I'm doing because I'll actually like go into a convulsion so I had really I have tits like an epileptic convulsions I can't finish the set so I'm sorry I have to turn my fucking back to you I didn't know that was even real until my friend Jim's wife is epileptic you know my message board would have these avatars that would flattering and that's basically nobody's business so it's like you know what do you mean yeah I I asked you if I can put the camera yeah maybe if you told them fucking seizure me mob they get right up in your face George yeah cuz then you got the asshole who's who's still in to 9 as nails from 92 and he's gonna do the flash thing cuz he hates me and he hates you for leaving them it's abandonment issues he said that do you know Trent do you deal work with him or whatever I'm I we've met you know several times probably more than a sip more than several but I haven't talked to him afraid he grew his neck when val kilmer grew his head yeah I haven't I haven't seen him for a while is it is about God's walls he's huge yeah he started bodybuilding I thought yeah I think that was I think he did start lifting but I don't you know it's a weird thing for a musician right it's a like at one point in time musicians were always sort of one of my favorite fucking scenes I almost forgot this is you some guy jumped on stage you hip tossed him and they took his back and continued to look like he's ready for you got it yeah that's all right what was that about what was going on there I mean you obviously didn't hurt him so you sensed it he was friendly yeah it was it was my stage like if you're up there you get choked so beautiful you give him like the the the arm around and where you thought you were like goodness yeah do a like it's so beautiful but the beautiful thing is the guy didn't even try to fight that are lucky throws his arms up the end he was just thinking Jake again says his boys bartlein yeah he's like ah this is the best I'm gonna have a baby but I'm a baby I'm gonna have a baby painted blue it's a pretty rare situation where you got the perfect retarded fam I'm gonna have a doesn't fight hard and he how cool was it for him though you were singing why you had his back well though I think that's a that's a you know if there's not there's no footage online that kind of shows everything that we actually had a guest singer come out on that song write it right during that so like not only did the kid like have to deal with you know me doing that but he had to sit through this other singer doing a thing - so you just held them up the back control I had the I wrapped the cord around his back and continued singing school because that slack so I would go and check the thing you look at me was he talking I get my back rub - can I see a little pat on the back and security never see there's the guy coming out to sing it's a it's Haytham he's a friend of ours was this going on 97 64 before let's see you back back when you didn't get sued for shit right yeah cuz that happened now you don't you be fuck yeah I can't do anything would you not do that now you probably will knock you out you would just do it anyway yeah I mean I don't know what you're doing yeah he could be crazy you never know the guy that killed Dimebag Darrell yeah I did it once when I was young sir words for you John I did once when I was younger at a Wien concert and now I look back at I cringe just thinking the fact that I fucking got up on stage and they actually had to stop there's like they were in between songs did you really yeah and then I jumped back into the audience but I was like it just makes me sick to my Sami and I was like 18 you know at a Wien concert but I can't imagine doing that now if it makes you feel any better if I was right next to you like do it pussy man ruin the show goes they'll be fine man this happens all the time it's like some bands like like it like I remember Mighty Mighty Bosstones worse the nip-slip force the nip-slips Mighty Mighty Bosstones you still like almost welcome people on this stage if I remember correctly so I think that's why I did I was like oh all bands are like this yeah you know it's a social event yeah yeah kind of like convey a thing right jump on up what's up with your music not being on iTunes is is that something Licensing's bullshit like crap bones hmm I'm sorry for asking questions like this are for a perfect circle or on iTunes how they are yeah what the fuck are you talking about son well I I recently went through a thing where I sold all my CDs a lot of my CDs and I baboo re buying them on digital yeah you know keep them I know higher quality I know is CD much higher quality well now that they've got there's our new version of you know like MP MP for RA or whatever they are they're that are pretty solid it's a pretty Celica and it all depends iTunes at all it all depends on how you compression cuz there's ways to do it where the new digital formats are actually pretty badass it just as good as CD quality it's pretty you would never notice the difference especially when you're listening to it on this fucking thing right Oh like that Portlandia episode like it sound great on these little speakers you you're one of those artists that emerge through the the digital take oh of music what was that like for you to watch that happen where all the sudden your shit was online and you know to go through the the you know the whole the the whole scene with what means something I'll just kind of you know try to fight it and there's other people that did you know they had to do whatever they had to do to kind of embrace it I know there's one thing I know for sure you cannot download my wine hmm that's right not a digital format not yet not until we have those printers that can bring out your wine crazy as that sounds retarded just five years ago that sounds walking around with a phone that's not connected to anything that's funny yeah Jay Leno has one of these 3d printers in his shop he puts a video online of him making parts for old cars with it yeah it's fucking amazing I mean you just ya run it through a scanner next thing you know it's there it is right yeah that's the beginning I'm loving this wine now actually he's alright his problem is it's okay it's like that all the problems in the world you know when was the last time you were at the Olive Garden you motherfucker you did it I would have to go there for me to be my first time oh you have never been I'm that snooty is it hard to find good restaurants in Arizona yeah yeah where we are there's there's a there's a handful of pretty awesome places but there's not as many as we would like how far you way from Phoenix two hours to our welcome Sun worth four hours from Tucson yeah and then the other area of note is Sedona right that's so Dona has a like even Sedona has only a couple places that are really good but you'll take that just for the small I just cook myself yeah I just do my own raviolis and we you know we have our own gardens and orchards yeah that is a cool thing we have a cook I just started doing that this year growing my own vegetables we'll have like a salad made out of our own vegetables so some cool about that there's something hunter-gatherer they just yeah and it's anybody and even in a big city like this if you have us those apartment that has like a little bit of dirt near you you can make your own food yeah any any square v square feet of dirt near you and you're in this community you can grow enough stuff that you can get with your neighbors and trade that's my ultimate goal we do the garlic and I'll do the potatoes yeah the tomatoes and you're just trade and you're happy when I see a guy like you like do something crazy like start a vineyard you know that that to me is far more complicated than when I ever wanted to accomplish but what I want to accomplish to find a way to live sustainably of one piece of land and that's whether it's a farm you know a small family farm or what it you know livestock to as a romantic as it sounds it's not necessarily that feasible I mean there is there's a lot of draw there's a lot of things that just you know nature will nature will school you it's it ends up really coming down to collaboration it really does come down to to not just hunt or gather cultivator but like also community you have to kind of work together to make any of that work and that's that's the reality if there's a lot of people that have that romantic notion of like I'm just gonna go out to the woods and just and just live off the land and you're gonna live a very short life that's where a cult comes in that's where the cult comes in so buy the land yeah so there's definitely like it's definitely possible to do those kind of things but as far as quality of life and the longevity longevity of life the collaboration ends up actually fitting better that community that village ends up really really working it's hard to find that though isn't it it's hard to find some like-minded people that you can enjoy but it's already happening there's that there's entire there's entire even in where we live in Arizona there's entire communities that have you know the garden garden communities and you know we're making pastas now that are from 100% Arizona wheat so we can grow wheat we make the flour I can actually make pastas free that go with the wine which we also grow but the things we can't I don't have so we don't make salt you know there's like spices you would like to have and that kind of thing so it's ends up being your back to the trading you know trading your wares with other communities and that's great but then just all the nutrition that you just get you know the basic fulfillment of that homegrown stuff it it resonates on a you know microfiber level in your body for sure yeah it's pretty badass in Arizona is a tricky place too because you guys don't get a lot of rain we get a little bit of rain and it's a matter of making sure you're planting in the right spot where the rain gets to the cisterns the cisterns yeah you have to water storage carry the water rainwater and figure out a way to move it mm-hmm yeah it's um if you ever thought about living somewhere where it rains a lot is that like a better option no I I just would the Arizona's just where I'm supposed to be just you know I grew up in Michigan so that's pretty moist and yeah it's got those mosquitoes and deer fly and year the humidity I just can't my body doesn't resonate in that place and I just get attacked by every bug and every creature known to man and in places like Michigan and Seattle Washington State and all that but in in Arizona free and clear like there's there are scorpions I see them now and then I've seen the rattlesnakes if none of that stuff bugs me you know that madam it goes after me my dad who lives in Michigan you know he's in Michigan like none of that stuff bugs and the deer fly that you know the mosquitoes and stuff it just kind of like bounces off from it's fine comes to Arizona immediately gets bit by a brown recluse a Hualapai tiger chased by a fucking rattlesnake I like all this to Arizona just like what are you doing here get out he got bit by a brown recluse that's no joke yeah like a big hole in his leg oh my god yeah you've seen that yeah that's disgusting there's nothing they found with Arizona is Jaguars coming across from Mexico there's there was a show called monster quest with a car Jaguar oh no no the animal i yeah its leopard in Africa right Jaguar in South America I think so they've started to see Jaguars in in in Arizona hunting Republican sir no no yeah just after our pile they just have to that joe arpaio guy that's got to be a weird thing representing your state you know when you you tell people be here from Arizona and they go oh yeah that's that fucking guy that makes people work pink yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a wonderful state to live in because it's the last State of the Union where the 48th state so we're kind of the infants and we're kind of the Mavericks in a way so there's all this unresolved like archaic shit that goes on there but there's all this amazing beautiful stuff as well that we actually get to do because we're not kind of a part of the East Coast like this is how it's done we've been here for 200 years it's actually we're kind of you know still finding our way in a way and so there's there's the good and the bad that goes with that and there's you know probably a lot more bad that outweighs it but I don't I'm not exposed to it was I'm I mean under good there is you know on that note you know the wine industry in general is was met with like you know that's for that's you know it's alcohol its wine it's the you know who read the religious right in there and the conservative Republicans initially were like what are you doing but now we've changed some we completely changed the agricultural and economic landscape of that state with what we're doing with the vineyards to the point where the governor god bless her has actually gone on record with the municipalities and said support what he's doing get behind him that's how that's so it to have a conservative person who was like probably teetotaler anti-alcohol all that kind of stuff her have somebody like that who you already know her story like to have them support what you're doing is like you're we're definitely making a mark and that's a beautiful thing if you're governor wasn't a fucking moron that chicks scary dumb so if you ever seen some of the debates with her holy shit where they asked her questions and she just locked up and just stopped talking and you're like you're not allowed to do that I'm not allowed to stop talking and then she's still 1 whatever that means yeah but she supports you yeah that's it's an amazing it's amazing thing to witness the kind of the naysayers coming around to like you know havin to like explain to them over and over again there's like these small communities in Europe that they whether whatever storm you throw it on they don't care who's king or dictator why wasn't it a there's small communities that there are small community they grow their own food and the cornerstone of their of their economic stability is our vineyards and you know something that like takes dedication and time and focus and commitment to a long-term thing and then everything around it can then sustain itself based on that being the hub do you ever recognize how unique this is for someone who has achieved your position as a musician and you know has someone there's had so much cultural influence to have this sort of radical change and just go off and start a vineyard and and become a small local business and aid the community like that I mean it's a really kind of a unusual departure well I mean it's only a departure if you're only looking at the part of my life that had to do with music if you're looking at the part of my life that came before the music you know I was I was part of the military I was I was accepted to West Point to become an officer and I chose not to go to so to go into the arts so I was in some way already doing these kind of things in a way you know you got your muleteer and you got your politicians I was kind of part of that part of that structure to begin with organized sports military ballet you sure so you pocket pool you've managed to really be your own unique individual you've really managed to not find a pattern to fall into but rather fall into the pattern that you felt personally drawn to yeah it kind of like again going back to just following your intuition about what your decision I mean when you're standing there and you're having to make a decision like when you receive that appointment in your hand going okay I'm going to be an officer and I'm gonna go to West Point and when I get out I see I can see my future all the way to the to the end you know classmates of mine are now like you know Colonels in charge of several divisions in Afghanistan so that would be that would be what I would be doing right now I mean yeah I can't say that for sure because I I'm not nearly the day a dedicated soldier that those guys are and that kind of vision but as far as that part of that corporation that part of that company that's what I was tested I was that's my path was laid out in front of me so to see that and go I can be a part of that whole thing or I can follow this feeling in my stomach right now and go I think I'm gonna go to art school so to actually make that decision and have all your friends and your family kind of go what the fuck did you just do yeah and that was long before you'd ever heard about me and to know that that's what I was supposed to do and to follow that against anybody else's advice you know that's that's a strong a strong statement when it comes to following one's intuition do you realize how inspirational that is I mean to a guy like me or two especially two guys coming up that may you know or they have a vision they have an idea and they see someone like you that they admire that has done that and really has so obviously carved out the life that they really wanted to live based on their intuition based on their idea which so few people ever actually do you recognize that influence maybe that's a that's a huge thing for for um and it always it's always gonna come down to what you what you were gonna decide for you it's kind of hard to them I had a my old back in Michigan I went to a church I did a little bit Church that's I might disappoint you but she had open one so if you a minister pastor I should say and the only reason I went to this place because a guy made this guy made sense super low-key awesome speaker he told stories he had no judgement I mean you know there's one point I was having problems and you know people are thought that it was way too into kiss and Alice Cooper we're gonna talk to the preacher and he called me in the AVI and I can't went into his place and he went and he shut the door he goes so tell me all about this man I was like he's freely anything as a smoke he just listened to all of that stuff then he started kissing you know can you say that with your pants off nothing like that like it was nothing he just like was just into like so what is it about this stuff like resonates with you what is it what is it that like inspires you about it and I was like telling these stories he goes I'm a storyteller I like that you like to tell stories used to tell more stories and I started writing poetry I started writing stuff based on that conversation with him so you know out of that and they used to tell a story that I thought it was very pertinent you know you go off to camp and you'd have some experience there and you come back and whatever you experienced out there whatever whatever camp that was you went to metaphorically and you come back to the general populace that's easy he would always tell the story about Moses coming down from the mountain and having his mountaintop experience and then coming back down to the rat race to where people he's a changed person there's something different in his eyes and he's watching everything that's happening and there's no possible way he will ever be able to like explain to his the people that he sees daily what the fuck happened cuz they didn't happen to them it happened to him he saw it and he just has to kind of you know live his life on that and not be disappointed in us and his friends and family in his community because they didn't see it so it's not it's not their fault they didn't they didn't experience that but he has to like not he has to kind of understand that a everybody has to go through that themselves if they're gonna go through it like the other thing we talked about what kids going into the military and having that like that moment where you're on your own you know you stick your hand in the jar with the ants and you know that kind of thing you're talking about that coming becoming an adult he was that he would tell that story and it was very important a very important lesson for me to go okay you're on your own with these decisions you kind of have to these things are not everybody's gonna get it so don't worry about everybody getting it just as well folks so to have that sort of confidence to branch out independently on their own with their that vision that's terrifying it's terrifying but that's the only way really yeah you find your own path yeah that's so hard for people to accept and so hard it's not what people want to hear the you know it seems it's so terrifying to be completely independent of all the people around you giving you other advice but it's all I want to do it and if you see you know that's that's how that's how things happen you see something that's not being done or you see something that's your you want to have happen if it's not happening go do it it's got it you got to be honest with yourself as well too you have to actually know what you really truly want and a lot of people will talk themselves into things that they want because there's maybe security in it or you know they could see connect-the-dots future mm-hmm thank you very much for coming on this podcast been amazing it's a you got an awesome story man you're you're a
