September night there we go completed my homework boom so what was the day that we were supposed to die from Nibiru I think it was the 20 it was Saturday yeah 23rd 23rd Jaime 33 days after the Eclipse oh then Nibiru was gonna come and smash us wouldn't isn't it huge will we see you coming pretty big it has to be pretty big yes we're pretty big do you know the whole zecharia sitchin thing do you know the whole thing a little bit yeah I was kind of into that for a while to as a while ago that I realized I was like super into it like art bell days yeah yeah just I love art final days I remember when his son got kidnapped oh that's really sweet I don't know I couldn't tell if it was real or not that's the problem I used to listen to it coming home from the comedy store there was the thing to listen to yeah in a clock late night driving home live from Pahrump Nevada yapper up like this fenced-in compound in Pahrump Nevada with a radio signal I mean he's like in a lot of ways he was like doing internet before the Internet yeah yeah you're right he was kind of like a like an aggregator like a curator it means a curator is conscious curation but it but it it is that what you mean like the content of what he was talking about was also like the there's a lot I would say there's a lot more people that have access to like UFO conspiracy theory type stuff now because of the Internet yeah before then or that was your own source for they got you right right right the yeah yeah the deep the deep cuts yeah that kind of stuff what is this son kidnapping is pretty dark son assaulted by HIV teacher oh jesus let's not put that on there's some people out there yeah I know but art Bell had this crazy fenced-in compound that literally looked like it was in the middle of this like open prairie there are pictures of it yeah they put pictures online who knows what I was looking at might not even banana I've been like he fake people out with this thought my lives in a regular house he yeah you want him to live in that situation I I hope yeah he's he's kind of like a you know in a way he was like a mystic those types of people they're kind of like mystics they're Hermits they live in like these weird places because they have to be you know in the right conditions to receive the information yeah there's his house see it's all like fenced in oh wow yeah it's a very large that's a weird he's got windmills for electricity Wow he's get some big sort of truck he's got backed in there where he gets probably supplies he's a total prepper oh my god that's amazing that's and it's bluish yeah goal or something it is so like a Beverly Hills rundown motel color yeah you know as a rant Rambler you know like off tans and off blues yeah that tower the radio tower fucking tower in the middle of his yard that can't give you cancer can it no should be right sure something's going on in it never it would never do any I know what that is that's it that's a picker that's a TV erial is like old school TV thing it's fucking huge towers you have and now cuz he must yeah cuz he used he probably brought he did he broadcast from there so yeah in a way that's another like internet reference art Bell was the first time I heard a Terence Mckenna outside of a buildings joke one Bill Hicks joke oh right referenced he says Oh Kenneth he's talking about five grams of dried mushrooms or what Terence Mckenna would refer to as a heroic dose yes and I was like wow who's Terence Mckenna yeah then I heard Terence Mckenna out on the art Belle show live what Hawaii what Terence Mckenna and this crazy set up in Hawaii where he lived in Kona on the mountain and he was totally off the grid but way more than art bell he was in the jungle off the grid he would have these basins to catch rainwater he had several acres around him which he was growing psychedelic plants he had a thousand books he lived totally by himself he had like a generator for power and he was completely off the grid and he built the house there Wow dude that's heavy he's just up there writing and tripping and then he would leave like every six months he would take off and leave for six months and just do these tours where he would do these speaking things in like hippy places like Austin Texas and you know Portland Oregon and shit like that yeah and they would gather on all these people to listen to all this stuff yeah and if you ever heard psychedelics Ilan uh psychedelic salons a podcast a great podcast and I've had Lorenzo from psychedelic salon on it's all like old recordings of Timothy Leary and Alan Watts are you related and I know I really wish that I was related to him that would be rather nice profound and within English access he's very accountable but he has all the McKenna recordings like all of him like way back way back through time he slays him all the time McKenna was which time period I sometimes get them confused with Leo with leery you know he was post Leary but he was there you know he was there during that era but he came into prominence post Leary I think his main psychedelic experiences were in the 70s like he had some really really crazy mushroom trips with his brother Dennis who's a no that's amazing Dennis is alive he's alive I'm sorry he's been on his podcast several times a great guy he's amazing and he's actually a professor and Dennis like recounts all these tales and one time Terence and Dennis went into the jungle they took too many mushrooms and Dennis completely lost his mind like went away for two weeks whoa for two weeks just incoherent rambling had some sort of a psychotic event like and just like broke down the nature of reality itself just went way too deep yeah it was gone like two weeks they had to watch him yeah didn't watch over him oh my god it's almost like he was exposed to such a complicated mathematical equation and it took him that long to figure it out and he came out of he's like okay I figured it but you know Terrence came up with the idea of the stoned ape theory and it wasn't just tenant Terrance it was Terrence along with a lot of other psychedelic researchers they sort of formulated some of the the parts of this hypothesis but the parts of this hypothesis had to deal with human beings evolving from lower primates because the lower primates were forced to try out new foods because the rainforests were receding into grasslands and all these undulates who were eating up all the plants as they're growing up they were shitting and they're leaving cow patties and these cow patties the mushrooms of course would grow yeah so these monkey people like things that were us that we're living in the trees they were forced to test out new food sources and coincides this theory coincides with climate data that we know about changing of the temperatures back in Africa during that time and in these particular regions and he thinks that these lower primates started experimenting with mushrooms it started eating you know that flipped cow patties all the time to get beetles and bugs and things along those lines right and so they looked bigger yeah and they would pick these mushrooms out to see if they could eat them well in low doses mushrooms enhance visual acuity so it would help you be a better hunter makes you more sensitive and it makes you more horny which would make you more likely to breed so you would be more likely to be a successful hunter and more likely to breed that's that's that's like that's that's like a triple threat right crazy and that's outside of the psychedelic effects right the psychedelic grass of enhancing community of creative thinking all these things that happen when you do mushrooms yeah and varying doses yeah and he believes that mushrooms are responsible for the doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years which is apparently the biggest mystery in the fossil record there's no I like it's so quick yeah so it's a total departure and it's the organ responsible for the fossil record in the first place exactly understanding of what reason why we're writing all this stuff down I mean it's because of the mind well this mine doubled over a period of two million years I think they what they think is there's a bunch of different factors and snow people argue about this but I think it's really important to be balanced about this and go I don't know think if it's either/or I think there was a bunch of shit going on yeah absolutely they think it had to do with humans figuring out fire and how to cook meat they think cooking me allowed people to get more nutrients which allowed people to be healthier and if you can kill one animal you'd have more resources to sort of figure things out and you start thinking up shelters and weapons all these different various things that led to civilization there's one theory that was only that way that trade the throwing arm is another one the fact that we could throw so we could throw things we could hit shit there was nowhere near us like no other animal and then once we figured out Spears we started like this this ability to do this one thing might have led us to enough free time to start innovating yeah and then the brain as time went on favored the ones who are more innovative and more more disciplined and more creative and those are the ones that survive longer which is obviously like what we're reward in people today yeah yes true yeah that hasn't gone away no that hasn't gone away that totally makes sense I mean it's like you know I've you in general the idea of awareness and consciousness is a you know as a metaphor it's many people use it but just like a computer operating system yeah so so or you know it consciousness experiencing itself infinitely you know but like that's like this form of an operating system and the we live in a binary version of isolate which which is kind of like a game you know to then rediscover the the fact that that's not true it is true but it's also not true you know to arrive at the paradox to the the answer of the the thing that happens it within a paradox you know a good joke right right when you're when you're like here's the setup here's the punchline and so is somewhere when those two things collide in a group of people if it it will trigger a reaction and if it's laugh at laughter in that moment it's it's understanding a paradox it's like feeling the effects of a paradox where it actually like write you a very unique moment a grazie thing that like you didn't expect experience because it's so different than everything else you experience in everyday life it's like it's like everything and nothing simultaneously like you get that quick like because a joke kind of does that at least in my opinion and and and that makes you feel like it gives everyone a sense of enlightenment for for a moment I know what you're saying I don't think a joke does it the way a psychedelic experience there's like this weird moment when you're laughing at someone who's really killing like when you Bob yeah you you escape from your the shackles of your normal thinking yes yeah yeah yeah totally and you and you it's just a joyfulness because it's it's like you get this perspective it's like such a zoomed out perspective on this thing in such a small instant of time that yeah it's like being on a ride you know it's like you're just suddenly there yeah do you feel like when I've been talking about this a lot the do you feel like that what's going on is like a form of hypnosis when a comedian is like killing over a crowd like it's like a form of hypnosis because I always feel like when I'm watching someone on stage and they really got me I'm not really thinking I'm kind of allowing them to think for me and I'm just like sitting down smiling and enjoying the ride they take me on I'm not doing any analyzing myself especially that's like one of the reasons why it's very important to like really think carefully about people's attention spans and how to get these ideas into their head I think it is in a way it's like a state of mind that you achieve on stage that's very similar to hypnosis yeah if you're talking about the effect on people or and you tend the idea what's happened I think the comedian as well because I feel like it's my job to put all the pieces together and practice it and just tweak it and to but when I get on stage and it starts happening I feel like I'm as much of a passenger as I am the driver oh man yeah that's a really great description yeah I agree with that 100% I mean you know like sometimes I'll say that the feeling that I get onstage if I'm you know making music or even just like riffing or whatever is that I feel like I'm actually I'm watching the show or I might actually step out of myself and I'm actually yeah kind of enjoying the show yeah there will be a moment row be like oh fuck right I'm also doing snap back in but in those moments that's that's exactly I dig I dig that because it exists it just depends on where your awareness lands you know what I always feel like man I always feel like the dude running the old-school movie projector because you're really just kind of turn it on but you have to be there in case anything fuck yeah yeah there was a yeah there was an operator there's yeah there was just someone next to it just in case something fuck do you remember when movies fucked up and you'd have to yell out oh yeah I do absolutely the other fuck-ups the chaos community that's a real test of character to see whether you talking movie theater oh yeah what do you mean like like like the kind of people that talk and movie players during the movie like you really know whether or not you can hang out with someone if they talk in a movie yes absolutely a hundred percent because if someone starts talking the movie to you like hey you're inconsiderate yeah Oh totally or unless like you know for me I have this like little secret that once if if it's a brief comment I don't really mind so much but yeah the secret get really quiet and get close to their ear and don't whisper just speak in kind of like right because the higher your whisper is it's much more sibilant and everyone can hear it so whispers are actually louder hushed tone and it was also the people to just start talking about normal shit oh yeah nothing to do with the machina you asshole this guy's gonna get killed by a robot lady just didn't seeing how that even comes to be shut the fuck up she's about to kill me Troy was really angry the other day I was right this avatar - motherfucker let's go in Hutchinson three I'm wearing glasses that's the crazy thing hey you know it's just coming out this fall gives a fuck what's gonna happen in the future you might not even be alive I might kill you for talking in the movie theater so I know you have no idea how I'm gonna react you're taking a big risk man I'm really hungry let's get something to eat after this but later the people that can't even wait an hour to eat like know I have to be filled now I need to fill my holes you know cuz your holes get lonely me I can't survive yeah that's tough man that's a tough racket because some people I don't know some I mean though obviously there are people that have like this weird thing that happens when you know that hangry thing or whatever their blood so then they kind of get crazy however I will say for the most part it's about discipline and the discipline turns into just nature and then you get a better sense of well how if you are hungry you're like you know what I'm hungry and that's fine yeah you can be fine I'm gonna be hungry I can live for a few days tough day so so a few hours they're like four hours extra I'm gonna be fine did you hear about the guy that lost like more than a hundred pounds by fasting for an entire year he had doctors monitoring him it was all part of some sort of scientific experiment and we had it we were talking about him with Rob wolf correct is that who was telling us about it or was it Dom - Agustin wasn't like in the 60s or Sun no knows fairly recently yeah fairly recently because the doctors were monitoring him he lost over a hundred pounds and here's what's really crazy his skin shrunk with him like his body corrected for itself yep which is like what because he went into a complete state of ketosis right words his body's only fuel was from the actual extra fat in his body and then when his body started consuming this I mean he could have like really bizarre genetics where his skin doesn't stretch out this is it right twenty fifty-pound man fasted for a year and he lost more than half his weight yeah I think that's it it happened in 1965 I was at the same one I think see if there's a recent Oh cuz if Rob Lowe was talking about that they had all these color photos of the guy that looked really recent you might be right but I think I think it was a recent maybe they recreated it maybe that's what it was but this guy whatever it was all he did was this ass ain't the same one same one all he did was drink water and his body just ate its fat I don't think vitamins or what he had to take some for some fiber because he needs stuff to go through I wish Rob Wolfe was here pretty sure he's one who told us about it what I think was was the most shocking was that his skin Trump doesn't that's the that's the that's the weird thing I mean I mean with weight loss like I lost it like around 50 about 55 pounds damn yeah I just started lifting I got a trainer and started lifting and then basically eating like a bodybuilder so just and that's how I eat for the most part I feel better that way oh man way better it's crazy like crazy like people sometimes will look at the food that I'm bringing which is always pretty much the same thing what do you eaten like you know like for breakfast it's like this what I call the year or what he calls the yurga shake my trainer he has this shake that he that he digs and it's like half key for half or no a cup of yeah a cup of oats raw oats 1/2 a cup of kefir 1/2 cup of water and then 35 grams of J Rob chocolate egg white protein oh and a handful of frozen blueberries damsons got a lot of good stuff going on there you got it since you got probiotics from the key yeah you got some carbs from the oats yeah you got protein yeah see just eat good it's a funny completion the problem is there's a lot of fucking dummies that also eat and they're annoying for regular people that like want to be healthy but they don't want to be that annoying guy the gym that's fucking right just droning on and on about his sets and his lifts and you start thinking that being healthy is for idiots yes right I know it gives it a bad rap it does it's it's not it's not that you know my favorite thing that I've been learning like lifting and sometimes we go to Gold's on Saturday like in the treat so like we go to Gold's and Venice and it's what I love about anything that I get involved with is just observing like how the system works you know and like what do you get a community like what's the level of awareness like what do they focused on those types of things and a thing I really dig about lifting is that it's not what you think like I think people think like oh meatheads yeah you know roided-up bla bla bla bla and don't get me wrong they're some of those pretty sure and it wouldn't be a real gym with that without a couple but like you go and you go into gold and man people are so respectful another very friendly very respectful they he'll be like rack rack their weights they help you they react if you're working in they get things out of the way they think about like stuff like being in the way or not you know there's there's a lot of like really cool conscious hey let me help you yeah oh you know that lift that you don't like this putting too much stress on your on your shoulder you might want to like pull in a little bit with your elbow or whatever just a tip you know so those guys are great the guys that are annoying are the guys I want to correct you and they're wrong oh no don't do that you just can't there's guys that just have this idea in their head that they need to absolutely tell you their knowledge oh man it must come out now I it's it's weird and II can tell the difference yeah like if someone's like giving you a small piece of corrective advice for exercises that you're doing in the moment or that you're doing so it's not a critique of the exercise so it's more like I'm looking at you doing this exercise and here's a little piece that might make it more efficient right on better better use of your movement or whatever you that's great I get that and you can get that right away like oh that's dope I'll try that and if it works it works if it doesn't doesn't you know but with someone psycho enough on these giant concepts like these just just things that are too large to give to someone that you don't know right they just start firing it out at ya yeah with all these like physiological words yeah what yes totally well yeah I mean if we can yeah sure man yeah that's thanks man thank you yeah my scapula supraspinatus and with your knowledge knowledge jerking there is knowledge absolutely yeah and it gets grouped in with mansplaining which i think is like another form of it's just a general as general human terms have you heard he Pete it's a new one oh it's the Hat he Pete is when a woman says something and everybody ignores it and the man says the exact same thing oh great I fucked I know it that I know what that is and that's fucked I do not like that there's nothing that pisses me off more it's Peter here let me let me capitalize on an idea that was not really delivered in at the right timing you know that's like but I'm just gonna claim respond yeah don't say Debbie just had a great idea yeah yeah yeah that's never seen a good person a country person oh man Debbie just had a good idea as the good person hey everybody Debbie just had a great idea yeah the bad guys like I got a good idea yeah it's all in Debbie's like what to do yeah fucking job son I knew this guy was an asshole here's my proof that culture of like not like being in a corporate world and like one person is the boss and the other people have to kiss Hassan the boss and then the boss has a boss the regional boss was coming right everybody tighten up yeah he's gonna put his good tie on yeah the only time that system works is if the boss is a really good person being a boss yeah that's the only time which is very very rare super rare because they're playing against it yeah that's what's happening what you have to exist you have to exist by while ignoring all the trappings of bosses yeah right right if you're just looking at like just from a rational logistic like efficient making mindset like you want you want you want and and what the value of efficiency also relates to the happiness of the workers and there will be not coddling too much but providing just the just the right amount of things plus a little bit extra to give it the grease that it needs and it will go finding people to fill your team that are like-minded or willing to like kind of think that way yes where everybody kind of works together almost as a family yes exactly those I'm sure those jobs exist I know I've talked to people they love their jobs I know there's people like that that are putting it together right I think that there are companies and if not there are moments when companies are like that yeah you know and because everything changes so it might not be sustainable if we keep going I feel like you know people don't people like to look at the worst aspects of any point in time right whether it's with climate change or are crazy presidential situation or race relations and whatever we always look at the worst aspects of it but I think overall it's pretty undeniable this is the best time ever to be alive in terms of health care in terms of you know with the science behind keeping people alive in terms of your ability to get information in terms of our ability to communicate with each other and bullshit to get through to us like it's way less likely that bullshit gets through to people today than the propaganda they could spew just in like the 1960s Oh get over on us that's mean the gulf of tonkin thing like the whole thing the whole reason what we got into war so I just think that if we can keep it together and we can keep going I think 40 years from now 50 years from now that's gonna I think we're gonna realize that that should be the norm and that the really healthy communities is going to be the norm and all these things this is like almost like aberrations that we when we look back in time and thinking like people who were kings and they had people under them and they executed people at their own whim and that you know they don't exist in a few places today it's like North Korea and like maybe a couple other places mm-hmm I feel like in the future we're all gonna move towards it we're just it's just hard to see why we're in it we're all moving towards a better way of living yeah yeah I mean that I mean I think of it you know if I if I go back to that like the reality awareness issue or the idea that you know there are multiverses and that every choice splits off and makes another choice makes another choice so in essence if just a yeah that in essence if anything is possible if if the amount of realities and possibilities that exists are infinite and but we're like perceiving one point you know yeah as a whatever consciousness experiment or whatever you want to call it but as your point of reference as you move in every choice that you make you can actually steer yourself to the reality that you want to live in so I mean I think that there's a there's something great about seeing the trajectory of what you just described and moving towards that future yeah but being proactive in the way that you can and but I think really the I think the thing that's really going to help all of that is energy like if we can figure out a way to distribute energy so that it's more equal amongst all human beings on the planet right like something you mean energy in terms of power actual power yeah like well power in power yeah I would feel like there's a lot of places in the earth that would benefit from some super advanced form of solar yes like free energy yeah I mean because if yeah for sure yeah why even ever have power plants do I have any of that stuff now can all be independent and we don't total I on a grid either this way no no no it distributed power is the is the best power especially if it is connected because then you have it can manage itself I mean even if like you know artificial intelligence things like that or just really good programming it just optimizes constantly in real-time based on a sensor array well you know they use really good backcountry solar panels to charge batteries for cameras and phones that's right my friend Adam was in Montana and he was in Colorado Montana Idaho and Wyoming went on this epic backcountry hunt and one of the things that he did is he brought this solar thing to charge his phone every day do insta stories from the top of the mountain yeah amazing amazing stuff but that you couldn't do that just a few years ago I mean there was no the kind of solar power that you could pack up and a little thing and stuff into your backpack it's crazy I know yeah I was checking out there's a company out of Australia that makes these solar generators and they're they're like 17 grand or something like that or maybe even oh no they meant even more like 30 grand so anyways it's this like fairly lightweight system it's like a mast system that has a base and and a solar array and it tracks the Sun so moves automatically with the Sun and it accounts like it also has like some other program the weather data that's also integrated into it either real-time or stored and so it it but it's able to produce like a pretty decent amount of electricity I don't remember the numbers but it was definitely way more than a trickle charge you could almost like you could run a refrigeration system on it like a small refrigeration so you can keep food from perishing yeah you know maybe even get some air conditioning going or something yeah I think with a storage battery 20 years from now who knows how this shit is gonna be well I mean you know if you I just got done seeing that a documentary I don't know I don't remember the name of it but it's a kind of kind of conspiracy UFO what you want it's those a fairly recent one yeah it's fairly Steven Greer guy I not sure it's on iTunes is featured on iTunes do you remember the name of it I can find it what the unknown yeah yeah seems right I yeah an acknowledge did you like it there's our belly there's acid it was kind of our belly actually art by those are tough shows for me to watch because it makes sense like some of the stuff that they're talking about yeah that makes sense but my theory is that the level of organization that they're talking about doesn't really exist like it's not that tight I think I think it's kind of messy I think it's it's the same thing like just look at kids on a playground and see how they organize themselves yes socially and then just expand that with a little bit more complex today or more complexity and you have these this idea of like the secrecy the structure of secrecy and yeah you know ancient a like cults that have now risen you know Rosicrucians and masons and the Illuminati in those types of things I think that does they can like that sort of thing does exist but it doesn't exist in the tight efficient controlled version that I think it's I think it's messier than that I think it's people trying to influence other people using a bunch of tactics but I think that you can't have control you can't have that much control as as much control as they're talking about well the only way that would work is if the government was different than people like if they weren't if it was made of people yeah it wasn't people yeah they were so smart that they weren't people that's not the case Donald Trump is the fucking president yeah we have proof that the government is filled with people guys a person you know person right yeah so no person has ever been able to pulled off that level of conspiracy for any length of time and the idea that you could hide somehow communication with aliens yes and that the aliens would choose the government of all people why would the aliens give a fuck who we picked in a popularity contest oh that's the representative that gets to speak to Zeta Reticuli yes they talk to whoever they want man go and check when we visit a bee colony excuse me suck some bees out the back you take them to a lab test just listen I need you to go back to the Queen we need to go to the king you imagine some fucking dude sitting in the White House you know at the Oval Office and the alien walks in I am the representative it doesn't make any sense I believe I believe in like so many things so infinitely that things can exist some things are possible however there are things that are just like it just makes sense you know it intuitively you can feel some connection to real like you know what I'll leave a ten percent margin of possibility you know like you know something like that ideas where I'm like I can't I just can't I it could be real but I've seen nothing that compels me to believe that it is but it could be real I'm definitely not saying there are no aliens or the government has been contacted by aliens of aliens having visited sure sure I mean why not you mean it I mean I I don't think it's impossible but again I think it's not in to the extent at which yeah when you compress all the data and you like formulate a story about it you know it's really unlikely yeah it's like well I don't know it seems you you have to you kind of have to do that like you can't talk about that stuff it also slightly super likely to me that in the future we won't send biological entities into these places they don't have all these limitations as far as like what we can survive we'll send some sort of an artificial intelligence yeah maybe that's what those things are those great things the big black eyes maybe those are robots oh man but then the question is is it's you know my theory is that the whole our propulsion or their compulsion to to constantly be making technology right it's based on our desire to make or build ourselves outside of ourselves yeah so without the the the normal biological means it's like we're fascinating and we're fascinated at simulating ourselves outside of ourselves yeah and so in essence we could just be that already right and so so it's like we're just like on this constant carrot chasing propulsion system yeah there's a lot of people that when they look at the image of the alien they they look at that image and they say that it's entirely preposterous that someone would achieve or something would achieve a humanoid like shape with all the massive amounts of different shapes that we have on earth yes right right it's just to be mobile that's not the only way to be mobile and know we know how ours came to be that we used to be crawling and then we start standing up right that's why we have all these issues with our spine yeah our spine wasn't entirely designed to support upper body weight that's right yeah yeah that's right yeah and yeah the other thing is it's one of my pet peeves and I'm just putting this in this the spectrum of science fiction every every celestial body every planet every moon and they all have different gravities yeah so there's gonna be different types of creatures not only that but when they come to our planet they're gonna need a really strong exoskeleton suit or they're gonna be so incredibly strong you know that it wouldn't matter also atmospheric gases like you know like how they produce energy oh there's such a vast complexity that we we life mmm is the way that it is now because of all of the elements that were present at the times that they were present in our reality and so and even if you take it on a software level like something like was that game spore where it was like it was built on like a generative mmm-hmm entire universe yeah and they would and they would kind of create on their own base yeah like your light touch and it was the infinite Jamie didn't you say that that got boring though because there's really nothing happening in these infinite that's uh no no no man's sky no man Scott so yeah similar idea yeah yeah that's it's you have to really you know the problem with those things is I know we're jumping around a lot but it just that's the whole show oh that is the show okay we'll jump around me like okay so where should we start talk about whatever yeah it's really good I like it there's no day no rules um so when you oh so this is what is this these are creatures just came out like prior 10-15 years oh this is dope it starts super small as little one celled organisms and works all the way up to organism getting on land and then you're really they're running a whole planet so when these these things are happening these little fuckers evolve yeah yeah yeah they evolve and what do you what are your tasks oh you have to fight ants here you survive whoa you get lost in these fucking buildings man then you can yes and now there's like tribal culture with a hierarchical leadership now are these other things you're interacting with artificial or the other hue they are multiplayer on yeah yeah so basically you evolve all the way to spacefaring - they're so cool looking yeah the fuck out of each other wood sticks though I'm gonna get past that chip man see see that's I know see that's the thing that's the thing about what that makes us that's why I call human beings the human race assimilation species it's like everything that we that we do we generate our ideas they're all based on like our observation of the world around us and then utilizing that in some way for our for ourselves and so like you know design of things why we color things the way they are certain chemicals or why things or you know look the way they look or the shape the way they're shape all of that so when I see a game about simulation of course we're gonna make simulation a game about simulations arguably a like children playing with dolls and figures and stuff like that it's another form of simulation but the idea of like having the awareness of another reality and projecting the idea that you want more with bigger I guess some more control yeah having control over a representation of your idea of a desired reality is Chris crazy I mean that's like that's like simulation within simulation and then simulations and it's it's totally to me a nice piece of evidence for that yeah I think we're gonna get better at it and it's gonna get indiscernible you're gonna be able to put some headphones on and they're gonna plug some stuff and they can put some some of those greasy pads with ya somewhere there's some wetware stuff connect it to your head in all those various places I'm gonna hook you up with this machine and you're gonna go somewhere that's so much cooler than reality you're gonna be like fuck reality man yeah yeah I'm gonna will it you're gonna you're gonna go and do your stupid job at Home Depot and you're like fuck this job you're gonna come home and you're gonna put that thing on I have to figure out a way staying here I'm standing world yeah like surrogate Tron world what surrogates forget the movie uh Bruce Willis oh yeah that's right I remember yeah movie it's all about telepresence before like just in pods it's kind of they had like a robot yeah and there were people like jumping off of like buildings and shit because they could there were no consequences so it looked like underneath that yeah half whoa freaky yes surrogate as well as robot yeah Bruce was younger yeah that was like one of the first uses of CGI to to make someone younger in a movie oh yeah that's right look how beautiful her skin looked that's a very smooth super smooth they just did that recently with guardians of the galaxy - with who or Russell Kurt Russell's red yeah you know the four you know the one time that I noticed the most was Tron the neutron yeah that's right that's where they like I remember being like expose is like this breakthrough - I mean it's a Benjamin Button like you know faked his fuck it looked fake it's fuck I mean it wasn't a simulation yeah even the fact that it wasn't a simulation looks fake within the videogame Kurt Russell they looked amazing that simple dude he looked perfect I mean he look really good yeah he looks yeah now that looks it looks like a 35 year old Kurt Russell that looks great it is really good and the mental fauna shit oh it's a are you talking about - yeah I you know the one thing that really pissed me off is a baby Groot I hate when they put baby characters I don't like can't stand it it's so obvious it's such an obvious play it's like is obvious even Mork & Mindy when they have a Jonathan winters I didn't I wasn't afraid of obvious things that are awesome like tits they worked what's okay but how obvious things that are awesome there's there's no I know that little baby Groot was cute I could not stand that opening sequence with like the he's like being casual and he's taking out all the bad guys I'm like that's so gross I don't what I'm singing oh yeah like is the opening sequence yeah I couldn't I didn't I'd now you know what though dude I'm a dork comic books man I've always been a dork for comic books and comic book movies and I'm I'm so get like I'll make fun of people for like in Pro Wrestling no it's fake that's not the point yeah Game of Thrones is fake tomb we'll go back and forth Wow I'll get fucking thrilled when David or Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk I love that shit yeah I get amped up oh I love that that bad I have no problem with that's so corny though I liked I like no that's not corny it got me angry I didn't like me when I'm angry I love that shit I always do that have you ever heard that of imagine what's his name British comedian really brilliant kind of all guy did a Jerry Springer The Musical and attended it didn't take it didn't take off not all those questions like protesting their protests these music yeah it was crazy it was like it was like really big and they it didn't happen or something like that like that the theater like decided not to do it or something like that oh that's rich that's so crazy what is it Richard Thomas no no no no never injured Thomas it's he's got it he's got a program in on TV and the BBC but anyway he sees this he's this brilliant he has a joke about Angley I did the Hulk yeah yeah say yes so the and his whole thing is just insane it's a long joke it takes like seven minutes the setup is just him talking about how he he worked with Angley and at the end of this interview he said Angley you wouldn't like me when I'm angry something like that and Angley not getting it and then him explaining the whole lead-up back to that again and then Angley not getting and explaining it again and it just goes it's it's I think I'm remembering it right but it's just brilliant and then it's such an abstract weird slice of a way to get to a punchline and it's just it's perfect a hug punchline it's a Hulk of arguably the worst Hulk movie yeah definitely definitely the worst Eric Bana one who's I loved him in chopper but I didn't love him as Bruce Banner yeah even though his last name was bana and I thought that's pretty close to banner didn't do it you know why Barney on that movie I went to see it hi and when you go to see high movies that movies just like offensive what I'm aware of the illusion you're casting wizard yeah that's a problem maybe they had Hulk dogs in that one yeah I didn't build therapist it was like it's like the three three or two-headed dogs was that two-headed I remember it was a Hulk dog yes it had more than one head I think because it was it was Nick Nolte's dogs he was the dad remember he was a scientist dad yeah that's right yeah he turning to jellyfish that the one returned to jellyfish at the end he had jellyfish there's the holy dogs look at them oh yeah no they weren't that's amazing what a strange they're gonna be facing that hulked out poodle I mean yeah that's yeah remember that happened it essentially turned into the Hulk vs. a Hulk dog so when the dogs would get fired up the same thing would happen to them as having a fence right yeah that's right a Hulk dog didn't he get bigger look at that thing bite them on the back and didn't get bigger depending upon how much fucked up shit was happening like I shot him with bullets he kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger yeah maybe the oh yeah that's right I remember that yeah because he just keeps absorbing the energy yeah he's like an athlete nuclear about matter just kept getting bigger that's right could you fucking imagine like of all the superpowers that's the one that I think so appeal two kids like me when I was young I was little and worried about the world and nervous and you know you picked on your like how cool would it be to just be able to just get angry and all sudden you come this bulletproof thing they can leap through the air it's like freedom yeah max freedom but it was so corny like the words that he would say that they you could only read it oh yeah as a comic book when you're reading a comic book that's different than when you hear people speaking yeah like well you know in the Avengers when he takes what is it loci yeah let me feel okay near beats the fuck out of them you only human oh yeah no it's no no no no but if you saw in 1970s hulk lou ferrigno you're just like oh I mean comic like comic in the 70s just like like he's beating the fuck out of Loki yeah Mokey's kind of like like kind of fucked up man Hulk is just you know motionless and then it said that yeah be like yeah that makes sense he would say that he would definitely say that and that's cool yeah there's a lot of things you could only read people saying yeah like a kneecap I mean no one says - yeah handicap Wow that's a blast from the past teach is there any more popular cartoons are there any more Dilbert's out there in the world do you mean like hand drawn yeah comic strips are there big ones that people like look forward to every day there must be you're about to hear some some from I'm sure get ready you have to read the newspaper probably right newspapers anymore I don't know man yeah and and in online publications unless it's the New Yorker you usually don't do comic strips right it's just the articles and if they do it's probably like a one-off by an artist rather than a series like Andy Capp or dill burger you know mean yeah it's maybe a one-off with Obama and Trump standing next to each other talking or something yeah it's just a picture yes is what it's like playboy style picture the punch line of the joke underneath yeah I remember those Playboy ones whoa this is crazy I was a little kid get what in the fuck am I reading I know yeah oh their tits popping out and the guys trying to grab her yeah and it's humor yes like adult humor it's adult humor but today it's totally rape culture like it was in Playboy magazine those those ads that if you saw or those cartoons rather yeah you saw today you'd be like you can't read this no way I mean it's is it as bad no it is it is I was just gonna say is it as bad as Mickey Rooney and Breakfast at Tiffany's I don't remember that movie yeah I mean watch it but as soon as Mickey Rooney's character comes on line I've ever seen that which doesn't make sense or City really no it makes sense Breakfast at Tiffany's is like one of those movies you you you hear about all the time but you may not ever see it yeah that might be the case yeah I might not have ever seen it I remember trying to see it and I couldn't I couldn't finish it because of make you Britney I was just doing it there he plays a Chinese man Oh God that's wrong Japanese is it Japanese Japanese or is he wearing a Japanese things saying he's Chinese it says mister you know okay so definitely Japanese yeah okay so at least I thought I was gonna get really terrible with like mixing Asian cultures but apparently remember when Katy Perry had to apologize for wearing a kimono because people felt like it was offensive Japanese people that she was culturally appropriating she was like had this big sit-down with what about York I don't know about her one of the one of her album covers oh that's right these that was a different time when it was acceptable oh you're right you're right no less grandmother day yeah yeah so she she had apologized and she when she was apologizing remember she made this like video that will make your fucking brain hurt she's sitting there with dream had he says Mackeson from black lives matter and they're sitting on a couch cross-legged with their shoes off which by the way nobody knows nobody nobody know yeah sit down that like that with me I'm like hey what are we doing here oh yeah that's training comfortable well this is the weird terrible setup how about we just give us a comfy chair well a sit here and talk to me they're like fucking human it would be different if they're like kind of organic looking furniture and they were dressed more as like human people and I don't know you know I mean well she was addressing other hair this was the thing she had a dress her hair because she did something where she had braids and people are getting mad at her because she culturally appropriated and then she also addressed there her idea of dressing up like geisha so the problem is they went over and talked to people geishas are from where geishas from why don't want to say China no it's just it is Japan yeah yeah it's like the thing that people just don't understand so they went over there and yeah there's the braids that she had apologize for because that's that's her Katy Perry so they went over to Japan to talk to these folks and they universally were saying when they interviewed people in the street that they're happy that someone is expressing Japanese culture that they're aware of Japanese culture and they thought it was a very good thing they didn't think it was better esting like they don't have the same feelings about culture appropriation as some people do with fucking braids yeah yeah I get it what but it's the United States right we're sensitive / super sensitive we've gotten very since you know what it is it all comes from the litigious culture that's that's oh absolutely the fact that you can get sued for anything anybody can sue you at any time that's just like that's American culture that's what you do it's like you know what you pissed off someone like enough you can sue them like and so there's a lot of like suing Saints earning enough successful cases along the way that's part of it's like a fear-based operating system right so calling people on shit yeah maybe they didn't even think was bad yeah it's a combination of like someone like it's a good service to be able to sue someone if you need it to however it's abused up the yin-yang and there's like professional lawyers they have billboards everywhere but do you think Katy Perry was worried about being sued no I'm saying that I'm saying that the sensitivity is she like like why why we're so what American culture is so like PC at this point because there's a it kind of goes hand in hand it's like a sense of well I don't know I'm at a loss over to Stan but but I will say it's it having that litigious fear-based kind of motivator or it causes people to want to correct things like to course-correct to to a form of something that works for everyone to avoid being sued to of what I mean and not me not directly right by not directly but that thought process yeah that mom says yeah that mindset I think this because it's about like okay well how can we make this we have to include everybody on this which I believe in but absolutely but but I think it should be done out of a sense of empathy you know and not to say that that that you know people fighting for rights to have handicap parking like in the front of a building like that's it there's thing that's just a great idea but like I'm just saying the the what we what you were kind of referring to that sensitivity come comes from that where someone's like afraid of doing something wrong yeah and it just starts feeding back and feeding back feeding back and then you get people so for your fold any choice that they're making because I feel it you know every time I walk into a grocery store I'm like this entire store could be reduced to five percent the volume that it that it is right now and the amount of people in that store would have all the products they need hmm so the inundation of choice choice choice choice choice and fear of doing something wrong whether it's because I like to look perfect or I want to look perfect mmm or whatever it is that all mix that all together and it's a recipe for I think it's a factor for sure I think another factor though is that people get to complain and that people don't like when people are mad at them so when you have a giant group of people that can communicate instantaneously with with anybody at any time you're going to get more prevalence of complaining it's the same percentage of people are complaining but they weren't able to access everyone as they were to get to Katy Perry and bitch about her wearing braids right so in the past like in there's low derrick days when both derrick wore braids in ten which is really before that was that was nobody was well seen that no not on that level I mean was that a thing in black culture back then the bo Derek days what do you mean like braids yeah like those like cornrows I think since I think the slave days yeah but the grades have also been in almost every culture right braids for sure but those crazy cornrows like the corner I think those that that was that yet that was a direct reference I think to like Lorde she was like correct Caribbean yes spooky hot yes she's ruin your life she was next door she was yes she wouldn't get anything done if you were banging her very interesting because you would have to like keep an eye on her all the time where you going stay put I mean but at the same time if you learn to be completely confident next to someone like that you know I mean come on that's like max good fucking luck yeah I know you couldn't hold it all the time you'd have to not want to fuck her you don't like be married and happy and successful and not want to fuck her and just like really just be grateful being around her you think just because you what I have fuck someone that's that hot he's always a problem for men especially back then yeah it yeah I mean I think the initial making a move and all that stuff I think like obviously if you got used to someone in a personality like that it bad start to calibrate you know it's a better person just better perceive you around us she could she could if she were great it sushi if she could have she had a great attitude she was a positive person you just wanted to like you more or maybe not yeah right right I don't know I mean I've just said like I know what you're saying but I'm like at the same time I take that as a personal challenge me leo okay fine how can I pick on it I started I trust you I trust me everything's gonna be totally cool I really think that that this complaining thing is what's going on so nobody likes to have people mad at them you know and that's why people get mad at people there's why people get mad if you over nothing they'd love to find someone who fucked up and get mad like we were talking about this yesterday the Anthony Bourdain casual response he had at the airport by TMZ that became this huge thing where they said if you had a serve dinner to kim jeong-hoon and donald trump what would you serve he goes hemlock and he walks away which is hilarious and then I was reading all the responses on TMZ about you know get the Secret Service on him he's threatening POTUS you know like oh that's really where we it's like they if you are really offended by that really offended that you are such a monumental pussy that you deserve you don't deserve to have an opinion on things like if that really bothered you to your core I can't believe he's threatening POTUS like you are such a fucking baby that you shouldn't be allowed to talk about things you're your opinion it can't get in you can't get in you're not allowed there was hundreds of those people that were commenting on the TMZ thing and I realize like this is just a consequence of people being able to communicate openly any sure so yeah because of that yeah you're getting so in the moment in this feeling yes and you're getting so many people whose opinions just you don't care for you don't want to hear so you don't appreciate or respect their intellect and they're spouting out nonsense but if you're a person who has to hear that it hurts if you read something that's saying someone's saying really mean shit about Katy Perry in our hair this fucking bitch think she's gonna appropriate black culture and this narrow fuck you ho and she starts reading that the panic that sets in thinking that poor Katy Perry this there's bodyguards and fuckin machine guns looking out the windows and Katy Perry is in her Beverly Hills mansion and all these girls that I'll fucking cut you ho oh no they're gonna cut me oh no she's like a little water balloon walking around her her Beverly Hills mansion with her soft soft worried that's that's tough man this fucking bitch thinks she can take our hair as she stupid shit has she said she said that she's worried about that stuff no I'm just again it's like drama well yeah it's ancient it's so funny I mean like for me I read almost I'm almost all tweets like because there's not that many actually in mentions right so you eat almost all the ones that come to you you've never said that you fucked up son yeah yeah yeah yeah no I tell people I've told the people that before I mean I'm not responding to all of them and I might not get every one but I'm just saying in general it's not that it's not that bad like it's like I can I can actually read through a lot and and it's it's always interesting like if someone brings up a point sometimes they'll they'll attack it a really hostile angle like at first they'll be like you know you're not funny blah blah blah blah whatever but whatever they're whatever and I'll be like and so I'll either do two things I'll either like answer it in an interesting way that kind of addresses their point or or I'll be like okay why do you feel this way and then talk about it and through a few exchanges and oftentimes at the end of it someone's like oh thanks for taking the time you're like oh yeah and no problem I just went I was just wondering what you meant that's all I like I like criticism I don't mind criticism I'm not gonna be like if I had a shitty show and someone was like yeah it wasn't so great I'd be like you know what you're right it wasn't that great and which I love I love like having that dialogue and just being like either open some things I don't answer but you know most things most things if it's if it has a good point yeah I'll go for it yeah I mean the ability to communicate with people has its pros and cons for sure absolutely it's a lot of pros you got to be able to you know you got it you got to moderate yourself and you gotta create some like some some filters and like understand like how to just process something very quickly and just be like is this worth energy or not yeah okay no energy when you're someone like Katy Perry - you're riding on this wave of popularity I mean it's not to say that she's not talented she certainly is a talented singer and performer button a big part of who she is relies on her attractiveness and her cultural relevance like how famous she is right now I mean she's a part she's not like we're not talking about like you know Liz Phair Cat Power someone who's just like only doing their shallow yeah someone's only doing their shit and you either like it he don't like it no she's like she's a rock star yeah she's a pop star through culture yeah what are you doing we show me a hundred million followers 4 million followers on Twitter I'd like you to do it Twitter audit on that because I'm not buying 104 I'll buy 80 85 the the David Bowie image is pretty good oh yeah I know right in cultural appropriation yeah that was she's got mostly British career know mostly fake Wow 58 million fake so she Katy Perry you fucking ho I don't mean that Katy we could sit on a couch together with no shoes on yeah your counts fake after we're after beauties though there are many hugs no I'll make everybody uncomfortable and where will its Fivefinger Vibrams oh please never do that where I'm all never do it 43 real it's some fake toast for the front of it snap on toast what did you say even 43 million real ones is a fucking no no of course if you would have said 44 I would have been like absolutely for 43 fuck that listen yeah I just might not even be her fault it might be that she's so famous she attracts fake BOTS and accounts that's that's just joking around there was a thing recently about Donald Trump's Twitter followers went up by 30 million or some crazy shit yeah it's not my dad real quick yeah people like those are all BOTS absolutely yeah absolutely it's artificial inflation well that's like the king has no clothes but well you know the thing before that what you were saying about pop star like you know on how you look and in your relevance that's not absolutely true and that's the thing I always feel for in a way I feel for people that base their careers on that because there's a way you can always transition for sure ah like you could do it but but when you're someone like Joni Mitchell you know who both was very striking but but obviously involved in the music she made she was responsible for what she was making and you knew that it was her her where as a pop star is like I don't know they're using Stargate from sweet and they're using the writing team they're using a writing team from Australia they're using like whatever you never know who's involved and sometimes maybe she writes her thing because I know that she she was she plays guitar and writes original music well that's the thing about what's the skinny chick back in the back in the day Taylor Swift thing that people enjoy about the skinny chick sorry tail the thing that people really enjoy about Taylor Swift is that she is a songwriter she writes her she composes her own stuff it's a vast majority that was getting angry ex-boyfriends but yeah that's her prerogative and and and that happened to break your heart bitch talking about you yeah or someone just might just because they want that devalue get over the relationships yeah they were just going for that just get trying to get that Kardashian thing going on you try a little Fame off of that song just throw some bad dick or way get her angry enough to put pen to paper mm-hmm mm-hmm hey it's a strat to fuck you up with a song though dude she comes hard don't don't don't let it happen she throws haymakers sad about John Mayer I mean Johnny Mitchell did that right sure a lot of no no Carly Sam Carly Simon yeah you're so vain you probably think this song is about you come on you've walked in to the party like you were walking amazing so I mean the girl that's mad she's not getting that good dick anymore angry he's got other choices angry he's decided to just live his life as a sexual vagabond you can't just accept him for the freakdom just wander through the world it's okay like you had a brief time with him but no people when they fuck they want to own you own each other you know for him and in vain well you know he might have just been and he might have just been a liar oh yeah I've been annoying cuz then because then it's like well it's not really about that a lot you know it's like what was the thing that happened with the Kevin Hart recently when I just got he just got in in he just got in front of it like there was a woman that he ended up getting together with one night in Las Vegas and but it was like kind of a team like kind of catfish a little bit like they got a tape of him or something and this is me just hearing it from other people so this is how informed I am but I will say the point is they tried to extort him he just immediately took this wife and told everybody just like I fucked up and she's like hey man as long as he comes back to me makes it make me I'm totally paraphrasing everything but about what what for her it's like he didn't lie how fascinating is it that there's people that would like target him I was like an opportunity like he's sort of wholesome in a way but also funny you know yeah yeah yeah what's so funny like they're going after NBA players and athletes and NFL players just like that to target them and like looking at their Instagram account know where they're gonna be yeah treat it is like business propagation yeah yeah it's like ransomware but it's the human version hilarious it's a weird time weird time it is a weird time first stuff like that you know it's a weird time for just just the interaction that we all have with each other it's just very strange it's like it's all like the possibilities of where this would go it's used to seem like I kind of saw how the world was gonna go look I remember like being a kid and being worried about the war with Russia remember that right you never like always being was a good kind of fear yeah oh good it was in this day let's just alginate once that sort of dissolve I felt like I kind of had a sense at least in some rough form of what the future was gonna be like things are gonna get better people were gonna get smarter life is gonna advanced and then all of a sudden the internet came along and then any idea is that I had had about what the future was gonna be like we're now like huh fucking who knows and it kept getting more who knows and more who knows and the would the who knows that I'm at right now is just like fuck man where is this going like I really think it's going to some weird virtual reality thing that people are gonna plug into and it's gonna be better than life well yeah I mean it's you know it's we're designing a better interface for it all the time yeah but right now we're limited to like little glowing rectangles we are but the kids that are super into video games they're essentially experiencing it right now just in a a weird you know they're like right in front of the screen oh yeah playing games that's what I'm doing do you do that all the time yeah I had an issue for a few years with quake Oh mine there you go it's really fun multiplayer but I shy away from computer games now because of that too immersive to me yeah man I'm not good at I'm not good at not doing things I enjoy constantly well my thing is I it's like for me there it's kind of like short stories so I like binge watching like I'll choose the easiest setting and I'll just your plain game though where you're not interacting with other people online yeah I'm playing by myself okay or co-op that my thing is like I think games this is something you talking about like where is it going you know I think what will help and what I think people really dig is I think people can get tired of these first-person shooters like it's always like shooter shoot shoot shoot shoot explode explode suit I don't mind necessarily doing that I like it when it's more cartoony that's why I'm a fan of Borderlands it's kind of like this cool like cel-shaded I'm kind of caught looks like you're playing so comic book puzzle solving and stuff no it's a first-person shooter with lots of guns lots of explosions but everything is like cartoony and Mad Max II so it's but not like crazy cartoony like just like comic-book cards right right so so there's like this cool joyfulness to it got a video of that you have to see what that looks like some Borderlands 2 I've seen picture ads I think yeah it's a mall when you walk by the videogames yeah you'd see it kinda looks like a Mad Max thing like there's always like some guy with a gun he's got his fingers to his head like he's blowing his brains out and then there's like some graphic like there you go oh yeah The Dude's wearing a gas mask see if you find a video yeah it's it's a really fun game and you can play this sucker I mean I don't I I'm playing divinity too right now all right I like it well not that look this is dope is this what it looks like when you're playing it right now yes someone playing it right now this is live to top 10 that popping yeah yeah oh so we're watching someone live on Twitch play okay what are you doing why is it so compelling and it is compelling but why is it so compelling watching people play games I think it's because it's it's like a movie mm-hm but it's it's it simulates like real time action right and from you know the first person point of view and so it's kind of exciting it's like did you ever see hardcore Henry no I did not that movie is shot all first-person yeah I heard is awesome it's amazing it's some of the best fight stunt work I've ever seen the choreography is insane and that's compelling I feel like my seven-year-old now I take my seven-year-old to a restaurant in the TV's on they stare at the TV you know little kids like stare TV yeah I feel like that like you're talking about hardcore Henry oh yeah probably probably pretty cool but I mean well I'm just terrified yeah well this is also a weird level this is like some weird like extra thing this isn't the game because the game looks even more like desert II cartoony this is like some like bonus whatever it is it's fucking awesome oh yeah I was like use that one like the sanctuary these are all people playing on Twitch Jesus wasn't it I was hoping you're gonna go to talk about this game this is a new game that's gotten really popular player in those sounds popular using twitch really so yeah it's a battle royale game so we're like The Hunger Games if you've seen that it's not apes for combat supply so like what can you survive on what what can you use you can use a gunner yes so you drop a hundred players drop into a map yeah it's an island there's about five square miles my shoulder and crutches there's a tribe yet and so circle comes in and starts killing you as you come in yeah the five kills oh and the solicitor it's moving all of the guns and anything you find in the map is a randomly placed around the map so you're starting everyone starts to scratch with just a fist and your goal is to survive or play hide until either you become the badass that kills everyone or you act or you just hide you just survive to the end but meanwhile people are watching this on Twitch also but it's compelling popular thing to watch on there it's amazing it makes sense though because like you're seeing all these P it's like watching a gladiator match yeah but hold on if they're watching on twitch can someone have a chat in the other screen where the person who's playing can read the chance I mean where people are I've been doing that recently and like they can talk to me while I'm playing they get tip sometimes I'll miss something like I'll skip a scope and like hey you missed the scope or you missed that awesome gun go back and get it right but my question is is it possible for them to also be monitoring the other people on the game and tell you where those people are it's not that's called stream sniping and that's cheating thing that's sort of being handled right now how's it being handled you can delay your stream a little bit you can hide different things that give away your location on the mattress thing like it's a setting that you can have can you that's a problem with people being able to chat with each other a little bit so like Mighty Mouse is actually doing this too and he did a custom game with all of his fans and a hundred people of like that were just watching him I jumped in too we're all playing and amazed too and you'll just people end up going to attack them because they want to be the guy that killed Mighty Mouse in the game or whatever it is but like he's the one to kill that's amazing he's gonna yeah but the thing that I like I like co-op games so I like fighting AI with other humans like you know like like people either like that are they're coming because what I discovered it when I was playing was it called the game with the mechs the mechs yeah Noons mechs mechs are robot suits exoskeleton okay but more like walking tanks yeah that's crazy it's like a hugely popular game but I was playing it and it's one of those like massive multiplayer games and like every time it starts there's all these people running around and you don't know anything you might might but I didn't and I would just get killed within milliseconds did you ever play that was one do you ever play unreal no no Unreal Tournament yeah well unreal and Unreal Tournament does that was another one that kind of like Oh got you came like quickly quick like and they had all these crazy cool weapons yeah mazing the Rafic that's what these all are they're all they're all that it's like massive weapon systems you're switching weapons constantly you can craft weapon so you can get you can collect ingredients to craft weapons like divinity to is an interesting Oh titanfall titanfall oh yeah it's a huge game right yeah it's in there it's it's gorgeous I love mech suits like who doesn't like being like who are you talking about being the Hulk yeah this is what you get to be like this massive machine it's it's it's really cool but if it's just like so bad at it it's just constantly getting killed he's fucking tickets today and it wasn't games that was like this is cool you know it's it's cool to imagine you know yourself in these like situations it's cool but I also like playing cooperatively so if I was doing this playing with other players and I had a team I guess that would be something I would try being on a team against other human beings just so fucking much time you have to take out of your life to play these well here's here's the thing that you might get into warehouse scale are RPG VR VR RPGs oh I've heard of that yeah I further there they're trying to set up wasn't it wasn't there a place that was doing a virtual reality in Utah wasn't it like in Utah oh you think it's Salt Lake City the boy yeah yeah yeah they're setting up a whole like environment yeah they have one set up yeah yeah it's great they did the Ghostbusters thing at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in New York for the ghostbusters yeah this yeah the future of virtual yeah yeah it's magazine it's crazy like you wear a backpack it's a backpack computer so you're wireless and then they have custom goggles that they fit on you look at this shit and and all of this is mapped in an environment so you're holding the guns you look down you see the gun the gun moves when you move it so these people are walking through yes environment this is insane so that's so so it's mapped so this is what you're seeing in the right yeah and so if certain things you know it depends on how one-to-one I I hope that in the future with real-time data capture or with cloud capture you'll be able to pick up objects like it'll actually be able to track up teddy bear and you reach out and the teddy bears there it's lined up well so you can naturally grab it you squeeze it and in real time the the the system is reading it so it's actually puppeting all the objects in the room so yeah and then the floor rumbles there's steam that comes out you know kind like a ride but you are the visual component you're hijacked so right now it's just ghostbusters is that what it is Ghostbusters and the void the void is I think it's public I think you can go there yeah so the void but there's a place that's opening up hopefully in in Los Angeles which is totally right for because there's a huge VR community here that Lana Monica yeah really yeah yeah there's like at least like five major players in like Santa Monica area you meet major players what do you mean by major players like people at humans yeah like time players like Weaver you know if they have stars they have they have titles that they're working on and they have they have experiences you know what some people call simulations experiences interactive experiences or just like puzzles or whatever like these people innovating for VR so their company their production companies that make WoW videos they think encode they or they code they create software or they're just really good at capturing there's like you know a tie which does like spherical capture or our volumetric capture it's called yeah so there's a lot a lot of people here so the technology is here and it's always being innovated but at warehouse scale is the perfect marriage for people especially in LA who like to be active and might feel weird about sitting down in a chair and just staring at a screen control in their hand but they can understand naturalistic movement right right and you can in a warehouse scale you can actually see the size of the room and feel the breath of the space so in that particular video it seemed like they had chairs and tables and everything like that but the actual textures on those chair that was all added later yes all that the ground objects were real yes but they look so different some of the objects yeah yeah like the major obstacle the chair was crazy because they have a chair in the videogame that was it seemed to me to be very different like the British totally that's art minutes now it's not one-to-one it's just like it's just a basic representation well it's saying in the future you'll actually be able to just have like a movie set yeah and the system will be able to it will already have a pre-loaded priests can't you know sized version of that room but then there'll be sensors that are real-time calibrating it not sure that it's like rock-solid so when you reach out you're like oh I don't feel like I had to move my hand a little higher to grab this right you can just reach out it's right there that's a one-for-one representation do you think that the chair is bearing up to the ground Wow look at these people are walking through there yeah where is this that they're doing that this was called VR Studio B arcade this might have been in yeah vrj iteration and yeah this is fucking insane and this is the future man it's gonna be really really weird and I mean it's gonna be so weird I mean imagine like if the mapping becomes so like rock-solid that you could reliably run up a flight of stairs oh my god I mean that sounds like it sounds like it's like it's not it's not and then once it comes becomes Wireless I mean remember when the only way to get internet yeah the only way to get to the internet was to have an Ethernet cable connected to your device right yeah that's silly I don't have an Ethernet cable anywhere no I know where to get one the only problem with VR is that the processing power so for a while it had to be tethered to a PC right now they have PC backpacks well now I - you what they're gonna have is like one of those you know you get one those five charge battery packs for a phone well yeah recharge yeah yeah totally see I'm one of those bitches it's gonna hook up to your phone yeah and everything's gonna take place all the processing is gonna be on your solidly you're gonna have a blue - 'the headset and you're gonna be able to go out into a park and do this yeah it'll be like bluetooth 515 point oh yeah friends you just have to walk across the park like you remember when you first got an iphone and you had to do the fingerprint a bunch of times yeah I can also do sorts of different ways the side and you're on the back that's what you have to do okay define your parameters we're in the park and everybody will walk through the park together and crisscross and then once the computer has enough data they go okay processing the game begins in ten yeah and then just transforms let's see that's the thing it's like you know you know you have augmented reality and virtual reality augmented reality was interesting what microsoft's hololens uses this real-time like basically can see the environment around it wrapping it so it stereoscopically maps it and it creates a really quick texture map of the environment that you're in so imagine that mixed with like the idea behind I forget the name of the the project but it was a my early Microsoft Project where it took it's basically scraped all relevant types of photos and like stitched them together and created virtual 3d environments of locations based on photographs that are everywhere on the internet so it could recreate a plaza in Italy and then using like kind of interpolation like the AI software kind of stitching it together blah blah blah so imagine that existing already just because people are passing by with their phones they're taking pictures they're taking video so all of that data is now present according to the location that you're at mixed with headsets that are able to scan in real time collectively that also gets processed and stitched together cross-reference together so that instantaneously you can have a mapped almost one for one game zone in a giant park like pretty quick and just like how you described it but like using things that are in the headset that are tracking in real time and then transmitting or that are completely internal to the headset and then also networked to intelligence to simultaneously and then also probably some fake stuff that they can create visually and with 3d sounds totally yes see like you know if you're doing an avatar game you can see the dragons flying overhead like yeah oh that's the hololens does that it's got these two little slits they're not even like regular speakers there's slits that are above your ears that are pointed down it's like almost like a hypersonic sound you know like sound that can be basically paper-thin so it might move the access you can't hear it and then if I move it back on axis and you haven't moved your head you'll hear it specifically in one tiny thin slice of audio well and so it has to be very precise so it's a form of that but they're just pointing down and they can simulate Dolby 5.1 by normally just saying think about house Oh crazy like your ear plugs are right yeah look at this little tiny a speaker yep there's a little tiny a speaker when it's in your ear I mean you can get too loud if I listen Lily if I listen to music sometimes it can get too loud with these then I said I gotta get you better headphones these are great they're they're good what's wrong with them come with ya they're they're okay they just they have a lot of high-end and yes is not good for your hearing oh not good for you here yeah I like things that are soft on my ears but I can hear clearly it's about what's prestigious this is fuck just fucks your ears up I would say like sure sure I really it depends on what you're using for I am sure I think the ear pods mm-hmm actually sound really fucking great yes I like the ear pods they're better I like them better than the headphones that come standard any time headphones are included they're like they're okay but they're not like great I mean on an Apple standard better than most but the ear pods are more precise the ear pods just sound natural they'd sound like I'm really surprised I'm prepared for them not to sound good almost every time I use them but they sound great because they're not they don't seal the ear this sit in the ear but the design is so ingenious that even when I'm working out I'm like I'm like on the bench getting up jumping around they're still not falling out and they sound great the bass sounds all natural then I'll put it in like a high-end pair I have like a crazy amount of headphones and I'll put in some like crazy headphones like some Oddie's whatever plan or magnetic bullsh it's like little tiny ones that don't require much power a phone would power it fine but I put those in and I'm like oh wow that sounds really small like I have to adjust to its detail whereas they I pod is like as soon as I put him in like let's just sounds like a nice perfect frequency Kurt feels very flat in real Wow that's a strong at door spent pretty good yeah I'm really I'm really I was like very impressed with them I bought them and I never opened the box really yeah they're easy to pair man and it's cool because I just have me my jeans all the time right a little easier to handle then this wire yeah that wire gets fucked up yeah you just like I just pull it out and it's so fun because the way it snaps closed and magnetically is so satisfying how long is the battery life lasts no suckers I think it's eight hours really I think with the case the charge case recharges right there yeah where does their pair at the Apple watch to see I have the new Apple watch did you get the three LTE users three brah what's the deal with the three what's what's better LTE now you can leave your phone at home yeah just take your watch yeah am i comfortable enough with your life to do that yeah I mean if I go into a concert or something like that like you know right I mean I'm in the you know I think what's great about this and I saw people talking about like what do you think about the Apple watch when they first announced it there were so many people that were like it's so stupid you already have a phone why do you need a you know why does your watch need to be a phone and they're saying all these things related to that and I'm like guys you don't get it it's about having to not manage a physical object it's the watch is on your wrist it just lays on your wrist the whole whole day I mean unless you take it off or whatever but most the time you just leave it on the whole day and it's always there you don't have to manage it like if you want to make a call you make a call if you want to take call you know you have your ear pods you like can do a full car call you can listen your music on it how much power battery wise does that thing have what so I think on LTE what is it like six five hours that's ridiculous something like that what do you live in a half a day so yeah it's it's a rat get it so that thing works better yeah that's like all LT but but realistically you're not going to be on LTE all the time so depending on your usage it'll I think it'll last I mean is that five hours of talking I think of yeah LT like talking or something like that but I think for me I'm like around 67 74% everyday really at the end of every day so I can go a couple days without charging it actually who moved I know I like it I like it your rebel I like pushing it man no wireless pads are gonna be everywhere soon enough yeah yeah I'm not - or the watch rather I just got the eight plus and just said are you gonna get the 10 as well you ya missed yeah a crazy person I have like I have like almost every top-of-the-line phone because I want to know Android because I have an I have a t-mobile account an AT&T account so you want to learn Android so you're yeah fuckin around with it so I'm always like updating I just want to know how the up like what's the UI philosophy like what do they think is interesting and because they're two they're two divergent but they're very similar I like to check out like oh it's the difference um that's really frustrating that iPhone doesn't do that that's frustrating that this doesn't do that you know if it wasn't for airdrop yeah air drops kind of keeping me on board yeah like I realize how much I like that once I tried the Google pixel which I really liked yeah that's a great fun great phone and the pixel - supposed to be even better but yeah Samsung Galaxy Note 8 might be the best phone in the world they say ya have the 8 at the 8 plus it's very beautiful note + no no I'm not gonna know yeah Galaxy 8 + yeah but the note is you know similar same thing right but it's got the obviously the stuff and yeah and there's a couple there features I think the camera is the same but it's it's just got a couple extra features so I just stick with the smaller what do you think about it plus the A+ yeah I love it the screen is gorgeous amazing right it is so it's the colors are just insane it's really beautiful once you have no bevel yeah you look at it yeah is it bezel bezel wide it's a bevel this is soft enough of a V I was like he said bezel but it gets a good job man but that it's so much more beautiful than seeing that edge that edge is like the obvious edge of the bottom of the iPhone where your fingerprint scanner goes and the OP the iPhone speaker is the chin looks clunky yeah it's it's totally clunky and it's you know it's it's where it's the next step before augmented reality glasses you said that your phones are your phone are your glasses when I look at the note eight red band as the no date it looks like Minority Report I'm looking at this I'm like wow yeah there's a hole that's all yeah screen yeah you're holding the screen that's all screen yes this is like the future it is pretty rad yeah it legitimately feels to me like a big step up from like a regular phone I look at that I'm like okay that's this is obviously next level yeah I got the essential phone to just to see what that display was like to kind of get a preview for the iPhone 10 iPhone town is gonna be insane it's that's gonna blow it all that looks for it looks it's it's great I mean I will say that their product design has been like there was like a period where I'm like yeah like what just kind of like their last few iterations of computer I mean I always get the new I get the new everything from Apple pretty much and then just see their cell or like fine like someone who needs a computer or whatever is given to that but so I cycle through a lot of Technology and just for a while there you know the the laptops were they were cool they're like some nice improvements I mean I like the you know the MacBook Pro design is like pretty cool I like the strip I thought was gonna be a gimmick the strip this becomes an issue with me because I have fat fingers and sometimes I hit series yeah I just hop so I disable this is for further for a laptop no but I did to matter when I only hit the button it really says series that's me that's but it's it's also admits it's right there yes right there where the fucking Delete key is yeah finger slips and goes up there yes he falls in there boom would you like to enable Siri no you better cancel no just just learn you know that I mean just learn I don't want my technology to learn better it's not learning very well this the thing about being with switch windows on the bar is kind of interesting but quite everybody I never used it either never use it I would prefer mechanical buttons for sound - I agree with that I'd it's way faster yes way faster this reason you have to press it once yeah then you have to press it again yes adjust the sound why don't I was just a prostitue - like normal I there's probably a keyboard come because I think it's out command Apple or plus the only other complaint that I would have is I really like a tactile mechanical feeling keyboard when I write a particular bigger key bigger key throw travel I like this one because it's it's I like this new MacBook Pro better than the last MacBook Pro because the last one was kind of mushy a little bit yeah and this one is more like it it seems like real positive feedback when it clicks in what I really like is the Lenovo ThinkPad they have yeah amazing keyboard that works it like you feel where the keys are it's like yeah I type faster with it it just feels like more certainty yeah my fingers just can communicate with it better yeah these are like flat they're like the flat rectangles there's not very high off the ground you know so because the fact they're not very high off of the rest of the keyboard you're not sure what you're touching so yeah especially if you have calluses I guess and if you had fingers yeah I guess I have to just understand the spacing of it but it's almost like they're preparing you for typing on a glass screen the same way you type on your iPhone right and and see I'm not a big fan of that I think we should be able to speak to our computers yeah I mean and they go oh you're just gonna keep or do touch to it okay I don't want that I wanted this this is the whole thing for a laptop in the first place tell me a screen and a keyboard yeah fuck you do I though do you do you have an echo or any of those things yeah I got a neck off never set it up don't use it so able to me as a gift I get it but it's just sitting there and I go I totally get that but I will say I use it for my lights in my house this is really nice so that's I'm going to pet I'll just feel like computer turning lights off can you can you know change the way you talk to it can you say shut the lights off bitch no I wish see it needs to do that ya need to be able to do that but it's gonna get there don't worry it comes in these lights and then you can set it up no but I'm just saying like you can speak to it super fast so I can say like I'm in the living room and I want the lights off and I'll just say computer computer turn the living room lights off and just walk away and it gets it it's like immediately on it's like it hears that that prompt it's on I'm saying the sentence naturalistically I'm not saying hey Siri how many times have I gone to the bathroom today did it you've gone I'm sorry I don't know the answer that whatever that long it's that long why would I use by the I there's just no there's no reason for me to use something that takes that fucking long to process it's faster to do voice dictation in in a Google app right that you're gonna get so it's but that's a combo it's like your eyes the voice better in google apps it is better it's their algorithms are better like the artificial intelligence is also note keeping and stuff as well yeah I mean there's you can do a little bit more with Google assistant than you can with Syria also I like the name I don't I hate it when they named a eyes thing like Cortana for Microsoft I'm like I don't fucking I don't want to court time why I mean I get it I like Cortana she's great I love Halo however I don't need a personality I want it to be a computer and I want to just do what I'd like it to to do I don't need to hear like okay you know the sunlight today is really beautiful but I'd watch that where some sunscreen less I wanted that I want that option but I also want it to be neutral right so over time I wanted AI to learn what I dig and just kind of do that yeah there should be an option for whether or not you want it to behave like a corny human yes I know some people I mean I get it you want something like that you want like a little friend or something I get it I I do that I do I'd have like a couple different versions of it you know if even if I'm in work mode I changed it to like computer voice if I'm just like chilling having a good time with friends I changed it to hey party person voice hey alright that sounds like a great idea hey play some Miles Davis you know what I was just thinking of that it sounds like a great choice yeah it's really that's great man what else you got yeah if you get like John Lee hookers voice yeah great talk to John Lee Hooker everywhere you go yeah you get like you get linguists and language experts and mimics to like all sit down and create a program so they can it can actually do impersonations off of like inputting an audio so it could actually become that person look at Jane we just pulled up ylai bird Lyrebird Lyrebird allows you to create a digital voice that sounds like you photoshop for voice thing yes yes essentially that it's already available for you can make your own just got to read I love it it's very good is it it's good what if you like fuck with it though that's what I want a support if you have 40 minutes of your audio they basically have you okay oh my god no way considering in addition to other options stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea that's that's fake you know you know you know you know that it's him you can tell it's synthesized but you know it's him it sounds amazing now that's pretty great it's also very meeting general cally general mattis and other military leaders at the White House North Korea that the middle section was nice the front and the back were not very good well I wonder if they're adding that reverberation that weird if it thinks that's part of the audio I like the quality Leon one of them do they're doing that on purpose because you're talking about the president like can you do an audio verse the president pretend like that like you might get in like real trouble because that audio could be used like if he never actually said that about not doing business with North Korea if they didn't make an obviously fake version it's pretty it's pretty you find another leg it's pretty terrible know where they restroom real quick oh yeah play me some Brock Obama I think they're taking my tweets and putting that through it oh okay let's hear it thank you to all the first responders and people helping each other this sounds terrible we do as Americans but why is it sound so terrible problem two on this your the way they have it set up like if you and me did it today they have specific sentences that we would need to read to hit the syllables and I think they're taking speeches and they probably tried to find the words as opposed to going directly into their computer program mmm the only issue though is it doesn't sound good those don't because they didn't actually have Obama reading specifically for them into there they just took speeches probably and found the words that matter right but even if they took speeches it sounds so much shitty than the actual speech itself I was writing something like my friend who showed it to me said he did it himself and got really surprised that he just typed a sentence in and was like holy shit that sounds like me they're gonna be able to have people saying all kinds of crazy things this is a this is not the Adobe Photoshop one this is I think a small company so they're probably gonna make people have feuds with people but you know saying little you hear what he said about you man she listened to this pretty fucked up and they're like what will fuck him and then that guy says fuck him and says some crazy shit about him and the next thing you know dude the reality TV show editing trick where it's just set off camera and you show somebody's reaction to what they heard right and send that to your friend and be like look they're fucking pissed at you easily that could be an app on your phone just like that app where you put a puppy dog nose on I mean how is it any different as soon as someone like gives the green light to put that on the Apple Store the Google Play Store someone's gonna figure out a way to to use that to make weird copies of people though there's ethics get the fuck out of here with your ethics shut up once you pee in the pool you're not extracting that stuff out and stop yeah first to raise public awareness to make people realize the technology exists by releasing audio samples from the digital voices of Donald Trump and Barack Obama second we want to ensure that your digital voice is yours we are the stewards of your voice but you control its usage no one can use it without your explicit consent shut your hole shut your hole that's like saying I can hold my breath forever shut up no you can't you can't control that they have some wonky ass website where they're trying to pretend like they can control the digital voice that gets printed using their app like the fuck you can this this once you've made some technology like this there's all your silly words that you're writing down that doesn't mean anything you're gonna violate all the laws the known laws of technological progression with your disclaimer and release that's not yeah it's not really possible because they can they can tell if your analysis that means I mean that's that sound that you're in that synthesis that's like that's the ughter the best it can do right now for now for sure it's gonna get better and for sure they're not gonna be able to control it like what has gotten to that stage it's that crazy I just think it's it's a matter of time before we have no idea what the fuck is real but it's not at that point why not just hire an Obama impersonator not it's good because Obama impersonator even the best Obama in person here is just a facsimile you know there's a a so you're saying that the but the computer has to I mean unless it's just audio being played back it's still like simulating it oh you mean like a physical well video that'll be easy definitely video they've already done it with video what do you want Jamie streaming over the very bottom of the site they had this little like disclaimer agreement regarding biometric site yeah and right here so how we disclose biometric data we may also disclose biometric data in the following circumstances law enforcement she's looking a warrant and setter etcetera etcetera Wow Wow so you basically it's this is all CIA psyops man the fucking same people keeping the man at your neck keeping the man they play with a fucking app man first they got their fingerprints man yeah your fingerprints off your phone and face data this data they're collecting DNA from your screens when you turn your phone oh we're fucked all that data is gonna get scooped up by the Russians the Russians gonna have all these people talking shit that's um they're gonna have they're gonna have heads of industry talking shit about Donald Trump threatening to kill him Donald Trump's gonna get crazy paranoid because he doesn't read yeah and next thing you know this fucking nuclear war going on in the United States homeland I don't drop his bomb and Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg hear this stuff fucking hire Mossad to protect him at his mansion cuz he feels that Donald Trump's trying to assassinate him because he wants to be President oh my god that I vote for Zuckerberg no no man dude made Facebook you wins I didn't watch that movie I think I think he stole it a little but not so much as like someone who might like being a band like makeup and they make a song and it was kind of based on some riffs you know that someone was good it's like well it's hard did he steal it a little like Chris Rock's ex-wife steals money from him how'd she do that by just going to court and stealing it oh my god as publicly well you know what they do divorced it oh you motherfucker oh I don't know I heard the paler Chris is act yeah I mean Eddie okay yeah Eddie Murphy would definitely talk about that a lot oh yeah well Eddie Murphy just talked about it with Johnny Carson remember because Johnny Carson and give up like hundreds of millions dollars to some chick who's briefly having sex with whoa whoa yeah me I mean not briefly but you know yeah this entire life if you pray to her not that not equal exam tell fucking single joke wasn't an even deal but that's stealing right so that's doing some stealing - so did he steal in that way Johnny Carson's wife stole I mean me no I don't know I I think I think that he just said he had an idea of what to do with it so and that's but I don't think that he's necessarily I mean I can be proven wrong anymore but don't think he's necessarily an innovator in any way at the key we find an idea that was pretty obvious right myspace had already existed right yeah people register yeah who the fuck used Friendster I did Jamie was one of the top awesome I love French a French tour t-shirt he were everywhere go to Friendster now it's so sad it's sad it's yeah it's still there but somebody still there myspace still exists as well I'm thinking of going back to Mars right man I don't know it's gotta be something else I think I could bring it back I think you could I mean but why would 20 friends delivery I'm kidding friends still living the game Friendster is taking a break the redesigned Friendster came about through enduring passion to make a difference over the what make a difference make a difference in your bank account ho-yeah over the years we have built a vibrant community and received valuable support and encouragement however due to the evolving landscape in our challenging industry the online gaming online online gaming community did not engage as much as we had hoped for the profound development in gaming in the gaming industry has also led us to rethink our street hyk priorities we have nuts made the decision to take a break and pause our services effective June 14 2015 I just wanna break kids you quit yeah two years ago that's a it's a quit so that's a hard quit two years in you gotta say like if you know if you and your girlfriend are taking a break it's been two years you're not taking a break anymore no right yes yes it something looks pretty safe so over friends there and then for the internet I mean multiply that times 10 maybe someone's gonna come out with a new one a virtual resources augmented reality based well alt space almost happen like what I was working with them a lot they were doing stand-up comedy and like it's basically like a Facebook of VR so social VR and that was really fun and they really helped out amazingly were they were like the coolest they're really cool justin roiland I hung out when they never were like together in a graveyard with like 500 of their fans and we just like fucked around for an hour and 40 minutes he was at his house with a small team of people making sure he was all good and he had a he had a motion capture suit our motion sensor suit and yeah this that's me doing stand-up so I'm moving that character that's crazy yeah in my living room just like hey guys I mean that that easily could take the place of touring yes they had some toys where you can interface and you could be onstage in front and even if you how about this the people go to a place the people actually go to a theater and you just get live beamed into the theater yeah I don't have to be they did that with some concerts right like a live broadcast like simulcast in theaters yeah like Rolling Stones there's something that there's a first different than a hologram no no that's different than like yeah immersive like VR the rapper chief keef an event they were saying like he couldn't go cuz it's gonna be riots and whatnot so that what they agreed to do was have him be a hologram oh yeah they did that curved screen projection technology oh right no problem with it because people don't like him no just he's he was silly very when he performs yeah he's uh he's a crazy fella right he's a wild one that chief keef I've seen him on the Instagram yeah he's a young crazy rapper got to yeah he's one of the wild where Joe Welch oh yeah very aggressively crazy ones so they had him as a hologram on stage show let me hear this whoa this is so strange yeah they've been doing in Japan for a while they have like pop stars artificial intelligence it seriously has to stand in one place yeah I think the hologram thing kind of sort like will.i.am situation remember you couldn't or you can I walk around the room yeah I could talk to someone Wow yeah so weird the Japanese technology you can't they can walk but it's like an obvious curved huge screen you imagine if you went somewhere to watch a hologram you'd be so angry at the person isn't there yeah yeah can you be there I know you know you have to must be weird to go somewhere publicly and to watch a hologram I feel like it's the future unless it's someone who doesn't live anymore right like Tupac like when they did they'd made Tupac way more jacked and it really is you noticed that no yeah then they did the Tupac one they've had him like a CrossFit Tupac took Tupac was in insane shaken CrossFit he really looked like Floyd Mayweather that's pretty wire oh no yeah come on dude no the he's super jacked Tupac that's a Tupac that's doing jujitsu five times a week right that Tupac's got a six pack he's got big muscles really is that video footage yeah yeah this is from Coachella oh but they made it holographic look so I know but I mean the the footage they were did they generate it oh they generates this is all performance yeah this is all CGI body double was it a body double well that's part of the problem they used some body double who's jacked you should have told that dude's gotta lay off the weights for a couple years if you want to play Tupac yeah because I don't think they would have been able to track his regret performance from the 90 well this guy who they used the body that well they got overzealous because he's way too big I mean he's like 20 pounds heavier right I'm not I think he was just white race he was wired this guy sorry this guy's Jack yeah he's a fighter yeah he's built like tyron woodley almost he's they have a side-by-side he's kept yeah it's Captain Jack yeah he's Ken's act he's built like George st. Pierre like that's a good that's a good comparison not quite tyron woodley levels but pretty fucking jacked you got a side-by-side they don't have one Oh CGI generated then special effects studio made it yes expensive CGI yeah see that's what I was saying so maybe they used a body double to track the movements and then they got overzealous when they went to give him six packs and and and packs and just like they made only star a Star Wars figurines or like all jacked they're all are they super muscular yeah I was like what the fuck he Walker's jacked yeah really it was like it's like late 90s Star Wars or something like that yeah it's like superhero bullshit the people wanted superhero bullshit back then like if you tried to put out a figurine if someone who wasn't jacked people used to superhero Adrian I know I was like so it's just so dumb that's like I won something looks like the thing I don't want to fucking cheat because otherwise it looks cheap it looks lazy it's as lazy there's what yeah but that's not this shirt to show the thug life tattoo yeah you gotta get the whole yeah the guy that guy's way more jacked trust me oh there you go that's picture my bill yeah see I mean come on just give yes is smaller ways it's wire he looks like a lightweight boxer yeah yeah that's what he leans in shape yeah he's definitely in shape he's not fabulous guy I mean come on that guy's super duper jacked yeah I don't know where they got those four Porsches you're gonna be that jacked like you really have to not eat anything that's bullshit oh I know like you can't be fuck at all not even slightly no it's just like all like straight proteins you're super clean like just broccoli chicken breast egg whites no beers no no not one beer at all no no like water no salt no salt no salt and in fact one day you'll probably fast or you'll like overwater like by gallons and gallium then not drink for two days probably take diuretics before you do this yesterday they made one of you wouldn't would you let them add a little bit of extra water waiter no fuckin slow me down no leave me the way I'm very did I mean that really fight in real life when we got to watch that you'd be way the fuck I am man don't make me look more muscular than I really am it's more immersive yeah in the EA video game that's my actual body they took fucking hundreds of pictures they have you stand they rotate around you with a camera they have this thing that spins around you and takes photos of you oh yeah oh there's different precise angles you have to do all these different things with your body you have to do things with your arms you stand with your hands up yes and your fists the other doing a doing a combination volumetric capture and optical capture that's what I actually and so they skin you there you go this skin they put they basically scan the OP the optical information mix stitched with a little bit of CG yeah that's great you see that look that looks like a person though this is a real person that's that's what a person looks like I mean your face does look a little uncanny valley yeah but just like video game character they're about five years away from that not existing anymore right five years away from just freaking the fuck out reality like avatar did a great job yeah that CG was like I mean half of it was the actors face right but the rest of it I mean it looked very natural what's really cool is that very movie like avatars that they can have something that's not a real thing like what's really challenging oh yeah right do a CGI of a real fish Oracle absolutely or yeah Game of Thrones dude it doesn't with wolves yeah and every be really careful how they shoot it like I am Legend with Will Smith they did it with lions and it was kind of clunking oh yeah yeah yeah zombies and I am Legend they work perfect cuz they're this thing a real thing yeah it's just like a yeah it's a fantasy creature yeah you'd have a point of reference what is this James from Logan that they digitally did his face and like almost all these action scenes because I don't whether he didn't do it or not but huh little piece just came out I don't know if it just came out this week I just saw it the other day it's a really cool little three-minute piece about the digital doubles what it's called a Logan somebody wants to watch that was that the stunt guy this is the stunt guy and then they kind of showed the breakout that was the actual clip and they'll show you the breakdown now how they like added Wow each little piece to it to make what you saw from you know the little camera angles and then this is incredible it's really cool that's whoa so the dude just got a oh and then this thing later here in a second I'll show you how all the cameras that they used to get his actual face so this was CGI yeah what that scene that whole scene that isn't that question that's incredible that's incredible look at that well you know what's fucked up even though it's CGI they still made it as obvious as a real fight scene with actors and a stuntman yeah well doesn't the movement is real but it looks very obvious that it's fake is what I'm saying oh now it does yeah to me but in the movie I didn't know yeah you know what I mean I mean it looks very obvious that it's a fake fight I mean no it looks great yeah yeah because you can't actually punch the guy you can't actually have the guy shoot him first you know and he absorbs the bullet and keeps going and and cuts the guy's head off with his with his claws but they could have done something along those lines these choreographed it like they would choreograph like a fight scene in a Six Million Dollar Man episode you know saying like I'm gonna punch you all you stabbed me first I'm gonna shoot you oh you cut regs right right right well that's my thing with with like tactical scenes and fight scenes for me it's like it it can be you just have to balance the believability level so so if it's kind of cartoony acts like violence then make sure that the physics flow together really like like Captain America Winter Soldier one of my favorite of the Marvel movies just the fight scenes were incredible they're really really well done and pretty badass pretty bad like when fuckin Winter Soldier gets hit and he like slides backwards you know as always that thing where a guy gets hit and he slides backwards I Haven gets torn up and he's like holding his stance but the physics on it looked really good yeah Wes I was like oh that's great and they were just paying attention all these like little subtle physics details and that's what makes me appreciate the fighting or like seeing Gina Carano fight like fake fight in movies she knows how to take a hit right so so when she gets hit she knows what it looks like when you get hit right but a certain way or certain angle or whatever and not saying that she's like the best best but just as an example somebody actually does make contact or has had experience in that the the reactions are a little bit more believable and also they're probably more willing to let people get close closer I'm sure and also you don't feel like you're being treated like a fool exactly that's what I'm that's what I'm talking about because it's otherwise it's just like let you see the people waiting for the next hit like when you see this fight scenes where people are standing around in a circle and one guy goes in and everyone else is waiting yeah that would not work like that man no like no everybody's just gonna wait well that's the rules it's just one guy at a time okay now the next okay now you try it Tony oh god he's really good okay Walter yeah it has to be some like that's one of the things that I found almost in eerily impressive about John wick mmm John wick is preposterous yeah cs1 saying they balance that shit so when you get it out because you see it as choreography right but it's so fucking tactically and imaginatively thought-out and stylistically gorgeous all that all the ingredients go together and you see in those that footage of him you know running three gun trainings fucking Rock and through those courses for real he's using live rounds and and so when I see that movie I'm like oh shit these guys know what the fuck they're doing they're not fucking around they're like using Special Forces guys for training they're using a specialized team of martial artists to create a customized version of martial arts just for him my friend Hagen Machado did a lot of the jiu-jitsu choreographed choreography for it that's who I was watching yet and I loved their whole fucking take on it and their approach its artistry yes it's like that's what it is there was no like everything that he did would work yeah there was no jump up and cake two dudes in the head of the same time and shoot through a window and shoot a guy a mile away and they had no no no no it's like if you trained really well and that situation presented itself the way that it did you could do that yeah it's possible and but it was also very cartoony - totally yeah that's what that's what was so great about it so it's like it's this perfect because the whole world was heightened you know like the whole hotel thing and assassins having like you know convenience of course so it's already in that world so you just need to create efficiency you know all it is is just like lethal efficiency with a with a kiss of artistry and there's a uniformity and John Wick's personality that's so so samurai that you believe that he could do all this and not be affected by killing all these people yeah I know well it's like all the people he's killing are players yeah they're all players in the game and they deserve it they killed his dog yeah he killed his dog and anybody who gets in the way not that it's their fault but if they decide to take him on mm-hmm then he just tested it's just professional yeah he's a professional even in his revenge he's perfect well except for the part where shoots the dude in the hotel and gets excommunicated but other than that I mean he's I just love that character so much I love the stunt driving and that's not CG that's him that's a 51 year old man fucking destroying it and I'm like you know what if anything even if you like that type of stuff or if you don't like that stuff just watch a scene look at the artistry of the choreography think about how old he is now Hardy train and then try to have someone who's sitting on the couch going I can't lose I can't lose 30 pounds right um and without I mean I'm talking about someone who has no help it's just them alone just going I can't do it's like man anything is possible any anything is possible you just have to fucking do that shit yeah well I think that movie is like it's it's like a masterpiece of that genre yeah like there's there's a lot of loose tile movies or fun and everything like that well I think what John wick movies did is they took that they boiled down the story to like there's no there's no ambiguity as to whether or not there's bad people and good people whether I should kill all these fucking people absolutely should kill them all he's absolutely going to it's awesome yeah and it's okay because it's a game yeah that's that's the whole thing about that's what's so brilliant about it it's like it's a game but it allows stuntmen tactical expert forward moviemaking yeah because it's really that's what it is it's mostly that the starett the story kind of takes you along and it interesting but it's a pretty narrow pathway and that's like the apocalypse now of like shoot them up of tactical thrillers or tactical whatever you call them whatever you would call those yes like the masterpiece of those you know if you get a chance check out this guy have you ever seen strike back no that's a cinematic show to show yeah it's a series no Cinemax was real anymore I know too many networks I know animatic people start bright I remember that yak in the day oh yes softcore I know the porn holy Sh this is crazy they would lie down in the bed and the ladies leg her naked leg would drape around the man's body so you knew what was going on yeah can't believe this I know then the physics would trick you up be like okay the way they're lying his dick doesn't work doesn't look right how is he having sex with her he's having sex with the no way he's reaching or actual the Chinese way too low yeah how does that feel yeah oh that's great yeah like just obviously someone in the studio adding sound later genres about those through a series have moved Emmanuelle remember those Emmanuel goes to Paris a Mary Emmanuelle goes to Italy they were all like Daniel Steele point no because Daniel Steele like it would be more for the ladies oh it was like you're right right I got you you have yet like she was like this exotic traveling lady it would fuck these dudes and hotels in these movies so they were so corny that's right but you would be so exciting but it was softcore yeah when I was like 16 missing we first got cable you know like I my parents were sleepily put there okay good yeah tune in to Showtime or Cinemax unless he's a manual for a manual three holy shit I'm gonna see some titty I can't believe I'm gonna see your ad and like some more shit yeah you're like I'm about to see some real adult stuff real shit this lady as long as you don't see genitals we do not tolerate general yeah let me breath yeah breath sir okay yeah but that's not a general yeah you're right I just walk around in public like Ari Shaffir does oh yeah that's true like like who's Ari Shaffir no no Irish beer stay on this medium good friend of mine thinks he's famous more famous than he is obviously but so is this Emmanuel the kohat Emmanuel she's sure oh she's getting hacky function to be more hot oh Jesus it's really beautiful undeniable like that's what that 80 is beauty yeah look at that guy's I love that beer fuck the pool guy please fuck the pool guy why should have a cobra in the lower left corner because it's probably someone's like channel with every post oh dude I remember that what is that out the window maybe this is Nick in that building that's so crazy maybe I should go to that building this building is tired she's like she's like pretending to be a Geisha cultural appropriation yeah no no no that's no that is that is that is someone performing a ritualistic dance of some sort you're that guy I heard of like try to figure out what was going on there she's mounting him mounted gave me kissing his face that's crazy Oh see it's the other yeah there was a brief moment like nowhere near he chose yeah I know yeah it's just like the idea it's like theater or so so well it was the the beginnings yeah of like figuring out the loophole between pornography yeah and romantic movies with it's essentially there's no plot they could write down like oh we're just gonna get to Paris we'll figure it out when we get there yeah this what I want you do look out the window where's Bob fucking Bob get over here I'm horny yeah you know I mean Bob shows up in a yacht yeah and that's story to make it look like oh is this a TV show yeah cuz it's a TV show Bob gets off the boat I can't believe you're here I didn't know you were coming yes let's go get a drink then go into the next room next thing is though they start making out I missed you so much I missed you too I've made some mistakes I'm so sorry next thing you know I can't do this it's like why not just one night it's just one night yeah all right yeah they smoke cigarettes bad together yeah back then everybody smoked I never really got the cigarette after sex I post fuck thing I just don't like the smoke yeah you don't get it because you know like I don't like to smoke no yeah we smoked no good for you well my parents did do Pattabhi I know it's a tough one man yeah I get it my mom quit cold-turkey though well yeah like 13 years ago good for her she's 80 now Jesus she okay yeah how long she smoked for she smoked like probably since her like late teens see that's what every long-term smoker they hear that story they go of long as I just know when to jump off this ride mm-hmm I'm gonna be okay uh-huh remember those Bugs Bunny movies where a plane was about to crash right before the plane hit the ground Bugs Bunny B just hop off yes and a plane we crashed he'd be like fine yeah I love that that's what it is that's romantic absolutely it's like okay I'm done well that was fun that's it you mean no many people die of cancer like from lung cancer like wait quicker than that oh yeah my dad that's what my dad died from Lahey oh he had heart trouble first and then he had like a bunch of heart surgery is because he was like I had like a high-salt it wasn't overweight he was thin so it's like one of those like thin fat type of watch and so he's had just a genetic issue I don't know what it was it was just like some kind of like build-up because he was a smoker as a heavy smoker he kind of heavy food salty whatever and and I just added up and then it got he got heart problems then emphysema then they sima turn to lung cancer and and then my mom like last year she she discovered she only had like 18 percent functionality or no like 13 percent functionality or heart and I just happened to be in Montana at the time I don't have brothers or sisters and I just happen to be there with a friend of mine and for Christmas and it happened the day after Christmas so she was like I really have a few little today Haussmann they're like yeah you've like got barely any coronary functionality right now and so then they put in two two stents but a third of her heart is not functioning one of the aorta just doesn't work anymore pretty pretty heavy but a lot of it is from just like high fat high set I saw smoking yeah you know the thing is people used to think it was high fat did you read that thing in The New York Times about where all that all came from the reason why people think saturated fat is bad for you yeah well I know that certain amounts of fats and certain fats are awesome for you in summer yeah see it all came from the New York Times I mean it all came from the sugar industry sugar industry bribed all these scientists and they didn't even have to pay a much man apparently it was only like fifty thousand dollars they bribed the scientists to study to report some bogus findings pushing the blame away from sugar and on to saturated fat oh yeah to this day people think saturated fat is bad for you there's something I tweeted earlier today that I was reading about Satchell escarole be able to put even cholesterol cholesterol is the precursor it's like what you need it's a substrate for hormones sure sure no absolutely but just saying like there's so much of it there's so much dietary cholesterol is not even it man dietary cholesterol apparently doesn't even move your blood lipids a lot of its genetic it has to do with whether or not you have high cholesterol has to do with your lifestyle if you're you're sedentary yeah you know sure a lot of sugar and carbs well so this this is something that I posted earlier today fat when fat people rather when people eat saturated fat the risk of stroke drops if they're also avoiding refined carbohydrates their triglycerides also come down so what they're saying is that when people eat saturated fat in conjunction with eating a lot of refined carbohydrates like white flour and sugar it's not good for you at all so the that that saturated fat is bad is the wrong culprit like saturated fat might be bad for you if you had refined carbohydrates because you like you're just fucking your whole system up but if you can remove the refined carbohydrates saturated fat consumers have a lower risk of stroke and their triglycerides come down to you actually get healthier by eating saturated fat without carbohydrates that's a totally makes sense it does make sense but this is all new shit man they just separated it they it looks like they just kind of finally went like it's kind of true it's only true in combination right it's only true in combination but you extract the one that we know to be bad because there's many many studies right now showing that low carbohydrate diets are beneficial for a bunch of different total benefits yeah yeah yeah so when you take out these refined carbohydrates it turns out the saturated fat is good for you haven't we known though for a while I mean carbs like refined carbs or not not good I mean I look at it like it's oh we didn't know how bad they were oh yeah I think we're realizing now more help out there and how important saturated fat and unsaturated fats are and there's a lot of saturated fats even for plant-based folks you get a certain percentage over from avocados I think you can get a little bit of it from coconut oil certain percentage of it from coconut oil I think it's they're saying coconuts bullshit the thing was widely criticized by some Heart Association wrote that and they these all these scientists got together and on it actually published an article about it where we sent essentially that American Heart Association is kind of wack Oh like their research is kind of shitty like oh that's too bad they're behind the times is it but it makes sense yeah you have to be the the cutting edge in nutrition this is what's so confusing it's constantly revolving around the latest science so if you're not using the latest science yeah the cutting edge and you're not using the latest cutting-edge nutrition yesterday talking about some shit they discover the 1970s there's a yeah a bit of possibility that's came along and it's tainted yeah I mean that totally makes sense I mean that's something that I tend to like fairly you know my thing like I just try to eat like what would a diabetic do like that's good that's a good starting place yeah and the other thing is just like simplicity you know like for me chicken breasts lean fish snapper brown rice oatmeal steamed broccoli steamed kale egg whites egg white protein but even egg whites egg whites are not nearly as healthy for use egg yolks well yolks are better for you egg yolks have more protein in them there's uh there's all sorts of vitamins you get an egg you don't get some talk about the powder you know like that more protein but a good percentage of the protein I should say and more cholesterol yeah the cholesterol is really the thing yeah but for me like Jay you know Jay raw egg white protein that stuff is so fucking crack it's great and it mixes really well if they don't think they could put the yolk in there I don't have you ever use plant-based protein like pea proteins really good you put two hemp protein if you have some a good source yeah I've used all of those things I guess egg white is like the most easily one of the most easily absorbed yes so and it's just kind of simple but what I like about is that it's simple and it just comes from an unrefined ish you know refined to get it to a powder right but that's what I would say that there the issue is in the dehydration rehydration process it's so different than with hemp where you're essentially just getting the plant fiber grinding it down to a fine powder and then you eat it yeah so it's super easy to digest it's almost like like squeeze juice except for it's a dried plant versus a dehydrated liquid product like it's a kind of liquidy yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah I guess yeah I guess they are they start that way but if you cook them or I mean I guess you could have them raw well you can if you got you know the source yeah you know this apparently catching Salmonella though from backyard chickens oh yeah that is an issue now there's some far oh yeah yeah right and there's like that huge movement yeah like a urban movement so people who do so they're closer together be careful if you don't you know know what's going on don't don't eat it raw just because you've got it in your backyard does not necessarily mean it's 100% safe to eat I made this ya know I you know my thing is like I just eat some pretty simply do you eat fish yeah yeah what kind of like fatty fish like salmon supposed to be I do like salmon like I like coho salmon a good if you can and then I like hamachi hamachi is just a amazing mackerel I really did Mac was great snapper is really nice for like just like a nice lean piece of fish like I just won the basic you ever go fishing you know I used to in Montana and grew up in Montana I used to live fish no not fly fish just like boat fish the dock fish Montana where were ya I liked lake a lake yeah yeah I forget the forget that oh we went to Rainbow Lake I think Rainbow Lake and then Flathead sometimes we went to Bozeman last summer my family and we went whitewater rafting down the Gallatin it's amazing dude you get soaked though oh yeah if you're in the shade you're gonna freeze your dick off okay so that what a glacial runoff it's like the only one of the few times I noticed between a shadow yeah not shadow yeah if you're in the Sun you like it's perfect I'll dry off I'll be fine yeah but if you're in the cold in the shade water's cold man you're so folks and you just like take one step into the sunlight you're like thank you that's like breathing that gallatin is weird because there's a lot of people that fly fish in that Gallatin River but almost everybody releases the fish that they catch oh yeah yeah I got you yeah it's more like the sportsmen yes take on you just tricking this fish and sticking out hook in its head and then you pulling it to shore and then let it cook and letting it go like how many times if this is like a stream or a lot of people on this river if a lot of people fly fish what are the odds that a fish gets caught and released like several times in its life man that'd be something to happen getting hooked Jesus again or maybe like you know what I don't mind it because I'm still alive I don't know I don't I think it would suck yeah I don't think that they have nerve endings the in their mouth the way I think it's like the a lot of the tissue in their mouths other than their throat is like almost like a fingernail I think it's like yeah I see yet that makes sense yeah I mean cuz that was the thing it's like I you know I love a little bit of a pussy about killing you know and so I have to kind of like get into a mindset you know to do it I mean I could I could do if I need to survive I need to cut of course I'm going to eat I don't have a problem with that what about an ugly fish like a flounder it doesn't have looking I was the kid trying to not step on ants oh that was I was just like very much even though I do eat meat although I will say I'm really stoked about Memphis meets Memphis meets yeah Memphis meets there out of San Francisco they're growing steaks chicken now is that actual steak an actual chicken or is it a vegan alternative from the cells animal zombie itis yeah I mean but but I I do think that it's an interesting thing because like I was vegan for like seven years and now I'm not do you get mad people mad at you because of that you know I've gotten some people like I thought you were I thought you were vegetarian I thought you were vegan are you open-minded man yeah I thought you could but the thing is like I do care and I am pretty particular about the sources of my protein I'm very particular but but I am excited about this idea of because it it poses an interesting question to someone who's yeah choosing to be vegan for ethical reasons or health reasons or both if meat was able to be grown like it's saying that you liked meat before you became one you like I love it I don't like that reasons make sense for health reasons totally yeah I would feel like you know it's probably just as bad for you are worse unless unless you feel unless you feel bad when you eat certain things not like emotionally but if you just like have a reaction to meet some people do have that well it's fine you'll be able to do you know that's a real common thing recently you know about that lone Star tick disease know people getting allergic to meat there's some some yeah something that is in the bite of the tick something called they call it alpha gal for short and when you get this you develop this allergy to this stuff that exists in red meat and so when people get bitten by this one particular tick they literally develop an allergy to red meat and it can subside over time but for a lot of people they have to they stick to check in and fish afterwards they literally become allergic to easy become healthy everybody not necessarily see that's where the that's where the whole saturated fat argument comes oh sure I guess on the diet yes there's all this confusion about whether or not red meat is bad for you because a lot of these studies it's show that there's a direct correlation between red meat and heart attacks what they don't do is differentiate what kind of red meat they don't make a differentiation between red meat that's grass-fed passionate raised cattle it's very healthy or bison versus a fast-food burger with a white bread bun yeah and french fries and a soda with all sorts of sugar in it yeah see because you the because the fact that people in red meat on a daily basis they don't take any consideration what they eat red meat with and there's a giant difference between eating a piece of grass-fed meat with vegetables yep and you know and it's our water yeah yeah you know maybe a yam yeah yeah versus eating a fucking Carl's jr. double cheeseburger with fake bacon just dripping with funk and yeah I mean sugary super-serious or sauces yeah I mean you can't make the but people do and so the correlation between like it's not a good there's these are not good tests because the correlation between red meat and cancer you could say maybe maybe but not the way you guys showed it the way you guys showed it is just eating red meat with a bunch of other shit right there sitting yet red meat and living a healthy life yeah and eating with vegetables and having a what we would call a balanced diet yep you can't like say that it's all the same yeah it's just no I totally agree with that I mean for me the red meat is like I'll just feel better if I'm not eating it all the time right and I just prefer chicken or whatever dude a lot of people have different they have different reactions to all kinds of things sure I know several people that have celiacs well they literally can't consume any bread I know what you people that have that yeah and for those people there is obviously different than mine yeah mine if I eat bread I don't feel as good yeah I'll feed a big-ass sub like a fucking straw me sub yeah it feels great while it's going down you feel like shit sometimes it's hard to remember that because you're like well I just want the thing the difference between a an in-and-out double-double with a bun versus protein style with the lettuce yeah it's an infinitely different thing I I completely agree I mean I'm you know for me it's like like you know filet mignon or something like that it's like really nice cuz it's like a very lean cut but blue cheese on the toei well I don't know about Jamie's - white bread no bro blue cheese with a little crumbled blue cheese with some fucking look at you here's the problem honestly also like filet mignon is a boring cut like a ribeye is the cut right now the fact it's like cooked in there and you get a fucking nice dark surface on the outside you slice in its red in the middle you get a hunk of fat in your mouth okay yeah it's so much better tasting than filet mignon so I will not have blue cheese with a ribeye I was I will say that at Pacific dining car I know what they do but they make the most perfect filet mean you know there's like nothing on it it's just just the steak but it is like the most flavor complex piece of meat everywhere the downtown-1 are the one that's downtown one see the downtown one is like 24 hours a day isn't yeah how's that possible so I can get a steak at Pacific dining car downtown LA at 4 o'clock in the morning you could I need to go yeah we need to have like a post-show Pacific dining car dinner yeah yeah yeah for sure ask the store yeah oh is we're always going these bullshit places to eat yeah that place that place rocks and I just look it's got that heritage surfer vibe to it it's really cool I dig that man have you gone to the one in Santa Monica I have not no excellent is it they're both excellent okay out super old-school steakhouse oh yeah there's something about that that like when they have a relationship with the with the with the cattle farmer order yeah but I will say I am excited about a grown steak right I excited about something which something doesn't have to die ethically community if Cleveland tastes if the taste is good as the original and you're just like no I love I love both of these then he would obviously I would choose the the one that was just 100% yeah you know I mean just because like well just an efficiency I mean you know get rid of the empathy the emotional thing but like even just for efficiency's sake like what is the saving the environment from methane yeah the methane that totally the problem is we don't need cows anymore we'll have to start Merkin those cows yeah because I'm just gonna fuck and just grow up they're gonna be like deer oh yeah dude online a photo from his house in Long Island and he was saying that Long Island is just infested with deer and that they're literally going in and giving these these deer operations and they're what yeah they're trying to remove their ovaries they're giving them birth control pills of trying all these different ways oh my god proposals and even some places they hustle numbers they're giving they're trying to figure out what to do because there's no predators and there's just a fucking astounding number of deer that's you know it's you know cuz it's just human civilization like we just it's a domino effect we keep like fuckin sort of but the real issue is there's no predators they're really mean old if they released a bunch of wolves should care that I agree but that was a human decision you know say it likes it because those ecosystems work perfectly and then we come in and we're like I don't like those trees over there and a bird goes away and then like that bird was responsible for this thing and that blah blah blah blah blah and then I don't like wolves eating my kids I hate wolves I don't like the way they have sharp teeth don't like it one bit and they stand hey they don't look very friendly so it's so whatever the reasons but so that's kind of what you get yeah monkey with a perfect system yeah but once you monkey with that perfect system once you monkeyed it out yeah you're responsible you did a fucking deer everywhere yeah you gotta keep it I know yeah keep it right a man who live around there it's a huge pain in the ass because they crash into those things all the time no and you could die I've had friends that run into Meese and moved here yeah who's the scariest yeah that's like run into a tree at think it's like a text stories of like some guy have pickup truck was going like I don't know 45 something like that 50 hit a hit a moose and the moose just walked into the forest yeah after probably broke a lot of shit but they walked away it'll probably hopefully he'll let you see the video on YouTube very recently of a guy hitting a moose on a highway in Canada and it launches it into the air I mean launches it like the moose just steps out onto the road a boom this guy hits his car and the people that are filming it alike holy shit yeah this moves just flying through yeah I mean fucking flying like 20 30 feet through the air what happened I don't know I don't know it's just a video that is it might not have man I mean it might have but they're so tough there's just there's here it is right here meats are tough these guys driving oh my gosh yeah that's not alive that looks like a deer more than a moose the other one that I saw honestly Jamie was different maybe it's the same video from a different angle that's oh my god oh my god that's incredible that's dead he's just lying he gets scared and he's playing dead because there's one everybody up it'll definitely dead yeah definitely dead and that car is Jack my fied that's probably totaled Oh caved in bed frame that's just so suck so bad well they you know it's is there are some place like in Idaho Montana where they have those under passes or those overpasses which is pretty great healthy animals nature highways I think that's so I mean there's like so many things you we could do obviously it's it's resource intensive and whether people agree with it or not but we could totally be in harmony with things we need money for guns time for that you're right yeah doing that on six-hour hour there's a project to do that on the 101 for mountain lions oh yeah yeah this should apparently the genetic diversity of the mountain lions is threatened by the 101 yeah this is mountain lions on the ocean side in there like breeding too much with the mountain lions over there interview hard for them to get across the 101 to find all the mountain lions on this side that are uh you know as you go deep into like Simi Valley and those areas so apparently there trying to figure out some way to mitigate that and one of the best ideas is really wide strip of land yeah these things feel comfortable and yeah I like pave it I mean they're gonna like you know put her there and yeah I've seen us they look great too shit little money yeah but you know what they need to do that shit I mean it's like you know if we have enough shit humans already like even even some of us I mean - mental problems mental issues it's like that's we have so much it's just it's it's crazy even when I was like I mean I was never like destitute but I was definitely very very poor and wasn't sure if I would make rent or had to borrow a lot of money for for a few years and things like that but you just realize how much you have like I mean if you're rich if you're in comparison in comparison like I can always find water I could always find water and if I was social enough I could definitely gain the trust of people to be able to let me crash for a while on a couch so there was always a way to survive even if there are little things that so I the reason why I bring that up is just because like nature it's kind of our job to be stewards of of nature it should be better at it it certainly is in a lot of ways we certainly should be responsible that's why it should be so much more of a big deal when something like some sort of a company pollutes a bay yeah no sure it gets that is it is such a giant deal you can't like it loss over it with a cleanup yeah what you've done is like Devitt like that whole thing that happened with BP and the oil spill in the Gulf like they dedicated an entire ecosystem I mean that Eco all the people that relied on that area for fishing yeah all that people the people that live nearby and then the people that had to clean it apparently the people that had to clean like their own yeah yeah yeah no bueno you gotta clean up gasoline spill oil spill all day that should be good for you are you breathing that in yeah good 3m a 3m mask and then paper masks that should be sufficient definitely is gonna filter out all the toxicity could get into your DNA so terrible man yeah I mean I mean you know as much of Deepwater Horizon oil spill has disappeared because of bacteria oh that's good they were eating microbes didn't mean us didn't they they poured that on there too there's like one other thing that's some new shit they're gonna use out actually for plastic as well yeah chemicals used to disperse it are kept under water making it more available to the microbes that live in the deeper portions the ocean what's up with all those Facebook things like right in front of it just like an issue with the website called shitty shitty coding CNBC yeah you fucks you see we see that's amazing I just love when someone super smart figures out a giant issue with something simple yeah microbes microbes can like oil or fungus fungus fungus is great fungus like gets rid of oil from meanwhile those microbes are gonna get eaten by fish and those fish are gonna become huge and they're gonna start thinking through and I go I'm tired these motherfuckers coming in and killing us we got to go out there and kill them I hope so I don't I mean if they tried to really fuck with us like that'd be good there's like a new blue go to war with the fish and just feel good about eating them maybe what is this bacteria are evolving to eat plastic we dumped into the ocean whoa they're evolving to do it without us doing it that's nice we're gonna make an alien man like the movie alien like the guard Giger alien yeah you mean the xenomorph yeah yeah do you see I posted this thing on Instagram a couple days ago that I saw from nature is metal the Instagram account and it's a cuttlefish have you ever seen how cuttlefish Jack's other fish no it is watch this it doesn't even seem real look at that oh shit it's like an underwater frog but the way it opens up like a flower and put this thing into it I mean this is incredible look it stabs it and then Shawn it's so cool it's such a great system because it's like it keeps it closed to stay in camouflage yeah and then it only opens it last second and probably maybe the color mesmerizes well it's not just the seein enemies it literally takes on the shape and texture of the seein enemies that's amazing the the amount of camouflage it has is insane yeah there's somehow another I guess related to octopus we can which maybe the octopus can do the same thing yeah yeah the change K the camouflage thing is insane I mean nature is like way more Vanson liver and I mean what we are nature but but it's just like from our point of view looking like nature which is just like an evolution of you know it's molecular I mean wow the octopus is like what the fuck are you complaining about dude you have a phone okay you can fly in a plane yeah bitching that you can't turn into like you look like a coral reef yeah here's a fuck is that a cuttlefish right they're pretending to be a coral reef it's a - crab crab what are they feeding a crab that crowd it this is a kind of oh whoa look at that fucker oh what a weird-looking freaky alien creature and I love its propulsion system is great just undulates on the side it's so cool it's just I love it I love the I also really love spiders I think spiders are just the king of camouflage played that video a king of camouflage the cuttlefish oddly looking they do have like a like a little smile to him and he's cute I think they mean the same kind of cuddle I think it's cuddle with a CT no no no that's what they meant that's what they meant look at how it just becomes like whatever its near like when it sits down on stuff yeah it's okay it looks like other fish oh that's a ACTA puss yeah look at this octopus as it's on the ground in cephalopod these things are just they've adapted so cool a way to fake it it's just so alien to us and that's the thing about love oh my god shit crazy entertained look at how it looks like the bottom of that thing that it's in looks more like Cthulhu than octopuses right right face you know it's like you were talking about before about the idea of aliens visiting us like why would we think that they would look like us at all oh yeah no I mean you know they could just be spheres of energy that disappear and they're just like hey guys what's up why do they have to have a language even when they just convey intent well that's why I liked was that movie that came out recently the alien oh yeah yeah yeah the one up with the one the one the memory one yeah I wrote off at first yeah then I went back and watched it it's pretty fucking what's it called again who jeremy renner that guy yeah except upon arrival the arrival yeah yeah arrival I really like that movie and I liked it eventually yeah the first saw it when the girl died I was like get the fuck out of here you're not gonna get me with this yeah I know I know I know yeah and then like man that change real quick yeah it was very interesting it was like and and they were something totally different yeah yes the way I feel it's like why would we assume that everything would be physical when we have things like Wi-Fi we have like literally all of the world's data coming to you on your phone from space with zero connection you take that thing spin that phone around there's nothing physical connecting it so why wouldn't we assume that information travel from alien to alien like that why do they had why do they need a language yeah where they need why do they need to be able to touch things and see things and feel things yeah great might be information yeah the nation might be an alien they that's why you know like when people talk about doing DMT or you know or or even ketamine you know like that kind of dissociative intelligences that people are the intelligences beyond being undissociated was like that they feel around them like almost an insight and like intelligence that's what I think like yeah everything is just pure consciousness just everything is consciousness around you all the time yeah all the time it's entirely possible I mean you know it's like that's what you are yes all we are is it me as far as we know we're vibrating proof weird particles we just don't have the senses to deal with whatever the fuck else is around we have the sense to deal with all our biological needs all of our imperatives what we need to concentrate on order to stay functional yeah as a flesh bag yeah we're a division of consciousness yeah we were literally life forms were forms of life well your body literally is an avatar for consciousness oh yeah it's like the movie that's what I call the biomechanical consciousness transport system ooh that's a good name for it if you want to talk to chicks in the hot tub with our biological transport sole containment vehicles whatever whatever is a big deal it's a hot tub it feels good yeah you know over here you sit over there so some some women would it take that'd be like yeah that's cool yeah and then you're like yeah yeah girls with tattoos like right above their taste like yeah you're saying if you made me feel good about my choices yeah I dig it thanks man I think it's on this joint although that fat Jewish guys made that haircut a little fucked up guys kind of like tapped into it in a way it's yeah yeah coming in change man's coming issue strange man the guy guy debord on your shirt who's Guy Debord no deed aboard he okay I don't care anymore it's the guy who started the Situationists they're kind of like a philosophical artistic movement in the 50s you know yeah use French and they got basically credit is Catholic dadaism mixed with like some different art like artistic techniques and some philosophy they would do these exercises to kind of shake their orientation like they love disorientation so they would you know drink a bunch of absinthe and walk around their town like and act like a group of them would like act like they were tourists in their own town and they would like look they would navigate by looking up at the buildings as opposed to a street level so they're do things like that or take maps tourist maps of other cities and superimpose them block for block like on another city or they did jokes like we are weird like kind of bits where one guy dressed as a bishop and actually led a sermon at and notify them and don't ever say it like that yeah there were like pranksters they really kind of nuts with them there they're like practice and they were accredited Malcolm McLaren was a it was a situationist and he created kind of partially created the Sex Pistols as living mannequins for his fashion Oh so the punk movement is kind of associated with situationist because they their whole mantra I mean it's a distillation but it's provoke to the edge of violence whoa no that's that's interesting was there ever a documentary on these guys there might be I've never I've never found one I'm just like there's the society of the spectacle which is one of the books that he wrote and there's like two two books that he that he wrote he did boards the Society of the spectacle yeah interesting yeah self-will self takes a walk through the how do you say that we're been banned in news and news of Patti they been tickets been you used a Betty of belly and is astonished by the press hints is that the right way to say that yeah prescients of de boards 1967 masterpiece which so accurately describes the shit we're in interesting basically a society of the spectacle and more fucking issues with the Twitter thing showing up right there on the pictures the fuck is with your browser son as I'm zooming in it probably fucks with it Oh probably ad blockers in all kinds of weird been hacked son AJ CKD yeah anyways that's who he is that's amazing know about that guy yeah when I first when I first moved to New York I a friend of mine and performance artist took me to this experimental theater that was in a garage in Williamsburg like way back who was still pretty shitty city seedy and you walk in this garage and they had this theater piece on Gaeta board and it was amazing as soon as cuz they kind of explained what it was about in the journey and blah blah blah but it was also done in a style that would have been situationist so we were just like on these boards that were on top of buckets for seats for bleachers and then they were passing around like beers looks like people were just drinking beers and watching this play and it was amazing and it really inspired me where I was like oh yeah I dig I like it I like that pranking hacking social hacking it's nice provoked to the point of violence yeah just before violence something annoying neighbor yeah basically but someone who's doing it on purpose which is even more annoying yeah super nice well it's more than just like uh he's an annoying person so how know this person is doing it on purpose like Andy Kaufman right Situationist yeah he wouldn't necessarily maybe have described himself as that but that's he's a perfect example of that or Andy Warhol more Kaufman ranked cuz Warhol was just creating art well yeah but his whole like con artist kind of vibe whether he would have ascribed to her not but the fact that he was kind of conning a little bit you know that sample the Campbell Soup suitcase a little bit of a con a little bit please enjoy looking at they they did but it started it's kind of like that when I see it I'm like a little bit of a con mmm it's like in the factory idea you know is also a little bit of a con it's a little bit of a of a hack I mean in a conscious really intelligent philosophical way right it's not to say that he's really trying to fool pit it's not that he's just like this and and people are like yes I like it and there's like that's what I thought you know right right it was always weird when like people push back against someone trying to push what they think is too far like like the they become these big cultural arguments as to what's art and what's not especially when things are funded like do you member piss Christ do you remember all that you don't remember this that was damnit what was his name I was just starting out doing stand-up so is the late 80s god what is his name what was his name okay wasn't that one I was thinking of there was a that was one I was a peter was another guy there was another guy who was like famous for that kind of shit god dammit very controversial artist who did a lot of like weird sexual and odd stuff in like the late 80s early 90s and it became a huge issue because people were mad that it like some of it was being funded and put up in museums that were state-funded oh interesting god dammit it's not the tip of my tongue cameras guys name these are like pieces of art like works yeah and piss Christ was one of them what piss Christ was was a jar of piss with a crucifix in it and it was on display in a museum how I do remember that yeah people like what in the fuck is this and and they called it piss Christ and people would travel from all over the world to go stare at pissed I get it what's the audacity right part of it is the audacity to just do something like that it must be like cool with it I mean that's my favorite art is like one of my favorite moments and kind of discovering that was when I was going to I was going to Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle and every I think it was every Tuesday or a Thursday or maybe every Wednesday one of the middle days they would allow students to throw a concert in the theater in the small pancho Hall theater and you could just sign up for it and you could do whatever you wanted and one day it was like all that kind of I guess I would call them performance art the musician conceptual musician badasses like all on stage and it was like Brent Arnold on cello Skaven King on violin or viola and a guy on base just like five or six people on stage all badasses Tim young and and I was in the theater and there were like maybe 23 kids in a 60 seat theater just like chillin scattered throughout the seats they started playing and everybody was playing through distortion pedals and they just started playing these distortion drones like all of them and and then eventually just sounded it you saw people doing things on stage but all you could hear was for like probably an hour and and there and I had earplugs in and and everybody cleared out like everybody cleared out and I sang to the end but I started like I started like head bobbing because like that's when I started realizing that static whether you're seeing visual static or audio static after a while you start to hallucinate and you start to you start to hear music and static so if you hear eventually when you D focus it's like those you know those magic eye puzzles were you like supposed to hold your thumb right and then also oh I can see this three dimensional image same exact concept essentially but your mind is creating the structure the geometric structure because it wants to find structure and static is like raw energy so like Jodie Foster in contact and she would stare at the static trying to find patterns exactly that's exactly right yeah yeah similar thing and so what so I started like I just couldn't stop like head head banging essentially but it was like really slow and then afterwards they they came up to me they're like oh okay you're one of those the bass players saying that to me and I was like ah that's so cool like he didn't he didn't have to explain anything at all it's like anyways saying so for me when I see duration pieces things that test people's patience I love it I love like seeing people you can't stand this and just like now just wait just hang in there no I can't stay there or it's pissing people off I love it it's like there's we're not even pissing them off just making them frustrated right like there's a certain amount of frustration that I think is fun to play with at least at least when I'm doing comedy a little bit of that is is good just like little doses here and there right it's kind of my thing I like it it's a good feeling but testing to see if people willing to relax yeah yeah totally you're just like I'm just fucking with you just keep that in mind when I'm doing something that seems kind of frustrating right and if you can keep both those things in mind you can relax and just go for the ride right if you if you want or you could just be like this fucking sucks and leave which is fine too that means an effort it's not not for everybody nothing is right it's an all dependent upon like whether or not you're good at delivering the ride Yeah right totally yeah yeah if there's long as there's a reward that's the thing it's like I mean that's what you're doing right you're always playing off of something that's what a joke is it's like expectations subvert the expectation and like and there's so many different ways a few different ways you can do that so there's gonna be people that just have different styles that they enjoy like there's people that are Gabriel Iglesias fans as people have taken a taro fans right you know I'm saying right there's people that are fans of both yeah totally yeah totally I know I'm like one of those those I'm like I like anybody that's funny yeah I like yeah I like any music that's good yeah that's the good way to say it yeah results may vary yeah results vary but like you know if you know it's just like it's a sincerity you know I mean we all know it's like comics if we're watching other comics up there that we haven't seen before you can tell pretty quick when it's it's coming from an honest place yeah you even if it's like they're a little nerd you can tell they're nervous and they're kind of playing a cool front like you can tell the jokes the point of view is coming from an honest place well it's also I think we lost that with DJs there's no DJ's like when I was a kid I would remember DJ's playing songs and it was like sincere appreciation for the songs they're playing thing they'd pick this song they really want you to dig this song and you'd find a DJ that you like you really enjoyed his show like oh he's gonna be on from 3 to 7 this guy's the shit he plays great music yeah and you listen to him talk about the songs yeah and it was like this authentic thing to it versus like a jack FM station but here we go Jack fm all the hits all the difference all the time yeah 24/7 fade right into the music yeah like kiss yeah yeah you get that with kids so donate now to not just can't share Terry Gross hi Terry Gross all things considered Public Radio International NPR eisah listen to that all the time Corvo Coleman that was mine morning ritual well so to NPR I've act before there were podcast this is different other things you're hearing yeah All Things Considered I love wait wait don't tell me those are good it's a it's a pretty fun time it's pretty biting actually and it's lightning fast I mean the wit on there is just awesome yeah NPR's radio labs and PR isn't a radio lobe yep yeah that's one of the best podcast peer amazing that I've learned more than radio lab than I did from all my years of barely paying attention in school for sure yeah yeah I quote radio lab more than I quote most books I've read yeah no I agree I agree they're they're absolutely fantastic I mean there's just like a lot of cool shows on there that yeah and Casey aw stow because they plays so much dope music like it's I discover like probably 80% of my music on there really what station is that KCRW it's a 93.3 is it or 89.9 I haven't listened to a radio station in fucking years check it out the radio in years it's cool I just get the app and I stream it from my app for my phone I listen to music when I work out sometimes when I'm driving yeah most of time what's in a podcast now 99.9 city of license Santa Monica Public Broadcasting yeah owner Santa Monica College how weird yeah they're moving they got they got a new location but they're like one of the most influential radio stations in the country I think that's the place where Henry Rollins has a weekly show yeah totally yeah fanatic yeah and fanatic he's it's great I mean you just get like this kind of more like eighties radio feel right here like these underground geyser you know people like these really warm voices like that was a new one from orbital coming out with a single that's definitely definitely geared more towards the kids from the 1990s if you remember that time period this is a new one from you know like that kind of shit where you're like oh yeah if you feel like you're in a warm bath of like oh what else you got this is a new one from flan tarf and then it's just like this weird angular gross sounding music and you're like how are you able to talk like that and play that track that's great well I love the fact that people could just play whatever they want like we need more of that like totally tried for a long time the other way it doesn't work now algorithms okay I mean we've got Spotify down you got all that shit which I don't really dig but uh and that as much I mean I sometimes they'll do a radio station on Apple music yeah but I like choosing I listen to albums all right so I listen to an album for a long time and then I'll switch to another album or I'll switch to like three songs off of a record but I like choosing when I'm listening to on occasion I have discovered cool music by using the radio station but really for me I'd rather just do KCRW then there's a real human you know going hey check this out yeah and it's yeah it's a rare treat yeah I like that I like it I like keeping it a little bit more old-school and comes to music discovery and listening well just the fact that you know that this is rare now you know you appreciate it yeah absolutely well we have to come back to it I mean the organic shit I mean that's why I like anything I look at like technology it's like we're still kind of primitive it's not organic enough it's not I thought we're not an afterthought mode it's not like you know technology should be like a light switch I went to a restaurant the other day and all of their furniture was made with like metal pipes and like wood like this tiny bowl and you know like that sort of crafty sort of feel to things we are touching wood and use brick on the wall like that's like soot and the menu is written in a chalkboard yeah totally people want that shit now oh they do they like the personal touch it makes them it reminds them of being human because we're so digital most of the time if somebody gives you an iPad the menus on the iPad know I don't know don't like a chalkboard over here do not like yeah I see that specials on the chalkboard yeah no one swipe to go will what what kind of beer do no gross that's why I think monitors TVs should only be in sports bars yeah and then keep them out of all the other places I'd love to just go I'm not a drinker but if I go to a bar with some with a friend I love it when I go into a bar oh that's just a bar this is I mean in what I mean is there's no fucking television it's off maybe just in case for an emergency broadcast or something because there are people gathered there whatever but I like it when it's like there's no fucking monitor people are just chilling to having conversations with you right that's what a bar should be sorry maybe maybe show blade on every oh yes streaming 24/7 projected ooh you know projected on a screen just to soften the light because otherwise you get that screen glare which is jacked ur fuckin ass going super old school when grab them fucking horse yeah I do I do drive a horse that's that's the technical term for drive one well we're gonna long for the days where engines were real one day we're gonna be like remember when Beckwith Kern's made noises and you can hear them coming yeah totally don't be like I am remember we're used to drive them yeah mm-hmm that was my favorite scene in iRobot he's like I'm going manual they're going like 300 miles per hour and then the computer said all right now the person in the faster said are you crazy going to switching to manual at these speeds I love that yeah one day that'll be a thing in the past the spherical wheels though I mean come on that was sick yeah the car could rotate while it's still maintaining the same speed forward oh yeah that's right and that's coming to four spheres yeah they have them in fact factory floor robots or like forklifts now oh yeah I forget what they call that type of steering but it's like crap it's basically crab like so it can move forward sideways any any way how many years do you think we have where it's still able to drive your own car I think we have probably 10 years 10 years that sounds about right yeah yeah I feel like it's gonna creep in we're gonna realize how much safer it is people with some some assholes are gonna fuck up with manual they're gonna crash into a school or something like that yeah and then people are gonna go enough with the manual enough you know yeah what they'll do semi manual like you can you can you can steer you can drive within certain parameters but if the computer senses you're going off the rails and look like and guide the car back well you know that's why it's so there's such a demand for really old cars that have like tactile feedback yeah they're so expensive like if you buy a 1973 Porsche which is only 150 200 horsepower engine if those things are in good shape yeah they're worth a fuck load of money now true because you feel everything when you drive that thing yeah every bump do you drive over you feel the there's no power steering at all see if you feel like every turn on the steering wheel yeah yeah yeah you're you feel the force that the wheel has to an interpretation and when you turn hard it's harder to turn yeah wait harder yeah yeah you got it you got a really got to be present with it every moment I was like it with like new power steering you could kind of be absent-minded be taking a pretty hard corner yeah is easy to roll the car well difference in also the newest power steering even opposed to the last generations now they go bye-bye sharing that's electric yeah it's fly-by-wire you don't feel anything whereas the hydraulic gave you varying feedback depending on how much load was on yeah or rack-and-pinion yeah I always loved wreck I thought that was the perfect happy medium yeah well those really old cars were so light like those old Porsches and old BMWs like the BMW 2002 no yeah tiny bugs yeah they're so light you didn't have to have like power steering yeah well I mean I'm what people are doing now is they're they're they're pulling the transmissions and engines and replacing them with electric so you still have the road feel and the handling of it but you get the battery but you get the you get the battery so you don't get I mean it's not loud but you get this great fusion of like you've got the classic car look but you've got the speed and the pickup so you can't like this little tiny BMW mm you're doing 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds I saw somebody did that with a 1965 Mustang they took a 65 Mustang and turned into an electric car and it was like to be a sad it's a beast I know that when you talk yeah crazy it was you looking at this classic old-school muscle car and yet it has like a Tesla underbody yeah it's like an electric muscle car huh yeah I mean cut remac you know that Rimac or Rimac they're Estonian are ima see they make this electric car for electric motors motor for each wheel it's got over a thousand horsepower Jesus zero to 60 and 3.0 to something like that three point cheese maybe even faster than that and or no no no no tell me look at that two point three that thing's insane because my card is two point three what car do you have Tesla P 100 e damn son look at this thing this thing's beautiful it looks like one of those Lexus who pays those new lexus coupes yeah yeah it's amazing yeah see if they can have like a yeah there you look at things beautiful yeah it's like it's crazy and so it does uh it it definitely does affect oral steering and Vectra power discs our distribution so if these things are gorgeous it can corner like a motherfucker and because the computers monitoring traction all the time if to each wheel with an electric motor that has instantaneous torque you're able to steer the car with acceleration well so if you're coming around the corner depending on the mode and the way that you're driving you can actually push the car around the corner with the wheels using the input from the steering wheel so your directional steering but also vecturo steering at the same whoa so that car is just fast gusting it's just leaving this Tesla behind yeah just leaving it leaving it like it's parked yeah and this guy this guy actually does some good shit and so now there's like some like young rich guys throw is the concept but I like that guy he's gonna race a Ferrari oh you know it's gonna bury that Ferrari on the Ferraris history it's a LOF it's a lot Ferrari yeah that's yeah it's a Ferrari laferrari which is hybrid that's crazy the Ramat yeah now the remakes gonna win I know Italy I think so let's say three two one go oh my god off the line instantaneously not even close let's just see you later I mean it's a linear power curve right it's an absolutely sure it's a curve it's just a perfect curve of absolute power that's insane now where does one get one of these Remax uh you know far can they drive yeah totally it can go two hundred feet per charge find out how long those things drive for it let's take a guess I say they have 220 miles on them what do you say I'm gonna say I'm gonna say 180 miles 200 miles to 200 much Christine you went low ball I thought you know high ball on me top top end of 225 or something like that or an electric car is a huge deal what's your Tesla get what's the longest distance you drive 340 that's pretty goddamn good I'm like that are three you think about when Tesla when they like had a bunch of people what does it say 2.82 kilowatt can give 205 miles yeah so they don't specify conceptual driving the drive cycle yes like a maniac I'm gonna say 150 yeah maybe not even yeah 140 what you think about like during the hurricane in Florida Tesla released a bunch of these cars that had they had restrictions on the amount of distance they could drive oh yeah and so they did it remotely and they gave these cars more of a distance oh yeah yeah yeah they control speed probably government opted at top speed no I think they actually literally have a threshold of how far they're like you could pay more when you buy them like if you buy one you could have the option to have a 250-mile gas tank or a 350-mile game all day we just unlock it exactly interesting so the same but kilowatt battery size kilowatt battery yeah I don't know about that I don't like that it's weird right I think I think as long as the battery system is modular so that you can add or take away from it without like huge manufacturing costs of changing the shape of the battery which is that which is what Tesla does you can either like elongate the body of the car then add more packs yeah or you can shorten the body of the car narrow it less packs but I think it'd just be Packers just fucking people over I just don't have the capability it's just a software thing I'm not gonna crossed any extra money unless the ID this is but it's so weird it's like well then why not just make a competitive lease for the battery capacity that you want or or there's that they're like but why for some small price now and if you want to pay more later we can unlock more battery but here's the problem instead of like say if you buy an engine and it has 800 horsepower and then the you know there's another option you could buy the v6 and that only has 350 horsepower mm-hm sike we're kidding the v6 has 800 horsepower we're not gonna let you use it cuz you're not paying us that's what really what it is sure it's because it's a since we're that battery pack yeah I don't like that that that I don't like that doesn't make sense I mean it is intentionally they've tripled some of their cars and the other ones they're giving you an option to not cripple but we want you to pay more well you know the same exact hardware it's an it's an in-app purchase well it is kind of it's it's way different because you're talking about like a physical it's like almost if your phone yes you have to pay more on your phone that's 250 gigabytes yes is a hundred totally that's really well yeah but it's like also the same as like getting a video game and you're like I've got the video game and they're like would you like to unlock more content yeah but see that's a journey you're on right your video game is a portal to a journey a physical device that has the capability to drive through and 50 miles like now you can't have those 350 I'll give you two well 200 miles also how many telic realistically I'm only driving like maybe 30 miles a day but that doesn't matter but I'm just saying if you want to go across the country if the idea was like you could in the future well see it doesn't make sense I don't know if that's really the real thing stupid this doesn't make any sense it's like you don't make money well I guess if you just want to like unify the manufacturing process so that you can create a higher yield or something like that you're looking at it like the man Johnny blue collar consumer fucking pissed hey I am pissed with you I you know I'm just saying just saying I understand yeah Reggie want we're gonna wrap this pitch up yeah it's gonna say to wrap it out this is awesome man I know every time I get a locked out they're like oh you should you should be out of show you should be on the show you know you and I ran into each other first time we ever met a plane no yeah yeah we're flying to London or something together yeah that's and Emily that is international plane we were like one seat ahead of each other we took the trays yeah I put the selfie on Instagram remember that shit that's right it was a long time ago that was like oh yeah it was you me and Tony Hinchcliffe oh my god well that was a while ago I think I think we were on our way somewhere in Europe I want to say there look at that that's us that's so crazy crazy time travel man yeah time travel what year was that young Jamie mm January 2015 phrase just just think at the moment we took that picture we were simultaneously talking about this moment reflecting on this picture crazy man so in a way we were we were timed okay we were we were Tom Chandler a time travel ship anyways I would stoked and now we're done say goodbye goodbye everyone cuz leave well goodbye [Music]
