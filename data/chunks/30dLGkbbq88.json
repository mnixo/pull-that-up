hello freak bitches I think and I know that Black Sabbath is getting back together with the original lineup to do two shows at the Birmingham NEC in England so I called Sharon Osbourne I said Sharon I got this great idea I fly out and hang out with Black Sabbath and bro-down with a band and go to band practice and have a really good time and you put me on the guest list for this shows and I hang out for free and it's like the best time I've ever had knowing she'd hang up on me she said let me call him and ask him if that's okay because I already knew Ozzy but I didn't know the rest of the guys and she called me later that day she said oh they think it's fine here's the address just let us know when to expect you so I booked it I booked it around my trip to Africa so I went a us a London bus up to Wales where they were practicing taxi no no to Aussies assistant came and got me so I hung out with Sabbath at band practice me and the band in full band rehearsals best watched the shows the two reunion shows by at the soundboard and then the next day I flew to Kenya and so it was just a good you know that was a good chunk it travelled and I ends up in South Africa after all of that and said to myself okay I'm going to come to Africa once a year and I just started picking out different chunks of it and just started going and that was 20 years ago and I've been there I don't know like 20s sometimes Wow yeah and you never don't learn you know I call it the big book it's where you learn about life and death and you can learn that anywhere but you see big stuff you see people who suffer people who have no food or water security like you and I we talk about retirement and life insurance indication a lot of tribes there's no words or even ideas in their lives like I was hanging out with some Acholi people once in Uganda a few years ago and I had a translator as a Dinka guy who spoke I guess whatever a trolli people speak as you can you ask them if they have any words in their language for life insurance retirement or vacation and they understood retirement you get too old your kids take care of you but a vacation they said you leave somewhere and you come back why would you want to leave your home it's where all your friends are and your family and you why would you ever do that we're like life insurance right what the hell are you talking about and you start meeting people who their sense of time and space is I've got a bowl there's some rice in it's like today I got tomorrow we'll see where you and I think okay December I'm going to do this and we really have a realistic expectation of being alive and breathing in December and in your life you've no doubt thought of okay when I retire or whatever that means to you money some kind of security up the road those parts of the world where people live their entire like 37 years and there's they don't have a day of that kind of security they got the t-shirt a stick in some shade and I try and not as some boyar I'm trying to understand the world and I can understand it by reading some books and seeing some documentaries but there's nothing like getting out into what Mark Twain called the territory a phrase I stole from David Lee Roth when he said it to me and David Lee was actually a real inspiration to do a lot of traveling and one time we were talking and he just come back from open sea kayaking in the Pacific so I said so why is it Henry is because don't get eaten today is a great thing to have on your to-do list every once in a while I said damn that is profound you know what he was doing up until recently he moved to Japan I didn't know anybody there and he was taking kendo lessons learning how to sword fight yeah Japanese master yep yeah no no he told me he called me one Sunday a while ago I helped him with his autobiography so I worked with Dave really closely for many many months I met him when I was in Black Flag 30-some years ago I walked by him in an art gallery I went wait a minute anyway black flag right now I'm like no way it's the van Halen guy we became brothers like he called me from from Japan and said uh he's learning Japanese he's very smart and he is like learning Japanese and started speaking Japanese and he's just taking lessons he said that this sword guy was just like everyday just like you're stupid he's good just like to break it him down yeah and he just got an apartment there yeah I mean his love and rockstar just gets like this normal apartment with his dog and just starts taking kendo lesson yeah right dave has always had a great appreciation of you know that kind of discipline I'm he comes up through martial arts since as a kid and I think is someone else in his families into it but he's been that way you know that kind of disciplined and you can see it on stage the guy is very physical but it's coming from a real disciplined not messing around kind of aggression and control and I Dave I really loves Japan he said he'd call me so I'm living a small apartment I'm taking my language lessons I'm taking my martial arts stuff and he was doing sword stuff for quite a long time though yeah he's always been involved in martial arts and even the way he sort of approached hedonism I always felt like it was sort of like an applied approach to hedonism like his rock star lifestyle thing what he was doing it's almost like look not a lot of people get a chance to do this yeah I'm gonna do it yeah one time he when we were working on his book he said you know I go home to Pasadena now and then we're you know born and raised and some of this high school buddies see me like well Dave you know must be nice you know being David Lee Roth and he and he said you know what I'm graduation day from high school we all were on the same starting blocks you chose the bank job that's a sure thing you're going to die in that cubicle I choose he said to sail the seas of consequence of like I love that and I was like yeah man that's daring and so he won I mean like he's had a pretty good ride I reckon and and so in my own way you know I come from minimum wage work I'm nobody from nowhere and I got into music via punk rock because the band black flag said hey you're crazy guy you want to try out to be our singer like what do I have to lose yeah and so I went for that and it led to everything else and ultimately why I'm here in this room with you today do you miss rock do you miss touring as a musician no no I did it I did it really hard until I had nothing left to give to it and so now if I went back to it it would just be repetition and it might be fun repetition but it wouldn't be meaningful in that I wouldn't be putting out anything new and for me the day I stopped doing music was what I woke up one day and I just sat up and like a light bulb went on I went wow I'm out of lyrics and it wasn't like only know I'm like okay well give me my scroll I guess I've graduated when was this uh 2003 or that and I just called the manager I said hey I'm done music and he saw a 15% of that dough poof and he's like you know I want ya guess why I said because I got nothing new to add these love then just go out and do the hit so I'm like man it's not what Coltrane would have done it's not with Miles Davis would it Don I just can't I don't want to repeat it's not artistically brave to me and so I'd much rather just try new things but thankfully by that time I was already doing talking tours all over the world and they do very well tons of acting voiceover I had all this other stuff I was doing at the book company a record company music publishing I had all this other stuff and so I just kind of let all of that stuff fill in put it this way I'm busier now than ever and I don't miss the music I see bands in the airport all the time but like the laminates in their road gear I'm like yeah rumble young man Rumble I had my fill well it's beautiful that you did it on your terms you decided to do it it wasn't just it wasn't like there's a lot of aging rock stars that have that sort of existence where they have to go out and do this yeah and no one wants to hear your new shit I'm a big part of the problem yeah and so they have to do that weird circle the wagons thing like we're going to play this album in its entirety okay I go to some of those shows I you know throw my money down and go see that band do that album in its entirety it's cool but it's not for me well I've heard the stones still put on an awesome show yeah I think one of the cool things about it is like wow Mick Jagger can still fucking do it yeah he still apparently works out twice a day yeah he's amazing Shane great shape there's some people and they're rare they actually it's not about money that's when I really start trusting those old rock stars like Rod Stewart doesn't need a dime I mean that guy can buy four countries right now he's probably playing tonight in Las Vegas or somewhere Elton John they just really like doing the thing Mick Jagger and Keith Richards they'll be rock it'll die on stage and it's not money it's not like hey we might get popular it's like man we really want to play brown sugar I don't but I admire them I think it's one thing is I think it's real yeah well I'm sure it is real yeah I'm sure it's room with a lot of them but what I like with you would what you're saying is that you had already figured out all these other paths in life that you were enjoying putting your creative energies decided I know it was summer 1984 I was 23 I was in Black Flag and we were touring we're staying out of California because the Olympics were coming we knew the cops would just be looking to smash down any supposed near do wells so we just stayed on tour the whole year pretty much and I noticed all these great bands around me very talented people and everyone we're all broke between tours we're like living like sharks if we don't like tour we don't eat and between tours the guys and that band are all waiters I'm not putting that down but the music wasn't keeping you in rent 12 months a year and I'm not nearly as talented as any of them so I said man if they're those guys are struggling then what am I going to do I better get plans BCDE F and G together and in those days I just started my little book publishing company so I'm going to work harder on writing I'm going to become much better start doing the talking shows I'm gonna get much better at that and I'm going to start saying yes to things when they come along a couple of years later Hollywood started calling hey can you act him like as well as I can sing and click but I started you know acting as Crispin Glover the actor one day he said to me said Henry as a just please consider acting just like just if you get an audition don't necessarily say no just because you're the music guy like he said I think you might really like it and you could probably do it and so I said okay and within a year I was doing film and then hey can you do a voiceover I'm like yeah I got a voice and so I just started saying yes to more stuff and that was the plan just have more things to do which is fine so I don't like sitting around anyway and then ironically music ended up being very very good and all of that for me but I had plans other plans and I've noticed a lot of old geezers around my era they didn't come up with something else and they just I don't know why and they didn't make another plan and they get put into those weird tours where they're you know you bring your kid and all of that and it's more that they got it more than they want and I'd rather wake up wanting to do stuff not having to do stuff I think like you are saying a while ago like less obligation just so you clear the deck so you can really do what you want cuz life is short I mean last week I was 20 and now I'm 56 I mean it goes by really fast it doesn't matter if you're in a cubicle or a prison cell man you wake up one day you're a damn that was fast and so you might as well make it as much as what you want it to be as possible because all you're getting is older I don't understand why people don't fear that I wake up every day but where the Grim Reaper's side whistling by my ear going you better get up man and it's all the up I meet I don't ever sleep in [Music]
