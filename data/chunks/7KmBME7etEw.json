the gyro gun experience so let's go back to where the power went out man we were talking about Hicks you guys put Hicks on a you thanked him on a CD because you got ahold of one of his cassettes and you enjoyed it and but you never you guys never actually toured together but you know we planned on it it was basically a plan we were kind of setting into motion in like mid 93 we were talking and that's when it's all moving he came down and that was kind of part of what he was coming down we're trying to figure out what we're gonna do comedians and rock musicians like that it's it's a weird combination the Bobcat Goldthwait did a lot of work with Nirvana he opened up for them we have him in here and he told some hilarious stories about them just fucking honking shit at him screaming and fucking murder in their eyes yeah stop fucking hey meanwhile he's friends with them and they want him to go out there it's like yeah like I actually approached Dave across a couple years ago hey now we're gonna do another shake no I would say no - no I wouldn't want to yeah you don't want to eat dick in front of a rock crowd it's just it's not anything right with coins and stuff is all it's weird combination it's like you're not providing them what they're there to see you you've got attorney me might work I've seen guys do it and pull it off and it works with it works with Puscifer yeah because it's just it's just that the nature of that project is silly it's it's just there's just all this different stuff going on you got film and you've got yeah you've got video and you've got an animation you've got week you know for one - where we had Neil hamburger opened up for us really you know so that's just and then in the middle of our said he would come out and interrupt and go I forgot a joke and you know just bomb the audience out for a minute and then wander off and that can take my drink in my chair and sit down and like in my spot and take up space for listen here I saw Hicks at the comedy connection and I saw him because he was on the Rodney Dangerfield special and I you know I was a aspiring comedian so I went to see everybody was on the Rodney Dangerfield special when they came through town you know and Boston was one of those pit stops it was like Chicago Boston you know there was places where people who come through and you know you would guarantee that they would be in your town eventually and Hix went up he went up at the comedy connection or the first time I actually saw him was that Nick's comedy stop and he went up after this guy was a incredible hack the guy was like cop doughnut jokes cartoon smoking pot and like them all the most hackneyed obvious premises and he was hailing audiences filled idiots nobody knew who Hicks was me and maybe 50 of the comedian's in the back of the room out of 300 people who were in the audience place is packed by 20 minutes in this show half the people have left you know mean literally cleared out at least 50% by the end of it it was maybe a hundred people left and it was 50 audience members and 50 comedians and we and he didn't give a fuck he never can i with if one joke would go wrong for me I would go into a tailspin I would panic I would I would rush my jokes I would say fuck too much I would just I would I would not have any confidence he's in the middle of this bit about how Satan fucks John Davidson who don't remember John Davidson was the host of that's incredible was the you know one of them was like the internet before there was the internet so he it's the demon with his thorny cock is fucking John Davidson in the ass and John David Davidson swells up in the off season because he's pregnant with Lucifer's baby and he shits out Oprah Winfrey or or Geraldo Rivera depending on where Hicks was that and so Hicks is standing on stage shitting so he's pausing I mean this fucking minutes man minutes of just just straining and people just getting up and leaving and he looks up in the middle goes yeah as usually clears a room crying laughing I got to see him bomb horribly but yet still kill for 50 to 100 people and then I got to see him you know kill all right the whole the whole crowd but what a an interesting guy it's like oh he was doing something that nobody else was doing I mean who's like it was injecting Noam Chomsky and and you know and philosophy and Terence Mckenna and it was like like whoa well yeah I didn't even like when I first saw Kennison Guinness it was the first time I ever thought I could do comedy I was like you know I thought saw these guys rolling up their sleeves talking about did you ever notice and it's like well I kind of can I could do that I guess I kind of could do that if I had to do that but then I saw Kinnison and and you know I was bad and he was angry and it was funny and I was laughs and I was like maybe there maybe there's a comedy for me maybe I could find my comedy right and then when I saw Hicks I was like oh this guy just flipped the whole fucking thing on its head like now it's now it's you know it's about formulating a philosophy on life and that there is a possibility outside of the direction that we're going in and then it is possible for the human beings and the you know the human civilization to rise up and and and be about love and be about understanding and be about intellectual curiosity and and to be free of judgment I was like this guy's a fucking comedian like this is the crazy shit I've ever seen yeah look it's almost like his jokes were an afterthought to inject his philosophy into the audience I think partly yeah that's absolutely yeah so what oh but I've loved I you know I kind of like you spend a little I spend a little time in that little comedy world for a while was very always very inspiring to me to watch comedians like him basically just stick to their guns and finished their act without getting that nervous sweat I mean I was always inspiring to see that and it's always my favorite comedy clubs to go to were the ones that you know you end up if you're sitting out front of the Mann's Chinese they give you tickets to go to this free comedy club go then because if it's a good comedian on you can like take bets to see how quickly the rooms gonna clear that's you know and we had a that I think I remember one time he had Andy Kindler did a whole thing we brought everybody he knew down there kind of have like a little side you know side seats with all the comedian's that he had an abyss sleeve and they did a whole like debunking comedy like a like a hack hack class and they had everybody come up and just do like the hack thing in front of this audience and this is all these people that just kind of one ticket from you know and got ticket to the man saying isn't there just I don't understand like that's funny why is that hack looks funny like and then you know that whole thing went on for like an hour you know hour and a half I was just I'm in the back of the room just peeing myself watching them go through this and then some dude gets up after they met their act and does everything that they just went through and the audience is like oh that's so funny can I have another break like and then David Cross gets up and then just clears the room was awesome an opening line just you know I saw Schindler's this the other day and she English list finally saw it it's not that funny this whole table of people just get up and out the door like in a just every joke that he said it was like we're watching like he just set off a bomb there he just set off a bomb there cleared the room Oh David Cross is rarely credited but in my opinion of watching it all happened he's the originator of the idea of alternative comedy because I saw him do an alternative comedy in 1988 he was in Boston yeah catch in Cambridge he would go up and he would do I remember one time he was doing this this exercise video where I would teach you teach you how to stretch so he have played the exercise video he stretches like I really do feel a stretch and he was like doing this like long and people like nervously giggling and not showing we're not sure where it was going and never one anywhere and everyone but it was amazing you know I felt I felt he was like a better version of what Andy Kaufman was doing because Andy Kaufman would get up in front of like colleges and like read The Great Gatsby and I was like that's kind of fucked it's not really funny at all it is now yeah it is now yeah it's like a delayed reaction like witness it it's great long-term absorption yeah but cross was he was funny while I was doing it it was it was weird he was just so silly it was actually funny while he was doing it do you like comedy I I like music because I'm completely unmusical I don't have any skill I don't have any talent I don't have it I don't understand it I don't see those bars that might as well be Tibetan you know Sanskrit I don't know what it is so when I see someone perform music when I'm in awe it's like to me it's a beautiful wonderful experience do you feel the same way about comedy because you don't do comedy do you watch comedy and just get a free sense of enjoyment that you might not get from watching something you actually I generally enjoy more scripted like a film comedy when I see a group of guys who have figured out not a formula but there's just a there's a rhythm to their comedy and they've actually created a character behind you know that actor brings something to the table that you want to look at and then their timing in this scenario where it's clearly they're just play-acting it's like hey we're just playing dress-up pretend and you still laugh because the writing solid but the what they bring to the table with the writing is solid so like you know when you're seeing things like the movies Super Troopers it's just like those guys had to have a lot of fun making that film because everything was just like the writing was perfect it's a quotable film it's like every step of the way it's that every every scene is quotable and they're just having fun and then you see you know almost almost any Will Ferrell those guys just yeah john c reilly is like just a master he's bringing his thing to the table and then making your script come alive it's just a great that to me he's like and i and i look at that and i go what the fuck did you do that i have no idea how they did and I have no idea how to be funny just so I'm watching them just like nail these things out of the park like you could put all that script on the paper and show it to me I would just go which I don't have where do I start like you know how is this funny one of my favorite all-time comedians is Mitch Hedberg and one of the reasons why mitch is one of my favorites is cuz none of his stuff was funny on paper it didn't make any sense like you would see he goes you know somebody asked me do I want a frozen banana I said no but I want a regular banana later so yes no now if you saw that on paper he'd be like why is that not funny the fuck is I might have butchered his joke I don't know that's great thing it was pretty close but I love that I love that he redefined comedy in a certain way too because he made some first of all I was a heroin addict and he had only clean comedy I mean his stuff was squeaky clean meanwhile he was gangrene in his leg because he was fucking shooting the same vein too many times it was really a strange guy and his material was also odd and if you loved Mitch Hedberg it was awesome but like Mitch Hedberg would go on after these guys that would like sing and dance and do song parodies and you know they would close with a rap and he would eat
