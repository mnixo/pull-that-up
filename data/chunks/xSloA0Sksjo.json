hello freak bitches well what's interesting too is that there's all these different approaches to strength and conditioning and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you because one of the things that I had seen was Matt working out with you and your guys and he was doing all kinds of crazy stuff like when you devise a plan like for an athlete like a matte brown or someone like that like what do you do you work with them first to try to figure out what they're capable of and then think about like what their style is like obviously you gonna have a different different need if you're a striker versus a grappler well one thing we do we try to get more air conditioned to do five minute rounds and recover in one minute when I worked everything was five minutes and then it recovery some guys I'd run through eight eight rounds a lot of guys who was able to do that I mean pretty good fighters you know 13 13 wins and you know pro fights stuff like that so just were there recovery uh I want to maximize the amount of work you can do in five minutes and then be able to cover in one minute and do it again repeatedly that's all I ever did working 5-minute intervals so did you work with guys who use heart rate monitors and like how did you decide what to have them done any of that really never know my friend of John Saylor he's got Shinnecock jujitsu he's basically started almost really the first MMA school in America if you think about because he was judo jujitsu samba but also striking and he started in 1985 oh wow and he does everything by heart rate where we do think my percentages like I said we trade by a rates of velocity speech strength to be attracted 75 to 85% he would do heart rates like that and like if you and I would grapple if we could talk to each other for a half hour to be optimal you know me and you could talk while we're doing it doesn't hop that my heart rate there that way so he kept track of heart rates cut basically how we do a percentage of one rep max so meaning that it's optimal if you could still talk while you're doing the exercise rate optimally you know you're not right like you know that's how I would be you know so but if you're gonna fight like if you're in a fight and it's a very high paced fight it's very likely that you're gonna achieve much higher rates of heart rate might be much more exhausted that's right but see that would be up too much how we train our speed days I kept too today for squatting and everything is out the mud they do 25 squats at one way and to end for speed strength acceleration in two and 20 deadlifts and then the other days max effort and that's what you're talking about what you go all out and around so much pushing it you know they're trying to take you out so you got to fight back so uh it would see it always changes you can't do the same thing it's called law of accommodation few night if you and I grappled at the same rate all the time I would actually catch up to you you know so you'd have to be able to you know maximize your potential and run me in the dirt so that's why you gotta have two different days you know you can't just do the same type of work all the time I think that's where a lot of puns go wrong they get where they pace yourself too much you see that before fighters you're the old fighters cover up and I you know I watch fights all my life from Roberto Duran that Muhammad Allah I watched a month I'm sure you've got to be a big fight fan and you just see how some people get in a scheduled amount of work per round and that's when you can beat them take them out yeah in other words you know I'm gonna make you go up my pace not you go might be yeah I'm gonna follow your pace you'll make you build mine so varying the intensity of the training varying how you do your training you think that's very important very important has to change all the time so does it have to change all the time because the body just adapts and gets a fish in try that's what the law of accommodation is you adapt to a training load or stimulus and if you don't change this you get no better you actually go backwards so you can actually got to change these stimulus time does a lot of stuff with war barrels we push war bells around for half a mile running sometimes heavier weight walking get in a belt squat all is very grueling and then just a maximal strength which the simple things like get those good mornings we do a lot of stuff holding the bars in their elbows tom has to do a lot of that because almost like you know grappling mm-hm fumbling and then other times you know you got to do quick stuff so quicker page stuff so you know it does how fights are there never one pace now how do you like create a schedule like say if you're working with a guy and you you know we don't believe in schedule don't believe in it now even my guys I had the strongest gym in the world spoke about 140 all-time world records at breakfast and Tom can verify at breakfast in the morning at six o'clock 6:30 we decide what we're going to do that day because he strengths measured in time it's not measured in weight it's mentioned in time arrow talked about velocities and so we just pick an exercise like for you if we did a real no Bach squat then it takes longer than squatting 800 pounds you're gonna squat 800 pounds you you know you choked me out you can't after a while I'm going to tap alright or if we run after a while I'm gonna run out oxygen I'm going to quit say thank for strengthing nice change so long so long as you strain at least that length of time or longer you're going to break it a classical lift and swap internet with
