max don't fucking crash nearly as much this wasn't a Mac problem is a Firefox problem everything else on the computer worked fine that's why I was able to reboot faggot listen stop worrying about Mac versus PC it's just a goddamn operating system it's like the Republicans versus the Democrats most of the people on one side or the other are just on a fucking team and their simple little brains are stuck on that team they might not even agree with half a shit the Republicans say but they support them and even say well we gotta support our team you know I don't agree what they're doing right now but what's important is we support them and we know push for and you would get a public in office in 2012 blue they're just the Washington Redskins versus the fucking Miami Dolphins that's all that shit is its teams it's just like Boston versus Philly Philly sucks Boston rules that's the same moronic bullshit all right there there is no fucking Philly there is no Boston it's nonsense you're a dummy shut the fuck up all right how dare you where was I anyway did you have to let that fighter course I did faggot it's not on there how dare you oh I swear to God I pressed on yeah they all say same word that they how quick it is though oh so beautiful they just told me that they're upgrading my downloads needed like 30 Meg's oh my geez looks like thanks I don't even have 20 I have like I think 16 or 18 18 inside last time it's at 18 that's a picture of David Lee Roth to do that's an extreme motherfucker that's hilarious this is what caused all the fucking trouble ladies and gentlemen a goddamn picture of me and David Lee Roth but it was just to prove that Bryan has been making this crazy buffets for years because this picture David Lee Roth was like was owing from in 2005 three or four years ago before we got banned from the comedy or dinosaur thing yeah because it was at the comic store right so that's 2006 maybe that's right before he got together with back together a fan halen before their name yeah they were going to get back together he was telling us about it yeah uh yeah all right I just put it on my little Twitter um and then you see Brian in the background making that crazy face he did that your bullshit fucking hundreds of thousands of times that was a long Odyssey just to get one picture but that really wasn't worth it epic fail indeed indeed and we always talk about that and O'Keefe and that fella tryout chatroulette you know what I would think about doing that but I don't want to see any dudes cocks randomly I I did I tried it out but I found this this is kind of somebody already did this before but I found this a big black chick and I put her on loop and then I don't did it justice in recorded the screen and stuff but it was like maybe 90% cocks yeah as I get it is not a funny I don't I mean it's really sad that there's so many creepy people out there I'm all well you know what it's dues that want to show their dicks at work and they just never get the opportunity but they get it home and they're wearing a fucking wrestling mask and they go crazy and Politico and this is suppression man it's like Catholic school girls remember Catholic school girls when you were a kid there was the biggest sluts right yeah yeah why because they never seen a dick they're they're whisked away to some fucking magical place where only girls exist they have all girl teachers and shit and they're told that dicks are evil and they just can't wait to suck one they can't wait those bitches can't wait they can't wait to get up ticking oh I just want to do that forbidden thing you know can't suppress human beings man I like to do it with maybe like a five-year-old girl on Luke just sitting there going like this you know like that and see if give me of these guys with that day except they might put it away or if they signaled they were fucking love it okay but we can record them put him on YouTube mmm that's not about that's if we get a fake loop just girls this little kid to sing they're going like like she's looking at the monitor and see if the guy like immediately disconnects or if he sits there and next a couple seconds so today well how does it work do they pull their dicks out immediately soon as you log yeah what what is it's right it just automatically puts you in with a room with another person both on webcam and absolute do they have the dick out instant went when I about doing what I was doing it was just guys stroke so right when you went in there you're like okay so that's what you should do you should we should get a video of like a five or six year old girl just freaking the fuck out from the beginning right so it only work on the guys that order beaten off right cuz otherwise we'd have to time it like you know tired like normally and then going oh my god yeah yeah yeah and have her scream call please call please we didn't have to did we just had to cook or you know that kind of odd al better even better to call it is freak this motherfucker out yeah because they can catch you the freaky weird dudes are mostly straight gay get sex all the time we are less repressed Yeah right shut the fuck up let me tell you something everyone's fucked up don't you tell me that gays are less repressed of course you more repressed Society represses gay sex gays are just as fucked up as religion reply repressing straight sex and a lot of gays grew up and religious households too and that makes them extra fucked up it's not like a coincidence that gay people do so much crystal meth and there's so many gay people that love to party and their lives become a wreck and a fucking towards their immune system gay people there's a lot of crazy fucking gay people and not repressed doesn't always mean that you're not fucked up I mean how about bugchasers how about gay dudes that are purposely trying to get AIDS you know that gay dudes who purposely try to get HIV they want to get it they think there's something hot about it and so they go and have unprotected sex on purpose hoping to get HIV that's fucked up you know you can't say that gay people are less fucked up sexually than straight people everyone's fucked humans across the board universally are fucked up it's just way too difficult to come out and have your shit together I mean how many people really ever said together if you had a guess the numbers what anyone really has there no but I mean have your shit together to a point where you know like oh he's not doing anything self-destructive he's being productive and positive it's like maybe one out of a hundred man maybe out of the people that you meet one out of 100 the other 99 you know half nuts partially knots you're nuts I'm not to bulk nuts you know I mean how many be I mean even the Dalai Lama's fucking nuts you know the Dalai Lama said he called he said that oral and anal sex were free ended I forget the exact word turns he used sexual deviations or something like that but he was saying well I forget the term that the Dalai Lama used but basically was saying that oral sex is really bad it's terrible for you do it like you should need pussy girls love it it feels good and I like doing it right you like doing here we've talked about that but there's actually there's actually science now saying that it can cause cancer in the person that's eating out the girl now or something like that what are you fucking member we talked about this once we talked to science no we never talked about any pussy yeah we made a video we made a video about it where I talk about eating pussy and we were talking about it in that video but we didn't say any pussy gives it yeah it was something that came out they were talking about how you like the cool lock out of it like a slug I know that's how we started over that mm-hmm I don't remember eating pussy gives you cancer dude I think you might have just made that up no oral sex please Twitterverse tell me sweet Jesus please please please tell me that you don't forget there was some kind of study that I'm eating put oral sex increases throat cancer wrists cereal scientists say no that's for girls because dudes who have fucking dick words shove their dick in the girl's mouth and the girl's mouth gets infected like if you have the human papilloma but that goes both ways um girls and guys can both get the HPV virus from eating pussy yeah at the fc-1 works for chicks because you're mixing up with fucking blood in there you know you might get a clock back there in the corner that gets inside to open sorna mouth never does sort of make sense you know girl sex can cause throat cancer March 9th 2007 it kind of sucks huh cuz that's my favorite thing to do so I've moved on to ass just fuck son what's wrong

you charging she's like for you I'll you know I'll do it for free or something like that because you'll be my first person to ever do it so I'm like thinking free tattoo that's awesome so I went there it took her eight hours or something ridiculous to do this tattoo and it originally was supposed to be an Egyptian turtle with my name in Chinese or the letter R in Chinese in the middle of the turtle in Chinese it was some stupid I was really stoned or whatever and it hurts so bad she did nothing but scar me so I have tons of like scar tissue and it's like the gayest looking tattoo looks like

ever because when I was in high school a friend Jimmy his cousin Oh selling coke shit even said my friend who let you fucking guess but uh he was selling it and when he was doing that he lost all this weight and he fucking he would like hide in the basement or in the attic rather and just they would do coke and watch TV and him and his girlfriend were just zombies and I saw his whole life fall apart like I watched it happen and I never liked saying that fucking stops bad for you I just remember nothing but bad things from high school and and you know right after high school of people and just like I just was very obvious to me the coke is like the worst thing you could do charity nitrous no oh like from whippets yeah I did it once once when I worked at a ice cream place I didn't like it give me a headache we used to go I've done MDMA so guy asked me if I don't I did ecstasy once only one time and it was awesome but the next day was so bad the next day I was so stupid my brain was like it felt like a sponge that had been just wrung out dry and then just left in the Sun you know and then you try to like clean something with it it was just like it was so my brain was so dumb I just I I was feeling so bad the next day I was like this cannot be good for you it's gotta be fucking terrible for you who knows what it was in it though it might not have just been MDMA pure MDMA it might have been like they say that people cut it with speed and shit like that you know but anyway yeah I couldn't read the next day that guy green REM show gallery REM shoe gallery yeah I couldn't read the next day man literally I was sitting in a Starbucks and I was trying to read a magazine and I was like I can't even fucking concentrate on this I could I literally couldn't focus that was it was bad I know it was a fucking great time though that night I can understand why people do it and I guess if you're not a big reader you don't mind feeling stupid the next day wouldn't be a problem but for me man I've talked to people say there's no the next day they feel fine it just depends how much like strychnine Xin it and stuff like that you ever candy flipped where it's a piece of candy and has ecstasy on one side and sit on the other side I've heard that's crazy though it's a great combo yeah yeah but I heard it's like when you combine things like that the recovery times just accelerated having more how long do it nowadays ah so what else what's the best weed the would the best weed is the we that you got bitch you know if you don't have the options see the beautiful thing about California is this um there that guy's fuckin grant poet that guy man that's the perfect style your style yeah I could totally see that guy doing it Adam Hawthorne um I think the thing that's cool about California is the fact that you get to go these places and experiment with all these different strains what Joe Diaz mixes it up every day thanks if that's a food that should was that right there Joey Diaz thinks that she looks like Joey Diaz thinks they should makes you weed up every day we're on guru tattooed calm GU are you tattoo um Joey says that if you smoke the same weed every day get used to it but if you mix up strains every day that every day is like boom boom so Joey buys like a little bit of weed every day it's like a ritual smoke weed every day you get used to it I mean I have to take good three days off nowadays but you always make sure you every day I try not Joey smokes weed every day Joe ain't taking no days off yeah you know when you go we're on the road and like would pass by Joey's hotel room like we're all staying in the same hotel when you go to get Joey his room stinks of weed I mean fucking stinks everyday it stinks a weed he always knows the right guy in every town get him weed you know and he always gets it Joey's an everyday weed guy I don't I don't smoke weed every day I like to take days off I think it uh it's better man I don't like that I don't like being completely obliterated every day I don't think that's just healthy you know alright let's go to questions on the message board oh you're Charlotte North Carolina D changed the change or then you changed it did what is it now it's EMU Southland hmm a most South End okay whatever they were there for a UFC so the way it always works is whenever I'm in town for a UFC I always do a gig the day before so let's go to the message board I did a gig and Sydney had a great fucking time Australian people are the shit that show was fun man but the show was could could have been better because I got too drunk the night before oh we got too drunk my brain was first of all I was fucked up because I could not sleep because you're 19 hours ahead when you go to Australia so your body doesn't know what time it was I'd be exhausted I go to sleep three hours later I wake up and I didn't know what I thought I was taking a nap like my body had no idea I could not sleep for like eight hours of session I couldn't do it so it's sleep like three hours get up I try to read a beat off I try to go back to sleep again I'd sleep for another hour and I wake up again like it was so confusing that but um Friday night when we got there it was uh me and Eddie and Tom Segar Tom Segura me and Eddie and Tom cigar we went to a bar and got fucking bullets creak we just pulled up to the bar we set up shop like right right by the bar at this club and just start buying people drinks just went nutty I must have bought a hundred fucking drinks right just pointing drinks cheaper or marks I don't dollarz all the same it's very close dollars like it's like 92 to our dollar consorted 92 cents or might be the other project arson much worth and I need to say yeah I'm not sure which one but uh people were so see any kangaroos anywhere yeah we did the zoo I'll be depressed depressed kangaroos just laying around like this like motherfucker that's what we're talking about earlier more talking about the red killer whale ok people yeah just uh zoos bum me the fuck out man I would like to see a kangaroo in the wild but they're dangerous they'll fuck you up was there anything Australia that was just completely insane like their bathrooms have weird little lights and it's like you know how you grow up we talking about this me and Eddie and Tom about how you know when you grow up you're taught that everything sucks except America right all this talk and all this and Australia is the shit yeah I mean it's beautiful it's clean really nice houses everywhere the restaurants were great the people were friendly you know the economy is not completely fucked you're driving on the left side of the road which is weird but other than that you use that what's the difference you know it's this way you used to but other than that it's fucking phenomenal I mean other than that what a great country man I mean it's amazing and comics like my friend Eddie IFFT he's huge over there huge that sells out all over the place does TV shows people come to see him that he told me they write about him in the paper when he's at a bar but in America I can't can't fucking get traction for whatever reason orange blossom UFC that was great yes Marge Barker's gigantic in Australia fucking monstrous he sold out someplace supposedly it was like a 1500 seat place sold it out something like 20-something nights in a row I mean it's just craziness they love American comedians over there so the show was fucking fantastic I had a great time a few people walked out but that's gonna happen man if you don't know what you're getting into you know I was trying to tell people that if there was a big sign in the front of the show that said warning this show will contain language and material as extreme as you could possibly imagine but apparently some of the shit I said people couldn't imagine so they didn't know what to expect but sorry you bummed out but 99% of people had a great fucking time but yeah I was pretty wild crazy show but also it was because we were hammered that night too so two nights in a row we got barbecued so I was planning on going to Australia and doing all this writing but alcohol just sticks a fork and all those plans you know you said that when you flew to Australia it's like 17 hours was the flight really did it really feel like 17 hours was at the point where you were just like fuck this I need to jump off this plane this is too much for them now no I wasn't that bad you know you just cats are fighting you know you just you've read to watch a fucking movie get on your laptop I was you know going over some material on the way over there the real problem was once I got there I thought I was gonna write but it was just so it was all get drunk recover from the drunk trick a lot of water could track again recover you had like like small little bedrooms almost on the plane right I was dope we flew first class on Qantas and that some think it's called the a310 or something like that giant ass fucking plane and they're huge man they're like it's like a little apartment man where's the quiz like coach like like I don't know close our doors I will be Tonto oh jesus fucking coach my business class pretty dope business class is just as good as first class Wow pretty close to it but coach fuck you they said I don't tax yeah I've been like hey let me hang out in your bedroom I can't imagine flying 16 hours from one of these ass chairs just Jim that's a wrap you lay on one side and Kevin Smith on the other but after they ran a marathon I can't believe this someone has picked Kevin Smith off it's like how dumb are you it's do you not know who I guess a lot of people don't know who he is with like the way he looks like they don't know that that's all that's that famous director you might want to shut the fuck up that guy's on Twitter all day every day he probably ruined Southwest that cost them money for sure don't you think well pardon me think so but then the other part of me is like they just got so much attention you know interesting specially if you hate fat people you'd be like fuck yeah I'm going to Southwest so they lost the fat dollar I bet there's a lot of fat people got bummed out how does Ralphie May fly Southwest because he's usually you know how much money that probably saved him all these pissed off fat people aren't flying Southwest now just save them there's already studies that they were thinking this is ridiculous if they were thinking about making you take a shit before you flew because they found out that if they made everyone go to the bathroom before they got on the airplane that they would say so many dollars per year like this was a real study that they were going this yourself wasn't this wasn't Southwest this was American Airlines or someone mad so can you imagine now that they have all these fat people pissed off but we're not gonna fly Southwest it's probably they're probably earning five million dollars a year okay how much it cost them more to fly like fuel wise to Australia for a fat guy than for like a small oh I'm sure that it's it's big enough times a hundred then that then you would imagine my god yeah huh yeah it kind of makes sense maybe maybe Southwest paid Kevin Smith amazes all just to save them a million a couple million a year did I really take the happy everybody has integrity I met him he was cool he wouldn't do it yeah he is really cool he's a very nice guy yeah I met him when I came into decay rock once krq in LA very fun radio yeah the last of the terrestrial radio stations in LA fucking radio in LA is vanished I wanted to do radio for a long time I was thinking about doing it you know I was thinking how what a cool thing that would be like we have some interesting conversations you take callers talk to people online shit you know but it just died when they had that 97.1 you know fm talk I was like how cool would that be let's get it let's get a fucking radio gig you know let's do we were gonna do it in Denver yeah back yeah I was thinking about doing it in Denver I was thinking when are you going back to Denver people keep on asking me down well does UFC in March but on March I haven't gotten a venue to do stand-up at so I might just go back and no no no stand up just have fun just do the UFC I want to go back and check

black person they're like what the fuck why is he that color what's going on in dogs see color maybe they just see darkness no dogs see in black and white maybe you think it's a deal with a mascot okay let's gentlemen let's go to these recordings News question Conan O'Brien has a new look over the beard yeah you know what he's got 35 million in the bank now which is just kicking it you know today I interviewed a squirrel in my backyard and then through to commercial somebody help me it's pretty Konya Brian now has a Twitter by the way it's coming up right I love the whole Conan story it just shows you how retarded networks are you know and first of all they should never change shit you know what they should have died I appreciate the Jimmy Fallon people enjoy Jimmy Fallon show but you know what put that on after Conan O'Brien you know go back to the way you had it don't be stupid you want to go Jay Leno tonight show while you want to go middle America throw softballs and not offend anybody and then keep the Conan O'Brien show where it was because what Conan's on he can do you know all that craziness the fucking insult dog masturbating but he do it late at night because you're allowed to do more crazy shit late at night you know what's-his-face remember when we were talking enormous Donald outside the ice house he had the best point Norma Donald goes he goes well I could never doesn't make what time he's on anyway nobody watches it you watch it on your fuckin DVR yeah yeah you see it on YouTube who cares Rihanna 11:30 or 12:00 thirty twelve varies betters you can get away with more shit he was totally right I like how he's saying all this but yet his phone was from 1982 so I was like you know I have a Lube acted he had a phone at all when I when I ran into him I rented it all McDonald once when I was doing some Canadian gigs like a couple of years ago and when I ran into him he didn't have a cell phone I had to call his home phone that's right I've never fucking cell phone I didn't have one because I had a lot of people that just be able to get in touch with me that's how that sounds right fuck off disappear nothing to do he's hilarious man he's a Norma Connell the hosted a talk show would be the shit yeah that would be I would I would tune into that talk-show because he wouldn't let people get away with anything you know he's nuts you know he's a loose dude he's wild he would be a good couch guy for like Conan because have you ever seen him on the couch with like I forget who it was the whole time he was like cracking Joe that was awesome yeah he's would be a good like there's good side guy yeah and you know I have like a straight guy and then he gets the side guy yeah what is my take on the weed stores in LA getting raided fucking sucks you know the whole thing makes me makes me sick you know the whole thing is so so strange man it's so strange that they're still fucking with people apparently the way the law is presented though in California and I'm not sure this is that they believe that the way the law is presented is that you can give weed away and you can sell it as long as you're not making a profit and that these collectives are supposed to be to provide medical patients with marijuana but apparently there's people out there that are flaunting the wealth and they're making a fuckload of money off of it millions and millions of dollars off selling weed now if that's the case there's two parts of me one part of me that says well you know what fuck you they should be able to sell it you know you guys are douchebags but another part of me says hmm maybe be better maybe would be really in the spirit of weed if it was free maybe you really would be in the spirit of weed that it isn't there isn't for profit you know people well then maybe these stores couldn't exist and they couldn't sell it yeah but wheats not that hard to grow man people would still grow and sell weed and you know people sell it illegally I mean there would be plenty of people that would you know if you want good weed you got to cock this guy and it's expensive but I kind of like the idea of it not being for profit there's something about it that bugs me that people are overcharging for this plant just because it's illegally it mean it's fucking some place is super expensive you know five six hundred dollars an ounce for like really powerful potent weed you know which I understand the guys get paid for his growing and this and then I totally respect that you should be able to make a certain amount of money for it but if it was legal it would be way fucking cheaper than it is right now the reality is the reason why it's expensive at all the reason why these guys can make millions of dollars in profit off of selling weed is only because it's illegal and difficult to get you have to get it from these places if marijuana was legally you could grow your own which is how it should be you would have no need to buy it you could have a little fucking plant your backyard or pretty much like that but it's not this guy got fucking arrested it's not this guy just got arrested this guy just got arrested with twenty four different counts and he's they're going to charge him and the way it works apparently is what Obama has says that they're not going to charge people who were only violating federal law federally it's illegal they're going to go after people who are going to violate both federal and state laws so you have to follow the state law to the letter and they're making an example it was one dude apparently well I mean if you go and get a license you're allowed to grow at seven plans or something like that yeah you're allowed to grow a lot you're allowed to have like a half a pound of weed yeah you could go and get the other license that you can do up to like twenty-one plans yes I got that yeah yeah they're crazy hey they asked me if I needed exemption I said what what's in the exemption for he goes well you know the regular amount of weed is not enough oh yes the regular amount is not enough honey so you could pretty much anyone anyone can get that even even kids could probably get this shit but if they can get that license so if you just grow within your amount you could pretty much do that now and even if the cops came over your round right but there could be people that don't have the room to grow and then you know they don't want to be hassled and they want to be able to go out and purchase it at a reasonable rate and I agree there's there's a reasonable rate but right now the rate is so high that marijuana is worth more than gold marijuana is worth worth more per pound than gold is that seems a little crazy you know I mean it's definitely inflated because of the fact that there's no competition because of the fact that it's illegal and it's a fucking plant it should be legal everybody should be able to grow it if it was legal there would be nobody making millions and millions of dollars off it real problem is it would fuck the economy up because pharmaceutical companies would just fucking nosedive there'd be so many different pharmaceutical products that would be there would be useless do it I you know I believe that to a point but right now I have we whenever I want have wheat but I still have tums for my stomach I still have aspirin for headaches you know they didn't replace any of them right and I don't have fucking glaucoma dude you know yeah you have there's a lot of different medications for a DD right there's a lot those are the billion dollar medicines it's not Tom's bro but you know why prescription for most of these people that are saying it's the best drug for glaucoma and stuff are just hippies wanting weed to be legal good if you if you look at the medication for like glaucoma in comparison I bet you it's better Lou it's not you know marijuana is the best for inter ocular pressure I believe that it's what's called when when glaucoma apparently is very painful for people and marijuana apparently is the best at relieving that it's the best restoring people's appetite when they have chemotherapy that's what cancer patients like it it's the best at it's the best at a lot of different things dude there's people that have had kids that have autism there's a video that we showed and we primary that clip yeah the kid had autism and it was the only thing that calm the kid down made him normal was weed you know it's great for a lot of different things and all those different things are prescription drugs that are worth fucking billions of dollars every year to pharmaceutical companies which is why they lobby against recreational drugs so-called recreational drugs it's just why to this day partnership for a drug-free America to this day gets money from pharmaceutical companies they got money from alcohol companies and tobacco companies millions of millions of dollars in the past and because of that there was a lot of criticism so they no longer get money from alcohol and tobacco companies but they still get money from fucking pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical companies are responsible for oxycodone vicodin percocet all that shit I still don't think it's going to be like if they made it legal like all the companies are going to go out of business I know my mom's not going to be smoking weed she's going to like no I'll take the other thing if some people would be dumb enough for a few generations yeah it would be Domino there's people that we just doesn't work with and that's like--that's percent sixty percent is never going to change for the things that we've talked about it's not fifty or sixty percent bull weed is a real effective medicine for a bunch of different things yeah the more important may be great for textiles it would be great for it you can eat it you can I mean it has all the essential fatty acids and the seeds you know amino acids there's a lot of different fucking things that marijuana is good for besides just just getting you high right it's incredible that it's illegal it's really mind-blowing that it's illegal but in 2010 with the access to information that we have today the fact that it's still illegal that's fucking insane man as you stream laggy yeah you streams always lagging man anything on the internet slabby nothing works perfect this fucking the Internet is in a it's in a stage right now it's not done yet the IRS plane crash a guy having a hangar Calliste by member of Homeland Security and having ties to intelligence agencies is that true well I know that he stole that plane so I don't know it wasn't his plane if that's what you're talking about oh really you know what I'm all for that guy because what you're offered I got a crash is building his plane in anyway diyanet yes okay King Ari I'm sorry I gotta dive bye fuck the IRS Wow I'm still dealing with that bullshit they're like fucking bullets okay this a bit bad bad Bobby's telling me the gold is $1100 an ounce in British Columbia and the best weed is three thousand two hundred dollars a pound it ain't more than gold it's going for less than seventeen thousand dollars a pound here in the US I stand corrected thank you very much sir sounds better the way I said it was more than gold yeah I know what's worth more than gold cash hash is worth more than gold isn't it damn hash is expensive as fuck how much is a pound of hash go for more than a half high-bypass not to have a fucking punch a hole through to another dimension imagine you smoked a pound of hash hash they make out a weed somewhere another and the rising to do it sir resin the resin how do they do it though do you know how they make it I don't sort of a complicated process but I've had it before and it's very it's a strange hi it's it's very very miss very strong I went to opium again okay ah you did opium okay it's not much different than ash really yeah it looks if I there's no like a little like okey so now heroin no no it's like it looks like a piece of soap it smokes like we're it smokes smokes like hash and it it smells like a hippie like Patrol II it smells like patchouli when it burns real yeah it's kind of like I don't know like a hash kind of feeling hmm I'm scared man yeah the the gold thing I didn't really research that very well it was something else sorry I said that incorrectly there's something else that that marijuana was more expensive than per ounce it was oil does that make sense worth more than oil worth more than something that's worth a lot oh let's go with some other questions here Dan with the Ustream powerful Ustream opium smells like flowers and is super addictive from the poppy damn faggot are you doing something super addictive Bryan's are inaudible cigarettes not addictive Brian's cat had a hangnail and that got him to start smoking again they could know it was eight I got audited by the IRS well that was your cat got a hangnail yeah now Latin who is my cat had a fucked up foot cat out of luck to me whoops is gather a fucked up foot like a good dude cigarettes other words because cigarettes out of nowhere you'll be like dude I need a cigarette I need a cigarette it's one of those things once you do it it opens up a door that's always going to be open and it's weird cigarettes Lou this guy did you know you can activate your pineal by saying the word love at a certain frequency shut up shut the fungi it's like that shut up if the numerator is song has a high enough pitch to open up your garage doors no it does people love to see stupid yes do people love fucking magic they love magic and nonsense you know they love to think that there is like something like that there's real magic your real magic eat a pound of mushrooms what is a magic instead of having a 16-ounce steak have 16 ounces of mushrooms motherfucker oh that's magic you know yeah you'll magically be retarded for the rest of your life you'll probably be communicating with aliens permanently you'll probably be locked into another dimension you know huh tell Jerry Garcia smoking opium wasn't addicted addictive he moved to smoking black tar heroin after that well it's for sure dig least have opium dens back in the Wild West don't remember but I never once did open the next day thought about oh my god I need it you know who's never liked that cocaine was kind of like that but for me but I hope it never was like that that was more of like a treat like a dessert well you know there's that's a good good argument because this argument was on the message board as well people were talking about things being addictive and hid the problem was even alcohol being addictive is that it's not addictive to everybody you know I'm not addicted to alcohol I could I could not have a drink every day for the rest of my life and I'd have no problem with that right but I like to have a drink sometimes and go on stage I like to have a drink sometimes my buddies just to make things fun just makes you crazy you pay for it the next day especially our age yeah yeah man you get older do you pay for it more but the bottom line is it's not addictive like I don't hurt when I don't have it but for some people it is yeah some people have to have a drunk dude when I was doing construction when I was a kid there was a dude who had a mountain Dew bottle and he would fill it up with fucking beer like cheap beer like Pope 45 and he would drink beer all day while we worked all day this guy was he was shaky jonesing dude he would show up for work though he was there every fucking day 7:00 in the morning swinging that hammer you know he was there pissing every five minutes guy was always hammered though he was drinking beer all day for that dude though I think it's like everybody's get their own biochemical make up it's like you're addicted to cigarettes but like Tom Segura Tom Segura smoked cigarettes when he drinks but doesn't smoke other times and he can go years without cigarettes no problem but when he drinks he likes to have a cigarette when was last me when a year with no problem well he said let's take it a long time off he's taking time off a bunch of times and he won't smoke for months and then I'll have a cigarette he'll have a cigarette when he drinks I definitely think cigarettes is like that one thing that even if you quit smoking it could be three years later and I don't know where you'll start smoking again no reason why no you said that it so is re so I I think you know I think they're doing something member that movie the insider with Russell Crowe you see that movie yeah it's all about like all the shit that they do to cigarettes to make it even more addictive like hundreds of difference of additives right hundreds of different additives just to make it more addictive and I totally believe that's true totally 100% believe that's true and if that's the case man I mean who the fuck knows I mean they say that cigarettes are more it's not as dangerous as heroin cuz heroin will kill you quicker and you can overdose from it but cigarettes will get you hooked quicker than anything yeah apparently if you if you have that thing inside you that gets you hooked to shit like what I don't but I cigarettes two totally different Charlie's totally does he only with cocaine till you said well I almost cuz I was selling it and getting a large amounts of it for free you were allegedly allegedly selling not really selling not really just for fitness just like this is like a character that would buy a large amount so he could give it away and he'll have some extra for free was Peter Pan of no not Peter Pan Robin Hood of coke it was like one month of my life back in 94 in this fictional story and it sticks in a story but anyways you but if you were rich okay what if you will I was a rich he's not rich what if you like jay-z baller you know private jet rich and you could just get pure cocaine shipped right over here from the CIA the CIA would drop it off on your doorstep well I think I might rival bucket of cocaine I think the only reason it was kind of addictive to me because I'm one of those people that never go to the doctors and I probably need to be one of those people that are on speed or something because I like having a fire I like having a fire word condition most of my my day is spent like moping around energy and stuff like that but uh when cocaine I felt like I was a why for the first time but go ahead and I think that's what was addictive more just like I felt like I was out of some kind of coma well sometimes yeah well sometimes I'm having like a normal day like I'm not really into anything and I'll have a cup of coffee and god I just get fucking fired up I write great yeah I feel good about life right fucking feels like a warm Sun feels better I want to clean my office now you get a little fired up from stimulants you know that's what they're there for yeah yeah cook it I don't know what cocaine's like but I know that I've had never stopped talking ever you talk about this anymore okay you would be talking so fast your jaw I often hit somebody in the face I have this thing called mata de coca and it's a it's a tea that's made out of yes I'm talking about self and our Robin here matee de coco is a tea that's made out of coca leaves so it's like cocaine the plant that they make cocaine from but it's the unprocessed form which is it's actually like indigenous people chew that I think it's in Peru they said it's like really common isn't it Peru he doesn't know he's outside smoking cirrage talked about myself um they they chew this leaf and some for especially people that uh are at high altitude like high altitude hurting communities they they eat this uh they chew this tea this tea leaf but I had it in a tea form and when I had it it was not good for me I couldn't shut the fuck up me and Doug Stanhope we're doing shrooms it was the day the Iraq war started and we were in the middle of the desert at my friend Yuans house and it's pretty crazy because we were shrewd and right when the shrooms were kicking in we noticed on the television set that they were saying that the war coverage begins at 5:00 and Stanhope looked at man he goes there's a fucking kickoff for the war I mean that's really what it was like they were telling us when the war coverage was going to start tune in at 5:00 or war coverage it was like a kickoff it was like that's when the program the war program was going to start and that's when this guy yawn my yawn who's like he's done more psychedelics than anyone I've ever met ever he's definitely probably fried his brain he's got a cool podcast oh but he was talking about hey take this Matta to Coco it'll help the mushrooms kick in quicker maybe it did but I could not shut the fuck up and I was telling Doug while I was doing it was like I can't shut the fuck up this is driving me crazy and he was laughing uncontrollably because he thought it was hilarious that I was talking about how I couldn't shut the fuck up yet aware of it and still talking it's the worst but you know what you would you would that's one of those drugs that thank God you never tried cuz you would freak out and love it because it makes your mind open up and just think so clear you're just non-stop thinking of new stuff to talk about well that's for me famous my friend Jimmy said that when we're kids we've had the cousin that was uh had the problem with it he told me not to do it he told you smells so bad dude that is so nasty cigarettes are so Flay are those but you kept on talking about him and daddy needs a taste Oh daddy needed it too you can't go two hours without he had a cigarette right when we started to buddy oh shut your fucking hole you had your fix had your goddamn fix um anyway Sarah it's bad inque going verba I'm good you know what though what's interesting in California I don't know this is in all states that they have changed cigarettes to go out by themselves now so you don't if you don't hit it long enough it will just go out because of the fires out here these are cigarette companies had to make something in a cigarette so if you don't hit it after a while it will go out by itself and just makes me what is that yeah it can't be good they're probably doing something like that man they've probably made it extra addictive along the way I know oh it's just well we can do that but unfortunately cause of psychotic episodes that make you fucking mortgage your house for extra cigarettes you might start hoarding cigarettes right you know they could figure out a way to put something in cigarettes that would make you completely insane and have this insane desire to collect cigarettes could you imagine that happening yeah like a lot of black dudes collect sneakers they have like you go into their house I got you MTV raps or MTV Cribs rather you know you go and they have like a whole room filled with sneak you're hiding your junk from somebody their junk was touch stored smell it's too big and they think they have a horse cock so they look at their shoes what is he talking about it's like it's you know what no no they're just for whatever reason they're into collecting shoes what if people just started collecting cigarettes like hoarding cigarettes like roomfuls of cigarettes and cigarette companies were like well you know we make a fantastic product we can't help it if people get excited about it they're just excited about a product we found out that they had added something to cigarettes that make people want to hoard cigarettes they would totally do it if some fucking scientist came up with a formula where he could have a certain amount of chemicals and if you put those in cigarettes the people smoke the cigarettes they would have this insatiable desire to collect cigarettes and buy way more than they need you don't think they would put that in a cigarette of course they would fuck yeah they would do it they don't give a fuck about you they sell shit that kills you they shit they don't it's not like they didn't know we didn't know cigarettes kill you holy shit we're gonna stop we're sorry no cigarettes killed 400 fucking million people every year and no cigarette companies have even thought about slowing down and no politicians have ever thought about banning them you never hear a peep out of politicians all those faggots want to talk about fucking banning pot and you know we've got to stop marijuana and illegal drugs meanwhile cigarettes are killing way more people than everything else combined cancer AIDS fucking heroin meth coke all that shit pull it all together with alcohol it can't put a fucking dent not a scratch into what cigarettes kill every year if they can figure out a way to make you want a hoard cigarettes for sure they would do it and the people hoarding it they would give testimonials I don't have a problem with it I enjoy my cigarette collection when I walk in the garage and I look at all my I like to smell I get out there and we know it's not like I'm smoking more I'm someone I say that today people kind of do that you're right they do do that with scars but cigars are totally different they liked like savor the taste and shit and it makes no sense different no different cigars of different flavors to these do they all taste like shit to me they all taste like you're sucking on a fucking I don't know tree or something I like them I like cigars I think they taste good really yeah when you have a fat steak and a glass of wine you get a nice Cuban cigar with a fucking good taste to it you know it's just like you take it in to get a good taste your mouth it's fun get you look gives you a buzz crazy then you don't like some listen I don't explicit inhale cigars you have to inhale it in your mouth okay do if you're gonna get high no I fed the science between getting high is that once it hits your mouth it's immediately in your stream you know is that true yeah they did a study word it showed like people that used to think where you're supposed to inhale it and hold it in as long as you can I guess suppose that you get 99% of the THC immediately when you when you suck it Twitterverse is this true because if this is true I will stop smoking weed from now on and I'll just put it in my mouth haha I'll just put them off take a deep breath and then blow it out I was thought that people were doing that were like Bill Klein was thought that Bill Clinton did not inhale but it's cuz he was crafty he didn't know that he know how C is he knows the flu is that real science it is science is that is that real science Twitterverse what the fuck is that true you don't let's keep our googling I love Google Google right now you do not have to inhale marijuana at high Oh marijuana to get high yeah I always thought you had to hold it in for the long thing - but wiki answers what if you do not inhale marijuana answer no it has to go in your lungs to get new high meaning you have to inhale to get high well I'm not going to listen this stupid fuck well because this stupid fuck spelled high here at two different times and then wrote have in capital letters not very scientific faggot next drops here's a truck do you have to inhale when smoking weed Yahoo Answers ah don't do it best answer chosen by asker you fucking dummy it's if the girl says ah don't do it but if you must know you have to keep the smoke in your lungs longer than you normally would a cigarette so you inhale it and then keep in there for as long as you can then exhale that's not true that's not true this dis donc on - uh don't do it why alyssa because you don't want to have fun why should he not smoke the pot because he doesn't want to be friendly because he doesn't want to be more sensitive cuz you want doesn't want to tune into the universe more didn't do it but you can't tell me not smoke pot because I'm a goddamn comedian and that's like telling a basketball player to not play with basketballs I can't find the answer for this shit yeah I forget where I read it I read it somewhere with anybody the same way a place I've read that gold is the same amount of weight I know now because I was on your side where that's bullshit and my girlfriend who's going in school for nursing she's like that's totally untrue and then she showed me all these studies I'm like oh okay it was a you have to in shit why don't we need to get high like I did let's say this guy shows you need to fully inhale it to get high take a big breath in see these are people like a TV team that is like you have to inhale leaving your lungs get higher won't do I think weed does not cause cancer okay this guy's got a cancer article when I'm talking about can't you fuck all right we have no correct answer ladies and gentlemen we tried we cannot find the answer to this Yahoo Answers are all written by 16 year olds or 40 year old retards one or the other this guy says he knows everything about cows more in seven seconds are these get Yahoo Answers yeah we looked at those guy answers man that doesn't mean shit it's something about your mouth it's filled with whatever that makes sense because you don't inhale a tobacco smoke when you smoke a cigar you get high as fuck you get really high from cigars it cigars give you like a serious nicotine rush like whoo that's a good one and if that's if that happens why wouldn't that happen with marijuana too you know you don't inhale the cigar smoke you take into your mouth and then you blow it out you don't take a deep hit of it like you do with cigarettes yeah that's a that's a tough google search I'll have to just actually find that yeah we don't know we don't know ladies and gentlemen it was a recent article that was about six months ago I read it some people weed is not for them that really is true you know like Stanhope doesn't like weed Stanhope a tweet which doesn't make any sense cuz he likes everything else but I think he probably got too high to get paranoid you guys I wonder if you get too high we will fucking rock your world man shit makes you really the last year see I was an I was tripping my ass off I almost had to run out I was thinking like okay I am just going to leave and go to my room and take a nap I was trying too hard from weed wow this is this rivalry says opium trivia the term are you hip comes from opium dens you would lay on your side on your hip and smoke hence the term are you hip that kind of makes sense because if you ever watch like those old western movies or dudes are doing heroin there or opium they are lying on their side yeah like what's that movie where Wyatt Earp was it Wyatt er one of those movies Buffalo Bill a rider thing was I don't remember who the fuck played him well remember what was the movie were a Doc Holliday fucking Dennis Quaid played Dennis Quaid played Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer played Doc Holliday the dopest Doc Holliday before Val Kilmer just ate everything that that existed Kilmer is all fat fucked up now he was like go back to Top Gun raise Tim's dumb tunes done that's it we go back to like Val Kilmer like the old days Val Kilmer's a handsome motherfucker you know ya know they're hanging out with Tom Sizemore you know this whole wheat thing we could just fucking next time we're sober we'll just try it okay Lea this guy's says read ban is right erowid here we go robberies comes comes clean ah here we go you do not read it to us okay here it is mouth smoking cannabis one of the primary health issues with cannabis is the effect of smoke of the lungs while the risks from long-term cannabis smoking are not fully understood is assumed by Moe before I do this I will tell I will take this copy mouth smoking is not as efficient as long smoking and requires approximately three times the material for the same level of effect but for some people efficiency is not an issue I would say it's not an issue you know cuz weeds not that expensive is you know I we were talking about how it's worth a lot of money because but it's not worth it's not that much I mean he said well um one marijuana joint is like what is it like ten dollars or something like that probably was it how much is a joint a joint ten dollars about tender that's not a California joint will fast for sure fuck you out of your mind joint even if you're you mean if you smoke a lot if you actually inhaled a full joint you would be blitzkrieg California weed California weed so if you take California weed and you mouth mouth fuck it right you could probably get by unlike is two hits of California weed from a joint and you're gone and one of the things that you could do also is if you inhale it and you breathe that out your nose so you you put it in your mouth and then you blow it out of your nose but you're not inhaling it if it even increases it all right well let's post this up online so everybody knows what the fuck were reading yeah but I used to I remember there's somebody I used to know that like smoke she would only smoke with me but she would sit I'm not going in Haley I'll smoke it with you that makes you feel better Mike ah okay so see if she would always get fucked up and I'm like wow she's not stoned but why is she acting so fucked up so I look back at it now she was gone okay I just put that shit up online hmm so you get Twitter that never so now we learn something nice gentlemen thanks Brian kill you rivalries rivalries you know a lot about drugs motherfucker this is the dude he runs the whole thing it says here he owns a pool in somewhere in Georgia forget worth from make them make them Georgia I believe but it's a pretty famous pool hall this guy owns it why they have that douche squad no no no it's a bunch of due to the douche quad you know some some members of my board break off into little separate sexes like little gangs in little cakes I don't know what they're doing have you never been to my message board I got the craziest message board I don't know how the fuck happened I don't know what caused it but I've had this nutty message board since like 1998 and right now there is more than two and a half million posts on it I'll put it up online start smoking when I was 15 Rae and anyway this message board there's so much fuckin nutty shit on that board that's how I met Bryan I met Bryan from the message board it's really got a life of its own I mean it's got my name attached to it and I pay for it and keep it running and you know but there's like a bunch of different dudes who are cool people that I've met in real life most of them that are the moderators on the board and you know it's anything fucked up in the world anything geared crazy any nutty news if you're looking for a video like I heard this is a crazy video out my board is gonna happen for sure right when you say that's looks you know it's a crazy place it's pretty nutty ladies and gentlemen and on that note it's fucking 536 yeah that's two hours two and a half hours we can't do more in two hours folks gets boring but we are at the Addison Texas improv this weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday and I'm going to take a link right here motherfucker and I'm going to open this bitch and I'm going to put that on Twitter so everybody knows what's up almost sold out yeah it is very close to sold out like all the shows what about Houston like Houston people wondering if you're coming back - yeah I'm coming back well right now trying to figure out whether we're doing the improv or whether we're doing the House of Blues there was a problem at the House of Blues initially where they said the House of Blues could not seat everybody and I did not want to do a show where people have to stand and we talked about this before that we went to the Doug Stanhope show when he was in LA and I love Doug but I fucking can't stand and just watch the show for an hour and a half it's hurts your feet your back starts hurting your neck gets cramped up and then I realize like this is uncomfortable like sitting and watching a show is awesome but standing and watching a show sucks it gets annoying and I'm a big fan of the house of losing to see it constantly last week and I had a horrible experience with those fuckers with them House of Blues which one though the one on the sunset what happened when you go through they stamp your hands equip wristbands on they check your IDs they scan the tickets right so we went there it was general omission we found a place that we wanted to like sit and stick like lean up against the wall was perfect for the concert halfway through the opening act or whatever opening band security grabbed my girlfriend coming out of the bathroom going where's your hand stamp she goes uh I don't know maybe it washed off I have a wristband here's my ticket he goes no your hands not stamped you're out of here and she's like what I have my ticket right here he goes I don't carry suppose I have a hand stamp she was my boyfriend's right there he goes go get him and he's kicked out too and like it was like it was like what do you okay but that's just la douche bag no no it isn't a manager got involved right but that has nothing to do with Houston Texas or no no then this is a closed as a company yeah this house just dickheads he's like sorry corporate policy you're supposed to get hand stamped I'm like it doesn't matter him in here I have tickets what the fucking good man you guys I'm sorry but let's go downstairs let's get your hand stamp let's figure this out together I'm like just the concerts on right now god it's just like the biggest like fucking corporate bullshit you know that shouldn't happen at fucking improv you don't think so no you have your hand stamp but you have a ticket come on so you think that so what happened then you think would not happen so you think it that if we have a show at the House of Blues people like your fuck my problem with the House of Blues it's a corporate thing the whole not being a great fucking time at all the House of Blues yeah well you have any time when you're at in front of a good crowd of people right yeah but that's one of the few venues where you guarantee that everything's going to run smoothly in the get rid of douchebags in the audience does not record your on stay that is true now that fans aren't allowed to bring cameras into the place or they have to leave them at the box office well the problem with that is these motherfuckers want to stick cameras in your face while you're on stage and constantly record things that put them on YouTube they're going to do that very very yourself very destroyed gonna do that regardless though but it is annoying for them for the bands and for different people I don't like they don't want angry their stuff pirated they're just protecting the artist that makes sense to me I agree but it's I am you got a bad experience but I think you had isolated douchebags I mean people have run the House of Blues in in Vegas or fucking awesome those people are super cool that's the one we go to the most yeah House of Blues in San Diego don't we also do it performance I'd night eight customers that's true I've never heard any complaints so if you guys have had complaints about the House of Blues let them need to know you know I need to I need to hear that shit maybe dad Ackroyd's House of Blues in Connecticut at the Mohegan Sun deal fell through gigantic fail why don't I read I know you fucking motherfucker House of Blues charges a buttload that is true they have a lot of built-in costs it costs I get paid the same amount to do a 300 seat room in Vegas as I do to do the House of Blues which is like 900 seats which is pretty crazy yeah I fucked out yeah that's kind of fucked up because they have all these built in they have built-in costs in health in pockets oh shit built-in pocket yeah in their prices that's another thing the price is ridiculous it's like a Bud Light with six bucks or something like that is it really yeah where is it what is it most bars but like usually I mean outside of Los Angeles usually it's like three bucks two bucks for Bud Light outside of Los Santos Angeles in Los Angeles under five dollars at least easily okay well someone just fucking bitch-slap rivalries BBJ Jones says that shit we said about hip the opium dens he says the actual is to in the answer of are you hip being opium dens lying on he says it's no true it's not true it says to ingenious to convoluted and to silly its wiki 44 but that's wiki this is Jesus opinion chasm is often a great deal about certainty and tracking word origins since we have written work word record to go on phrase may have been in common use long before anybody wrote it down after all one doesn't use slang phrases in most writing such as newspaper a certain calmness accepted they should use slang and everything so talk why would pretend and not talk the way we talk I always thought that like writing professionally like oh when I write in my blogs I read exactly the way I talk she's like I wrote an open letter to Kellogg's which more or less I did as a writing exercise I was writing every day for a month the month my Spike TV special was being recorded wrote down I wrote my material out every day I wrote that material I wrote new blogs every day and I just needed shit to write about and one of them was this Kellogg's banning Michael Phelps because he smoked weed and because I wrote this open letter and I wrote it the way I talk with swear isn't just the way I normally talk people look yo they're gonna read that open letter like I didn't want to read it stupid so I'm just writing doesn't you read it or you don't read it but I'm gonna write something see you do have more impact just like they're going to listen they're going to listen to a fucking pothead comedian slash Cagefighting commentator like Kellogg's is going to make their their decisions based on that no it's for you guys it's for humour it's for entertainment does the word hip really hail from a West African language it could be either/or though this this I mean it could be that that the original hip that rivalries talked about is right I mean this I mean if there's no real if the origins of it are are murky it could it could be both there is not saying anything to discredit that if it's a fuck read ban is totally right about the cigars oh is you really totally right I am tell you right no no it's a fucking taste thing I think cigarettes are disgusting you're sucking on them every day you wouldn't think they're disgusting if you smoked him for a year you're totally right about Doug you're right if I was a junkie I wouldn't think there's nothing this guy had a shitty experience at the Anaheim House of Blues same deal as read ban except they had to make me Reese tamp my hand and I lost my stool exactly that's what happened to me I lost my stool and was going to fight with bunch of Persians and the guy felt bad his brain felt bagging kept him by me frico bad tequila all night next thing I know I was like six hours bro what Oh Rick isn't that heard calls that are the club Persian they're Iranians yeah but they don't want to be called arenas their insurance yeah are you sure they don't want to be confused with Irene Aranea here Iranian ha ha talk about the fights at 1:10 it was fucking awesome Cain Velasquez that guy's a legend he's going to go down in history it's like one of the greatest hour I think that that was just some stellar shit Cain Velasquez is going to be him against Brock Lesnar is going to be insane him I want to see him against fate or really I would love to see King Velasquez against fate or I think every time Cain fights it gets better you know the heavyweight division is a motherfucker right now Shane Carwin versus Frank Mir and Brock Lesnar's gonna fight the winner and you know who knows what the fuck is ever gonna happen to fate or fate or ever gets to
