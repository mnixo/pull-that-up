trained my dad Joe Rogan podcast by night all day because that's a fighter dude it's a very damn sport I see any glimpse where I can get an advantage I'm fucking : like Floyd Mayweather and Victor Ortiz yeah no I have no problem with that was that to me was fucked up it's no no not it's a light he came by and came and said hey man sorry no they already said sorry twice come on Oh bullshit oh shit look no emotion I'll tell you what it was victors he's at a mental breakdown yep he was succumbing to the pressure he was fouling Floyd head nose head-butting him and he got penalized for it when he got penalized for it he wanted to make friends with Floyd and in the making friends part like I'm sorry bro look a lot of times you can't have that in a fight you can't have that in a fight because a disruption of your focus it's adding in this emotional connection with this person now this person's your buddy like hey we're bros we're bros right let's go back to fighting fat baby boys like a fuck you lap oh right hand go to sleep no T's is known for that bacon yes well I got knocked out by Berto cold-blooded yeah man I think he's done right he should be I think like it seems like when he got really famous and things start taking off like didn't he do the stars movies yeah yeah the expendable he's doing well and against Berto the first five rounds like shit here he is cuz you remember they built him up as the next Oscar De La Hoya he was like the Golden Boy and then just never won the two fights I want to see his golovkin Canelo and I want to see a kovalev Andre Ward Cove 11 Andre Ward is gonna be crazy that's happening for sure yeah that's happening I can't wait Andre Ward is so smart you just have to fight more he's so smart but core that might have people enough might not be enough against kovalev man so hard well he's not just so how he still felissa fuck kill the guy yeah kill the onion and he doesn't bother at all no doesn't give a fuck how about uh it's kind of stupid to talk about but it has legs Floyd Mayweather Conor McGregor you don't and we know we know cause have any legs it kind of does it does it kind of does you know why cuz Floyd wants it doesn't ma'am I disagree yes he's not gonna let it happen well but see I the only reason why I disagree with you there's because Dana goes if would wants to make that fight happen call me Dana's a businessman they care about money no big that fight would be how much money do you think they can make if Floyd Mayweather fights Conor McGregor Oh biggest biggest pay-per-view of all time no crazy y'all think so now what kind of it is to lady it might be cause you know boxing do you know bottom aggregor's the biggest draw already in UFC Mayweather is the biggest pay-per-view drawn boxing ball time you mix the world everyone with tuned in including your dad I would you know I'm telling you in tune in no because I would your fault you're so full of nothing right you should very uninterested taking two hits instead it will baby very eyes very fight nullity it's fascinating spark okay joy so so what would happen is Floyd Mayweather would box with Conor McGregor and basically move around and be like all right here goes and it'd be a spectacle it's just not a fight it wouldn't be a fight will you a fucking party pooper yes ice guy yes and in our cheerio yes this is the thing you gotta remember though the one thing that Dana and Floyd Mayweather who would be responsible in this fight together encounter for the rider all they care about is money and numbers that fight would be money and fucking numbers it'd break Pacquiao Mayweather kenton okay I know but it was it how would how would they how would that fight come what would they do in that fight so Floyd probably could knock him out anytime he wanted right no no Conor has a very good chin I mean kind of got knocked out by Nate Diaz or he got knocked down and hurt well done wobbled by Nate Diaz yeah um little gloves first of all Nate's a really good puncher Nate's a big guy Nate Nate's fought at 170 he's a lot bigger than Floyd like physically alive yeah but Floyd is a guy who's broken his hands many many times and he's not known for like really uncorking all of his might and trying to knock guys I do not get artists in the least bit but he could he certainly could you know it's not the Floyd doesn't hit real hard but when you box real smart knockouts come the opportunity comes like the Ricky Hatton fight it's a perfect example that knockout came yeah it's not like he went looking for the Victor Ortiz fight Victor just fucked up and he just left hook right hand um and he was it was a total sucker punch again no idea well look at what Mayweather has issues okay yeah like Madonna yeah I mean a flip are you suggesting Bursa verse five yes one fi'ty box this shit out he did but if Maidana like if if if I was college coaching that fight were to happen I'm like hey man don't be pretty and sit on the outside yeah hit this guy we make this a dog fight you're the bigger guy yeah you think Connor would actually give Floyd Mayweather a boxing match is that what I'm hearing no that's not what anybody saying no the say the thing we're saying he's a big is strong I'm saying that I don't think Flo would just go out and try to knock him out in the front he just yeah hitbox I think he would Canelo Alvarez imboca sleek in else way more skillful in boxing yeah I mean Canelo is a world champion one punch knockout artist boxer I mean that fuckin Aamir Khan knockout hey Jesus Louisa's you know what for said a super fucking homerun on the blonde dude Floyd got hit he said after he got when he fought Canelo he got punched in the thigh by Canelo had trouble walking for two days he literally said he didn't show it at the fight he was like dude my thigh he punched me in thigh so hard I am having trouble walking battle I think I she's never gonna fight MMA cuz if Connor would fucking break his legs like literally MMA be a that it'd be more embarrassing than tonic doing just box anymore but he would get way more embarrassing because Khan is a big guy Floyd would have to like box smart out and Conor I think Connor would have um just unbelievably difficult time even coming close to hitting him man he's go straight boxing was trying grays and stuff he's probably yeah your time out if not the greatest boxer all time and his defense is good it would be a great show a good it's the best defense ever for sure who's a better defense and Floyd and now you're taking a guy who is an elite strike in the UFC but boxing is a different game man you
