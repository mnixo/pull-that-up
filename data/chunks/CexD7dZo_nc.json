here we go three two one fucking yeehaw Felipe how are you sir what's so full good man for heaven you have to say that I don't know it seems like it happy like you said what's up dude and then you said what's up fool you corrected yourself yeah I'm slipping is that like when you have such a cool saying like you do you almost feel compelled to use it yeah it all started like people my neighborhood will answer the phone like that oh really I was dating this girl in a collar up her brother as a reformed what's up ooh yes normal right yeah that is a cool Mexican thing to say no probably more like the hood is more like a West Coast hoodie with social Mexican in certain blacks let me took you from the blacks okay but I mostly like west coast south central East LA Boyle Heights Boyle Heights in the house yeah sure yeah what that's a you know this is a contentious time for fucking people when it comes to like Mexicans and Americans with this whole wall thing yeah and I went to I want to go um to look at the walls because I went to Mexico Tijuana and I was like and right at the border of the gate like the gate right it's not a wall it's just a gate and across for the gate they have like eight wall prototypes like the ones to like eight wall prototype like there's one wall that's like it's a wall it's the man and it has concrete then there's another wall that's different and then another wall it's like they have you know when you go by tile for your house yeah and they show you all the tiles Wow don't hook to what the wall like our little Home Depot yes like a sign like a placard with different Wow that's it I was right I was there I was right in front of that each one of those I think it cost 25 million each wall each like one yeah what someone's getting robbed there's some contractors right now in New Jersey going wait wait hey hey what the fuck I could do that for 30 grand anytime you have a wall historically shit goes down right people want to get over that wall it's natural people when I get out people want to get out but I want to get in Utah here's what the craziest shit about the wall I'm sure you've seen where it goes into the ocean yeah was there like how you gonna stop people from going around that that is the silliest thing ever that is like having this gigantic wall that is like having like a gigantic huge impenetrable boundary but on one side there's just like a door yeah that's a door you go right around that may be hard to bring all your shit so what happens these guys right there are in the Mexico side yeah those guys over there are on the California side like that is the weirdest shit ever they play volleyball with each other do they yeah really Wow but so they added they added another piece to that wall right there so that wall that's an old wall see that's the construction of the wall you know that I saw now yeah wow man you can still swear butter 1/3 is used to where you know that part of the coast cards will come get you that is so crazy just what its training people go you're you don't want a wall relax I haven't said any of that not saying that I'm saying just look at this just as I use your brain just look at this objectively and see how bizarre it is that there's a a gigantic physical boundary that keep certain people from going into a certain area I mean I I think that that one day that has to not be a thing anymore right wouldn't you say it's that is a crazy thing to justify like you can't come to the good spots like the good spots are limited well if they would let people in then there'll be no more no more good spot it'll be just like the bad spots that's the that's the fear and here's the thing man that ain't none count that's not a it's not an imperfect it's not a fear that's not totally logical either right and like you would be worried if you lived in a sweet place like NEMA City not too many people perfect size Boulder Colorado yeah that's cool yeah business well right everybody nice what if million more people moved into Boulder they're all sudden it's a million one hundred thousand you're like what the fuck what the fuck is this you can't go anywhere now everybody's rude people start getting antsy the way they try they drive faster that's what happens be more more gangs how do you fix that that's how that's what we need to fix not like whether or not there's a wall okay fix how do you fix people from getting crazy I know man sooner or later Boulder Colorado probably have a subway system to keep get other people off the streets yeah yeah if they did yeah if they did have like a couple million people move they're like BAM start moving shit and so she would change radically that's what happens to places you get too many people they just fucking change it's uh it's still strange fuck see a wall it is them in your house I'm not saying that okay but I get so I think it's so right-wing he left with a but what you just stick to comedy yeah how I'm saying is it's weird it's fucking weird it seems to be something that should be perhaps reexamined its idea like it's almost like we have weird parents that we have to listen to for our whole life that those parents are the government I know I feel like when I was another little boy I was living in Mexico and um my mother she to tied me up to a stump so someone run away holy shit I'm glad to follow my dad to work every day my dad was like I think he was like a steel worker or something he worked on a lathe so he worked with metal all the time yeah and I will follow him to to work every day because I was a boy little kid I guess and they could've run away every day and my mom would tie me up to a little squeeze table with a rope Wow other pet basically Jesus Christ holy shit that's a weird memory I know right because I lived it numb I remember I lived in Mexico for a little while so I was three or four then my dad took off do you remember Mexico at all I remember a bathroom was outside like an outhouse huh I went through you the flashlight to go outside and wow I remember most sceetos everywhere and well my mom's family are living in like in one big ranch with different houses and it was fucking dusty I mean it was dusty I was living in I'm Sinaloa Mexico right and and there's to be a truck that were water the ground every day because it was too dusty and there was no cement but then my dad took off to the United States and we followed him we came in we live we were living in Tijuana Mexico for about two years do you remember how you get through yeah we let well my dad made it through first starting another family then came and got us know what that's what I thought he was gone for a long time and then we went we were living with my aunt her name is Julia and she lived in Tijuana Mexico right next to that was what I get is Colonia transe what's up and we went across with a like a coyote you know a smuggler I'm on pain of money and we got in his car we crossed we made it through I remember we made it through but it was like a checkpoint back in the day in San Clemente California the California Sheriff's Department was just the County Sheriff's they were randomly stopped cars you know like too many people in one car it's not too heavy right so the god was that me they put us in there like in a holding cell my mom went one way we went the other way and how old we I was probably four maybe or five I remember those three or three little brothers I have my little brother was like three another one was one or two but why would they separate you from your mom um I don't know that's I guess that's how they process wetbacks or illegal people that seems kind of crazy she went to one win I don't know what um I don't remember crying or being scared I just know that we were watching cartoons you know American cartoons that's how you remember and then they caught us we went we went back again and they cut it again she in another car and we got separated again but this time we were held for a longer time and I remember my dad when she saw us in Mexico she said ha ha they caught you guys again ok just jokingly Wow but the third time was like my dad and my mom came up with this crazy idea because we have brothers now we had cousins in San Ysidro California and my mom said you know why don't we just borrow their passports you know to cross and I don't remember this you know I just found out recently that what happened my brother told me my little young brother um we just a more like a little girl like a full-on little girl because I thought we had like three passports and Wow two were boys one was a girl and we took straws I guess and my mom and my aunt they forced my little brother to be a little girl girl they just my little girl for two weeks just to play around you know they gave him a fake name I'm so-and-so and he was playing you know dance he know I know you know dancing getting ready playing with little Barbie dolls and so he was preparing preparing broke the Nero bro Wow getting ready for that role of his life Wow how old was he he was 2 at least or 3 very young Wow so it we crossed and we made it all the way and I remember that I'm some other car pictures oh yeah we jumped in another car right away and then we jumped in another car and then that car drove us to Cal to Southern California we were like in Compton somewhere and Carson we're in the house they had there it was like it was funny when the call it was like a hub for illegal immigrants like everybody there was going different places okay who are you gonna go to st. Louis this guy you're gonna go to San Diego this lady her three kids are gonna go to Boyle Heights because that's what her father is so then we're gonna corner Boyle Heights um didn't speak no English at all but um I picked up English right away you know could your little like watching Bionic Woman and shit a Six Million Dollar Man Incredible Hulk Dukes of Hazzard so you basically picked it up from TV yeah damn Dukes like what kind of what kind of like lessons did you take listen we're in English Oh none zero who knows when I was in elementary school it was different from now there was no like separating these kids who don't speak Spanish and put them in an English and a second language class I started I started on kindergarten so so you just picked it up I picked it up your crazy teacher never spoke Spanish to us she never said I'm okay Juan you know you know what Apple is now there wasn't nothing like that it was like it was like I don't got time for you you're gonna pick it up or not do you think it was because you were you were so young your brain could pick up another language really quickly isn't that what they say like young people their brains pick up languages quicker I think I picked it up really fast but did my pronunciation we're not there right they I didn't know how to step by on it I would say belong in that kind of makes sense right that a part of your brain would really develop and make it real easy to learn a language when it's really young you know like okay how do I say this what do I you like give more of a desperation for figuring it out but I bet you a little kid that comes from another country like you did well you're a perfect example you learned from TV that's crazy so you learned for just talking to people that are around you and television in television nobody's saying this is how you say this is a pronoun this is a noun this is a verb meaning that nobody told me that but later I had a cousin who lived in Santa Paula and she taught me that stuff like this is how you say the word good her never played it will play like school together yeah she'll give me assignments and we were just she pretend to be a teacher then I read you know what man for little kids that should be fascinating learning how to speak a lot but for whatever reason we decide that it's boring like learning the language like oh it's so much work I've got to read another book yeah fuck fuck up another book before you give you now come on man just get rosetta stone what ha yeah magic trying to learn Chinese like what are you saying I'm gonna learn how to read it too I could read that stuff and and say how much time would that take that would be crazy I took German in high school for like a whole year and I got I ate in my class but I didn't learn anything see for me I think everything gets super squirrelly with with unusual like languages that use things other than our letters soon as you use things other than our letters like you see Russian you're like ah what is what the fuck is that shit they have totally different like ways of using our letters pull up some like Russian pull up like Russian translation like Russians have this they got wise in there and jeez yeah it's a lab it's such a powerful language it looks like almost like Viking runes or something like that sometimes like Braille it's a crazy I don't like it's a crazy looking language like another one is Arabic Arabic raizy looking language well look at that what the hell is that man that's what is this I think you're in the movie of Indiana Jones what is that thing that looks like a like a spade with a knife through its heart yeah that's right there biggest a that dot that hotel right like what does that call krill ik they call it krill ik okay look at the language like look at it when you see it written down look at that weird double K thing K left KK East cave look at that one nobody fuckin see a crown I'll be for it to watch Russia will a fortune give me the the belittling a6 but they have our letters too but they're backwards look at it look at that again this almost like look how they have ours but they have a backwards capital R what backwards lowercase n it looks like that's insane like look at that you that you with a big dick what is that there's a you with a big dick and they use a you with two dicks they're gonna be a little chair yeah this is a fascinating language are ESPYs SS see I think if we lived on another planet and we were looking we were observing a giant culture that had nuclear power but they all hadn't even agreed on the same language yet we'd be like what are these crazy assholes doing what are they doing they don't speak if they can't understand each other they all have nuclear power and they can't understand each other so you're relying on translators and people to speak for you and representatives and I know man I watched that movie clothing culture for the first time on mushrooms well man man dude and you read about communication with the community with the UFOs and oh you who cooks ain't eeny Meeny yeah dude it do you didn't have like a hand fan yeah I would do that that was amazing how I wonder like what if word like it humans always think that they know what other person might be saying right but what if the whole time you're like detonating a bomb with each other 'they mean but the problem is like what they're saying means different things in different cultures - it's just on earth people just have different styles of living you can't tell them they're wrong in africa or they're right norwegia norwegian what is noir we'd norway norway how funny is that in norwegia I'm coming I'm trying to come up with a cold weather I was in the middle of Iceland I should have one with ice Iceland but any place like that these freezing climates who's right who's you know know who's right like in Argentina we had a guest on our podcast at he said that whenever performing he said that they were spitting at them anyway why would experiment you because I how they say we love you in Argentina when you're performing they sit at you I'm like fuck that people do weird shirt I'm used to it right how about in Iceland they eat this crazy shark it's like a fermented shark and it's supposed to be disgusting for everybody else but them like they love it it's like a delicacy it's his friend Bourdain Adan he said it was disgusting the bunch of people have eaten it on TV shows and shit and been like what what kind of shot you did for some kind of fermented shark Iceland people are some strong fucking people man those people live in Iceland just think about how harder you have to be for the huge man I see no I've seen a video of them working out yeah there's like a disproportionate number of the world's strongest men have come from Iceland big-ass giant motherfuckers they put a lot of fucking beer - huh probably drink whatever the fuck they want those are Vikings man that's what's left over that's what's left over the Vikings back before guns it's like that just rammed through villages man hey slowpoke good those are the last remnants once people started developing guns then it became a fair fight and then it's like okay before that man the Viking showed up you were fuck's ville that was no bueno fuck this whole heavy asteroids dude giant swords if they were all if like the whole there was an actual country filled with people as big as those strongest men guys and they decided to just take over there was no guns they just take over that's how it works arrows aren't not good enough catapults not good enough with them in the legs yeah that's good - it's good move a little hyenas brought you away for the motherfucker what do you think it would be like if everybody spoke the same language do you think if the world spoke one language things would be better or would find other shit to hate each other for I think sooner or later somebody make a little language yeah you're right I think your slang like we're not gonna call him Mike we're gonna call him shithead okay for fun right like especially if people get to control with the language soon as people do don't say that word don't say this word as soon as people get controlled with the language like let's make our own shit like I was called problematic one time for what would you do I was just I did a show and this lady went on it was always problematic he's um what'd he say he's messy mess over what the word male chauvinist yes yeah I just did a just a war joke but she heard like the trigger word against right set her off so I guess she didn't hear that she didn't wait for the punch line I've had that happened but it's weird like lady you should understand you know you went you walked into my show you know with your friends they should I just warned you that I say words but you gotta wait for the fucking punch line bitch yeah there's a turn coming up here hang in there like I remember doing this show and I was just talking about my brother coming let her in another prison a lot and they booked before the show it wasn't that much $200 and I told my friend this comedian I had worked with named Steve flies fucking dirty I sort of please bro just be clean for 10 minutes please no surprise this grown up for your past doubts just a quick eight if you have it so he did a quick 8:50 solid killed it I went up there I was doing okay I started talking about um whatever stretch marks this is that then I said my brother been in another prison a lot every time he comes out worst the first time he came out a better thief the second time he came out racist like total races I'm Mexican guy and then a third time he came out even worse man he came out are born-again Christian and the to microphone away from me she went for the punchline like he don't steal no more he blesses himself you know and then yeah she just took the microphone away this fat lady and she said that's enough for mr. Felipe Esparza that's so crazy they don't let you say that she says think of how foolish that is to stop you from saying that like this is a problem there's a problem that people have they feel righteous when you do we talking about stand-up comedy in particular when you're setting up a joke like that you're gonna you're you're taking them for a ride they don't know what you're gonna say next you know and it's funny and to pretend that it's not funny because it's talking about a certain subject it's just crazy because it's not about not being able to talk about subjects it should be like if someone has a heinous perspective like hey I don't have a problem of kids get raped and killed and they start trying to make a joke about that fuck fuck man good luck you're on your own you know you have obviously heinous perspective but that's not a heinous perspective what you're doing talking about a guy going to jail and getting worse every time he comes out that that's also a reality it is it is a reality and for people to deny that people become hardened criminals because they've been in the joint three four times at the joint what am i living in the 50s come on man that's crazy to deny that but you're in there with fucking criminals and you know you're stuck in a cage of course you're gonna come out worse that's where it's fucked up right it's like nobody's getting any better doing that no no one ever re-engineers the whole prison system no one ever reengineered the whole people system and looks at goes why why we just continue to have crime emanate out of these unfortunate areas if you just fix those areas fix that is it possible that you could have no like extreme poverty on earth is it possible do we have enough resources dude does anybody know like do people think that in order to live the way we live now that somebody somewhere has to live in extreme poverty is that like what they think or is it just a spot we're stuck well I think um the only one that would happen if nobody really it will just be middle-class and poor then everybody has something yeah because could right now it's just rich and middle-class and poor the rich would have to give half to the middle class in the middle cloud that you're throwing it to the poor Jesus not enough money to go around sorry yes up is that real like if I had all the resources on it'll really resource people to volunteer man volunteer for what to help people like you okay you care about dog so much I don't see you working about doing putting in a dollar and no shelter walking these dog for free what does it say billionaires make so much money last year they could end extreme poverty seven times Jesus where's the profit in that that is crazy roughly six out of the seven the top 500 richest people saw the net worth the net wealth created this year is a staggering two hundred fifty nine point four billion here the top five richest people who saw massive gains this year oh boy Jeff Bezos in the house CEO of Amazon thirty five billion to his net worth this year holy shit I don't know how to say this gentlemen Lucca Yana ever grants chairman bank account grew twenty five billion yeah these guys are they're fucking making Bush baby what's his name Bernard what Bernard or not look at them cash baby 24 million Zuckerberg Zuckerberg in the house 24 billion that's a lot of money yeah there's some but here's the thing man if you're gonna have a game and I'm not I'm not advocating for capitalism or communism or social I'm not advocating for anything what I'm gonna say if you have you're gonna have a game and you're trying to figure out what how much of a certain thing and if you own that thing you could do way more stuff right you could buy a private jet you can get a big house so what is it what are the what are the steps you have to take in order to get that thing is there a too much could someone have all of it and everybody else has zero is that possible if there's like there's no rule that says you have to do something with it either like you could just collect it all yeah burn it but I'd be an asshole move but in every game there's rules right technically there's no rule here that says Bezos couldn't just win it you know for sure for sure no I'm not I'm not saying what I'm saying is is it possible that someone could get to the point where they have all the money I mean if this is if I think they happen before what they've got JP Morgan had all the money I wasn't really yes and I saw that that that dr. Bracci the man who built America and one time he held he held a monopoly to other steel in the world well one thing that people really resist is if you try to make new money you know that's why people are really edgy about Bitcoin you know though oh yeah what what the fuck's going on this is their own real money they they're buying houses with Bitcoin people are selling houses with Bitcoin oh that's it - a Bitcoin listen man in this day and age with the the kind of trust that people have in government in government decisions when it comes to economics that bit point stuff any crypto currency stuff becomes more and more interesting to people because they go these crazy fuckers aren't fixing nothing man well now when I was living in no well I grew up in the peak oil esau peel gardens at least a village housing projects we had a we had we a lot our my mom didn't have money in a bank effort at first our neighbors didn't have money in the bank so we they started their own little Bank like we had this thing called our names in English called pwned Dena we get like I guess ten families that we know and every week somebody puts a hundred dollars in the pot so there's ten of us and I hunted everybody puts $100 and we all take turns every we collect you know the pot so you and I in him and seven other people we put it $100 as $1,000 so this way this week Joe Rogan gets it and next week everybody puts in a hundred others again and this time he takes it $10,000 and then the next week I get $1,000 so everybody makes a thousand dollars that'd be like the way we used to loan each other out money in the hood it works on the honor system but it works out and there it never works out it always never fails because usually like in one guy doesn't know they wanna pay something to happen like you know it'll look bad on his family in Mexico or right we're gonna hunt that food down but I used to do that when I used to be the guy that used to collect all the money from these people when I was a little boy I was like 12 13 years old walking in the neighborhood with a thousand others in cash I'm passing it to this house but no one knew that but this is how this is how money market he worked in the neighborhood Wow everybody was borrowing for somebody could no weapon alone $1,000 right dude that's interesting man that's a that's a really cool way to handle it that's a cool game like our social game that everybody's playing with each other that's a cool way to do it I'm not I mean Congress could do it if they got together oh fuck yeah you can't pay a rate okay let's but if I tell people put a hundred each that's a great idea man that's a great idea and just pass it around that's a fucking great idea man there's like something that's a social security that you'd be happy to contribute to yes I get a group of your friends and do that that's super smart because then you get these like little bursts of a big chunk of money yes yeah I like it that's a social thing too yeah I don't know who came what were there but I think we have like a social thing you know it's something that keeps people communicating with each other and talking about shit and getting excited about it that's badass man my mom was a hustler man my mom sold we were to go to UM so I live in Boyle Heights and we're next to downtown Elaine there's so many like so many fucking factories and my mom knew like she was just you know like where everything was wish to go to this one factory and this trash camera throw they was in a trash can I can aband there was nothing but synthetic cotton so like this Frank cotton made out of plastic we should take it out of the trash and put in hefty bags then my mom would will go home and my mom was so mean to pillowcases and what's up fellows wow that's hilarious dude you had a crazy life you know I could imagine that how did the little boy do pretending to be the little girl how did he do it he's gay now bro he was sucked into it do you think that he would have been gay either way you never know is it possible you can deduce Wow maybe he was just gay maybe that's why they chose him my brother felt like I had this joke why I had this story for many many years but they don't know how to put it out there they my brother he told me a.m. you should do that joke about how we cross the border my mom made me dress up with a little girl I saw you sure mad cuz people are gonna call you that they're gonna call you and ask you here that really happened so what so I yeah so yeah he's I did it he didn't care and now his his husband was a prize my brother married to this city planner oh really yeah that's hilarious but it's crazy no Joe like gum how naive you know parents can be because my brother came out being a homosexual and my mom still goes okay why and my father too why why that's right you can't figure it out motherfucker you just run like a little girl it was too asshole do you think that's possible maybe do you think it's so here's the thing it was destined maybe I don't know I don't know it might it might be but peed there is a possibility that uh you know people are malleable you can kind of steer them in different ways the question is are those ways good or bad you know it's if he's happy and he's gay and he became gay because he dressed him up as a little girl if you really truly care about gay people does that bother you it's a weird question right it's like wow man I don't know I kid you firmly believe in equality of sexual orientation if you firmly believe in total equality you should have no issue with someone turning a little boy gay I mean really you should but then there's the thing like no no I want people to decide their own destiny but no one decides their own destiny religiously right little kids get introduced into religion but sexually it's work it's super important for us yes we don't let the boy be a boy yeah it'll be a boy no no fuck boy son hey hey give him some boxing gloves get out of there put the helmet on stop staring at that bull Jackson poster get a motorcycle and fucking ride around with shirts off yeah man right it's like people get super scared if someone turned a kid gay like what what happened what happened some people put some parents know they allow their kids to just be what they want to be but here's the thing I don't know if that's possible but I definitely think with no intervention there's a lot of people that are just gay they're just gay what's crazy seeing that like isn't there like a there's like a spectrum of gay though right or the levels bro there's levels like there's well I know because of my brother it's not negative he never my brother's like there's my brother's friends are really really cool and they're really funny but they're very full and buoyant hmm and my brother's not at least not around ours you know right who cares if he is though right yeah who cares yeah they know that's a funny thing man like flamboyant gay that's all that's the that's the the gay I knew you know growing up for the flamboyant one but we like we celebrate that right like look at him whoo you see a dude with like a halter top on you know what I mean like daisies cutoff shorts like rainbow striped socks on you like it damn go you go boy flamboyant gay like we'd love flamboyant gay but like a girl dress like that it's like are you unfortunate you unfortunate child like look at you with your 17 inch pumps on with your shorts up to crack your ass with your tiny top on that is so sad that you need that much attention isn't that weird weird that's weird man when it's a boy and he's gay we fucking celebrate the shit out of it look at him he's got all these crazy multicolored beads on and he's just fucking blaring gay hell yeah we think that the rave but a girl is just screaming out for dick oh you poor child you stop that stop it you stop it what do you do you want sex she's like her mom you're not gonna get love that way you're not gonna get love you're just gonna get a bunch of guys that want to fuck you there's a lot pressure on those work women those of the girls because I remember like

get the ladder for me one night without putting the letters up I always enjoyed that guy he was always very cool to me too you know people were scared of chewy Julian I always got along great you know he just looked like the wrong dude to fuck with he'll a hillbilly jam but Mexican but he's a gentleman always a gentleman if you're a good guy to chew he's a great guy to you but he's a talented musician man it was crazy to watch it's crazy to watch your friend just killing it at the House of Blues after you just say what's up what's up Chuy you know that song but that song hey Chuy what's going on that's like he made a really good song about shoulders right did he they kind of match I remember we definitely lifted it up a fucking great man he was great like he was like he's a he was a guy that I would actually go see I was like this is amazing I don't think I like the bar you know like being a comedian that when I was younger was like door thought something to do afterward that was crazy you know yeah but I give him like four sometimes you know that you go to like dark areas you know if you want to party hard like I had a kid one time I was doing a show in Montebello remember Willie Barcena yeah good work said I had that crazy ass fuck it was only for 11 years and somebody came in and said um I think this comedian yours he said hey man so these guys are looking for comedians to perform at 3:00 in the morning 200 bucks and I said fuck yeah all right do we shake morning I doing shit I ain't got life so he giving the address we get there to like undercover police officer security guard and his house in Burbank and we perform at 3:00 in the morning for them but it was like shit in their house yeah man and what Joe the house was built for like partying like 80 style we're like we don't you don't even know what time it like like the curtains were there curtsies all over the house you can't see the Sun come in no more real it perfectly like the house looked like it's 5 p.m. all day Wow and all over the house there was drugs but they were not openly out there for everybody to take only like for like people who knew what was going on he had liquid coke there like the you know the nasal sprays yeah he had like those filled with water and coke cousin do when you do coke sometimes the coke is stuck in your knees in your nose so you get a pour a little water to help it go down Jesus but this guy had little squeeze bottles all over the house like nasal sprays he lives so I would see people lean over in the crack of the house and then grab something then so then I found out where it was and I just instead of just putting it back I just walked it what I kept it damn it was I stood at that house to 11:30 in the morning and I got there at 2:00 in the morning but this is funny that the guy who owned the house he had nobody cleaning the house so everybody liked it like if you grab a little bit from a house like that give Joe Rogan picked up those beer through my parents trash can he'll give you points like like dougie points his name was Doug like Joe Rogan got three Dougie points so if you get like so this house you got invited to the house bite by text because Doug knows you but you don't know with you someone else invites you but now that you got points you know enough Dougie points you get a personal call that's crazy I was crazy there was a guy walking around with a little a Marilyn Manson but wasn't Marilyn Manson just looked like him yeah he was just hired for the show I guess for the party dude I hate to bring up this thing with your brother again though bring it up but this is do you think it is possible really that if someone dresses their kid up all jokes aside is that possible that if you dress your kid up as a girl for like a little bit and coach them in to act like a girl that it turns them gay I don't honestly all jokes aside I don't really think it works like stop right when they got here like her did he keep playing that way no I don't think he stopped he was like a male afterwards but it could have been a total coincidence I think what a coincidence yeah it just happened yeah but nobody wants to think that people are that susceptible but they definitely are in some ways right maybe not sexually because that seems to be like a biological thing but in terms of like behavior like the racism for sure right racism carries from from parent to child pretty pretty well you know if they're they have a good relationship with their parents and their parents are racist that shit will carry in because a lot of people who are racist they still love their kids so they're really good to their kids but they're racist so the kids associate really good like love with family also with like like distrust of certain certain groups and colors and that's a almost a thing that they're taught by the people that care about them like wild animals man they're taught a wild animal behavior by their parents and that's the same shit with people it's a weird thing man so weird it's a weird thing that human beings are malleable you know that the you can get him to behave a certain way in Iceland but then a different way in Brazil or a certain way in Japan in a different way in China like I was uh I was in China recently one of the things that's crazy is when you're around large groups of people they just walk in front of you man they just walk through you they walk through little kids they walk through everybody and it's not rude it's just they have a different way of moving around because there's so many people in so many spots in China they're not being rude they don't consider it rude this is different they're just trying to get there and they don't mind if everybody bumps into each other a little bit we're like oh you touched me oh I can't believe this that guy touched me with this hand isn't that by their fucking head button each other just but they're not doing it mean they're just kind of going through each other like they don't mind touching each other so they just you know you see an opening they're going in that opening oh you don't look that you don't own the space in front of you bitch there's a little spot I'm gonna go in there boom and they don't think it's a bad thing they do it here to China people do oh yeah Asian people or you know Armenian people older people we're trying to catch the bus we're all trying to kind of bust and they run they rush in front of me they don't say excuse me that's why I don't how to say excuse me in Armenian the next thing you know when people don't mind being jammed up like that in the winter in Boston when they get on the tee you know those trains like if you leave in Fenway Park and it's like fucking zero degrees outside in the winter and you get on the tee together and especially if it's sunny out so nobody feels creepy about it and they shut those doors and everybody just jammed in there huddled together who like penguins yeah you don't mind you don't mind you're fucking freezing so everybody has more a sense of that's like a big problem with LA it's too easy to just live here it's too easy to like physically survive it's too hot but the heats one thing but you could get by you get used to that you can't get used to the cold but you can't do it you can't stay out there you could stay and see that the heats way easier you could stay out there if you have a shade and you have some water I can live you literally can't live in Boston outside no yeah you can't go to sleep there if you go to sleep there you'll die you won't make it it's zero degrees out you're not gonna make it oh it's you can't just sleep on the ground when it's 30 below zero I can Alaska or some shit can your pan handle in back holder no and so you gotta be a hardy motherfucker to survive those places it's too easy to survive LA we don't have enough interaction with nature we got a distorted sense of where we sit in this whole thing who our nature guru Griffith Park yeah when I was in Thailand they got crazy bugs do bugs that bite the fuck out of you we got this little weird bites all over you and mosquitoes are ferocious those are real bugs men we got here roaches we got nothing we got a few roaches we barely have any flies we ain't got shit no bugs want a part of this crazy dry air that's the we're super lucky man bugs don't like dry air bugs like the crawly ones don't seem to mind but the once they fucking hate dryer lots of hummingbirds eatin them up to do we do there's not lots of hummingbirds anywhere else I've lived like there is here we rehabbed a honey bee hummingbird him in my house and released it we found the girls found a hummingbird that was wounded and they nursed it back to health and then re release it in the wild we have a little hummingbird feeders in the backyard dude hummingbirds the coolest little animals ever they're so weird I'll put up a video of this hummingbird it's so cute like they fit fed it's sugar water you know life superfast right dude they fly so fast they you can't like if you see it with a stop motion or slow motion photography slow motion videos you can't believe how fast it is like you're you're you're watching you're like whoa look at that's insane like what kind of animal evolved like that little tiny wings and they're going like a fucking billion miles an hour look good look at that thing in slow-mo see if you can find one but there's no animal like that like imagine if an eagle did that imagine how fucked everything would be if an eagle could move like a hummingbird just a giant fucking giant flying thing with knives four fingers and it's snatching fish out of water and it's as big as a turkey and it moves like a hummingbird what the fuck like if you think about that's what the tiger is right a tiger is a big thing that moves like it was sanely fast look how little those wings are I never seen their wings till now do those wings are so small that if they were in a superhero if I saw a superhero and the body was that big in the wings with that small like that bitch couldn't fly get out of here that wouldn't even work bro dynamically look how small the wings are look how big the body is it's fucking stupid I got a little those wings are men if you went to like one of those hot wings places and they gave you a wing like that you'd be so angry oh hell no moving forward those are the tiniest little wings it's such a small little animal but they're so adorable legs are they have legs yeah they're just tucked in they're tucked in the back see it yeah they're so beautiful such an unusual little bird - who eat them oh I'm sure everything that can snack a dishes but I think good luck catching them good luck catching that little fucker I told you I was net Leonardo book the other day and I one of the weird things in the beginning it mentions is that he had a very weird fascination or it was written in one of his notebooks that he wanted to I think it was he wanted to describe the tongue of a woodpecker well this is like an obviously in the 1400s where you'd have to catch the woodpecker kill it dissect it right and then do the descriptions herself and I guess that he does have descriptions of it which at that time are so descriptive you would have to take wouldn't be a scientist like he was I wasn't really crazy how you would catch a woodpecker I did catch one of those fuckers know why you would how he thought of that what was making him do you think he just shot it out of the sky came up with a trap of some kind I guess right yeah imagine those dudes they were just like initially studying species is like imagine just like writing down drawing pictures of a cat that you just found in the fucking jungle like being one of those guys that are the first people to document what animals exist out there because like how long have we known how long have we had a good sense of what animals exist out there how many years has it been you think that people are a good sense of all the animals in the world like right now we know about giant bears that live in Russia right we know about Komodo dragons we know about Nile crocodiles we know about how many Lions we know about humppa we know about all these animals that exist because we've got all the videos and the information but how long has that been a thing how long have people known what was in all these different spots has it been two thousand years has it been three how many how many thousand years this has been like reliable information no Krakens no fucking sea dragons you know stop you making shit up like what did you really see like how has it been whether we have a detailed account of what animals exist I was one of the things he'd used I don't know how long has it been a pet or the hollow there been a pen or something to ride on mm-hmm oh the first thing they ever wrote wasn't writing I think was like the Middle East I think it was all like sumaré and those places I think that's where they think it came from you ever see that writing man dude it's crazy-looking it's called cuneiform it's like it looks like nails it looks like they're like old school League carpenter nails yeah and they're they're going left and right and up and down a bit too yeah look at it oh wow that's I think I'm you know obviously I'm not an expert but I think they believe this is the oldest written language see if that's true is cuneiform the oldest written language they think that was where it started that it started with these little like they look like nails look at that shit dude it's such a fantastic looking language because it almost looks like some crazy computer coders and it's funny how I leave this kind of language so on him who's bored in prison will pick it up and learn how to write like this with another inmate and give each other messages but the guards won't know look what it says this this is this is the one it's called Killa mil-to-mil ok the oldest language comes from Sri Lanka Singapore and to Indian states two mil is still spoken by approximately 70 million people across the world tamela's one of the oldest literary canons of any knowledge in the world with the earliest piece of tamil' writing sand gram literature dating to approximately 300 BCE so that's 300 years before current era that's not that's not super old I see the thing language I think Sumerian is so there it says Sumerian first developed 3200 BC okay so I think they're saying what's the oldest language that's active in the world and that's 2 mil and that comes from 300 BC but the Sumerian language yeah is the oldest shit ever so that's what we saw that's cuneiform so it's created using a reed stylus to make wedge shape indentations in clay tablets so they think as far as they know that's the oldest shit so that that's that's only 5,300 something years that's not developed it to record transactions to keep track of money or to talk you think which was more important to them at the time transactions probably everything writing things down try to figure out what what animal does not eat you know try to figure out what what makes people sick keep track of who paid taxes who did it so 3200 BC what is that that's five thousand two hundred and eighteen years ago wow that seems so recent that man five thousand years ago they figured out how to write shit down like what are you saying what did they do before then Wow fuck and we're and nobody had rights no more I barely handwrite I suck everybody's no well they've been teaching the more I think when I write I Drive my handwriting deteriorates rapidly with every stroke I barely do it anymore you still do this no I don't know goes what is that low nevertheless you do that do that do that F in high school I was bored at the Superman logo yeah yeah I used to do all the band names like do the V and the you know the what did a day when we're talking about George Washington I saw a fact and I was trying to bring it up in time but I had to go back and find it and I did it just remembered it because what you're talking about do you know when the first dinosaur bones were discovered dude we talked about this once I don't remember late-teen it was more recent than ever funny fool yeah yeah somewheres like that I don't know he was already present and done with all of that all everything that they'd have written and talked about everything we go back and discuss was all before they even knew like dinosaurs even existed almost yeah yeah clearly crazy yeah it is really crazy it's hard to believe that we mean imagine you have like okay we think we got an understanding of what is here and what's been here has probably been similar to what's he what the fuck is this then they find a bone that's as big as a bus like wait a minute what the fuck is this that's why I would have freaked me out do you imagine you find a bone as big as a bus and you're like holy shit this is one animal what is this this is a leg you keep getting bigger bigger pieces and then you realize you have a brontosaurus just imagine finding all that shit not knowing didn't exist and going what the fuck is this thing that looks like a rib and what is this thing and in that noise how big the world is so you think is there's another one around so where others live yeah oh yeah man for Allah you know they sent David Spade or David's baby Jesus Christ they spent David Show they sent David Cho to the Congo in Vice this is how I found out about Dave they sent and then I found out about him again but from Bourdain was telling me how amazing is they they sent David Choe David Choe was already rich at the time this is how crazy David Cho is he was wealthy as fuck like he didn't have to do anything he'd already made it gang of money like gambling and shit and he decides to go down to the Congo to go looking for a fucking dinosaur man it's the craziest episode of vice because these people some people that lived there or at least they're saying they're convinced that there's I mean they could be just fucking with white people that could be a thing too right yeah this kid could be fucking with Westerners some Korean kid comes by and like yeah yeah yeah I'll show you the fuckers gonna add about the davinci thing he used to fuck with his friends with the lizard dressed up like a little baby dragon and he'd freak him out and like look what I look what I found look like God you have to believe him because he's fucking da Vinci right that's hilarious add things to creatures to pretend he's made a new speech a new found a new species yeah look at Dave he was young as fuck two men this is a long-ass time ago and he went to the jungle wet looking for these supposed brontosauruses that people see in the jungle do you imagine they found one I mean there's not enough jungle to hide like someone else credible someone will get a picture everyone has a phone now you people who live in the jungle right what would I hide it would hide in the jungle you would have to dam or cave in the water it would have to be an enormous area where people never go for a big thing to be alive today that people don't know about like they'll find like a new deer you know they'll find a new deer sometimes like wow look at this we got a new frog yeah we found a new deer this is incredible it's in the jungles of Cambodia it's a new it's a subspecies this deer we're here footage shows the last surviving member of an uncontacted uncontacted Amazon tribe yeah I saw this it's poor dude it's the last the Mohicans that's me well that's a cameraman it's a cameraman they fucking gave him 50 bucks just go out there beat some trees I'm gonna get some footage looks like Blair Witch Project and have you just whack it against a tree I'm gonna say you're the last surviving group bro we're gonna get paid for this come on bro you look like an old fucking guy that lives in the jungle just do it 50 bucks dude I'll give you 50 bucks what else are you gonna do today this says they've been tracking them since the 90s yeah that's crazy they living by himself since the 90s we got a weird problem with that right like poor guy what if he dies out there like that what he's gonna die here in a different way what are you talking about who me sad living alone if he's sad he sad if he you know he saw those people with the cameras you probably chase out on with a blow dart you know if he embraced it just always in thought bah what a way to go got himself a nice pair of Nikes you know Gucci come out of the woods bro he shot us someone in 2005 or you wounded someone in two with it tomorrow oh fuck yeah you don't want that man that guy's gonna shoot arrows at you imagine that he's a criminal they haven't even gone he got in them shooting arrows at people he's son of a bitch he wanted to get saved but it's funny man we look at people that live in a way that's different than the way we live look all we got to save him we gotta save him we got to bring him over to the good side I know we gotta save him but someone living their car he spire yeah yeah yeah man someone lived in their cars fine till the guy that guy that's camping under the freeway normal normal super normal there was a guy living across the street from my house I love living in Echo Park you live in instead of a Bobo whoa here's the thing right they know they let Native American tribes control giant chunks of land they give them reservations in the eighteen whatever it was was like 1865 or some shit where they did all this the worst land ever to nothing grows they didn't want they didn't give many of the good spots so they give them they give them all the like think when did that happen let's find out first that was uh my question was no would you ever allow them to live the March of Tears right what is it 1880 sailors act wow that's crazy but would they allow them to live like they lived before the Europeans intervened like if you really just left them alone and they live like fucking horseback trading you know animals for bullets he's really learned like they lived back then Indian land for sale fine lands in the West this is a crazy ad grazing it hold your own easy payments perfect title possession within 30 days Indian land for sale is this real yes this is a real ad that they had back then Nebraska stud is from Nebraska's website okay this is this is the next art for the studio we need that we need that that Indian land for sale make a reservation yeah we need that framed on the wall how much there it is a big Oh what is the land that's what we can't I don't know we need that framed dude that ain't that long ago man that is not that long ago that is a crazy day it's like look we captured this shit from these people and now we'll sell it to you who wants to buy it there's a picture to do we jacked they got a picture of the dude they jacked there's a preview this is the previous owner look at that twenty dollars an acre in Wyoming do you think that they had both an acre how much does that know twenty dollars an acre yeah Wow do you think that right now I mean it depends on where it is if it's in Beverly Hills it's why we 14 million orcs and fifteen dollars an acre 15 bucks Oregon but look at the dude they got the dude they got like the most regal looking Native American looks like a chief daughter look at his image perfect fucked like a perfect representation of like an elder like a wise powerful old Indian like a chief right he looks like - do they be running shit like we got it from this dude we got the prime Kutz baby we got the fucking tomahawk rib eye with the bone come on bro for you Indian land the best nothing but the best we got it off that guy look at him we said if I may never not the highest getting a totem pole could you imagine if there's parts of this country where people decided to live like the Native Americans live straight up . they wore animal skins they they tanned from shooting them with bows and arrows they made their own bows and arrows they did everything the way that the people did before the Europeans arrived they say fuck your technology fuck your laws fuck your bullshit just give us a fertile gigantic swath of land that we could live like we lived before and then people just gravitate to that do you know how crazy that would be people would fuck it up though they would do a reality show of it they would have certain some of the horses will have like fucking cameras and you see gonna be that fucking West world yeah dicks flopping out a loincloth and people would have to kill people the way they kill people back then - they'd have to have tools and shit scalp them I think I don't know who invented scalping do you think scalping was invented by the Native Americans or was it invented by the white people or the white people they we covered this day to collect them yeah in a bag what was it their idea first I wonder whose idea it was first because sometimes some of the shit that people do in war you know they'll the copy shit from the enemy - look if enemy's doing it they'll day yeah Wolf's fucking do Genghis Khan was a bit of person uh he did the worst shit of all time brutal you ever listen to that Dan Carlin hardcore history series dude after the show I'm gonna send to you okay gotta listen to it it's nuts if you've got the time because it's like five parts and you get sucked in but it just shows you how insane that guy and his family were and what what the Empire that he created this one guy his real name was too much and I think Roscoe's right they had all kinds of shit they had catapults that there were like human bodies on fire they would we got out real quick as shooting arrow while horseback right saying there well that was one of their strategies but they were extremely stout people they were very very strong people apparently all I know about that I'll just full disclosure all I know about is what I learned from Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast and like a couple of articles I've never really read that much about the Mongols but yeah what he said was that they had these bows that required a hundred and sixty pounds to pull back which is just insane so they must be shooting heavier arrows that could kill people better than anything the smaller people are the weaker people would would possess and they were a nomadic horse people so they were traveled around living in tents like they despised people that live in cities they were just the strongest most ruthless army the world has ever seen at the time like nobody had ever seen anything like this they would just they killed millions of people they think New York Times had an article that said they killed so many people they changed the carbon footprint of the earth there was less people a noticeable number if you go and you look through the ice core samples and they're starting to attribute it or some people at least are attributing that to ginga's Khan killing some somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of the population on earth damn one out of ten he killed more people than AIDS yeah definitely right how many people did innate skill if you had I guess someone was just talking about that recently and saying no one should die from HIV anymore no one should die of AIDS it literally shouldn't have to happen more I'm not crazy just take medication now we were kids everybody was terrified of AIDS a sense while eating Twinkies terrified of eighths while eating the thing that's slowly killing you terrified getting today's little kid gets it everybody go to school no more never that one kid yeah they stopped going to school yeah they magic God and everybody with all right magic got it I remember being in my car I was in my car I was living in Revere Massachusetts was it here yeah this apartment complex and I was driving my car and I was on the high I was on the road listening to the radio like you know you see where the traffic lights are you see you see you remember it's like burned in your brain like ah Magic Johnson has AIDS what in my car what what I remember thinking like it was a scene in a vampire monster movie or something like a zombie outbreak like oh my god now it's it's reached one of the greatest basketball players of all time this is insane are people gonna just start dropping off like flies now I'm gonna start you start wearing condoms right away afterwards I don't think so minions you know there's a reason why there's seven billion of us we stop people need to stop pretending that when they're you know four fully aroused that they're thinking straight like you you're operating at about like 10% of your normal resources see like aids whatever who's got AIDS you still gotta get rid of it with a code well you know it's crazy that it was just primarily gay people and drug users that we're getting it so what a weird disease man that's a that's a weird one man that's a strange thing that your when your body starts weakening and shutting down like whoa but when you really think about the actual danger and death like I think even while AIDS was in its height of killing people I don't think it was killing people as much as the flu was right the numbers I'm finding now are depending on worldwide or us so worldwide tuberculosis is now killing more people than AIDS mmm but this says that only 1.1 million people today in the US are living with AIDS and I think I saw but living with AIDS it's like you're at the border of getting AIDS is that what it is it's like yeah you have H supposedly this is an again I'm not a doctor right supposedly it's like you have HIV your immune system gets weakened you catch aids which is acquired immune deficiency syndrome which means your t-cell levels have reached a certain count where they identify it as AIDS right yeah it actually did type in AIDS and this is going to HIV so so there's that's they're definitely connected so it's not people that also their immune system fails that's outside of HIV yeah this so I clicked on this I'll show you i clicked on I typed in that in and this is showing this it says at one point two million people I've receives an AIDS diagnosis since the early 80s since early eighties okay so 1 million people and there have been 12,000 in 2014 there are 12,000 333 deaths due to any cause of people with diagnosed HIV infection ever classified as AIDS and hmm what does that mean yeah that's six that's a weird way of saying it with people well I'll say it again it says there were 12,000 333 deaths due to any cause of people with diagnosed HIV infection ever classified as AIDS isn't that a strange way of saying that yeah with I don't know what that means loses their classification if your immune system gets strong enough I don't know it says with diagnosed HIV infection ever classified as AIDS okay I don't know maybe I'm too stupid for that because what I also saw was that a million people died last year from it but that would be worldwide and this then contradicts because it says a million people there's only a big diagnose and this is only in the US and that other numbers worldwide so it gets really sketchy and it says six thousand seven hundred twenty one deaths were attributed directly to HIV so it seems that they they definitely think it's still killing people definitely still is tuberculosis is oh yeah but what is how many people died from the flu every year what did woody would you think would be the most the route most ruthless normal killer would be the flu the flu would kill the most people 36,000 just way more way more people got jacked by the flu every year every year and what was the number that from the aids number was total right how many of those people about flu shots though what is it it wasn't in 2014 so it's a third or so so what's a third aids to the fluids is about a 1/3 of the deaths of the flu per year ish on average I don't know if I'm not interesting it's like we are not scared of the thing that kills us from way more we're really scared of the thing that kills less people because it kills them through blood sex it has to be we're terrified that it kills people through sex because like the flu it seems is like we should really be concentrating on that thing that thing's killing way more people people not washing their hands mm-hmm but they're like look we can't stop that but we can't stop all this but acts weird right it's weird like when we maybe it's just because it's a new thing that was killing people because it didn't exist and then it did exist that's probably what it is right yeah like yeah because it came out of nowhere because it was in like what was it and during the 80s yes yeah and Eddie Murphy stood on your well control that aids on your lip how was that was that delirious do you remember Sam Tennyson's bid on it they say Sam you shouldn't make fun of aids aids Sam is a communicable disease straight people can get it too you'll name one it's not our dance you had this crazy dangerous bit about it and like way back then like whoa it's like zero and around like 1980 I don't know if that's accurate but so 1980 was the highest peak maybe it's in thousands yeah it's nice late low so high it seems like late seventies right is that's somewhere around 1980 the one thing to I read that there's around 300,000 total deaths and a third of them were in New York 300,000 total deaths a third in New York and the flu this is all told ever again these stats are all multiple pages so I how many of them see I get so confused about all this shit because some people believe that a lot of these people also are shooting heroin a lot of these people are also doing a lot of drugs I would wonder you know if they're really partying hard and they also get AIDS I would I would always wonder like how much of you partying hard is destroying your immune system - like if you're if you have a disease like say you have cancer and you're struggling with cancer and you just decide to hardcore start smoking meth and then you die from the cancer like is it isn't didn't something else kill you - right not saying that the cancer is good for you cancer certainly bad for you but if you have cancer and you just decide to go on a meth binge and destroy your immune system it's got to contribute to your health but we don't consider that well consider up the fucking cancer got him cancer got him it did get him it definitely did get him but he was also smoking math all day feeling good doing robberies dude robberies with fucking skulls painted on fights at 7-eleven yeah man he was amped dude was amped with cancer that's that's also I mean if he dies of a heart attack like all the cancer gave a heart attack yeah probably there probably had something to do with it it definitely was not good it's definitely not good to have cancer but it's also not good to be smoking meth while you have cancer smoking bad so how many of these people that got AIDS were like extremely healthy folks they're like you know jogged on a regular basis and ate a lot of fruit and vegetables no I would like to get that data this is not like a prejudice perspective I'm just curious person I would like to get all that I would like to know what is it that actually does it is it is it the meth that kills you is it easy kills you is it a combination of all these things we always want to tribute death to one thing but I would imagine that with all the people that have died of the flu there's certain there's a number of deaths will you look at the flu you like man that the flu could just catch you the flu could just catch you and you know catch you when you're already weak - maybe you're rundown you've been working too much and then the flu hits you when your immune systems devastated then it gets deep into you and gets you everybody's vulnerable I mean the thing about diseases that's so strange to me is that some of them are associated with certain certain groups of people like aids like AIDS is one of those ones it's just so associated with gay people that it's like a really politically charged disease and we concentrate on it like really heavily but I think I really think it wasn't just the gay thing it was also that it was it was new new there was a new thing that was killing people we were always worried about that right there's always these pandemic movies or some new crazy disease breaks loose it just runs rampant we don't have an immune system for it people are start dying and they need to get the medication to the people and get it to baby quickly Subway's stars there's always some shit like that we're like stars of some new shit that's gonna get it swine flu chicken flu so that was so aids had a dual disadvantage one that is connected to gay people and people are gone what are they doing over there what are they gonna get I'm lucky yeah exactly there was that and then there was also well blood transfusions car accident that's right right people were worried about getting from blood transfusions so that means back then they were never they were like dude you're letting random people donate blood without checking it I don't think they had a test for awhile I think for a while they didn't have a test for it then they have to find like I guess they have to find like antibodies and your blood or some Shandling but it's so weird that while this is all going on how many people are dying from cancer every year just from smoking cigarettes it's fucking crazy numbers crazy numbers people dropping like flies and no one thinks about that when you see a guy smoking a cigarette you don't think that guy's killing themselves little guy he's outside for the restaurant having a cig normal shit now that guy's that guy's poisoning himself like a guy who a week live but it's just strange to me like we get really specific about what fears we have in terms of what way we die and when a new disease comes along that becomes like one of the most specific ones but while you're indulging and all these behaviors that'll also kill you in way larger numbers than diseases it's fucking weird man very weird human beings me included were so strange we're so strange in the way we like prioritize things always yeah you get the flu shot no Joey Diaz though I won't give up the joke but I think had here sleep on the best new bits about it I never got a flu shot but I've gotten a flu once and then it was like two years ago I don't know where man just came out I hit a fat ass bow my legs got hot and my whole body felt hot and I told my wife I think imma get sick so you you hit a bowl and that's when it came on but I almost stayed with a bowl but I started feeling it hot huh so the weed made you aware of it yes hey asshole yeah the we talked about okay asshole you got the flu you better pay attention to your body I got it like a couple years ago I kicked it quick cuz how I caught it coming on I felt it I was like oh I know what this is and I just laid down I didn't do shit I just laid down drank a lot of tea chill the fuck out I didn't do shit I just laid down and relaxed let my body recuperate itself I got lucky that it happened during a time where I wasn't I didn't have anything to do that day so I could take time off I heard it that that when you get a real hot a real good flu it let your body fighting off something inside your body yeah your body's basically going to war fuck yeah yeah you sweating up a storm your body's trying to chase out the invaders you got people trying to get over that wall in my body later today your body has little organisms trying to get over their walls you got wall setup to keep these things from breeding and you know taking over parts your body so you got this immune system I'm just going to war you got a little war going on in your body when you're sick I know that everything is fighting I got PCP I got we need fighting a crack fighting yeah I mean the people don't like when you judge people's health and you know you definitely shouldn't judge someone based on whether or not they're sick or but when what you're looking at when you see people that are sick including yourself all of us what we're looking at is an organism that is at war and we have this weird instinct to kind of get away from them like oh my god I could get that I could get that organism whatever that was I got to get away from it what if one of the two troops jumps off of him and pops into me I can't afford to take time off work now get away from me I don't have I don't have time for lupus I don't got time for you coughing blood don't cloud I'm a domme be man but think about how many people like um who don't have who don't never really take care of their body because I know like before I wanted at Comic Standing I never had health care I'll just gambling with my body how's it look - I didn't go to the hospital this I was really dying and when I went to the hospital I went to this cheap little hospital right here in Echo Park it was fucked up man it was like it was real it was smell like an old old elementary school in there and it's what like pine-sol it was an old Korean doctor there and I told her what was wrong with me and she time I thought I have a flu I got my butt hurts because I might have a hemorrhoid I don't know what's going on I'm bleeding out of my ass damn and she goes okay sit down and now she do she and I paid $100 and what'd she give you she gave me medicines for further forward to hemorrhoid because I had I have read for the first time and she gave me antibiotics for my flu what is it hemorrhoids come from does it come from you trying to force your poo out man that's not someone told me Eddie my first time I didn't know man I was out I was on the road and now open the low carb diet the Atkins down so I was fucking with I ate cheese man meat all week round up and I didn't eat drink no water at Wrigley no soda so I must have been stuffed so Joe however I'm in the bathroom like the show's over and like two days nothing right no no yeah and I could feel like like my butthole already felt like I have broken glass inside oh that feeling so I finally did I pushed too hard because I I pushed her like I was having a baby I would like I was doing Lamaze and then I end up on the YouTube screen please I fucking this up while he's talking cuz I never faked and then I pushed and I pushed and then like oh man I could just feel I saw like I like myself and it might the toilet paper look like a fucking tampon and I wasn't paying dude it says the veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell swollen veins hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to straining during bowel movements sitting for long periods of time on the toilet lady Bravo has a hilarious bit about it but on his phone taking a shit it's very funny remember didn't you talk about it on here I think he talked about it on here but it was crazy yeah not good for your butthole to be sitting in that I would describe the physician the pain it feels like remember talking about in a bit I said that it felt like every night though the ghosts thought of sodomizing me mmm I fuck you in the ass at night how many days did you go before he took a shit oh three days then I took the shit that's when the pain started and I blew my butthole out I guess and then like three days later shit right without pain for like two weeks I was afraid of fucking eat man I have a friend of mine got to go to a doctor and they had to literally break up the shit in his butthole there to go up his butthole with an instrument and break it up and flush him out give him something I think he had to take something some sort of diuretic and some stool loosening agent like some hardcore drugs and then they had to go in there with like a chisel and show off this concrete log that here at the bottom of his butter and then you know he hadn't shit and maybe it was dry - yeah it was dangerous and he couldn't get it out so he was literally plugged up and I kept piling in it's not like he's gonna stop eating it's just gonna keep piling in so he's got a blockade of like shit rocks at the end of his booty tunnel and it's it's a real pride to be bad it's a real problem he had to go to a doctor my leg finally came out and then clink-clink but it was all bad with all dry with ugly male painful you gotta eat your vegetables i'm he'd every time I peed after I finished pain it was hurting about blood home after I peed yeah I mean that's one thing that I freaked out about people that are on this carnivore diet I hear this carnivore diet stuff and they're like no no problem shitting at all like no problem at all you don't eat any vegetables you got no problem at all it would've really kill you to eat some broccoli with that okay loosen that motherfucking life line up I just can't imagine that broccoli is killing you I think if broccoli is killing you there's probably something else wrong you should probably like get your blood work done try to figure out what the vitamins are if you eat broccoli you start getting headaches brah eat broccoli fucks with my gains are you broccoli I get a headache you sure man people have been eating broccoli forever like how is that possible but when did broccoli ever become something that you feel shitty after you ate has anybody ever said that like I eat broccoli I just fucking get headaches fucks with my abuse I'm dudes will claim that now these carnivore guys a lot of them are claiming like I I eat a fucking salad bro I'm mama off for a while people I checked it in back at the other way in general broccoli is safe to eat any side effects are not serious most common side effect is gas or bowel irritation yeah broccoli farts caused by broccolis high amounts of fiber all cruciferous it's a great word cruciferous vegetables can make you grassy Oh gasps II whoo syphilis I like I said gassi gassi are you a scientist or not you fuck okay when you're a scientist use scientific terms you don't say gassy with me what do you scare saying farts gassy but the health benefits outweigh the discomfort yeah so there's certain people like that I think have a real physical issue like Jordan Peterson is one of them when he describes like he he literally can't have anything other than me and at this point his life or it gives him headaches and it fucks with them I think certain people made all bullshit aside might have a real biological issue with vegetables which sounds insane but it only makes sense people have a problem with everything there's certain people that have a problem with almost everything everything that are allergic to citrus there's people that are allergic to certain avocados yeah all kinds of plants there's people that are allergic to grass why wouldn't people be allergic to some vegetables so if you are allergic to some vegetables and you just go on and all meat diet all those symptoms of those allergies go away why wouldn't that make sense to people I mean everyone there's so many people fighting off the idea of this carnivore diet that you're only eating meat you feel fantastic you're probably dealing with a bunch of people that have undiagnosed interactions like it negative and interactions with vegetables this is probably something about their system that does not go well with vegetables so they should take vitamins take vitamins and eat meat and you better find a way to get some fiber kids I don't want to get all backed up that's what they're good I think if you eat like really fatty meat though you don't have that problem if you eat like a ton of rib eyes it just greases up that whole pipeline you like whoa everything comes to flying out I think when you start eating that lean ground bison meat you know no butter like you're gonna have a problem or butterball yeah you chew that shit down and pack it down then you water on top of it so let's go you go to packed out bison here and then you got the water behind it it's concrete affiant it on its way through your body have some broccoli bro some kale put some cheese on it some people really firmly believe that dairy is bad for you and that's something I've never tried I've never tried you never have dairy no no to not have dairy I've never tried to like way off 100% dairy I don't eat much but if I do it's mostly cheese hardly ever drink milk unless it's with cookies and whenever I do I always feel weird know if I eat milk I shouldn't myself I've been my whole life to the tolerant and I didn't even know that my mom never told me but ma'am every time I've eaten cheese I have problems I get stuffed up it'll come out to him so I fought with almond milk and soy milk now yeah do you fuck with vegan cheese everything big only meat no more when did you stop why wouldn't that fuck my asshole blew up that's good move fuck that fiber inside you feel good I'm so fat people don't believe me they say you're vegan you're fucking fat Willy crops why are you opposed to eggs oh no just just give it all up man I got so scared after all right I saw a bleeding man and I said you know what okay you died on point fuck you feel better I feel good yeah I mean I don't have I don't have the runs I don't know that shit on myself anymore you ever tried this other types diets or just the first one no I tried being a vegan diet I tried the Hollywood diet you know you wake up in the morning and do some coke and I one doesn't work now that sucked don't sorry I never try that one yeah are you trying to lose weight are you good no I mean I could lose weight my but I was bigger than I am right now oh because of no did not really diet I just started this then mm you said when your ass was bleeding yes when you decided that's where they started out slow I stopped drinking milk first and then I thought was cheese then meat was the hardest fish chicken little slow and what do you replace it with well my wife she was raised vegan and dates in Ohio by her mom damn and you know that and they were poor so they grew up in uh in a trailer park so that must have been tough for them being vegan so I just started little by little or my Torah help me because she was not being and at the time when I started being vegan good I got it nice to love me man like fuck yeah man like hamburgers ribs ribeye lobster jack-in-the-box number five do you go and get your blood tested and get yourself checked out I got my blood tested two years ago and I'm supposed to get my blood tested this week again yeah two years ago and how did you look like in terms of your vitamins getting enough nutrients do they do all that kind of stuff test your vitamin B levels yes that time they did it took my B levels before able for sugar and everything was cool yeah that's good he just told me that I could lose thirty pounds yeah well the first swimming and watch your videos every once in a while I'm trying to get into that ice thing you got into the ice things rough how are too bad good for information no you know it's good to sauna song is good you should be more confident in that sauna or 90 degrees yeah is that like a different foot of solid they have at the YMCA right now Sol is the same steam rooms different steam room is like if if steam gets that hot well it's it really is like in the implementation of it more than anything but if you did a steam room most likely was a tile floor and you go in there yeah well the tile floor they closed a last door and it's just hot steam and everybody just gets hot in there and then they get to sweating and they leave but the song is different in that it's a dry heat so you go in there and it's usually I think the idea is and I could be wrong here but I think the idea is that the steam room can't get as hot as a sauna because if it did it would kind of cook you because it's wet it would be like hot wet air around you it kind of cook you as opposed to the hot dry air that doesn't make any sense but it's touching use the hot rocks that's the sauna that's the sauna yeah it's because it's conducting water the water is conducting the heat that's what it is right so the air doesn't conduct the heat as well as the water knows okay so that's makes sense because the sauna you can get to a fucking a crispy degree a crispy temperature before your body starts to freak out that's like the old school huh like the the Rat Pack listen I used to sit around a song oh yeah and it's take a little steam in the morning get all the alcohol out it doesn't really do that but it doesn't make you feel a little better yeah if you fucked up from drinking you could also run the risk of because you might be dehydrated you could run the risk of blacking out you know if you're if you're susceptible to that and you look at them all they're there in the sauna Landau look at these guys that's hilarious meanwhile how the photographer get in there that I call bullshit yeah I call bullshit the phone I call bullshit with the photographer now Ocean's eleven we know it probably really happened I'm sure he did it all the time in these yeah come on in take a picture of us this is what we do those guys were having a good time Hallie I meant what a time they were having a good time man it's a crazy day back in their 50s there right yeah they were older guys and they got together and they just we did whatever the fuck they wanted they go to Vegas and party and everybody wanted to go party with them there at the sands there the sand the sand it's crazy when you look at those old hotels and casinos in Vegas they just decide to dynamite them but what would you give to stay in the sands today if they kept everything up to date but current with the era in which it was created like if you went there was a total retro hotel room with like fucking dial-up phones and you know just look I mean there's God there's something to be said for it right like if you if you live in a log cabin like there's something really cool about a log cabin right you're like you're you're living in a way that God people lived like this a thousand years ago man this is real this is really how people live but no one wants to live like people lived in the 60s yeah you know like if they had a place like that where you had all the same kind of furniture just updated all the same law tencel's yeah but have that shit like they had it back then how many people would wanna know that mean like Vegas was only made possible because of air conditioning oh yeah and water they couldn't have pulled that off if they didn't have some sort of way to cool the place down when did that start cuz that's a good question Wendy's I've had a bit hotter shit I don't well the ice house where we do stand-up was is 58 years old before that it was some sort of a I think it was some sort of an actual ice house where they bring I yeah at some point it's history that's what it used to be he used to be a storage place where people that didn't have refrigerators yeah that's what the old ladies would yeah they would buy a block of ice and they would take this ice and they'd let them carry at home Jesus Christ that wasn't that long ago man I mean that's less than a hundred years ago that's insane so late 1947 Bugsy Siegel flamingos yeah I bet it I bet it couldn't be I'm gonna take a guess I feel like we probably have talked about this already I've just forgotten cuz I'm too stupid to maintain all this information anymore my brains overfilled I want to say it happened somewhere around the 1920s the 1950s what there's no refrigerators before the 50s or frigerators I'm sorry the air conditioning in Vegas as I was looking at oh I'm sorry yeah I was I was rambling I was going with Bacchus you know what let me go so air conditioning and refrigeration we're differently we went with the Ice House which is a blocks of ice that they used to use for ice boxes when do you think they invented the refrigerator where they didn't have to do that what care for the refrigerator the ice chests so I'll check but I think they so with air conditioning the 50s so the the the big roaring times of the Vegas eruption was probably right after that and yeah they had to be like right after his invented well there was difference about where conditioner though the standard air conditioner we have now but I used to work at I used to work at Sears Roebuck and in Boyle Heights it's an old Sears building and they and 1987 was a big earthquake and I was working there and that's it and all the water came down they have an old swamp cooler so it's like a big shower with a bunch of water in it and that's a really an old air conditioner by the mid to late 1930 swamp coolers homes by maybe 15 degrees but added humidity swap cores I like the name man swamp coolers it was our marital luck I had to clean one of the motherfuckers man he was just bigger than that for the whole building that's crazy and it broke another water came down yeah man air conditioning if you live in the Northeast in the summertime it gets wet like I lived in Boston it was a wet place like when when the summertime would come around you wouldn't it wouldn't just be that it was hot out it was hot and wet you know things get sweaty it's fucking mud everywhere yeah real muggy it's a weird feeling but it's cool because you realize it's not gonna happen very long you know so like when when it is muggy the thing about like real contrast weather that's one thing we just don't get in California we don't get a contrast if you live in a place like New York you'll have a summer that is brutally hot and muggy and people are walking around sweating and they're like holy shit it's fucking hot out fucking hot back but you'll also have a winter where you've got your shit pulled up to your face you're fuckin dyin man you can't wait to get on that train or that bus or hop in an uber you just got to get out of this fucking cold Oh cab and like take you to this place can't take you that place y'all pile out and immediately run inside man there's something about that that sucks at the time but it's good for people you don't get the hill here man right here in LA to 70 leg warmers hugs yeah people are uggen it up everywhere they uh get up so they bring in those boots too soon they bring in the uggs when they weren't shorts girls are allowed to do that we don't say shit they can do whatever they want basically they're running fashion for sure they decide right that's why fanny packs went away it's because of girls they're like uh uh guys on all right that's what happened if I don't pay they're trying to make a comeback I remember there was a fanny pack then literally the only fanny pack I wanted to get a teener sorry on Guns & Ammo with a fanny cap funny pack and then the inside had a holster for a little 38 mm you know he's trying to rob me son there's a video that Bert Kreischer just put up on its Instagram of a dude pulling us pistol out shoot himself in the leg try to be quick draw mcgraw shot himself for the leg he goes I just fuckin shot myself and Bert Kreischer with all the tears coming out of his eyes ha ha ha ha ha he's so funny man Bert Kreischer has a new Netflix special coming out August 24th Netflix Bert Kreischer I forget what it's called but Bert's gonna be here the night before I'm gonna hype it up secret time this was shaiva s in his chest for secret time he could do that guy he's a very good - I've been on this podcast once he's a very good dude very good guy we got a lot of good guys but a machine yeah like comedy today's a good time it is man it is it's a great time funny people and cool people and it's fun yeah it's fun fun and happy again at the old time when that gig yeah those were fun times man happy time doubloons yup go across the street see Chuy play yeah fine when when everything's good like that like it makes it's good for everybody it's like it makes the whole community is like more more positive and it seems like we're helping out more young people coming up yeah and then every day they develop a nice positive community too and they realize hey man we're all trying to get somewhere but we're not against each other we should be supporting each other and it'll help everybody it helped you it'll help me there'll be more positive vibes flowing around everybody be happy like we inspire each other we were not competing against each other someone does well don't say fuck him say goddamn he did it I could do it too you can set the same amount of energy can be put into both ways of thinking about it but one way is so much more positive for you and for everybody around you and it still allows you to have a competitive instinct because you're still competing against yourself you're competing to do better but you're looking at the people around you as inspiration rather than its competition and so you instead of having this negative combative relationship with everybody around you that's also succeeding you have this really cooperative excited feeling about it you know I mean that's that's entirely possible in in business that's entirely possible in friendship it's like that's how people should try there or should aspire to inner interface with things always try to be as positive as you can to give the same amount of energy you can give towards positive and still fulfill all those same amount of instincts of like kicking ass and doing well I do it against yourself like compete against yourself don't think about it as those other people or taking something away from you think about it as they're giving you an opportunity to look at what's possible if you really dedicate yourself and you should choose that as a valuable life lesson like wow look at that guy doing so well or look at this girl like kicking ass and doing all this how does she accomplish that I should write all those things how does she make all these movies how does she do all these things like fuck but people don't do that the natural instinct is to look at someone who's like some crazy like super competitive person like the rock or something like that yeah like you see the rock he's into everything he's in everything you want to shit on him but he's such a nice guy you can't it's a real problem but you could do that guy could do terrible movie after terrible movie no one cares cuz he's such a good guy you could he could do whatever he wants he's sooner than a nice guy he's a very nice guy he's a and he's the real deal that's really what he does I mean that guy really does show up at a fucking hotel room four o'clock in the morning flies across the world and immediately starts working out Wow he's an animal like a local you want to be inspired that guy's worth more money than everyone he makes more money than anybody that's ever made any money in movies he's a fuckin juggernaut he's so out of control every move he does is a blockbuster meanwhile he still shows up out of place they got a fucking they got one of them elliptical machines waiting for him they got to wait waits waiting for him he goes to town he'll do like 45 minutes of cardio when he fucking lands flying across the world lift weights for an hour he just keeps going he just keeps going he finds a way to not complain stay positive and just keep going I read half of his book and I'm less that's very like a lot for you I remember that um when he was he was third string and playing fucking football in Canada he was literally no he was sharing a mattress with that was the last guy who got kicked out of a team Jesus fuck to be now a superstar I mean I don't even know how many how much millions he makes a movie but everybody sees his movies he's such a good guy but here's be really clear that kind of genetics like what that guy is that is just like we were talking about with Iceland that's the same shit that's the same shit with the Pacific Islands man that's some warrior DNA son that's a giant man that's a huge super powerful man who fucking is so driven like we are lucky we are lucky that dude is not on the biggest fucking horse he could find with the biggest battle ax I mean that's what these people come from man you don't get to be that big if you don't have like some sort of a great lineage of warriors behind you you mean this that's so much bigger than most people bigger than Schwarzenegger to be so big but all those guys like that guy that plays the mountain on Game of Thrones like what in the holy fuck that guy's so big you know that that dude came out of some warrior bloodline some crazy Viking bloodline because before guns that was what was most important so when you see a guy like the rock or you see a guy he like wow that guy looks like a conqueror yeah because that's what he comes from 100% like he's a lorry warrior that due to place door what's that dude's name Chris Helms workers hound worth dad that dude listen that that dudes a he's a goddamn specimen or Aquaman what is this Jaime body comparison of the rock to the mountain who is the mountain mountains behind him 150 pounds on them according to this hold the mountain from Game of Thrones oh sorry yeah holy shit put that again look how much bigger he is that's like that's significant in a good like six seven inches he's so big a guy so big I'll tell you they u69 or some shit yeah six nine dude that is so crazy I weigh more than both of them that's not true oh wow now the mountain weighs like 3 90 doesn't he 386 ah 386 he's 6 foot 9 he weighs 386 pounds like to put that in perspective former world boxing champion fuckers his name the crazy gypsy dude I'm sorry Fred oh no the guy he's the last guy to beat wladimir klitschko damn it how am I not remembering his name Tyson Fury right yes that's it sorry Tyson that guy's a beast Tyson Fury he's 6 foot 9 and he weighs 250 yeah and he's a world boxing champion he he gave up the title he was going through some struggles some health struggles some mental health struggles too and gained a shitload of weight and then I mean got real fat and then got all the way down don't like a super healthy weight again and I don't know if he's box since I feel like he has shit find out if he's box since when's the last time he boxed but he's gonna box soon I know and he looks he's in phenomenal shape so when was the last time he fought does the Wikipedia say I feel like the last time he fought is when he outpointed Vladimir Klitschko and then afterwards he had a real struggle maybe just all the sudden became the champ he's freaking out and maybe partying too much or something and gym he fought just recently right so literally last month yeah and who did he beat suffers a fairy did he beat him by decision doesn't say where is it RTD round 4 what does that mean referee something to get a knockout no because it's TD technical decision maybe it's uh someone got head-butted and they got cut what happened so find out what happened in that fight see just google the fight we'll figure out what happened anyway if you go to his Instagram page he's Jack now let's shred it six-pack bang looks great but you gotta think he's 250 that big motherfucker who's the same height as him is a hundred and forty pounds heavier than him that is fucking insane that's so big 140 stakes take 140 t-bones just slap them all over that dudes body just sure that's that used to be everything will they do before acting doorman someone smashing people's randomly I don't know man I don't know what to order about anywhere Matt he's a world Strongest Man though he's one of those guys he does those world strongman competitions together fucking strong bro the handles on the logs they horse the long look back to it after fourth round so again the guy retired after the fourth oh the guy retired so he retired on his stool no mas so he said no mas sound like I was an interesting event yeah rob was getting pissed and there's a fighting stand by was a crowd getting pissed I was the fight that stop cuz dude quit Tyson Fury's beast he's a really good boxer but um you know he came up to weigh over 300 pounds got real fat and then lost at all got down to 250 nice smiling and laughing on his Instagram so like you figured it out like I like that like when someone goes to the Darklands then comes back God look how tall he is dude six nine and he can box his ass off he's very slick like deceptively slick you know he's a traveler he's like one of them badass gypsy dudes like there's a quite a few of those in boxing right now these are you know tough fucking people and he can perform under pressure too like he gets loose he's huge man he's so big dude can he box he can box his ass off man I just don't know why this guy so they're just standing in front of each other like they're fucking around like two rounds almost and he landed some blows and I don't go to band here and see what happening let's see what happens at the end because if the guy just quit and there was no there was no point where he was hurt then it's disgraceful so he's beating him up here yeah well Tyson Fury is legit yeah he's fuckin him up he's a legit world championship caliber boxer absolutely look he beat Vladimir Klitschko in his prime I mean at the end of his reign but he was still in his prime because his next fight against Anthony Joshua was fantastic Klitschko knock Joshua down had Joshua deep in deep trouble and then Joshua came back and stopped him and Joshua knocked him down first then he knocked Joshua down second so it was like Anthony Joshua was clearly if not the best at least it's between him and Deontay Wilder right now until they fight the the best most dangerous heavyweights of our era and Klitschko almost beat him almost knocked him out so when Tyson Fury beat him before that he was beating a prime ton Klitschko and he just out boxed him man so the dude just quit was he getting was he getting beat up while I was talking too much no a little bit a little bit more so this is all the highlights I mean they probably showed over yeah he he was getting hurt he was getting hurt for sure he like right there he got hurt but but you got a you got a you know try to figure out a way to to mitigate this you know you got to figure out when I mean he's going back to his his corner he's not wobbling you're supposed to be trying to figure out a way to get past that dude and if you can't figure out a way to get past that dude why just take the fight but I guess I guess he probably thought he could beat that guy before he got in with him and then while you're in the middle of it you know what happens who that happens to lomachenko let me chanko guys just quit guys quit in their corner world-class guys they're on their corner and they just go fuck this I'm not going back out there that was like one of his more recent fights against a really high-level guy lomachenko is so good he boxes guys out so convincingly they're like look I'm going out like if this guy keeps teeing up for me I'm not making it we're cutting this shit short right here and they'll do it with like a straight face like enough of this but that's cuz he's so much better like what you're seeing with Tyson Fury there that guy was definitely getting beat up and maybe he definitely needed to stop that fight but the way he's getting beat up is not like the same way low mishchenko does like when lemon chenko does it looks like the end is near son you better get off this fucking train we're going right into a brick wall you think their minds not in it when you just give up who knows man I mean we didn't watch the actual fight he might have died some fewer most likely I think probably hit him with some big shots and you know we're looking at it from an outside perspective but he knows he's in a big big trouble it's a smart move I mean people get they boo and they get angry when someone who's a real warrior steps out of a fight but I can remember when Nigel Benn fought Gerald McClellan and it was a big big fight at the time because they were both just knockout artists and crazy wild dudes with ferocious punching power and Gerald McClellan cut a shit ton of weight really way too much weight and he was a really big light heavyweight and when he went in there and fought Gerald McClellan or when he fought on Nigel Benn rather they had a clash of heads and it was a crazy like non-stop first round action where Jeremy : hurt Nigel Benn see did you find that jeremy Clell Gerald McClellan hurt Nigel Benn knocked him through the ropes and looked like the fight was over and Nigel pin comes back he gets back up and they're going at it and there's a crazy headbutt in there too and during the headbutt I mean they're throwing bombs back and forth but um Jeremy Cleland takes a knee shortly afterwards and then goes to his corner and stops and the the people that are watching I remember saying like why is he doing that like why would he stop a fight like you know it doesn't make any sense and then boom he he's fucked and then they take him to the hospital and this is in this is what was around 10 right before I think I saw this is right before the the headbutt yeah so during the first round I see I thought it was a shorter fight see during the first round they had collided and Jarrell McClellan hit him with some big shots and it looked like the fight was over I'm pretty sure that was the first round but when when whenever happened happened oh look at that right hand by Nigel BAM oh that's ferocious oh dude remember this wrong I remember a clash of heads look at that I though man damn my 100% remember this wrong see cuz he got up and he's in trouble and Nigel Benz hittin him again see I don't remember him see that's interesting how that worst man you haven't seen a fight in 20 years and you have this stupid memory of it in your head oh look at that uppercut he hit him with mmm so I think this is winning the fight so I think he was a really struggling at this point I think he waited out his whole count that's it he waited out his whole count on his knee and I think some people were critical of that a time this is crazy man so anyway after this fight Gerald McClellan had severe brain bleeding and was taken to the hospital and he's never been the same since damn em Nigel Pan was a beast man they were both beasts gerald McClellan was a knock out artist at the time man see if you google Jeremy McClellan ko highlights the thought was that it was going to be one day Gerald McClellan versus Roy Jones jr. that they were gonna have a super fight that was like a big like one of them Pacquiao Mayweather type fights for that era Wow mega hit hard man I mean it hard getting hit in the face like that well how do I remember him getting head back maybe I'm just completely delusional or maybe that was somewhere in that mix but certainly it was the big bombs from McClellan that uh dropped him in the first round and the big bombs from Nigel Benn I want to see the the first round too because i from I remember it was a crazy comeback because Nigel Benn was really hurt in that first round but just showed insane heart and figured out how to keep going where a lot of people like this fight is over this fight is over but you see in those highlight reels he was a knockout on man but now he's he's in real real real real bad shape he's in a wheelchair he from that fight he he went blind he he had severe bleeding on his brain and never really recovered he could died in the ring oh he absolutely could have died so here's the first round look at this first round insane you think they're gonna win look at this Nigel Benn falls through the ropes go go back a little bit go back a little bit so you can see how fuckin and saying this go to the beginning of it you see how insane this combination is I mean McClellan came out guns blazing and hit him with some serious bombs man look at this he hit him with a couple of good shots they're good right hand a good lead hook left hook to the body so this is the beginning in the fight you're thinking oh my god this fight is fucking over look at that left hook left hook to the body right boom boom I mean MacLeod was a destroyer look at this and this is when he's blasting them through the ropes you like holy shit this fight is over Nigel Benn comes back from this to win like ten rounds later which is insane insane look at him I mean clearly he's hurt it's kind of wobbly but Jerry McClelland just couldn't keep this up Nigel Benn survived and came back those are like mad intangibles in a fight that's why the best description of fights is always the theater of the unknown because you really never know what the fuck is going to happen when you get these two world-class knuckle slingers throwing fucking haymakers head each other like this look at McClellan Oh Nigel pin comes back with a right and he clinches now I'm aglow I'm starting to get a little tired right I'm gonna get knees they're giving it up my cousin yeah I mean you gotta think what kind of output he's put he's trying to win this fight and Chael Sonnen told me something once that's a old boxing it's saying something along the lines of if you try to stop a fight and win by knockout but fail you almost always lose by decision because you just blow yourself out so bad obviously that's not totally the case cuz some people have crazy endurance and they can try to win a fight by knockout and then recover around later but did the amount of output that you do when you're throwing everything full blast like McClellan did in that first round is insane it's like sprinting how many punches he'd throw that first round he threw a lot but here's the most important thing he's throwing a lot of them at full power that's why it's so difficult to maintain well most people don't realize is that most of the time you see boxers boxing they're throwing punches fast but they're being loose and fluid and when they heard a fighter that's when they expend the most energy because then they're digging in glass and they're winding up they don't normally do that so the amount of energy that it takes to wind up and throw your hips and your fucking ass into it and all your weight and explode at the end that's much more than to be just a technical boxer so when they're throwing technical punches and they're moving fast they're not exerting the same amount of energy see when when you're trying to knock somebody out like McClellan clearly wasn't this first round you are running uphill with a weight sack on yak and you can only do it for so long so as we go into the second round like look he's he's already really tired so it was his lunch length pitch right there it was as much his weight cut as it was his strategy to try to win the first round as it was Nigel Ben's ability to absorb punishment and come back strong because Ben is looking fantastic here in the second round look at him but it was a big wake-up call to a lot of boxers that if you engage in wild brawls even when you were one of the elite of the elite like Gerald McClellan was at the time you could still get you know brain bleeding and be fucked up and a lot of people attribute that to that weight cut because he had to here dehydrate himself quite a bit back then you think his game plan from his coaches was get to the guy out in the first round it could be but it could be that he heard I mean he figured he could get him out in the first round you know I mean McClellan was a killer that was his thing if he if he hurt you he was coming after you so I what's that I had 14 straight knockouts and ten were in the first round yeah that's what Jeremy Cleland did so when it didn't work out against a guy like Nigel Benn Nigel Benn figured out how to maintain his energy better that fight that's a you know that's a dangerous strategy empty all you bullets out in the first round huge is done defense for the first three rounds and huh but meanwhile like the the that's what was his success formula up until then you know I mean I was that was what was working you don't know it doesn't work it don't work anymore fourteenth straight not close that way yeah I mean dude remember when we used to think that nobody could beat Tyson yeah remember we were little we were young we thought I think it was like when did he lose 86 did he lose in like 1986 yeah what year was that Google that he moved he did it why it was I was definitely doing comedy at the time and I definitely saw it with my friend Ron after the fact that we're 11th 1990 1990 damn so from that point on we knew he could lose before that every Tyson fight like man I'm gonna bother watching why do people won't even want to fight that guy they just getting killed what were the odds of him winning like 42 42 I supported two-to-one somebody I paid somebody I paid some crazy number I think it was 42 I think it was one of the highest underdogs ever that won 42 and he won by knockout Buster Douglas was fantastic back then man he fucked him up huh well dude Buster Douglas is a crazy example of a guy who always had a tremendous amount of talent he was always regarded as like people that were in the know in boxing I you know heard them talk about him and they would always talk about how smooth he was in training and when he's at his best he's a literally like a World Championship fighter but he never totally put it together in far as far as his discipline and training camp but then his mom died and he decided he was gonna fuck Mike Tyson up for his mother oh and he trained really really hard so it was a perfect storm of Mike Tyson being king in the world you know he's just fucking everybody up doesn't even feel like he has to train anymore he's just just being he's just being the world heavyweight champion so it that's what they're like the reason why they become that guy in the first place because they have this ability to indulge and excess and go crazies buying tigers and Lamborghinis and shit and along the way Buster Douglas for that fight trained like a demon and still almost lost still almost lost that's how good Tyson was when Tyson was in his prime as a knockout artist he was so lethal that even though Buster Douglas in him fought and Buster Douglas eventually wound up knocking him out he knocked him out after Mike Tyson knocked Buster Douglas down and had him hurt and Don King after the fight even protested and said that the count was more than 10 and that when the Buster Douglas was down the referee gave him extra a couple seconds to recover that he shouldn't have had I remember that was like a big protest after the fight but even then I mean we even with shitty training you know not taking this guy seriously at all even then Mike Tyson still knocked Buster Douglas down and almost knocked him out with one punch well Ronde not come out was look at this though the longest as long as Tyson fight he ever had right I know he's had decisions he had decisions yeah I think he had a decision against Bonecrusher Smith video here as both both knockdowns simultaneous so you can see like but different 10 counts I guess okay let's see it boom he clipped him an uppercut right for three on the left you think I'm just 5 or 6 on the right oh that's so different oh that's so different he was counted in wrong no more yeah yeah oh man it was the end of the round yeah who's the very end of the round so Buster got a break so look that that's that's just how go go go to the very beginning again please go to the very beginning again so I could see the punch here yeah boom look at that uppercut that's a beautiful uppercut Tyson nailed him with 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 you're out you're out buster yeah it's only on a time Buster there no he's out he's out do that I guess that seems like he's out right doesn't it yeah let's try again ready boom he goes down one two three four five six seven eight nine ten he's out someone distracted him on number eight yeah does that stop the count with a longer pause that second when he turns running away seven eight I'm Mike Tyson here there's five six seven nine ten yeah that guy's way quicker is that the same guy yes oh that's ridiculous dude you suck at counting in Spanish another one that's a fucking crazy hard job man you're in the middle of the moment you know there's all this hype going on I pay the leaves fuck out yeah but it's the same guy because it's the same fight so how how does the same guy count real slow for Buster Douglas and way faster for Mike Tyson personally the video says this clearly demonstrates that he gave them both the exact same amount of time oh really let's try that again let's try that again let's count for Tyson will count for Tyson first ready Tyson goes down boom what a combination by dog huh two three four five six eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen achtung around around fifty on the on the clock on the screen you can see it and how many seconds was it he puts them up at 38 okay like 13 seconds yeah or five six seven eight nine they're both out the counting is definitely slower on Buster Douglas with they're definitely both out but either way if you said seven I bet butts but you know instead of you know or if you've sped the count up by a second you don't think Buster Douglas could have gotten up quicker I bet he could have I mean he was waiting for the guy to hit eight so he ends up right which what you do you take as much time as you can especially after you got legitimately hurt like that you're supposed to do that so the question is like would he have been able to if the guy had countered a little quicker and you know eight came where seven was or six was what he been able to I think he probably would have the question is would have Tyson have been able to get to him with one punch before the Bell that might have knocked him out yeah you know okay fight you get him back up again and it's three extra seconds it Tyson storms forward and connects with them huh I think it's two head shots with a faithful dude crazy shots there's this guy right here watch the black glove it's me the official counters the official count this guy that's the finger bro he's famous his nicknames the finger really he counts way faster watching us watch the finger two three four five and a seven eight nine ten oh yeah by the fingers count that dudes out they're both out cold I'm going with the finger forever captain white glove Michael Jackson County Michael Jackson we go with Mike magician yeah man that's that was a insane fight though because you couldn't believe Mike Tyson could lose even when I watched it I remember I heard about it first and then I watched it and they still remember thinking I can't believe when I'm watching he's gonna get up and he's gonna knock this dude out for sure or leave he lost it was like it's over then you couldn't believe that he could lose whoo that's people don't understand today there's never been someone that was as dominant for us like a scary moment in like boxing history than Mike Tyson because even though you knew Roy Jones was gonna fuck up whoever he fought the way he was gonna fuck off you need knocked him out with one punch it wasn't gonna be this horrific storming by a destroyer just comment after your soul Roy Jones it box your face off hit you with leadly left hooks and straight right hands or way faster than anything you can duck he would fuck people up but you fucked people up with a certain style and movement speed whereas Tyson was just hitting you like mugging you at the same time it's like all anger so fatherhood in you and he was solid like sledgehammer 220 pounds but moved like a hundred and sixty pound guy but you couldn't believe it at the time there had never been a heavyweight like him before there was heavy weights that that moved amazing like Ali Ali had the most amazing footwork of anybody just smooth and flowing and change what the game was was in front of people the rope-a-dope this is a crazy video volley that someone had on their Instagram page one of those boxing pages where he's fighting someone and the guy throws two three four punches in a row and I'll he's got his hands down I just barely moving his head away with each punch just like bitch you can't hit me he just had a there was a magic about what he was doing that you were like how was a heavyweight moving like that he tries to jab - Tyson was a totally different kind of strategy you know there's no strategies will be argued to the end of time like what would have happened if Mike Tyson had a thought Muhammad Ali both in their primes what would happen man what would happen it would have been fucking crazy I'll tell you that if we had Mike Tyson in his very best before shit went completely crazy he started giving out Rolls Royces to cops and walking around as tiger in his underwear before all that stuff and they were buddy here yeah before for sure before byte nears the bitin ears thing was when you know Evander was you know when Evander beat him in that first fight no one could believe it no one could believe it even though Tyson lost to Buster Douglas everybody assumed that Tyson lost because he hadn't been training and he really hadn't been been focused and then when he went to jail he came out of jail and he looked jacked remember yeah way more jacked he had a ridiculous six-pack remember that shit tattoo of phase son no he got the tattoo on his face afterwards right yeah after jail Athena gets a tattoo on his face in jail right I don't think so I think he had mal tattooed on his arm what does it say here Mike Tyson opens up oh that was when he got arrested by that Joseph though joe arpaio guy do time in that Arizona he was living in Arizona for a while and he had to do that Joe Arpaio shit when they make you wear pink handcuffs on and dude Mike Tyson though when he was in his prime like that was when he just got out of jail that was the Mike Tyson fresh idea like just jacked that was 95 first fight after release that was against some unfortunate white fella that looks like he would be was his name p-nut Neely yes Peter McNeeley tough guy just wasn't the video if hype up the fight is hilarious yeah go watch it now no Solaris he was like a guy who'd be carrying the money back he'd be a guy that you'd say bring him to Peter and Peter would break your face hey you owe money fuck boom he was a rich guy I'm over him give me some volume Jim Gray looking young and dapper for just a moment before you go out into the ring your thoughts gonna play your joining Tyson my grandfather's my grandmother's my father my mother Curley my three brothers last but not least snobby last but not least is a guy from Medfield that if you've ever been to

Micky Ward box somebody some famous dude I feel like he box some old some old-time - damn it Jimmy just told me about this Reese - and I forgot what it was but we were both like couldn't have been more than like 19 something like that I went to see Micky Ward box was crazy man gonna see live boxing so weird because there's no commentary like I'd only seen it at home yeah you ever see a live boxing match yes it's weird it's oddly quiet you know what is the same greg young is that where he fought in 95 85 oh yeah that makes sense that's probably exactly it that means I was 18 yeah yep haha

over there junkyards junkyard yeah yeah man I know dudes who built cars they would they would go the junkyards like I gotta get this fender I gotta get a good fender for a 70 Chevelle they go and look and that's kind of fun you know if I had a hundred lives one of the things I'd do is build cars I think that would be the coolest shit in the world you know and I envy the fuck out of people who've done that or have the time yeah that's the thing at the time the people who have learned how to do it and get a frame and figure out how to get the frame all sandblasted powder-coated and then you know figure out how to put the suspension on and fenders and like to really take a car apart and restore it and restore it and have it look beautiful and then drive around and then you see those guys that do that he'd go wow that's an admirable quality there's like that's like something very few men would ever do but every man admires a man who could do it like Oh me and my brother we restored this 1969 Camaro you remember I read that Matt Hughes did that Matt Hughes who is also at the time UFC welterweight world champion also restored classic cars that's a man you know that's a fuckin man like if you take it you rebuild a car and they get it to the point you did that that's a that's a manly activity right there brought it back to life that's one of the most manly things you can do rebuild a car guys who work on their own cars that's a rare breed son my dad always worked on his car man he never went to no mechanic yeah he would go out the he be out there like changing the spark plugs out of the 73 Impala by himself in a rain dude changing them he be out there in a parking lot man like oh like renting his own stuff to take the motor out of the car and put a new motor in and put it on the end from kind of man and I'm liking my dad never like he like like most dads would invite you and Philippe gonna help me out yeah my dad never wanted no help the first time I try to help you know what go kill your fucking toys you just probably the wrong wrench asshole oh judgmental daddy thing is too like they get locked into that they don't want you distracting them that's the the way they're escaping escaping by working on this car and wrenching things down change carburetors and shit those guys you could do that that's a special type of guy there's like there's a special mechanic man it's like you know I mean you know a guy who could do it yeah here's where when you invite those guys to it I could get together yeah they always looked dirty he clean like even if even if you bring your invite your cool mechanic for the neighborhood to a party and he wear the tux you'd be like dad that goes John he still looks dirty Oh it's got crazy fingernail dirt yeah grease under the fingernails just never comes out you don't recognize him standing up hey here's a question Peter how many how many people get sick from working in gas stations I would think that like working in a gas station all those fumes like that shit's got to be terrible for you fumes and then all the grease and oil and you know Bri matching your big girl stuff oh the guys are always smashing their fingers and losing tips taping them fact man they when I was no the kid they used to be a guy that you fixed you know the toys the guy that in the neighborhood that fickle don't how to fix everybody's car right right right and it was this guy named Eli and there's a moment they were a big family but they were like 9 or 10 people in their family but this guy will fix your car but he also likes to party like he to party hard Joey like like but he was town but he was a Volkswagen genius Oh fix bugs man bugs where his thing but he also was a mean drug addict my friend Junie he was getting his bug fixed from here he had a rat was the oval bag a beautiful book this guy a light man smokes PCP he just he holding him holding the wrenches and staring at the bug for like three hours straight not doing shit Wow Volkswagens a different kind of car man like a bug you drive a bug that's different kind of human you gotta be a bug guys would know how to pick the bug yeah my friends Jimmy that same friend that I went to the boxing match to see make you word fight he also had a bug hit a blue bug was the most ridiculous car I remember being in it like we were laughing how silly it was because it was so he loved cars right oh love cause I'm aware of cars I remember you and Eddie Griffin in the same car that was clean well cool man you will come in there man like the fucking like the cleaner in shit like Harvey Keitel and I'm like you know what I mean - give me one of those cars I wasn't the fastest car she's looked cool well it here's the thing about those cars man they were really well-balanced like it was a good amount of power for the size of it it was a very light car like I want to say like the Acura NSX wasn't even 3,000 pounds so that was it I had a silver one I'm a Ferrari somebody bought mine you know Black was great right no I had two silver when we were at the wolf I had a silver one in like the late 90s and then I had a silver one in the early 2000s that's my that's it right there that was my car that's it right there so somebody owns it somebody bought it because I think I traded it in when I got something else but it was uh Joe Rogan thanks for modding it to perfection that guy's got it that's my car to this day that was one of my all-time favorite cars definitely not the fastest car ever drove but it wasn't about being fast it was about like the experience of driving it was more real tactile it's a very light car and it's a mid-engine car she's a little old right book is he hmm and it's a Japanese car it's a Honda so you know it's never going to break I never had a problem with those look I had two of them I had one I had it for like three years and I traded it in and I got this other one later but in between I had a Porsche and that shit broke down constantly I had a 19-hour 996 turbo which is like 2002 that shit broke constantly it just kept break-in man all kinds of crazy shit like the shift linkage blew two separate times where I would go to shift gears and it just disengaged and was just floating around on two separate occasions that happen where I couldn't shift gears and I was stuck one time luckily it happened while I was driving down the road so I was driving down the road and it popped loose and I was in second gear I said okay I'm gonna swine this bitch out and get to the Porsche dealership so I kept in second gear and just drove around in second gear through the streets like near Ventura Wow ridiculous they were just weren't they weren't durable glow fathom that Porsche but that's the new one side oh no I wasn't I wasn't really into driving fast when I'm what I like is a car that corners really well you know I like a car like that just it has a connection to the road dude look at that thing that's the new NSX that shit looks preposterous that's a preposterous looking vehicle play Knight Rider yeah the only problem I have with this car is the problem I have with all these cars they won't let you use a manual transmission they don't sell them with a manual transmission the problem with that is come on man we're not racing like oh I don't want it to feel good like if it feels people need to remember how much better it feels to drive a manual transmission everybody wants to not learn and since a lot of people don't never learn that's the problem they don't want to stall out look like an asshole that's too much work once you learn how to drive you still stall out I stall out occasionally but the fun that you have if with a car like that with a manual transmission it's so different it's like you're engaged you're shifting things first the second gear there's something cool about that and for whatever reason people are forgetting that it's a totally different experience when you drive a car that has a manual transmission versus a car that's not a Matic yeah more control right yeah well not really honestly you're better off with the automatic if you want to be totally honest the automatic is gonna go faster it's going to have a better choice of gear selection than you it's going to like like a lot of times in these racecar drivers take like an automatic Porsche like in one of the new ones they take it on track they don't even take it out of automatic they don't shift the gears themselves if it's a double clutch gearbox they put it in Drive and they just go because the things are so good at picking the right gear why fuck around so it's better that way really is better you have more control of the car that way but that's not necessarily what makes it the most fun then what makes it the most fun is you're engaged in the car you're shifting the gears but a smooth car yeah quiet yeah yeah yeah you could learn how to drive a stick it's not hard I've did it one time this guy taught me in rehab how to how to drive a stick shift oh yeah we're going downhill though oh well that's ridiculous I know what's the worst the top of La Cienega you get to the top of la CNE or right when you eat the sunset it's like a super steep hill you got to have an e-brake and the new ones they don't have a breaks the new ones have a bullshit button ebrake so you'd have a handle that you could just lift up and lift down those nonsense fix that like that's the whole deal if you're stuck in a like San Francisco Street oh my god and there's a red light and you got to go forward in a you know stick shift that shit is a heart-attack inducing I'm always afraid of rolling back on that corner of course yeah you have to have a mercy brake it's hard to do mmm wouldn't you you're a young kid and you're learning how to drive one and you want a crazy steep hill at the top of the hill is a stoplight like oh no that's designed for automatic cars if you have a stick shift that's a fucking pain in the ass of the UH I can't even ride a motorcycle motorcycle stall out to right same yeah yeah so most motorcycle guys would probably be able to transition to a stick pretty easy pretty simple being in neutral yeah I don't I never wrote him on a motorcycle it took some classes for a little bit but then while I was taking classes a couple of people I knew wiped out pretty bad oh fuck this this is too dangerous I think I wrote a Meany bite one time and or was I in San Jose this comedian named butch he let me write it mini bikes cool now someone without too much power is cool it's when you get into these like Hayabusas you know you can just go buy something that goes like zero to 60 in a second the fuck is that you just sell that to somebody you all you have to do is get a license get a license and then go buy the most insane two-wheeled vehicle the world could have ever you couldn't even imagine something existing a hundred years ago like a hundred years ago if you went back to one in 1918 and somebody got a hayabusa and brought it to you he'd be like what the fuck is this what is this there's a rocket yeah this is this doesn't make sense people who try it and go flying off of it we would do wheelies and fall on top of them to be like what in the fuck is this what are you doing with this thing and then someone could show it someone who knows how to ride some real motorcycle race car driver guy Evel Knievel know like one of those guys that does those I love what's that I said I love man what is that Irish crazy race they do where these people are they're going so in sanely fast it looks like they're going through the woods and shit I can do this is that it is Isle of Man yeah why is there a car there in front is the car for the cars driving with them oh that guy just wiped out right there son or these people that are driving when it's not the race this might just be your normal time they're maybe doing their own race or something yeah yeah maybe so I think okay this is the actual race this is the Isle of Man race and I don't think they allow cars on the road while they have the race but do these guys go fast as shit it's crazy they take hills and they're they're flying through the air when they hit the hills like look at that fuck bro what is this look how fast he's going 171 miles an hour right there yup and people to the left and to the right hide them that is so insane bikes are so insane and the fact that you know this is a fairly new thing in human history I mean this is new this is within the last hundred years we had anything that you could do that with and this speed that they could do it with now it's just fuckin crazy man like your your moment where you have to make a decision like if something jumps out in front of you how much time do you have that would be a I'm still waiting for a jet pack look people are fucking stupid wouldn't want to just go I'm gonna run when he comes by as soon as I see him I'm gonna run and I'm gonna get out of the way and then he tries to correct for you and wipes out yeah yeah it's like he was doing a wheelie before he could even get off gothis that you have to be so tuned in like I don't think we could even imagine how heightened your senses have to be to be able to stay on top of this with these cars to the left and right and tell me that alert man trees and shit there's trees everywhere these guys are animals look at them fly over the top like that fuck that is so bananas that is you watch I mean there's a video in real time of them all going over this hill yeah it's like that like assume you really get a sense of it right there when you're when you're riding in the POV their POV you get a little bit of a sense of it but you really get a sense of it when you watch them pass by stationary cameras these guys I mean are my cousin sort of like this I know there's like crazy people that doing highlights fighter pilots guys that go there a risk-taking fools brown and again this is just like what we're talking about with those strongmen dudes these are people that are they're hardwired to do incredibly dangerous things and I guarantee you these same people that are hard-wired to do these kind of dangerous risky things they would be like Special Forces operators there would be Navy SEALs they would be they would be people that are mercenaries yeah they can do things that other people probably don't have the nerves for and they're thrill-seekers like but then you could take a thrill seeker that maybe would have joined the military and put them on a bike or put him in an MMA cage or put him in you know a boxing ring and you get that same type of person like that those people all exist because you needed those traits you needed those traits in order to be successful to keep your civilization alive needed big strong murderous people you needed people that were crazy and weren't afraid danger you need a risk takers she needed to reward seekers you needed people who wanted to be the king and if you didn't have that you weren't gonna survive because there's other people that had that on the other side yeah that's what's crazy is we're figuring out how to filter that shit into sports now and all sorts of other aspects of life but it's these same instincts that have been around for hundreds of thousands of years that have turned people into what they are right now fuck man it's a trip really is a trip when you think about people just people in general like what the paths that people take to become who they are right now how to be this guy on a jet pack going 100 miles an hour down a street delivery weed very fast right yeah he's flying Jesus Christ this is one but this is not I don't think the fastest one this one that looks like a halo of jets around them but there's another guy that has one that are on his arms like like an Iron Man this is pretty new this was like earlier this month you're gonna get it if batteries get any better God would festival of speed yeah they're gonna get it they're gonna figure it out we're gonna get hummingbird wings bro that's what it's gonna be cuz have some shit well it's like but you gonna buy some cheap ones you know some from janky ones from overseas and the hummingbird wings gonna break off and hit you in the fucking head there'll be people no and down tougher than knockoffs wings yeah and then it would definitely be tripperz that would put like glowing lights on them that would cause people to have seizures you know like for sure like you know Burning Man style lights Olivia your hummingbird wings that would be amazing come on that would be one of the coolest things of all time Burning Man hummingbird glowing flashing light wings I'll be badass yeah Burning Man this artist wants to cover Burning Man in a massive NASA engineered blanket like 10000 square is it sorry 100 square meters for what to trip all what would happen it's supposed to reflect 97% of the heat that would normally stay down there so they're gonna do a portion of it I don't know if they're gonna think it's funny that I was just reading about this they tell you to take one of those space blankets with you if you're going hiking in the woods I'll give you going on a camping trip and you were you know you have like some survival stuff a survival kit one of the things they say is to get one of those because you build a fire and then you get under the blanket in the fire and the fire reflects off the blanket and it makes a big impact on the amount of heat it gives off and they think like for survival purposes it's a good move to have where did I when I hear that about I heard that on podcast hmm trying to figure out which podcast it was I'll try to remember but the those little tiny blankets they don't weigh anything either so it's like a smart thing for people to carry around with do they keep you warm supposedly so you know never see what it's warmer but they're really good apparently for for reflecting heat like they can keep your body heat in you know and and pretty effective compared to their size and weight which is like weird when they wrap people around although the middle layer burritos to go there's nothing to it but maybe that's why I chip Oatley uses those wraps there too full poisonous you pulled it twice you think you did in DC how do you know that's exactly where you got the food poisoning do you know the left the last thing I ate right and then how much time did it take between eating and you're getting food poison one hour one hour but I fell to like it's probably getting hot and then I just threw up and before before that one hour what did you really love a number did you eat anything else mmm okay it was it was the plain eight hours before the food poisoning kicked in I don't maybe three three the flight with five hours I know that's what this yeah but can I think most experts never talked at food poisoning expert I don't want to bullshit you but I think most people say that it's more likely that it was the food that was on the plane that got you why didn't he do the plane oh you didn't you know latter five routes class you're nuts you might have gotten it from nuts you sure it was food poisoning and not just like stomach flu I don't know man but it was bad for like three days I lost 14 pounds you know whenever people say I got food poisoning from this I always go you might have but I mean people don't know like how long it takes to get food poisoning it's a little long stick you think it was chicken you think how many how many hours does it take before food poison shows that one two three one two three oh maybe I'm wrong maybe one of the server has dirty hands maybe they used to think it was longer did they used to think it was longer I used to hear that it was like eight hours I thought you'd wait for it to digest but I mean well you can eat something that make sense then probably was too poorly then but I would say if like you'd eaten three hours earlier and then right after chip but well if they're saying one two three one is one depends what it is I suppose too well chicken right Nicole Iyer right oh that's scary people get that from salad yeah you have run off man's run off from the animal areas animal shit essentially yeah right you know a lot of times when they have these these farms you'll get a it rains and there's a lot of runoff and the runoff is carrying cows shit and pig shit and it's getting into the ground and it's getting onto plants and if they don't adequately wash these plants and you get them and you eat them raw you can definitely get sick see let Google that ecoli what is the cause of e.coli in vegetables I'm pretty sure that's the reason like something when you when you when I Drive to like when I do show them by say Lea or Bakersfield on the right hand side you know he passed by these cows yeah and then there's a lake and I always thought that was water but it was runoff it's all a lake of crap it's like this whole lake full of cow shit just fill in there that's so dark there's a lake full of pig shit outside this one pig farm one of those factory farms that where they have these warehouses filled with pigs and they flew over with a drone to get footage of it and you see this putrid disgusting body of water that's just shit and piss and mean it's massive did it's massive it's like a lake that you would think that you go fishing in its recommenced and where are we gonna put all that stuff it's gonna go into the ground they're not supposed to do that you know this this thing of figuring out how to make the most amount of money with having the least amount of concerns for the life of the animal is the total wrong way to look at it it's just but when you're feeding 20 million people and none of those people are aware where their food comes people start making decisions based on money and profit and then you get to this point where someone allows them to or we don't agree on what should and shouldn't be done or we don't agree on what we shouldn't shouldn't a force in force and then we get to this place where you have these buildings that are filled with pigs and you got a lake of piss and shit behind it and these things are jammed into these cages and they got a dead babies on the ground you're like okay what's that that seems like hell like you've you've created hell so that you can make bacon like that that is a that's a crazy that's a crazy way of contracting or getting your food but bacon tastes so good I know eco lies a large group of bacteria with multiple strains most of which are harmless and part of the normal flora of bacteria in the digestive tract harmful strains of E coli produce something called Shiga toxin which can be deadly the strain undercooked ground beef it's infected people through the consumption of undercooked ground beef something so it's uh it's a toxin that exists in cattle okay here it goes this time however the toxic strain of e.coli has been found on romaine lettuce which likely became contaminated from nearby cattle manure so yeah that's what the recent Franken yeah it's I think it's happened before that I read about it as well with other stuff I think it was spinach I think they had an issue with spinach in the past was produced again however when that when the news came out um Joe the other now we're watching freighters me perform in the head of spirits joke every it was done but it was hilarious to us he said I'm spinach um there's a there's a little thing of spinach and then he said there's a good tide of beat up Popeye so silly he's a funny dude hey there buddy he's so silly very nice guy though isn't he yeah a very nice guy funny dude though that like that kind of joke now's a good time to beat up Popeye guys yeah but that's not from the vegetables themselves that's the thing like that those kind of diseases are from you know their environmental toxins from the nearby stuff so the the lettuce was grown it grew with e.coli in it or it got on it somehow so even washing that lettuce you could not take it out I think you can I think you can I think if you wash lettuce you can take it out but if you cook it you much more likely to kill it like for broccoli and stuff like that are you much more likely to be able to kill it you know kale you just stir-fry kale but the crazy thing is like had that happen in the first place like was that a normal thing that would have happened on a regular farm like if you just if you just had a farm that wasn't a factory farm you just let the animals roam around just be themselves would that have happened is it still possible or is that only happened when you can you know contain a certain amount of animals in a certain area and then also try to grow vegetables in that same area too I mean I'm sure people got e-coli back in the day I'm sure it's not a new thing that people get so I just guess they didn't clean it well enough by the way they're doing it or before refrigerators for sure they probably got it right yeah they must have got it like crazy I bet people got food poisoning left and right before refrigerators oh yeah Oh before always had diarrhea before I'd know right before they was telling you um come to our restaurant our ship washing his hands you ever catch your dog eating some in the backyard and you're like oh well for sure he's gonna be sick now meanwhile nothing they need a dead rat they can find a dead rat and you catch them chewing on a dead rat you like what the fuck dude I thought we were friends why you eating a dead rat man that's so stupid get in the house we got nice next into the house you know and I'm thinking man he's gonna be sick get a rat nothing zero problems eight steak one time I left in my car overnight I didn't know asking me a great lunch oh it was so good eating the two and I was sick for three days lesson learned did you try to reheat it in the microphone as Gillett to thing I was working at a restaurant no that's why we made all the time so you knew the probably had to cook it again you thought it would be fine in the clear I really liked the seven-day old KFC but it was doing a refrigerator I didn't even cook it did I get you it was good no no thank you koc cold rocks no my favorite KFC is KFC cold with hot sauce yeah like Elia TECA habanero sauce that green shit what's up I feel yeah doesn't have the kind of kick though I don't have a you're right about that need more anymore it doesn't have the Kate don't have the spice but let the real big kick like other like Dave's hot sauce maybe that's too much fuck it's too much what are you doing fucking you know do you want to start like why eating that I thought Doritos are good though they're very I don't know but I mean there's like a habanero so there's a level of hots how about they were fucking hot habanero is hot fuck it's hot enough it's not it's fuck like that you could take oh shit there's a lot of good habanero sauces a lot of a lot of good ones but the something about habanero sauce on cold chicken I think does your favorite terrible afraid shake it no chance no no I don't I mean I try not to eat it unless I have to from starving that's all it's available but most the time I think man how are they getting these chickens these are those tortured chickens to live in those boxes yeah these chickens have bigger breasts but then you pass by chick-fil-a and you're like what's the line about what's the bars of line so big delicious oh I could taste the bun and the mayonnaise and that chicken sweet sweet juicy warm chicken I have to fuck with a little chicken littles from KFC a little dollar sandwiches mmm the thing is man what you know what happened to get that chicken sandwich in your hand if you get a video if they give you a little clucking every every chicken sandwich you buy tickets and what you buy comes to the documented life of the chicken you know you could you get a number like oh this this is number two one six and you go to the website and you could access the video of the chicken living from the time it's a baby chick so times growing up check and a dude the fucking gloved hand grabs his fucker it's tough some of the cage and feed somebody gets bigger and he's stuck in this cage and they take him out whack his fucking head off throw them into the furnace to blow off all his feathers pulls the the guts out of them cook them at KFC if you could see all that if you saw it from start to finish you'd be like roof or they tell you how much doing here or they'll tell you how much water was weight used to feed this guy but we need more water yeah for sure but that doesn't disturb me as much as like the life of a pig that lives in a cage that's in a warehouse filled with cages that's created a river of shit right next to a swimming it I like wild animals man I like the way they taste I like the idea behind it what's that moose tastes like it tastes good that is delicious I had deer burgers and one time and beer Malcolm will cook he would hunt deer in Ensenada and he would make it like carne asada pork whenever yeah hot sausages and it was good a lot of people saw us come here yeah a lot of Americans go to Mexico to deer hunt the evidence another big deer hunt yeah but is there's another place Rosarito what starts with an S Senora Senora Senora has a lot of big deer there people go there to hunt deer scared as fuck they're scared or Mexico I gotta get me okay I'm over here it's weird man they hunt deer over there and turn them into tacos there's a wild ranging free-ranging herd of buffalo in Mexico - really yeah they must have shot a movie there one time and brought him buffaloes and then left them there I wonder because I've had buffaloes I think there's buffaloes then some Catalina Island or I don't know where Catalina right yeah they asked how to get there while they shot a movie was anybody a buffalo they left them there oh that's interesting there used to be an island like one of those islands off the coast of California that had all kinds of wild animals that people brought all these animals over there to try to turn into a wild game Park they had like deer and elk and all kinds of shit Roman runs one island and then the biologist said yeah enough of that like this is crazy got a tiger all these things are breeding there's no predators like this is an eco-disaster then human beings have created so the story that I had heard was that they decided to gun them all down I won't find out if that's true Jaime find out that's true Channel Islands is that what it was Channel Islands that's one of those I did a show at a military gig in the one of the islands Saint Nicholas Island oh yeah you were telling you about this yeah yeah you told me about this a while ago right yeah it was a it was a it was like a mill they do armed they do they test nuclear weapons there in the ocean yeah and it wasn't that it was just a quick gig at a bar and it was crazy because the show ended at 10:00 and like against the bar closed at 11:00 but like five minutes before the bar closed ten military police came in and make sure it's closed Wow and then we left that when they say we're leaving at 5:00 in the morning they're leaving at 5:00 in the morning there was no lagging like I was running late they almost left without me oh shit this is 5:00 in the morning you're supposed to get off yes and head to your flight yeah well yeah you can't fuck around there son we did some of you have season two military bases we did quite a few of them there you know did the one down in San Diego we've done and Texas denim in North Carolina I believed in him a lot of different places but they get super enthusiastic man fights on the bases and it would be you know on I think they did it on Spike TV I think that was on Spike at the time but uh it's heavy shit man it's interesting really interesting they might have did it on Fox 2 maybe on fs1 a one of those Fox Sports channels maybe Fox Sports 1 but it's uh it's not like nothing else man when especially the military guys fight if one of the guys like one time Tim Kennedy was fighting and he's fighting a half way on the towel it was a real world class fighter a real tough fight and Tim Kennedy caught him with a left hook boom drops him with his left hook and then he's on top of the cage and they're cheering him in I mean though that we had gone to break to like he wasn't doing this for the cameras he was doing this like to express himself to these people that he just fought for they're screaming cheering from him to cone nuts and he's pointing at them telling them I love you I love you then you know I'm doing this for you guys heavy shit man what a fellow soldier is that that base and then they all cheer for him and he wins like that it's intense human beings how appreciative were the people there for you today super super super but so happen if the anybody huh not just so happy to see anybody but to have like a crazy event like a UFC on their base and they get to go and see it you know it's a great treat for them break up the monotony it's good for the morale man fuck yeah man that's big man you got to have him around and the Vikings do that especially did mushrooms people love like I'm pretty like people who listen to your show man you don't know like how happy you make him you know I run into people when they say hobro thank you for having me on it was a pleasure and they always talk about hobro like they would say I wake up to you to you and they talk about you like they want to want to be here they like everything you say man and and I remember when I was I was I was walking down the street the other day and I ran into a guy and he told me um amen I was locked up and Corcoran state prison for tweet for like many years and I'm you one last coming your on Last Comic Standing helped me get through the hard times our whole you our whole our whole whole lot our whole prison alio here's what were they called the whole block was rooting for you you know we were gonna ride if you didn't win Wow and I'm thinking wow man least fucking inmates are watching me and they're voting for me Wow from with the prison phones Wow and now remember likely one of your guests was here around George Perez yeah I write I used to write to him I remember one time I was I wrote on my 7/7 page letter stay up you know and he will call me in the middle of the night George Perez from prison like in the middle of like an 11:00 at night if you people are you doing being free fool enjoy my freedom back Oh what's he like caught everything is doing good man he would tell me that he was doing comedy shows in prison for the guards for extra extra extra lunch Electra chips Georgia funny dude man to the Beast it's a funny guys good joke writer - yeah man yeah yeah man I mean that's how Joey started to you know Joey Diaz started in prison making people laugh so near they would like they would have something going on it would be boring they're like throw the Cuban up there and throw the cubed up there and Joe go up there and make everybody laugh that's how he got started then that was a big part of like what Katie gave him the confidence when you when you started that you go at it or that you go read a book or like what you know what you were gonna do when you started stand-up how did you approach it I just went to an open mic night and I got real lucky that it was available they could sign up it was it Boston stitches August 27th 1988 and you could just sign up you could just go in there and put your name into the Hat and you know they got to pick X amount of people I forget how many 20 people or something like that and everybody does like five minutes and I just got lucky it went up and just said wow I think I can do this you know I think I did you know I wasn't good but I was definitely thinking this could this is this is something that you could get better at you could figure it out and you could do it but I remember thinking like there's no way I'm gonna ever be able to have a real job I'm just too dysfunctional way too dysfunctional I was way too crazy like I had a lot of Drive but like the idea of being in office and being trapped like that I felt like a like a caged in alley cat like there's no way man I gotta get the fuck outta here he fed there was more out there huh I just was too a DD man you know I mean it might not have even been an ambition thing as much of an intolerance thing it wasn't that I had like this grand plan for myself like I thought I deserve better and I'm gonna be the top of this from fucking kick-ass uh-huh it was it I couldn't do that I can't do it but there's something about like monotonous boring shit my brain is screaming for new experiences always that's my number like it's a good thing it's also a bad thing because sometimes you just can't you can't concentrate on things because you want to think about other things that are better and more crazy and more exciting more fun so it's like trying to manage that mindset with a regular job is almost impossible to me I just couldn't do it I tried I just - I didn't give a fuck I wanted to quit done can't do this I feel like it was just a constant grind on your skin yes pulling your skin down and dragging you into this state where you didn't want to exist you know and some people were different some people have no problem they find a great job they're super happy they make friends with the people they work with and every day is a pleasure and they just get in there and they laugh and joke around but I'm too fucked up I can't sit still I have a million other things that I want to do while someone's talking to me about some boring shit I've got like five other things I want to do Mike I can't do this I got to get out of here like I can't take this so I was like stir-crazy if I had a regular job yeah I was a rehab over the rehab pick in 1992 or the drug rehab for crack damn I was I was out and when I was in there somebody asked me um what are your goals in life you know what do you want to do and now I'm here with a bunch of heroin addicts guys from you know it was a rehab and then he told to write down fighting so I I never had goals before so I wrote that I wanna be a comedian I wanna go to Italy could I love Olive Garden and I wanted to show her Mexico because I love taco but hell yeah that's the same shit I know right just I want to do it I wanna do the real tour of idiot not just a little plate so I didn't know how to go about it man I just went to the Los Angeles Public Library this before social media and I went there with my bald ass gangster bald head and I told the old lady that his old white lady I'm sort of listen man I don't know how to tell you this or how to explain it to you okay I want to be a comedian I want to do stand-up comedy but I don't know I don't know how to write I don't know how to how to I could put a joke together so then she put me to this she went to this big ole you know those big old library glossary card with yeah and she found comedy writing and she got me this book called comedy writing step by step by G Perret uh-huh Wow did you follow it I did I followed it as I learned then I would go back every day and I rent videos of Lenny Bruce and cassettes of um George Carlin from the library and a friend of mine when I was a little boy he had loaned me this VHS and back then I'm if you fuck with the VHS tape you could make it go six hours instead of a three hour movie or you downgrade the quad so I had like six comedy specials that I watched you know they're all HBO's it was Holly Mandel Paula Regas when you wearing that little Christmas sweater yeah and Sam Kinison I'm the young comedian show with Seinfeld and now Jeff Jeff what what yeah ronnie was hosted in the Diceman was on that tape so I just all got all that stuff and that's what inspired you yeah and then I would look to a library on your write down like ideas one day I pray how old youth I was 23 24 like this oh yeah and I wonder I paid 12 bucks and I went into the main room to watch a real show and I saw him in SIA I saw some do name of the Todd the time yeah and I saw this all white black dude with a fedora white hat Tyree yeah Tyree Tyree I just thought that guy that does the props he's - like he's to inflate his body into like an Elvis he's one of the blue color of comedy he's just props he brings out people and I don't know and looked aureus I saw Luke Torrez who one of the blue-collar comedians just props used to inflate himself you but he's not a hidden tour with them be within the show okay he's to like like put it like gonna iron and burn himself in the Hilda book and then his face will be on a higher that's fine they don't do that anymore and then he had like this bit where there's like a but he's like a football player and if people chasing them he like a fake football player yeah Oh who's this Heath hi yes very funny guy fucking hilarious a very funny guy remember when he had to the church sermon yes - choir rather andum yeah yeah and they would move around he had like these people behind them Holt he had this whole contraption yeah he was a really funny dude yeah so that was what year was that well like 1994 problem Wow that's when I first started going there man then out from that I just went to the natural fudge and I met Brian Holtzman there Cynthia Levine Freddie Soto Albert man the moody twins ringing Donna crazy lineage man what's it's just so interesting art form you know you get to know these really bizarre people and you get to get close to them very very unique way to live your life as a you know as a person in a strange group of vagabonds just trying to make people laugh yeah I realized where I took at Dodger Stadium and I used to work at Yoshi Noah when hey Dell normal was playing while I was cooking food every day like it's making Japanese food and every time I will see a comedian I was asking for advice he knows I'm so young and I will talk to t kick harder TK Carter I'm out okay Carter he was in the thing punky brewster the teacher but you remember TK Carter was in the thing he was in that he was in a bunch of big time movie back then he was in John Carpenter's The Thing I know another woman there that was armed she was part of the comedy store I it was curly hair and now she did a special which Paul Rodriguez from prison she did it with him yeah what did she do she do this kind of comedy hit her at him and with her Paul Rodriguez and Anthony Michael something hmm Wow I forgot her name oh she's famous she's famous old school old school man yeah yeah it's interesting it's so much easier to get more inspired or to get inspired rather today cuz kids can just watch all that stuff that you just brought up on YouTube on YouTube plus all the shit that's happened no bus rides yeah no bus rides and you do it any time you'll anytime you're anywhere you know you put the headphones on family sitting there watching the whole comedy special my first company I bought I listened to was Bill Cosby my brother Russell whom I sleep with first time for me and my friend Jackie escalera um he he put it in the little fisher-price record player and I memorized it and ever up until then I never memorize anything mmm it's crazy and then um Richard Pryor that nigga's crazy that was a fuckin album ever all-time you can never get an album together unless you cut up and say five nigga killing a white woman where's the body simple bro yeah it's so simple and Joel quick the way that's what good I brought up I know racist jokes they're so easy yeah but so they're like so simple but I didn't come up with it well that one I mean you got to realize the world is a different place when Richard Pryor was doing that man the world was a different place and to be first to well he was not necessarily first I think this is what it is is there's like this progression and I think that you know what comedians get inspired by the other ones that around them and they were really just starting it in the 1950s and 60s right so then there's Lenny Bruce who's probably the first guy who does our style of comedy I'm just talking about things like what the fuck is this like what is this ladies and gentlemen why is this happening who caused this what instead of just telling a bunch of jokes he's talking about things and pointing things out that happened to be funny and then Richard Pryor comes on after him and makes it way funnier so what he did was like the same kind of thing but way funnier like Richard Pryor had there was another level of evolution that he achieved inspired off the work of the guys that were before him the Mort Saul's and the yeah you know those guys inspired Pryor and Pryor of course inspires everybody it all comes from prior like in the early it's like Lenny Bruce is just this genius mind-opening guy that's dealing with people that are asleep he's in the world of the 1950s and 1960s or people just asleep they're weird they that they're disconnected from the world around them from critical thinking it's like they're just yeah they're just starting to wake up culturally and then BOOM Richard Pryor takes that and turns it into the funniest shit that anybody never said oh yeah right my all-time favorite comedians always been Richard Pryor George Carlin part of the tedious there's a lot of great ones man oh man a lot of great ones you know did you get a chance to see Richard Jeni at all I did Petipa's man yeah he was funny dude dude he was funny he doesn't get the credit he deserves no he was really funny man here like a lot about all those vh1 half hour specials yeah and he was a lot he would he was on our senior how many times dude he was on everything yeah he's done a bunch of Letterman's tonight shows he did tonight show a ton of times he was a monster also I got when I work here in Dodger Stadium I saw one of my one of my favorite comedians and I and I was working I remember Joe so fucking dirty I was greasy bro I had fucking peaches a chicken on my my apron and I saw Stephen Wright oh sure he was buying a hot dog and I said and I was telling everybody I don't know that guy yes this guy Oscar winner homie you know the full-width bitch I'm super comfortable yeah very uncomfortable that fucking Stephen Wright dog you're that guy we're done and I went around the hotel where and I went around and it goes you're gonna pay for shit all right he goes cuz you'll just walk out of here he was better there Larry then I said because we started shake my shake his hand and he put his hand inside of his hoodie oh he's sleeping he shook my hand was the same no I'm sorry it's all right he's like a germaphobe germaphobic cereal I don't even know that's why he didn't he shook my hand with cotton that's hilarious but I must have freaked them out to about well you know your strong cup of tea he's a super white guy from Boston I know mad cuz I know you don't go nowhere I get starstruck don't invite me to places start but don't go nowhere it's a real problem statement when he said don't go nowhere he's like this is not a Stephen right nice to meet you you really funny thank you very much appreciate it I'm gonna get a hot dog now you forgot here I don't know where I remember P next to John Ritter at Dodger Stadium man
