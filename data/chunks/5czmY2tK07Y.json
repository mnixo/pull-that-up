oh gosh yeah sir everywhere yeah you know hi Oh folks stick together yeah what is it about Ohio we live what is it about ohayou ohayou Lake Ohio Cleveland Columbus you guys all stick together that's how we do it man ah just good people yeah even when you won the title you like leave oh we got a champ yeah Ohi always everybody loved it so much I don't know I just think it's the mentality of people that just the people are awesome um you know it's just hard to explain I think you got there like you know there's people that have lived in our states and move to Cleveland Ohio and ya know I get it now I see why you guys like you guys are so like in depth with each other awesome like you love each other right yeah Mary just like it's only nation it is weird like Columbus in particulars like one of my favorite places to visit it's like one of the it's it's like I get the weather sucks a lot I get it but the people are so damn nice like it's like overall it's like a really good spot yeah yeah I love Columbus - I've got a bunch of blurry nights there down there I with brothers and all that good stuff but I love Columbus - it's one we know the one down there and treasuring for like we go down the Arnold and stuff like that all right checking it out you know the cool anime fights and and our local shows - we have like about our coaches were down there for local MMA shows remember when these do the UFC with the Columbus with the Arnold yeah there was a big event there was a bit I wonder why that stopped that was always a lot of fun one time that strike force there that's when I how the fuck is a heavyweight champ in the world never been on a podcast well I've been on podcast like over the phone but not like oh yeah yeah so um but I think it was I Strikeforce is when I Rousey and Kate fart and that's okay - Rob oh yeah yeah I think I think that was one of them yeah I think so yeah back in the day so what's the like walking around the UFC heavyweight champ in the world how's that feel that's good my household I'm like fourth on the ladder it's my wife then the two dogs and then me I'm there just to pay bills it feels like that sometimes right yeah the money machine but so as everything good now you you've finally got a title fight you finally got a real challenger in Francis and gah No On January 20th how do you feel about this I think is a great fighter you know definitely uh he brings it it's hard you know but you know unfortunately nothing's gonna change I'm walking out with a ball still wrapped on the waist and you know I'm excited for him you know he's gonna shot but as long as I'm here no one's gonna be champ damn do you have to have that mentality what do you think about him that's unusual well like what what about him other than the size and the strength what stands out I mean he's power I guess you know but I think everyone is tired in the heavyweight division I mean 260-pound man 250-pound man I mean yeah you know you know you're not supposed to be hit by something like that and I know JD I thought JD that's a far enough stuff on my client I mean I guys you know too hard ya know and you know he just thought he's a little wild too which is that's tough you know sometimes you can't prepare for that did you just punch you don't see right to punch it Alistair with a wild hook yeah things wide understand well I think there's a little bit of both on both ends yeah you know we were just kind of you know sloppy and then put his face right in the lane and yeah Overeem's got a weird style now right it's a it's a totally different style over the last couple of years you know but he does awkward stuff you know like when you fought him what did you how did you feel well when I fought him he was like very traditional moving around running but I kept yelling keep his distance I'm like oh it's a fight you know and then I you know he try that that lunging down Oh what kind of cake to my thigh and I grabbed it in time took him down but you know I mean watched the whole fight with maganda but I what I saw was he's doing all these wild punches um yeah you know when he fought me he's throwing straights and you know it was you know I think within Ghana was almost like he felt like he could not get hit which was correct right so he just decided to be just completely wild and unpredictable I mean through that wild lunging left hand to fight off and then got the clinch immediately but wasn't able to do anything with it yeah yeah you know I'll find out Jamie xx you know I think I'll be all right but you know the best coach in the world you know I'm pretty confident walking there you know he's big dude throws hard I mean but that's every way it doesn't take much well the only time we've seen him on his back was which fight was it taking that was credits play it took him down yeah that was his first UFC fight right hmm yeah that was an interesting fight right you got a chance to see but it's it's hard to see when a guy is really young in MMA it's hard to see a fight from three years ago or whatever that was and then look at him and say well that's the same guy today cuz it's not right yeah yeah I mean I've definitely changed that's coming one thought for sure you know I think you know he's definitely gotten better there's no question um but you know see what happens you know I'm glad they were broke yeah I'm gonna throw a win you always do yeah now um this is January 20th and right now what it was it's December 13th or something with the second know about their fight oh no today yeah so like how much time did you have to prep for this wasn't prepping y'all been working out I've been you know staying in shape so did you have a feeling that January was going to be the card yeah so when the UFC lets you know it but what how do they how do they do that how does it work he's a contact my manager like hey you know that's what we're thinking mm-hmm no you be ready so yeah I was little beat up after the the gds fight you know with my shin and everything not just my shin by other things and just had to heal up a bit so i took me awhile you know everyone thinks I'm just trying to hold on to the belt and just yeah but uh you fought everybody yeah this we gonna do I can't make everyone happy but uh but yeah I mean I was beat up a little bit and just had a lot going on and so you know yeah the JDS fight was interesting right because that chin was swelling up hard man couldn't leave that like yeah I feel fine awesome like man some feel right you know I just I could feel like the Russia like blood in my shin and I'm like hmm it gives me again a way to checked it I like girl I gotta hurt I got this chasing them down finding my opportunity and thank God I got it it's so interesting that after all these years in MMA a new trend surfaces and that trend is the low leg kick the low leg kick to the shin in the calf area it's devastating yeah now you saw it with Benson Henderson I think was the first guy to really bring it to the UFC and really like to make it a big part of his arsenal but you know you're seeing it with so many guys now at the low leg kick is just a giant technique sucks right well you can't condition that part of your leg so no same I think some people are different some people it's gonna be real bad thanks yeah one time use bet like for me it sucked it was terrible I go up the stairs after that fight was like the hardest thing ever just look like your leg was broken like it swole up so quick I was wondering if you had like a the fibula was cracked or something like that yeah my doctors actually was super pumped about it cuz he's like oh my God look how deep this bone bruise is this is amazing so he's a good dude and he just loved the show my coach my coach like awesome so what did you like put it on an MRI or something like that he saw the pictures and he's like Maddy bone bruise like it's pretty bad yeah it's amazing to me that you know you think of all the techniques in martial arts that this technique becomes like a prominent technique in 2016-2017 yeah you know I'm still trying working my jab right now 2016 so over that it takes off for a while no but yeah it's funny how you know mixed martial arts there's one thing and then like nobody started you know there's one guy who's a wrestler or gal Jiu Jitsu won't gap now it's you know training and training more and more and and you know you got guys are like you know sprawl and brawl yeah it's just crazy watching how sporty balls it's amazing actually well you you're an interesting case because you're a guy who does everything right you're not a one sport specialist like you didn't come in as a kickboxing champ like Overeem or like Mark Hunt you know you you came into the sport with everything you know you were you're one of the new guys we're essentially you know you do everything you know you're not either you're not a specialist you yeah yeah I think so yeah I mean I rest my life and they're not you know actually I was it was my coach actually who made it better because when I started training to mix martial arts he literally was like I would take a run down to my office yeah no no me go he's like every time you say take someone down I'm gonna stand right back up so yelling have a fight I'm like oh and I just got a crappy out of me for a you know wow I like learning how to use my hands better and then you know I took a little time off just do go and goes boxing and know here we are when did you start MMA yeah that's not that long when you think about it and now you're the UFC heavyweight champ yeah took a year and a half off just for boxing really just to learn how to use your hands better yeah it's probably a good move right that's great best especially coming with a wrestling background but you have an overall athletic background too like you paid paid baseball you know you you're you're a multi-sport guy yeah I tried yeah I tried but I yeah you know I definitely long you know the rest does help me out and you know make it sure I think baseball definitely helps me out too just because of the reaction and do I use my hips and stuff like that definitely yeah I would imagine you know I think that having a bunch of different skills like like have you one you I'm sure you're a boxing fan did you watch the low mischenko I mean what I thought was fascinating about the commentary they were talking about how his dad making made him take four years off and just do Ukrainian dancing that's how he got his footwork really yeah his father said you want to be a fighter he goes well you're gonna take four years off of fighting and just learn traditional Ukrainian dancing yeah I mean his fucking father's a wizard man nailed it nailed it you know they asked his dad like when did you know that he was gonna be the champion he said before he was conceived oh shit that's got some Russian chip cranium my god Soviet Union type shit watch like it's like it's like it's like poetry I don't know he's like everything even body shots his slides out of the way of body shots he slides out of the way of body shots the weight like a Muay Thai guy slides away from leg kicks yeah you know I'm saying like it's he's just moved so much different than anybody I've ever seen box before in his last four points the coaches threw the towel in yeah I'm wondering what I think he's one of those guys it's like a bar raiser right like where he's just raised the bar where people look at what footwork is and then look at that kind of okay this is not just like moving around a lot everything's so purposeful like when he turned around them when Regardie out like he put his hand on his head and then spun all the way around organi I was like what in the fuck is going on that's crazy like mind-blowing yeah because it's not like he got out like struck by a bigger heavier power puncher now you got the shit boxed out of him like he was just pop up double jab pop up oh it's like watch that guy I mean sorry try it comfortable here yeah I mean just detect I just it's like I'm so happy to be like alive to watch this yeah I watch views on that guy oh there he is right there I mean just the fucking guy barely gets hit I mean there's no one like him in boxing because what he's doing is he's standing literally right in front of you and he's unavailable it's not like he's like dancing all over the place and moving away he's doing some shit and he doing it in a way that nobody else is doing like Floyd had a lot of shoulder rolls and he's slick as fuck and Floyd stands right in front of you too and he ties people up and shit but what lomachenko is doing is just some total next-level shit drop chilling carry you yeah he does a lot of very interesting stuff but I'm wondering like if we're gonna see this in the future now I mean you know obviously when Ali came along a bunch of guys started imitating Ally yeah you know when Tyson came along bunch guys try to imitate Tyson you always see that yeah I wonder how many guys were gonna figure out a way to take that to the next level yeah I think you know I think some guys are gonna tell you tonight not that I mean I don't know if they're gonna catch that level that's that's just well that you know what the next level is that but with like Roy Jones jr. power yeah yeah like if someone figures out a way to move like that with that kind of footwork but that one punch go to sleep yeah you know knockout power baby say yeah that's probably the next level we'll see it I mean this is a amazing time for for all combat sports I think I think the bar like I think with all sports right like if you look back at the olden days and look back at today the athletes are bigger they don't want to train better they're faster but I think and anywhere that's more apparent than MMA I feel like MMA is like the best example because it's so new yeah I understand like you said like it's always something always evolving like you know I mean like it was a John Jones a teep that thye yeah like that you know couple years ago they started one started doing it and then you know like Ben Tennyson doing the you know I mean just I don't know I just I just love it because there's always evolving you know you like you really cannot take like two months off and if you do people gonna pass you up yeah and it's interesting too it's like there's different schools of thought right there's like the aka school where you have all these killers in one room and you have like world champions beating up world champions and and then you have your gym which is much more specialized you know it's like you're the big guy to emerge from your gym then it's been Jessica I and some other high level MMA fighters coming out of your gym but that's a like a lot of people think that's the way to go to have specialized training like max Holloway has specialized training we're like you know there's not you're not dealing with a bunch of people that are already champs you're building champs yeah that's right we're like at my gyms awesome like my coach Marcus man marinelle he it's like a homegrown man guys come in and he just makes him better we all ah you know you and like you know I don't get any specialized training liked anyone else like I don't go out you know everything's you've pushed aside because a guy you know like like if you've got a fight they're going first and then I go you know I'm right I'm not better than anyone else yes I'm a champ I don't I don't look at it that way I look at that guy you got a fight coming up you go first I'll push my training back later you know like I don't care but yeah like it is great watching like you know our gym like guys coming in they're like I'll something like to come out like a few months later these guys are killer if you like Jesus like can't Alexia I 205 pounder kids an animal like he keeps me young he just turned probably was third pro fight on my cat dang I come in some days I'm like isn't it interesting how those guys like that in the gym and then for whatever reason it never clicks for them like there's some guys that are just so insanely talented but they just don't have whatever it is whether it's focus whether it's the discipline to keep going when things get weird to just finally realize their potential like what separates a guy like that that's like a gym killer from a guy like you who can perform one of the bright lights you know when I when I was fighting UFC I don't mean the whole story here but it's why I was think I'm fighting you know I was like 9 no I lost the truth you know I thought was unstoppable and it's true beat me I'm like the homeless didn't wanna fight anymore I was I don't know if I'm ready for this anymore and then came back for Nelson a couple more fights and then loss of JDS and Lily when I walked in the back locker room I was like I'm down I'm like I don't care anymore like I don't care what happens I'm gonna go out there I'm gonna train and I want to do is put it all out there I'm winning I'm gonna lose I don't really care it's gonna happen is gonna happen you know but I'm gonna go out there and get my damnedest to win and we do whatever got you and I just don't care so but some so something switched in your head we you can kind of see it like when you're doing one of the things I've always said about you when you walk out the fights and during the staredown you're like stoic you're like you give them dead eyes you just like you like you're there here we go look when you fought for doom when you fought for doom in Brazil and knocked him out in the first round you look at your face while you stand in there is like you might be waiting like the fucking car wash you know I mean you could be anywhere yeah you're not you don't you're not mean muggin them you you've you almost got like that fade or face going on or you're just like here we are yeah you know I get I think at that that face from like when my wife yells at me no no no yeah yeah I just you know I just looked at a lot really it's not Kerry I'm like you know what I'm not gonna like we're like get emotional about stuff like I don't care like all I care about is like I'm married my beautiful wife takes care of me end of the day no matter what happens in this play game she's gonna be there for me she likes me for you know who I am not cuz I fight she likes me cuz you know I made her laugh I do good things for her she does good yeah I mean just like like a marriage should be and you know and like she was there before all this you know all this stuff happens so like she's not I got what they call it with Gary but yeah so like there you don't she's been there the whole time and you know that's what I love about her and you know and I just so you're anchored yeah yeah you know I just stop carry on she's like who cares if I lose you know I'm gonna go out there I'm but I'm very competitive so I'm gonna go out there and do everybody to win yeah Randy Couture's said that once he was talking to young fighters he was saying you can't be worried about losing the people who love you or always gonna love you not gonna lose anything you're just gonna lose a contest and if you're getting Turing into something like a mixed martial arts fight someone's got to win and someone's gonna lose and you got to learn from those losses and you know some of those losses that devastating feeling like I'm sure was there for you after this true fight huh that that the rebuild from that is what makes real champions yeah you know definitely I helped them I actually took my mom there she didn't want to fight she never seen me fight but like sitting on you know and learning they got those big double-decker buses right so we're going back in my head's like he's throbbing I'm like guys I'm Johnnie Mack and my coach our next anybody he's trying to be laughs Austin they're talking and I look out the window at that hotel and my mom's focus to gradually fucking high school right now like who does that you know when I get there I grab there like maybe feel better like like you said like no matter what happened you know always gonna be yeah you know some was gonna be there no matter what happens they're gonna love you no matter what yeah your family's always your family your friends always your friends and if they're not they were never really your friends in the first place exactly you probably better off that way sometimes it's good to have some losses just so you realize who's just gonna abandon you yeah right now yeah that makes sense so do you do you have any mental coaching they do do do anything like that I did I did for a little bit back in the day after a shoe fight he was a surfer I talked to a sports psychologist which it turned into about a minute talking about fighting the next was about my personal life had nothing to do a sports it's just really just all I talked about just by half an hour just I did a few times I walked every time and that's when I start getting them intel like why do I care anymore like and stop can I not know you know I just don't Karim right like what was he trying to show she was she sorry I'm a sexist when you think about like your that's that's a critical component in keeping your mental state together right that's one of the things that a lot of people will talk about like having a good support group around you having the support system family friends real loved ones so in her or examining that do you think she was trying to like reinforce like what matters and what's important you know I never actually thought about that way she just knows he may be I've known her for a while no no but she I don't know I don't you know I thought about but we just start talking she's plague so let's talk I when I said time off Friday I'm like you all this and that and I'm like yeah my girlfriend in the girls house like she's doing this to me yeah I mean and she's like no but I walk down I feel like so much better not even just because I'm funny I just I think you needed to clear all like our stuff out just yeah mine straight they say that for people to go to shrinks like if you go to a psychiatrist I've never gone but if you go like the best thing is just to talk about it like most people just keep things bottled up inside they don't have anybody to talk to about a lot of the shit that's going on inside their head yeah that was my Pam when I was younger actually you know like especially like my wife with one thing that made us better was that I communicate because I was like she get mad at me I'm like hold and finally one day I'm like - like that was like two weeks ago now right now it's just talking that lady and just opening up more and just when something bothers me I you know she hates it now cuz everybody listen you know you need do this like you know she go what's up - ugh I know you're a full-time firefighter - as well as being the UFC heavyweight champion huh how do you balance that well I'm part-time actually at two departments okay no but just ah he's just tough could be in full timing I didn't get hired full-time so I couldn't you know it's be tough to do both you know if I did before I'd be a lot easier but I can't just take a test cuz you're through probation year-long and then we can't write so while you're fighting you work part-time and do you have it set up where you know like you tell them in advance like hey I got a January 20th fight yeah sorry I already picked my schedule so a month in advance like one station I pick it within the first week I picked my host the whole month and then the next station we go like seniority so my I come up I pick my schedule so I make sure that you know it's ready picked out so I literally worked by five times in about two weeks now our show how much does that get in the way your training never never no no how's that work just the way I pick my schedule if I had to I could trade someone and someone's coming in I make it work and they're they're amazing people like those both stations are amazing they're the Chiefs are great the guys at work they I mean actually a lot of them are coming to fight caring towards oh yeah well that's uh that's an interesting thing about firefighters it's a lot of times you get those 24 hour shifts you know and where you know you get a chance to work out you can cook you know hanging out with guys it's like once the the duties are done around the firehouse right yeah I play a lot of Call of Duty little kid it's a crazy job because when when you have to do something what you have to do is so extreme and what's demanded of you is just insane like I'm sure you've been paying attention what's going on just a few miles from here yeah in Ventura it's out of control you know what's crazy is that we just went past there was a Getty Boulevard yeah Gettys honey that's all that getting and we just passed it today and it was like burnt yeah it was nice like a couple days ago that's what it would look like it was like shocking well la is a fucking mess you know the beautiful thing about California is we don't have any weather yeah it never rains but the terrible thing is once it gets crispy and the other night you know when this was all happening I was at my house and the wind was blowing like we're did they were calling it a dry hurricane because the wind was so crazy dreams were falling down all over the place and the thought was man if a fire gets lit here we're fucked and then boom they start popping up alright if you do it's a natural like no I don't think so I think there's a lot of psychos out there I think there's a lot of fucking people that recognize these are crazy fire conditions and they just want to light something on fire and they do and they step away and then next thing you know it's a 300 thousand acre fire it's crazy there's accidents for sure but I think for sure some of this is arson that's kind of yeah there's a bunch of fucking psychos out there that's what I think I think there's definitely some accidents and obviously those winds exacerbate anything that would have been a small fire like there was a small fire in my neighborhood a couple months ago but it wasn't when Dean the fire fighters jumped on it quick and they put the house down but man when the winds were the way they were me you were having chunks of embers that were flying six seven hundred yards away flying through the air this and that never where there was no way they could stay on top of it yeah that's that's like scary terrifying like we don't I mean we have like brush fires like six or seven inches yeah snow so yeah listen man snow you just need snow tires you know warm clothes snow tires you're good fucking fire storm not good yeah that's like okay that's scary like just just reading about and just seeing and doing the Patriots just you know you feel terrible for people you know we actually have friends in San Diego they had to get evacuated yeah they said there was 85% chance out there so begone Jesus they came back and within 1/10 of a mile the fire stopped they're gonna lock you yeah I've been evacuated twice that's scary yeah it's scary but you know you just got to get out quick throw the dogs in the back let's go fuck yeah you know part of its like cleansing like all that stuff in your house is not you your fucking TV or your clothes that's not you you're you yeah you'll be realistically they always buy a new one yeah just fucking stay with your grandmother for awhile you'd be fine as long as you get out you're all right rebuild get back it's sometimes it's a I mean it's not a good thing to lose everything that you work for but sometimes it's a good thing to know that you are vulnerable you know in these these fires like I think there's one thing that la is missing is humility that's brought on by the weather like you know how it is in Cleveland when it fucking snows right when it snows out and it's thick there's that feeling in the air where everybody calms down right everybody's like oh okay like there's no one driving like a fucking crazy psychopath with snow everybody's going real kind of slow slow and steady your back tires are kicking out a little bit you know what I mean like that that keeps people humble yeah we actually uh was it the weekend of uh was it which one New York med Square Gardens and you'll see what so I'm coming home and wife psych hey you know there's a huge storm comes like you know am i cool she's causing again my house we have actually a built-in generator so if the power goes out that's not like sweet dude awesome so every Saturday I would hear to kick down like awesome thing works great of course the tower needs to work the power goes out is dead boom the battery bust on it but up so we came home and I came home and I flew home that night and it was like a like a zombie apocalypse man it was like stuff everywhere like it was all dark those trees like on top it was crazy and then they said that 15 tornadoes touched down within between Indiana Ohio and and PA and so we came to my house and it was like I have one big tree my yard I've eaten half acres I have one big tree that magically got split in half Wow then our barn we have a barn it's a go it's like a little soft on the side that I have forgot ripped down that it was it was crazy like I mean there was like so much stuff like we had a gazebo I got ripped down like yeah he was like you say button yeah but you said it's humbling because you know you were not safe so but least we found out that the generator and working on over again because actually work the other day it probably it was so windy that the power went out and actually kicked down yeah there's something that like that's comforting about hearing that when I lived in Colorado we had a generator the power go out okay I'm safe yeah are you handy do you fix it what's that man like hey Mike what are you doing I'm calling your house Mike what he's a guy talk to action you need to fix something my god I'll see you at the gym so he comes over and does that for me I mean I do help mob but it's mostly it's I am you lucky yeah lucky know someone you can fix it I make it worse well especially if you live in a place like where there's fuckin tornadoes like can you is there a tornado proof house can you make a house like remember like Three Little Pigs remember like the guy with the bricks you can make yes yeah yeah you'd have to go you'd have to make something that like was underground yeah like some underground dudes have that remember remember when we were kids like a lot of guys had like not a lot of guys but people were talking about building bomb shelters in their backyard yeah that was like that thing yeah yeah yeah my basement sprint it's not bad it's got a few like cinderblock windows like the whatever that's about it I mean so you probably survive down there yeah plus me I like a little area and then who would like without like the furs and stuff so you had in there nothing oh do you work out at home at all no no no yeah actually I have a 3,000 square foot barn with radius was like warm all year round you know it's awesome and was I do you should put a cage training I'm like hell no this is my sanctuary this is where I go and I watch TV and I relax and I do fun stuff you know like no I'm not doing anything my wife does my wife you know she is a some on it stuff we have four little kettlebells and you know some ways she loves it so I you know she has a treadmill yet and she does everything there yeah that's probably a good attitude right to burn it all out in the gym and then home is peace yep that piece was a camp you know if I piss off the wife and it's not so peaceful how do you how do you like when you're the UFC heavyweight champion the world like that's a tremendous amount of pressure and stress play some call of duty I don't know just hang out I really I just chill I don't do much like you know John Volante him I play with him online with a bunch of guys from New York this is there talk smack talk shit little kids imagine getting your shit if you're playing online call of duty in the UFC heavyweight champions talking shit to you Oh what the fuck all my buddies actually we were playing with town when we mate and he's like come over kick your ass I was like just let me do it I like don't you I might just let them have this moment it's so funny get direct messages and stuff like threatening you oh yeah you're such a new fucking find you and I kill you I uh it's so funny you imagined the thought that would go through their head if they found out who the fuck they were talking to well the horror here's some 14 year old shit talking get a fucking coma House stick my dick in your mouth you find out you're talking to the UFC champ like oh Jesus oh yeah Jesus Lord some guy had no idea it's not being a ton of shit but we went to like about my party and we wanted to like just one man she knows it was crazy leaven fun they're like I think bunch of different Elvis Presley's whatever they're like always miles I'm with my wife from hanging out and I'm like sitting right there looking straight like not looking around cuz like no I doing girls like this you know and so anyway oh my god you wanted the Emily with some macaroni and cheese like yeah cuz they're like we're in lay back I never forget that macaroni cheese whether we get some mac and cheese and I came back did you talk to my wife and I'm like some like it turns around over here sometimes like I'm so sorry I didn't know I can't use me nightlife like he's

do you think there's any benefit to keep it a day job do you think like in any way it's like good for your head or anything I think so I definitely think so I think it keeps me grounded because I you know we'd only saw about fighting you know but like it just you know other things to worry about I was worried about fighting this and that keeps my mind off of it but I think also too is always a plan B you know IQ I could walk out of here trip and fall and break my hand and never fight again you just never know so that's why you keep the job a little bit but I really worked hard and make my mom proud you know I just plus I love help me well my whole life I guess I always been helped and so it's my cousin II might be in the Coast Guard police officer mm-hmm check out the fireman dude

mustache or who steak and potatoes potato salad they my coach Oh last I got to talk about I was when schwäbisch here now it's the other buddy's name what's named Bryan Callen yeah there's a who's that his brother or something murder in the Cajun Oh actually stairs on business off the mountain he's an actress that's someone that you're close to but it's always people that you kind of like in the periphery that have some stupid business idea they can't go wrong yeah can't go wrong those those people are my favorite this can't miss the idea I don't know I don't play that game plus my wife someone pretty much in charge of the money that's good so that's good you have like removal from it like hey I can't even do anything yes who who schedules your training like say if you're gonna do a big camp for like this in Ghana fight like who schedules what you do all the time oh my coach Marcus you only my systematizing I'm with this guy here I want this guy I think we should bring this guy in you know and just we kind of just figure it all out and so he have all this written out like he'd left a certain amount of rounds he wants a certain well strength and conditioning it so he's he or your overall trainer yeah he's my head coach you know he's the one figures everything I wear my boxing coach Alex I have my strength condition Bobby you know I'm Steve - yeah he's a grappling kind of more like just my dude just God makes me feel good about myself you know I just fund a yummy I tell apart and talk shit to him and make myself feel better about myself you know like I just sold fat like I feel good yeah I mean but yeah he mark as he sets it all up make sure it's all good you know I know Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and then you know just Saturday you take Friday's off how much strength of conditioning do you do I don't do too much I don't not like I won't be like heavy lifting you know because it's not a powerlifting competition it's a fight right so like on Tuesdays I do a posterior chain work for my lower back my have way Bob yeah what's a barbell sure you know the bell squat yeah I love that putting one in here okay yeah yeah dude Louie Simmons is the bomb good deal I love that guy he's a freak he we had one of the best podcasts ever with him he's so fucking crazy he's out of his mind my coach is acting like the O Jesus with a mermaid he worked out of his Drive I became like it is now like he used to like just train with him back in there yeah we went there give us a tour and that whole belt squat thing that thing's amazing oh it's awesome please like it gives you traction and I'm so much trained so you know I do that you know I mean they're the new ones even awesomer now - it's just great you can deadlift off of it and you like geniuses over there just - amazing job so I do love much of that like reverse Hyper's yeah I've got a reverse hyper machine back here yeah the pendulum swings real good - that thing's amazing yeah that reverse hyper is a back fixer oh it's the craziest thing I mean if you if you have a back issue ladies and gentlemen please just Google reverse hyper it is an amazing machine that Lois Simmons created and it literally decompresses your spine and strengthens it at the same time it is a work of art yeah I mean your fucking paper boy hat it's that thing's amazing man yeah but I feel like having that thing on you you would seriously develop some like real power in your in your movements and your ability to push off and I think for striking that would be fucking incredible that thing did three five-minute rounds at 290 so do you shadowbox what you're doing there yeah the first one I did marching then I excited back before I just a little bit I do I it's kind of funny but actually grab a bar and I thrust my hips okay works my hips and I'll through my lower back and then next time we did I thought with squat medicine ball throw it to one coach squat throw back back and forth five minutes and then I know and I like rubber bands mm-hmm keep moving a little bit like that and so you evolved this over over time oh yeah we actually bought the one put it back up again we sell a medicine ball that was strapped up and be like a muy Thai clinch mm-hmm we did that you know five minutes that was hot that was tearaway so that was actually not fun at all we did that then we had like on these massive like I would do both but there's these big metal rings like oval rings and their chin I don't know we just just lock her like this and keep your hands up and just so we're just working on keep your hands up put an axe in there your reverter max know what's a vert Amman so that's like it's like it's like plat for the platform he's got all its traps all resistance it's pretty cool so you jump no punch oh you know I had I think I have seen that before it's like it's strapped up to different parts your body yeah so you could throw knees and punches and kicks and stuff like that yes we add that to that so I need to operate on Browns you do it round round yeah so I go back and forth of that and stuff like they can one be I won't have you one when they're one resistance so are they do they monitor your heart rate no no I just push the limit I don't worry about it you know like I do listen my body fat I'm tired of remember struggling you know like the last camp for juniors camp I don't know what I was thinking but I did like I was already doing five five-minute rounds and then like the first fight choice foot 10 10 or 12 we foot a fight and I was like fire like oh yeah I feel good yeah it's amazing and they're like it was like I just went too hard yeah well I was being just a dumb jock well that's what I wanted to say it's like like what is the not that you're a dumb jock but like that is what is that what's the way you prepare for like a major championship fight like what is the build-up like like how do you how do you know like one two push too hard how do you know when you're peeking when to back off well every fight two weeks out I stopped smarting how far to each for for two weeks why is that so my body rest that's the reason I made that genius fight really everything hurts so bad I would wait a minute but just stretching out edges I could feel the pain like just my bones now I just bar and just soreness yeah I just mean sore and then from spine I'm doing everything grappling and just you know I'm boxing whatever and then I you know if I had two weeks man I feel like a million dollars so what you do for those two weeks out I do pair work condition and running and stuff like that you know just thought just keep my mind straight my mind right know I work in a pair just like technique or with the game plan for the week you know yeah everybody's got a different strategy for like Matt Hughes told me he would work out hard right up into the day of the fight I guess he's like that's what we've always done it's what I've always done it's feels right for me I can keep puts his mind in a good place I guess - yeah that's old school yeah yeah no doubt but I to another coach who said that when he was competing that what he would do is the last week of the fight he literally wouldn't do anything he goes I wouldn't work out at all I go nothing he is nothing he wasn't my ride my bike he was I might swim a little bit because I don't do shit he goes I already know how to fight it was murder in shape he goes I'm just trying to recover yeah and he goes and you think about it like if you haven't worked out in a week when you go and work out you like fucking I feel so so powerful and energetic because everything's recovered and he's like that's how I want to be when I'm fighting yeah okay that's I think I think desired you know I still go Hardy nice to do my rounds and I you know I'm pushing limiting but like you know I definitely just the last two weeks let my body rest I'm getting beat up yeah except I'm I write to you do you you have any sort of recovery methods do you do like cryotherapy or massage or ice baths or yeah I am I do i surpass my own but I do I cry oh and I have a place that will be ups over there that clean when I do have to stop I once a week with that was called that green there's a menthol cigarettes I think it's like well you put it like in the episode like green like the liquid I don't even know it's epson salt but it's green yes I met these men from you know who knows but but it's also opens up the pores actually else with people cutting away too but they'll show absorb young gets everything out and then I do like once or twice a week so the crowd pirates I want to start doing that you're soon once twice a week you know I proteins amino acids all the stuff you know you're supposed to I go to a chiropractor call times a week they ask that without sets including massages so I mean 220 massage after yeah I think massage is super beneficial I think the more people do that the better I think especially for fighters you just you're constantly dealing with knots and things that could eventually become like real injuries yeah I remember when I Ben Rothwell and and I finally like worst tie my life I never pull out a fight before I didn't know what to do I really couldn't bend over I was like I never forgot my wallet I was like what happened just my back it was so screwed up like I was driving I I was I mean like sit up straight I'd like it was oh so bad I get my bag was so messed up I go did you get an MRI yes for whatever else lumbar yeah they were just screwed up they're you know they're herniated bulging out whatever II want to call them and so I went to talk to Tom from Westside you know Irish guy yeah Good King he's out he was like hey man check out it's so ass miss OS muscle uh-huh you know the sweats muscle is no so it's a muscle it's connected on the inside your thigh when it goes over hip bone and goes to your lower back okay so I was sitting there and like I would take your shit and I like Oh like I feel like like my spine it would kill so I said like stretching it out and I said yeah massage and the massage it was like she's like I'm like Elijah she's like you touching your so ass muscle cuz that the dig can get to it because it just can't find it she it was like a rubber band with like bumps on it was disgusting she's like it was the dance so I go to West Islands guy named John Quin who is a relief therapist whatever big dude awesome dude actually my career he started working myself ass and started stretching me out well I mean now I can do head kicks now I never be able to do a kick so it was like a muscle that just was broken down yeah it wasn't getting enough recovery that's wrestling from being yo sure and then just being tight all the time and then hurting my back when I was a little kid you know not a little kid when I was 18 right back and then he just carried on and ever do yoga I did I probably should do it it's just that it's tough I'm gonna forget when I was training a gym before I started doing mixed martial arts I was doing yoga class and I was trying to like do it and this lady's like you're just too big she they told me that I was like you're a terrible instructor like how do you want me to come back like why he's just too big she's like you're just too big your muscles are too big yet she's told me yeah I'm so devastated I walked out I know what to do stupid yeah that's ridiculous I lost my mojo after that no you gotta get back in there I would just think that like for for anyone that's involved in anything that's as brutal as MMA that Yoga is a great sort of balance and thing for that keeps you flexible you know keeps your your your core strong does a lot of it you you've developed like weird strength strengthen like it helps the joints it helps like a lot of the connecting tissues helps stabilize everything yeah yeah I believe it put it with your mind and stuff like that sure yeah that's right I mean I don't like once or twice I get told you the lady's like you're Muslim it whatever I read about it when I see my dad looks pretty good yeah I looked at post on Instagram that I put up last night excellent from what pull this up like this is uh from jujitsu Brotherhood this got it what's up Yoga is a martial art you do against yourself how do you say Knicks last name Grigori ADIS Grigori ade this nick Gregorius anyway real good jujitsu guy he was a guy that was in London real right wasn't he used that little fancy Google machine I'm pretty sure that's Nick he was the in the early London real he did our podcast yeah yeah he did the podcast a long time ago but that's a great quote that that Yoga is a martial art you do against yourself for real serious for like two years two and a half years before that I would do it like once a month or once every now and then but now I do it pretty regularly we did the sober October thing no booze no pot fifteen hot yoga classes a month it's fucking life-changing man yeah yeah I haven't done yoga since I really have it but I need to because I fucking I tweaked my my back yesterday doing something go compactor no no yeah I don't believe in them really yeah don't I know I'm sure you do I think massage is good but if you know how chiropractic was founded do you know where came from came from a scam artist the guy was a magnetic healer and it came to him in a seance that he could cure all ailments if he manipulate people's spines yeah and then he was killed by his own son who then who was also a scam artist his own son ran over him with a fucking car and they took over the business I'm sure you know people claim all sorts of benefits for all sorts of things but there's no scientific evidence that manipulating your spine does anything the only thing that it does show is that if you can manipulate lower backs sometimes with some people you can relieve some of the pain but I think a lot of that is just massaging them like a lot of that is just manipulating them just just rubbing into them giving them some sort of relief and adjusting them but the neck is very dangerous you know people that want to get their neck adjusted and feel that pop feels good right but literally people have gotten strokes from that oh yeah why I just you know I read a study on it said like you know like you know adjusting you know twice a week and you are kids like reaction nice and sports right quicker just because uh everything was like lined up perfectly yeah I don't think that's real I just don't think you know I don't think your body has been manipulated that way I think that what's happening is you're putting attention on your body you're thinking about recovery more you're getting adjusted and while you're getting adjusted getting massaged when I used to get adjusted the best part of it was what you said the massage yeah that was the best part I get massaged and then I get adjusted and it felt good look at everything loosened up and but when I talked to guys that are actual orthopedic surgeons and real doctors like spinal doctors and they talk about it they're like you're just making like a pop like it's not it's not real like it doesn't your your body be so fucked up if like you could manipulate it one way or another that's how you fix things like that's my fix things you got a injury it's like there's a whole bunch of shit going on like if you have some sort of a muscle pull or a back injury I soured on it when I had a bulging disc the reason why was because this guy was convinced that I didn't have a bulging disc and I didn't get an MRI though it's just going to a chiropractor and he's like pushing down on my hand I had a in my cervical in my neck oh it was a my hands are going numb from jujitsu yeah and this guy was like trying to tell me just keep coming to the car you'll get adjusted it'll be fine and then I finally went to a real doctor and they gave me an MRI and they're like no this is why you're in pain your disc is bulging out and it's pressing against your nerve it's called the ulnar nerve and that's why your hand is going numb yeah like that we're gonna give you spinal decompression and you should try to look into some things they're going to reduce inflammation they change my diet and I started getting something called Regina Keene which is like platelet-rich plasma we're gonna take your blood they spin it to heat it up and in the heating up the blood it produces this radical anti inflammatory process and they then inject that your own blood back into the injuries and just fixed it over like a period of like two or three months then I got another MRI and it went away so I think a lot of that shit is just fucking voodoo it's just nonsense and you think it's working or you you you're thinking about it or you're giving yourself time to rest while you're getting all those adjustments so you think that the adjustments are what's doing it but obviously there's a lot of people that are chiropractors that are very skillful in all sorts of different methods of recovery like electrical muscular stimulation massage there's a bunch of different transition I don't know enough about acupuncture I always I never got it done and I always like it seems to me like horseshit if I had a guess it's just but I don't know I mean there maybe there's some method to it I mean I think that massage works that definitely works like if I get a good massage and I have like something that's tight and you know like your neck has fucked up from not tapping or something like that and you go get it massage tout like you can fix that like that actually can provide you some relief and I'm sure that if you go to a good one of those people that does cupping like people apparently swear by that shit you know you know cut what is covering by the way no I seen it like sucks on the bagging is terrible marks in your body but I think that's half of it half of it is like the marks in your body make you think like you're getting something done but you they take this cup and it sucks all your your skin up into the cup and how does that I don't know how it works like look at this asshole guy looks like he has the worst disease known to man and if that was just like what happened to your skin you got like some porcupine disease yeah I guess like they have a vacuum thing and it attaches to the top and it pulls yeah Olympic cupping a practice rooted in ancient Islam oh shit hmm interesting yeah I mean look these fucking people are world-class athletes at the top of their game is cupping there okay how about Google does cupping work it's cupping therapy would it's probably probably some weird sexual shit careful will you pull up how does cupping work hmm yeah how does it work the glass cup is warmed by burning and alcohol soaked cotton ball inside of it and they're making a bomb this this removes the oxygen in the cup which creates a vacuum the cup is turned upside down and placed on the patient's back the vacuum created by the belt lack of oxygen well that's this kind of cupping but the other one seemed to have like a stem on the top of it where a vacuum thing pulls in but what is it supposed to do facts how do you feel not ice though I think that's very important yeah drawing up the skin go the scroll over towards the right so I can see though yeah drawing up the skin and the Cup is believed to open the skins pores which helps to stimulate the blood flow balances and realize the flow of okay you fucked me with this this Qi Qi Ballantrae lines the flow of Qi oh you got any you got any peer-reviewed Studies on that Qi you fucking dipshit breaking up obstructions creates an avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the body again as soon as assholes start talking about toxins oh well I'm just cleansing I'm gonna deep cleanse getting the toxins out of my body nice it's just bullsh talk that whole toxins talk is pulling toxins out of my body the fuck you are no you know what pulls toxins out of your body your liver you dumb cunt that's what that's what you livers for it gets the toxins out you're not pulling them out with a cup for me it's a song I've been drinking all day yeah your sweat does filter out some of that water yeah ionic foot spa saying that oh that's the worst where the your foot the water turns black and they try to pretend that it's like toxins coming out of you I mean while it's just a reaction it's a chemical reaction yeah you ever seen that yeah yeah they have this thing it's plugged in and your your foot sits in it and there's some sort of reaction with the water and your feet it turns black and they try to tell you oh the toxins I'm coming out of your body and then you walk out of there I feel amazing no I need a colonic no no this is not real ladies and gentlemen what is that like what are they doing what is the exact reaction there's lots of videos you can look up where people do the exact process with not without putting anything in there yeah and the water still turns black it's something to do with like battery acid or I don't know honestly that might not be it but it's something weird bullshit this see people want to get healed you get hurt you want to get healed you want to lose anything yeah well you ever heard of Reiki healers no no that's that's Rolfing that's real that's legit especially manipulation Reiki is like they rub their hands and they just pass them over your body and they heal you we have this one video that we were watching this this one lady was just rubbing her hand above this lady's vagina just like above it like what is going on there you trying to what kind of sorcery are you using what are you trying to what are you trying to exorcise this lady's porno yeah next thing you know she's number one porno star in America look I did it with my hands my healing my Reiki healing i met a dude last night that was a psychic healer told me was a psychic healer i go good luck with that that's not real you fuck psychic deal I think is like I know there's some people that don't like you guys seem they like you and I like that the injury gets hurt unless it's needed but I you see a sprinklin you can start moving right away and get the blood flow back in there without yeah you know there's there's some evidence that well I think it depends entirely upon the injury but if you look at the vast majority of scientists and sports medicine therapists and the people that are at the cutting edge of the business they almost all use eyes yeah yeah they don't think that you you're not supposed to use ice within what was it who was it on the podcast was it Andy Galpin who was it that was talking about the about the timeframe between icing and exercise where you need to well that might have been Rhonda Patrick there's a beneficial amount of time you should wait before you ice after an exercise like that you you give yourself a chance for more recovery and more growth if you wait a while before icing like save you had a hard training session you wouldn't want to go right to cryotherapy you might want to wait an hour and a half two hours and then go and then you get the benefits of the heart training but then you also get the anti-inflammatory benefits of cryo yeah well I did crown my first time a couple times to do it right and then there's another place plus also it's free which is nice yeah pretty nice yeah and the guy's like hey man you know to come out so I checked it out and like man I got done that one it was like I felt that coldness coming like in my whole body so it was a better place you into a better place yeah I think I definitely felt different how long you in town for oh I'm leaving I want to take you the place out here the cryotherapy cryo healthcare out here they have a very unique system there their system is its first of all the guys that developed it what they did was instead of having it where you're breathing in liq liquid nitrogen you know like where it's from the neck down which is a lot of those places you go into it and you're breathing air and you have to have your head above where the cryo is because you can't breathe that shit in which is how that girl in Vegas died folks if you don't know there's a girl in Vegas that went in the tank by herself and she was too short and she was breathing in the nitrogen and she passed out and then she froze to death but the ones at cryo healthcare that's a normal one that's like Floyd Mayweather in there right there where you see the the cryo stuff is all below his head the ones at cryo healthcare they jack the temperature way down like 240 degrees below zero and one of what they do is they freeze the air itself so the air they're pumping into is super cold air so you go in there with full like you you're you're breathing in this cold air it's on your head your full body is immersed in this cold air so it's it's way more intense and it's supposed to have way more benefit because your head gets cold too so the reaction that your body has for producing cytokines and anti-inflammatory cold shock proteins your body freaks out way more when everything is covered not just from the neck down but your head - yeah so - I wish you were in town I'll take you there we got under this you've got some other duties yeah what you have to do other UFC stuff no no yeah kind of kind of knives like my stuff I don't know I don't want to go but I had to go like when you have a big fight how much of the big fight is like how much of the pain in the ass is doing press I want to say you're complaining about it but I mean as far as like time constraints yeah sometimes it sucks like it does suck cuz like you're in your Center you and you're thinking about doing this in the car like hey right you know but I understand it's part of the game and helps you know promote you and you know your sales and you know pay-per-views all that stuff does but there's like a balance to be achieved right those Conor McGregor's argument Conor McGregor's argument was with any winning one on that world tour with Aldo he's like they just did way too much he's like by the time you're doing all this you don't have time to Train he goes there's no way you're gonna train recover sleep correctly you're flying from one city to another country to another country and he just constantly on a jet yeah it was like I mean yeah Australia I mean I flew I shoulda thought Mike hunt and now I flew more than action was there in Australia I was there for like a day and a half and I flew back home that's crazy yeah so the flight is more more time I think it was like a 20-hour flight there in 2020 that flight so I think the lights yeah of dicks yeah that flight is you get out of there and you're just half a person you look confused and like something happens to you when you fly in 16 17 hours in a plane I was there for after the flash so I got there a week early before the flight I saved for the week of the flight and I was there like three or four more days later so someone was there were three good three a half 23 weeks and I got home and it was crazy so I get home

I was still like four days later I was still like messed up bad yeah I could fuck you up for a week or two but you know it's worth it just to go to Australia to see amazing it's a great place yeah I have much family there but you have a big fight with a guy like Saint Mark Hunt well you know could be a brawl and that turned out to be a five-round fight right was it mhm for now yeah you stopped him in the fifth when you you have a fight like that and you know this is you're in there for the long haul do you plan on like staying for days after the fight to recover no I actually wanted to get home but I had I was a bad boy so they want me to do a couple like promotional yeah oh yeah we put they get see my family so I think we all should either the Melbourne and Sydney oh yeah family out

video the guy was diving the real recent video and I hit the back of him oh yeah thump the back of his head fishing like this the seat she's like this and the swordfish half of it yeah the whole thing jumped in oh well she starts going crazy one guy jumped overboard cuz you like anyway you're like sauteed by this thing so I gotta try like get out of a chair hurry up you know like this fish was trying to get away from a shark blue is jumping oh yeah yeah I saw like I saw like that like that seal one time I was like he jumped in the boat ran away from my god I killer whale yeah my my oldest daughter when she was 13 we went fishing and she was a vegetarian at the time she loves animals and I was like you know and she but she was eating fish I said listen let's just go fishing we'll catch a fish will cook it and you'll get like this sort of connection with your food is this what was this one in South Beach the other day some guards Charlie ten feet off the coast this guy's just trying to die what is he doing cuz I don't know if he even saw it so anyway I'm on this boat and we catch a Marlin within ten minutes of the the trip ten minutes in we catch a Marlin which is crazy right all's I'm I'm pulling this thing in and it's not a big Marlin it's probably like 80 pounds or something like that we get it into the boat and they beat the fucking thing to death with clubs because that's what they do they pull it in and then just fucking thump thump thump and she's sitting there oh and then they they put it on ice after that and then when they put it on ice it's like still alive every now and then he'd hear his tail would be flapping out it'd be spasm it would come back to life and they'd sub it in the head again she was a vegetarian for another year after that Oh take a while yeah turn the back around we're gonna go catch some mahi-mahi this is gonna be great Marlin you usually don't catch a Marlin yeah we caught one within 10 minutes yeah I mean you're like you were gonna be a good dad they're just smile it just was the total wrong experience like my youngest daughters I took them fishing and they caught little fish and it was a great experience it was like what I was hoping for yeah like they caught little fish we brought it back to the restaurant the restaurant cooked them you were staying at a resort and that was great it's like nobody got clubbed I'm like if you're fucking four and you watch a Marlin get clubbed I might not ever bounce back from that yeah I think if they if I was a child and saw that I probably scarred for life yeah I fucked up I didn't die so much time I've ever caught a Marlin - I've got ocean fish and a hundred times they've caught amar yeah I know if I've learned ocean fishing oh it's the best fun yeah man it's amazing yeah the only thing that's kind of a bummer there's a lot of times they just want to troll right so they're just pulling the lines behind the boat so you don't really actively do anything I like casting yeah you know like the best ocean fishing I've done is in Mexico for I think they're either skipjack or amberjack tuna I forget what they're called but we would go and there would be that would follow these seagulls and bait fish so like the bait fish should be frothing on the water because the tuna were underneath jacket him and then just cast into them and just I was amazing where I work Mexico it was outside of Cabo oh so it's like no no it's outside Porter varta yeah who's outside Port of IATA so I'm not sure like what part of the ocean it was but it's great you know it's it's not when you eat a fish that you caught like an hour ago you realize like wow this tastes way better yeah it's amazing like what happening of the it's the kind of the opposite with meat because with meat like you can eat a lot of meat fresh right after you kill it and it tastes really good but much much of like like the best cuts of meat that you get like from a butcher or from a really good steak restaurant they let it age you know they let and apparently they do that with tuna too like when you get sushi I didn't know that yeah they let that shit age I love sushi do you fish I mean are you still like back in the day yeah how do you have time a little pond of miles but I don't think God yeah it's past all right not huge probably 20 yards by like 20 yards not big at all but we do have big massive turtles like like the one bond yeah well I had no idea so I actually we made a bet one of the UFC fights and bunch of my coaches were over and I was lit up having fun like and I never bet and they're like I bet you this person wins so I was like I'll take that bet you know what happens if you win I'm like if you if the person that wins you know you can do everyone I pick whatever you know I went oh my god you got to get in them getting a little shuttle boat and you do a cross lake with the snowballs at you there's no winner and I'm like no I'm like one percent you're gonna do it so the best part was it was half of it was covering ice so they can go anywhere in for pebble it's so they're just sitting I'm I'm drilling them like so whatever and we do our thing and awesome like months later my wife's like honey she sends me a video of these these massive snapping turtles they're like hate fucking each other like really the ones like sitting I'm gonna find on the phone the ones like this and I'll get some bags and all something goes like i tries like brace face off my clothes go on it was like but they're like I mean they had both at them in that bag they're massive and then I looked over their head like a bunch of babies and you know and their necks are so long I get the grab by like by the behind yeah they'll bite your hand off yeah so those just moved into your neighborhood is that what happened I live like it's weird so I have like a private drive from my house you can't see my house all the driveway so we have a little pond and so yeah but were they there before there's a little pond next to it's that connected where drivers cook them up turtle soup recipe half-decent if you cook it right what did you diet like I mean I joked around about that but we had Courtney de Walter in she's a woman who won the Moab 240 oh yeah chick is a fucking Savage she beat every man every person who entered that race by a marathon length 240 miles and she was she was ahead by more than 20 miles the next person the second-place person was more than 20 miles behind her when she won so he is it's a ultra marathon yeah yeah it's a three days for some people but for her she didn't I think she did it in two right she's an animal she's a fucking animal anyway beer nachos candy that's what she eats beer nachos and candy and we were like what like I expected some sophisticated ketogenic diet protocol where they're monitoring her fucking her ketone levels in her blood and check out all her portions are mapped yeah when she was here she just kept eating candy she was just eating candy like M&Ms and shit I camels yeah that's a great that's a meal prep yeah tell me about your stuff it's good on you I'm gonna have you wait so you know right somebody's love pizza you can do whatever the fuck you want exact I don't like have you ever thought about trying to go to 205 we thought about it but I'd be really tough what do you weigh now 240 yeah and you're not fat so will you like even if you got super lean you're probably looking at 225 and then a holiday yeah 225 class all day yeah easy mate I think there should be one me too I think there should be a lot more weight classes I really do and I know there's a resistance because they want to keep the sport pure they don't want it like boxing was a weight class every four pounds but I feel like if you look at guys there's a lot of guys that I think are tweeners you know they're like they're not quite yeah well you're a heavyweight champion can't say you're at yeah but there's guys that you know like Diego Sanchez was always a good example he's a little bit too small to make 55 when he tried to make 45 was a disaster but if there was a 65 pound weight class I think that's perfect for him there's a lot of guys that like 70 to 85 that's a big jump 85 to 205 that's crazy yeah yeah I mean I think definitely a few more weight classes not like yeah give me 10 pounds yeah if any great - I think I'd be bored for that I think that's the move every 10 pounds and then when you go to o5 205 to 225 225 - it should be unlimited you shouldn't be 265 like that seems silly to me yeah by that two of those guys they won't last long they might not but in Ghana's cutting weight to get to 265 the way 250 last Friday I thought no no I weighed 260 something way 263 263 or 264 yeah no he's cutting weight oh cool yeah yeah big fella yeah but obviously there's pros and cons to being big and the the con is that if you're getting into the third fourth and fifth rounds yeah you know those big guys are not known for their endurance this is the weight class like there's there was always a thought in MMA like when Cain Velasquez was on top there was a thought that might be the perfect size like 240 like anything bigger than that maybe it's just like not worth it cuz a 240-pound man could basically knock out anybody on the planet ya know so the power is still there but you have more like nobody had more endurance and Cain no I think I think so I think being a 240-mile you just took out the card you could sort of the strength south speed I mean I Love You Man you know I don't try again I mean I'm not gonna touch me you ever thought about gaining or no no I've game everyone after Marco night man I kind of went on the deep end and when I binge drinking then find me where I feel like living it out living life and I sure I slept that skill I was like what do i to 59 wow I never weigh down my life do you take a picture like holding your gut no I actually I look exactly the same I know I just look a little bit thicker of nothing like bad though so it filled out good yeah it was asked to so if you were checked it would've been a good move go back to the whole ultramarathon thing yes I'm a weirdo and so I found out about ultramarathons so I go on Wikipedia and I started reading all about it yeah like Tombaugh I never really liked the top three guys like they're crazy like the one guy was at the first ever my automatic I like that did awesome was it's a cattle runner cattle like guy cattle farmer guy cattle farmer yeah yeah run through the night well he even sleep at night so he would just run and run fast but then they had another guy I saw that guy I saw a video about that guy and then yeah and then there's another guy he was like third years old he like a pet for me he's like he was drinking one night and he just got sick I like you let's drink when I first birthday probably put on my shoes you just start running realizing you know you still run and he like torn up again I don't know he's an American and another guy he was like at one point he was sleeping running and that he's like while he was sleeping he was running they watched him sleep by running you sleep whoa I don't know no I'm saying I'm saying he's just running like I know if you're snoring but like they had another time like they're saying story about he like twists his ankle and beginning of the race and I was a good size of a grapefruit he still destroyed everyone we did finish like I fight everyone across the finish line Wow like it's good about looking up news like I don't know it's like one guy thing yeah cliff Jung shuffle yeah that's the yeah that's the cattle rancher guy yeah yeah so he he does he kind of has a shuffle and the idea was that that shuffle allowed him to save energy because he wasn't wasn't like picking up his legs like really high he's just kind of like shuffling along yeah I remember this guy yeah look at him he competed without his false teeth because they rattled when he ran Jesus Christ at 61 when he showed up and no one thought he was nobody was doing they didn't know it if he didn't do what he signed up for Wow I mean while he won history's filled with guys like that it's like everybody thinks they know exactly how everything works until someone comes along that's a completely unique version no one has seen before like that guy do a little shuffle yeah or like this Courtney go Walter chick but she just won she just beat the world record for the most amount of hours a woman has ever run in 24 hours she's a freak and again candy drinking beer it's nachos I think watches Pele like run marathons like it's crazy yeah for one year I out of my one coach you did like security detail for at the Cleveland Rothko marathon so I'm like I said that it was a worst day of my life though I really sat by and then driving five miles behind people running it's why they like fell off I'd pick him up take him through the finish line but I it was just crazy why she'd be like they were so like they not so I'm another one guy we stopped to check out him he's like I got a Vienna and stuff like that he said I'll be fine he put IV in him he went to go finish the race right this guy's like dead unless it gets IV comes back to life he's like I got this coaster get start spraying again I'll never forget we're about to be done and I see the guy running he's about a hundred yards away and he starts like tripping and falling he couldn't finish race Wow hundred yards away he's like you couldn't defeat couldn't finish I was like oh well Gilley he was like a lady about the thought passed out of the first time they put an IV he felt grazie I'm good leave me alone took off again then it's endurance racing is a totally different kind of thing far as like the mindset like if you think about a five-round heavyweight title fight is a grueling affair right it's 25 minutes of throwing bones the best fighters in the world but it's still 25 minutes these are motherfuckers like this court need do altar chick she's running for three days it's crazy what is it was a Dallas marathon this is a lady that was winning she got to the end and she just collapsed and this girl helped if she took a high-schooler she was running one of the shorter races and just saw her and just like that was compelled to help her wow she still won the race she was I guess the lady said she was afraid she was gonna get disqualified because someone was helping her but they still she still won so someone's helping her that seems weird sort of helping her you can kind of tell she's picking her up though she's picking her up every time she falls I feel like that's cheating they might had some rules I don't listen when people tell that men should get back a battle they sit in fights now if you poop yourself they stop the fight Oh a lot of guys have shit themselves a lot of guys famously yeah I mean the wrestling guy in college went on that show his pants I remember michael Chiesa who's he fighting Benilde are you sh and right were right before the fight started he leans over to the kg goes dude he goes I might shit myself during the fight I go you serious and he's like I got a shit so bad are you serious anyone I'm choking out dare you thank God we were talking about afterwards goes bro he goes something will happen during the fight it went away but I was convinced I was gonna shit myself really he goes I just got out there I was like oh no so we're feeling good table feeling that'd be like I'll ask you like my hotel room they're coming to get me and I'm like you know let me just shit make sure thank outta shit cuz whatever came out at me like he was like just disgusting diarrhea on my ceiling I get done oh my oh yeah I didn't figure I had to go by the yellow just checked me on safe side oh man thank god I fucking that was a big win for you too yeah it was a big one because it was like definitive it was like you were marching towards the title and then when you blasted arlovski out there's like all right this guy's the guy does the next guy well I did a little arm map yeah but I mean you know I'm saying like that was like the definitive like were you like I want my fucking shot like where's my fucking shot like right then and there like that was sort of one of those moments where like you got to give this guy the shot yeah yeah I appreciate you you help me out with that too I appreciate that you know I appreciate and then the title fight man holy shit that must have been amazing knocking out veux doom in Brazil like that with one punch holy shit that was like one of the best title fight winning performances ever yeah it was a good night man yeah you know I wish to work on that a lot step over and right across the guy chasing you down yeah I know and you know I just thought do you just what a great night you know I just I wouldn't be there without my coaches honestly they're just great people of course they're just like the stories on there just because they put so much time and effort into me I gotta say it over and over again but they're just amazing guys and I'm very lucky to have them in my corner well they're very lucky to have you too you know it takes both you know and you're right you you know you have a great relationship with your coaches too which is very important I think like you were saying about having a great wife having great friends having a great support system like all that stuff like for your mind for your mindset it's great but having coaches that you have a great relationship with that you really you know they're looking out for you you know they're working hard for you guys are in there together yeah coach Marcus I they look down like long time and more time drink wine bro you can do it you I just joke around soon you would say you know listen eyes wide you be happy you know that's the best kind of coach man that's the best kind of coach that way when you retire and the worst is the kind of coach that wants it got a fight when you really know it's over you know and the guy really should be stepping away and then you see them you know trying to give the guy the pep talk and you know you know the best days are in the past yeah that's why it mark is actually real good at that you know we've got a couple guys that know he's like he's a young and you mean your corner you mean he killed him inside of telling that please they listen you know you know you know what this is an important point to talk about feeling that you felt like after this drue fight it's like you've got to kind of figure that out on your own and come back on your own yeah right and some guys they have that feeling and then they're never there set those same again they never reach those same but you got better for sure you rose above that but some people are dwarfed by bad performances or a bad knockout or whatever it is and they just never they're never the same again yeah I mean I just I think it's you know just to the type you leave they're gonna be build above beyond or not I mean that's just how it is yeah but there's also stages in your life too right where you just don't want to do it anymore like you see some guys at one point in time great driven fighters and then the grind just gets to them yeah yeah I mean I understand like I mean I was just talking about Volante 11 UFC fights I think more of those have been 5 rounders that's insane yeah my third my fourth UFC fighter was a fighter even if they didn't go five rounds you still still training for fire yeah you go to camp for five rounds I mean I mean yeah the vadym fight was so crazy because I almost think you benefited from it being in Brazil because it seemed like Werdum was so emotional and so ramped up because it was in Brazil he's like chasing after you which I was like this is crazy yeah I think a little bit to that you know we knew exactly everything you wanted to do and I just wasn't falling for anything you wanted right and I'm finding what for a takedown you went for a body kick I just wasn't giving anything you wanted you know I think you realized that I wasn't going anywhere you also caught him before that big punch - yeah when we watched the fight we did a fight companion we've watched a fight you clipped him early and I was like he's hurt you know you could tell there was something going on like when he got hit like and then he tried to get it back and you know when a guy gets hit and then just tries extra hard to get it back like a lot of times they're exposed and you just caught that right hand perfect yeah yeah yeah here right now what was that feeling like man awesome like so I hit him do anything I was like Shh you fell because I knocked out holy shit so I gave me a couple extra one but and then you know I stopped fighting I looked darkness my coach was like oh hell yeah yes I run over and I was like you know like no heart is before that but before I said I'm a world champ I looked at my coaches like we did it we did it you know right so I told him we all did it you know that's some world champ and that kind of like Freddie tank I blacked out and to Ramona that's but you know it was it was it was awkward too because it was so quiet in there now here was myself screaming I was amazing you know it was amazing we were clapping when when you were you when you hopped over the the Octagon and you're standing there you're like I'm the world champ I'm the world champ you like it was like setting in like you can see it those moments man those are some of my all-time favorite moments when a guy realizes like the biggest dream the biggest accomplishment of his career that's far at least in the see a guy like you win the title it's just there's nothing like that man there's nothing like that yeah it was great you know I was 45,000 we had about 15 people there so 45,000 people rooting for a breezy over - it was 40 4905 I 15 there for myself and then yeah it was Mike's my brothers and my cousins and now they're all top row with my buddies and they some when I knocked him out they all going but yeah they're going crazy and actually like yeah like we're sorry they're like it's okay you know congratulations they were really nice oh that's cool must've been silent in there though when he dropped him oh he was he was so awkward like it was so awkward like he was just cuz I remember share myself screaming like I'm like what was the crowd doing nothing there's quiet quiet it was like I'm not her my wife screaming I hear I heard her screaming and that was about it Wow it was it was awkward and then you know clean was like it told 180 you know that was crazy too I'm sure you know I'm gonna put in my ass and then getting up and when the zombie mode didn't care after that Wow it's a crazy time for you you know you're the UFC heavyweight champion in the world I mean one day you're gonna look back and mean talk any grandkids you're talking about the time but now and you're the fucking champ of the world yeah that's pretty intense yeah I'm excited man I just had some you know that uh you know be proud of them and Wyatt and my wife my mom you know he's like yeah well what I'm excited about too for the for you for this in Ghana fight us it's gonna be a lot of people buying this on pay-per-view this is gonna be a big fight mmm you know and these big fights this is what makes you know a champion popular I mean this is really this is I mean historically in boxing the voice said that the health of the heavyweight division it just represents like boxing overall I don't think that's the case anymore because now in box you got all these lightweight guys like Gennady golovkin Canelo Alvarez lomachenko all these big stars now that are emerging in a lighter weight divisions just because they're so skillful and talented Andre Ward but I think in the heavyweight division in the UFC it's been a while since people like really pumped up about a big heavyweight title fight yeah you know I'm excited man you listen he's a good tough dude you know I mean you bring the pain so why but I fortunately I'm not walking out without that bout I'm still champion still when you see a guy like that what preparations like what what do you think is different about him than guys you fought before what are you gonna do different I mean every guy is different I mean every fight is different you know I yeah oh my god is punishing power I mean listen there's a lot of guys at heart I mean yeah there's there's no question you guys hit hard I mean but I'm gonna like read stupid put myself in a position when we get hit you know I'm gonna do things that make him feel uncomfortable and I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna sit there and let him dude you want so I'm gonna dictate what I want when you see the rest of the heavyweight division do you see any standouts or any guys that are coming up that are exciting to you that's that's a fascinating thing because some people do you know I talked to Matt Hughes after Matt Hughes got beat by BJ Penn and this is what he said it was really fascinating because he had he's got so much courage that guy like to say to say this in an interview as well he's like honestly it's a relief he's like being the champ was like so much pressure it was just it's overwhelming so having this happen honestly right now I feel relieved and I was like wow that's crazy yeah it's not like you gave up me fought his heart out but he got caught and got choked out and then to go from that to say you know honestly he's really then rebounds and then gets back on the horse and you know probably had to have that experience just to have the perspective that I don't know if you ever had a perspective that you have but your perspective is different in that you like you don't seem to be concerned well I mean I'm concerned there's no question I think every fight you can you know I'm nervous and always you know never know what's gonna happen that's what you know as real as a guest you never know what's right but you're not concerned at all these guys nipping at your heels all those guys coming up the ladder it's part of the game that's why I signed up for yeah yeah I mean we don't win like if I want to do it I wouldn't do it you know I knew that you know one day I'll be a champ I knew there people are coming for my belt yeah I understand you know there's a lot of guys out there that I mean you know I you know find Jade yeah that's fine over doom you know no guys I mean they mean they all want a piece of it and I understand like that you no matter who it is it's that he just meet since when Cain was fighting you know what yeah you know I just over doom you know I ever wanted a piece of the tail well you know it's an interesting thing too because what we're seeing today with MMA we're seeing this combination like this marriage of fighting with promotion I can't do it yeah you're not that guy but but you not being that guy is promotable this is what it's like it's almost like no first of all I don't think the UFC has enough resources to promote every fighter adequate because I think UFC is a promotional entity but it's also like this sanctioning body you know not the sanctioning body but they're the ones who put on the fights they're the ones who decide who fights and you've got a 500 fighter roster whereas like in other organizations you would have you know you would have a bunch of different venues and avenues for different fighters could go when a guy like you is the heavyweight champion blue collar guy works as a fire fighter you know got a great story you're a fun guy like does it frustrate you that people expect you to talk shit and and get I mean you've seen all these guys that are getting a lot of attention now for obviously Connors the master at it right yeah but you're seeing other guys that are you know trying that route trying to say outrageous shit to try to get attention you know yeah I'm not gonna be a copycat I'm it's too exhausting for me to figure out what I wanted to say and like what I want to say and hurt someone's feelings I don't like I don't care yeah I got more important shit to worry about yeah like my kitchen I had to figure in a fixed I like I don't I didn't worry about that and you know I didn't worry about like what next I was gonna fight was gonna say I was gonna say about like right I'm good man like I'm gonna do my thing around there my Beatrice and the walk out me champ I said I'm torn because on one hand I'm like I love a good shit-talking session I like shed talkin I gave it the fire station all day man I should talk to the bathroom yeah but I just don't wanna go out my way and just hurt someone's feelings I don't even know yeah but like Colby Covington like he's making a name for himself but he's making the name for himself not just beating good guys like Demian Maia but talking mad shit yeah like talking shit in Brazil you see one for Eastover do him hit her in the head with a corporate I think you gotta fly all the way to Australia to go to court for that it's crazy to let it go it wasn't trying to hit I mean wasn't try to kill him he just threw whatever he had in his hands I don't know pretty sweet though fine Kim a little fire in Australia right yeah it's great yeah it's like hitting some in the head with a koala bear right bottle of Vegemite or something like that oh I like that stuff yeah I did one time so Safi he's good with butter yeah with butter on bread but the thing like has there been any pressure on you to try to talk some shit to try to like promote things more no I mean good tell me like your own promoter okay that's what they say - yeah I kind of say UFC say it like I mean I mean just like I don't really care what you know they think well I mean you do like promote like I promote myself I got bright that's what you guys are in a promoting company that's what you're supposed to do you guys do that you know I just you know I think they'd rather you know what 5050 with it but I don't see that way well I think they would rather someone who's just promotes themselves like Conor McGregor is a perfect example in unicorn yeah like everyone one guy comes along that has first of all he has an entire country behind him like I've never seen anything like that like Ireland's on a big country but it seems like they're the biggest country in the world when Conor's fighting yeah I mean he's fighting in Vegas against an American and there's more Irish people in the audience I mean that's just bananas right but when they got a guy like that they kind of get spoiled like hey what this is Alissa you got to do it go do like Conor does it well not everybody's Conor you know so like for a guy like you to see all these guys getting a lot of attention and they're very good fighters as well I'm talking Conor's case great fighters as well but the thing is the shit talking like that's that's sort of what's ramping everything up that's what's getting all these people to buy the pay-per-view right yeah I mean if someone came at me you know for some defend myself I'm pretty ready you know I mean I'm favoring I get should talk to everyday by you know five or six guys so like but like I said hey I just want to got him away and just just idle herself to worry about like training wise and like what am I gonna tweet today when I ride it's too much made Chael Sonnen career yeah being a great fighter that did jails like career really took off when he started talking shit people remember chill in the early days of his career he was a gentleman never then somewhere along the line is like Anderson Silva you absolutely guys like my belt and it's like a WWE promotion and everybody's going crazy in jail took it to a new level like jail opened up the door to a lot of shit talkers of the modern era he really let him know like look that guy promoted the fuck out of me fight he's like take classes I'm not trying to be funny like I mean he's just very smart oh yeah very smart I did a couple is radio shows exceptionally smart and a very articulate very he's got a great vocabulary and just knows right there I don't know if we calculate I'm sure you're you I think I always said that like people just need to it's it's almost like there's no way I mean other than like maybe having a podcast or something like that there's no and I know that Tyron does that now tyron woodley here has his own podcast and I think a couple other guys maybe as well but it's hard it's hard for people to get to know you all they see is this stoic fireman who goes out there and fucks people up you know they're not which should be enough who doesn't want that should be enough but it's like - it's hard I think it's hard for the UFC to figure out how to promote everybody no I understand I mean if I were people on the roster and all that so yeah definitely I think then better taught me a little bit yes I think better - great they helped you out a lot in the comments is either as I'm too loose or my wife's got a fat ass but there's nothing wrong with you know first of all I can't read the comments I love it back in the day back in the day when I lost the stream and then I was like people would write me like novels a bad word person I was I should kill myself were Spider America yeah I was in the world I'm like oh my god Oh God and wife's like stop reading it so I deleted my my facebook account my yeah I deleted it I went and then then I kept my Epiphany I said screw it I don't care anymore now if you watched my Instagram once in a while the tags I'm doing attack me or something they'll be like what's up - what's up your scheme you see say something stupid I hear that you're a paper champion I was like he's like he's a fake it's a paper champion I'm like I know dude totally

like now that guys laughing I just think it's funny shit yeah but isn't it kind of a waste of energy to engage those people you actually enjoy it I actually enjoy it usually hit me up on a message and there buddy brothers love a champ I just wanted to get a reaction but it's also like after this true fight you were at your lowest so you read in comments when you actually lost now you're reading comments when you're the heavyweight champion of the world it's like what are you gonna say bitch yeah the worst thing you know they could say is they can't say anything you fucking you're the champ yeah you're gonna lose someday that's the worst thing they could say yeah probably most likely and if you keep going eventually yeah I mean everybody if you keep going will lose including mayweather including everybody who's ever lived if you keep going long enough yeah father time will kick your ass once I be there to help them out fuck I go mom I three acres once a week and I might get down on my - I'm 35 you're still alright you still got a couple years heavy loads they say but you're later in life yeah I get down on my back is like tight and sore my goddamn cutting grass oh yeah I got a big scab and I fly around I get done I wake up in the morning what's a big scag skates a 61 inch like commercial no more oh you got one of them bad boy just seems like fun always flies but that hurts your back yeah cuz I'm always bouncing like oh it's not perfect level sometimes the fucking daily grind of MMA training like what that's got to be doing too body like when you're talking about how you barely get out of bed like some days most people would think like they see you fighting like this fucking guys just doing cartwheels all around the house all day and it's so bad I'll wait over the morning and like hey oh hey Kimmy coffee what she wants you to get her a coffee I'd like for that my housemates like her the dogs in me I got I get something there to pay the bills man for you though I really do I think that's healthy just like have somebody gotta answer to sometimes I love it honestly like you know she takes care of me man she does a lot for me so it's the least I could do for her yeah good woman she she like like it's the way that like the big storm I had no idea what to do she call insurance she screamed with them got more shit we didn't mean them you know that we needed and I wouldn't I'm like oh yeah that's fine they gave me like a little check another phone you should film like you getting out of bed in the morning maybe should do something like that for Instagram to like an Instagram video you here we go I mean people just don't they don't know cuz we're all they're seeing is uko and Fabricio Werdum knocking out Junior dos Santos raising your hands you know all of the glory moments I think that's one of the things that embedded does really well they show like hey this is a fucking grind for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks until you get into a cage for a fist fight and this is a fucking brutal way to get by in life I can go 30 seconds or in your twenty five minutes yeah which of course row 30 seconds wins but yeah maybe they should do something like that for this fight like really like follow you from beginning to end like foxy see what it's like when you're getting up in the morning and then just put it together for something after the fight yeah you know yeah I mean it sucks some some days man you know like you know some days I'm alright but it isn't like goddamn it says I'm sorry like you know me like man it sucks like I sleep wrong like unfortunately we let the docs in both us oh my god I get like 1/8 of the bed every king-size bed skydiver yeah yeah I'm like honey cousin coverage please you know yeah the dogs a fart last night was so bad man primo guy dude yeah I had her move my dog was watching TV with me last night farting up a storm - not cool but when do you like have a like how do you know when to call it like if you get up in the morning and you're like real fucking sore and you just can't how do you know when like maybe I should take today off I usually know by that night the night before yeah I talked to my coaches you know okay how do you feel and just on my sparring goes and stuff like that were grappling whatever I do some type of my condition like my sparring session if it's MMA kickboxing boxing or did you see what it is so just watch me and I'm like how you feeling the layoffs like shit my guy you know I'll just take tomorrow off and yeah or just say you don't take half a day and then work out at night and when you do take a day off do you do like ice baths or like how do you try to accelerate the recovery yeah you like ice baths Epsom salt or something I did you know that sleep all day I literally just eat and sleep all day just sleep just catch up my rest yeah it's good it's interesting though because there's no real set thing where you can know when to do it when not to he's got to do it all by feel yeah I think I think just knowing about it I think it's one thing I think that blondes and so I started fighting and just knowing my body because you know I think you're the best critic on your body because like back in the day we just do caveman training you know I feel fine but yeah there's nothing to is like we're so used to training a certain way you can get through those workouts even if you're tired and sore but I can go and pick up a bag of groceries and blow up my back right right you know I pick up a baby or put template on my shoe like I never had it but just you do random stuff that you don't do everyday like you know you pick up a bag gross oh my back Oh your back goes out but then I can go and spar five five arounds and imma buy his dad right yeah I can make it through just because I'm so used to my body being right yeah that's the weirdest thing right was you do the most ridiculous hardcore shit and then like you just go to tie your shoes wrong and something tweaks ya like what is that like what's causing that actually actually after my over in fight sitting there and I went to both my buddy when his parents were hanging ours you know couple cocktails with day drinking hanging out downtown stadium in the water and he is this little like four pound dog how you doing I go to pick her up and look cool and my back went out after the fight yeah it's absolutely it's a week later we clear how crazy I was like oh but anything like go fully full like I got felt in my we're good we're good Wow so then a couple days later and anything for couple days so I went to spar and hit a double a my pinched nerve in my back and when I was out for a whole week that's crazy from picking up a dog for pound it's like yeah I get I get punched in the face by I was going to Vegas once for a k1 bout way back in the day there was some k1 fights at Vegas we're gonna go watch and I'm in the shower on the way to like like to leave the house I might take it a shower oh this is gonna be fun I can't wait to see these fights and I just turn to grab this show the soap and Pat something popped in my neck is like fuck out of nowhere so I drove to Vegas like this the entire way like four hours and every time I to turn like to look behind me to park I had to literally turn my whole like this from just turning to get grabbed shampoo or something like just turning pop like no idea what it was doesn't make any sense we're just triggers every now and then and it fucked me up for like two weeks for like two weeks my neck was fucked Wow we adjusted chicken doctor they kill the fucking duck and my head some voodoo shit I mean look I'm not saying that going to chiropractors are bad things that people I'm sure it works but you know the history of what it like how it got still don't know that's a little wacky no yeah there's a some pretty good articles about how wacky it is but there's a lot of like it's interesting because there's a lot of methods of recovery that some people swear by like the cupping thing or like electrical muscular stimulation or you ever see those nor tech boots they put those things on your legs if you use those no no no those are they're like it's like like you're putting on pants they go all the way up your circulation yeah they have like they they're supposed to be really good for recovery yeah like it's interesting how so many of these things it's like they're just trying things out and they're trying to figure out like what works for you and what doesn't work for you you know yeah when I had knee surgery awesomely contraption like wrapped around your leg and she's like how like compressed you want I'm gonna venture we'll get tight so she get to tighten down so the cold water comes through and it's super tiny constricts it and push it all the bad blood in you know it's awesome I love it would you have done with your knee just scope yeah yeah my fifth one holy shit I'm the same name no I - am i writing through my left nothing a big guy you crippled why do you run I do I use that anti-gravity treble what's an anti-gravity treadmill so I put on these super tights these super tight things and I zip myself up and I and you can go like half your body weight sixty percent of your body weight whatever and you know you and the water zone of those it's air and it lists me up what really is pretty bad yeah what's the benefit of that just so don't pound my feet as much whoa so it doesn't pound your feet make soy because I'm 240 pounds so I kill my feet in my leg it lets me up makes a little bit easier but does it it can't possibly be giving you as hard to work out oh definitely I'm running a 9.5 miles per hour right but you're running in nine point five miles per hour at less in your body weight yeah I'm still running you know 20 like torrent some pounds so to 4000 K so like you said we haven't by the way I'm wearing 120 pounds and then 95 percent more like 200 pounds whatever it is it's still work I still get a great swim still breathing hard I mean it's still push myself is that like one of your main forms of cardio yeah that I do like a lot uh you know at pad workout you know what this sparring it's like you don't with sparring I do my rounds and I get done I do either power work for a twenty minute straight right after that do some ah sticks with Mike we're moving the film yeah exploit whatever they made they made some weird contraption do you do any other machines like go first a climber or any anything and swimming do you know any swimming no no no do wrestle I'm sorry I do wrestling here soon so mostly a lot of is old school training yeah which is probably the best way anyway yeah I like it I mean III run twice a week though for sure there's no question I like running just cuz like I run hard on Mondays and then fries is more of recovery run let my body rest but you're doing it in this thing yeah running on the concrete yeah I like running and just it feels so much better my legs like I feel better I could imagine I mean especially when you're you know you're dealing with 240 pounds pounding on your knees and you've scoped out all the cartilage and shit yeah they're doing some stuff now though you should look in to talk to dr. Davison from the UFC yeah they're shooting stem cells into knees and regenerating cartilage and meniscus tissue replacement I don't want to have that I don't think that you're gonna have to do that anymore I think soft tissue stuff they're gonna be able to fix that thank God yeah they're pretty they're pretty damn close they're able to do some pretty incredible shit now yeah and there's the great email really yeah my wife just posted on they grow your team they can grow your tea like the PRP like that whoa really Jamie we'll find it they can grow your teas yes put a little scaffolding you have some kind and then they use some injection to regrow teeth I don't know if there's any full use yet but like it's definitely on the way if it's not they're gonna be able to grow all kinds of shit they're gonna be able to grow body parts great our great-grandchildren they're gonna cut their hands off and grow new ones that they don't think you look good yeah kid's gonna be like my hands looked ugly I wanted long slender finger so I cut them off like oh yeah that's the world we're gonna be living in I resent yeah it's gonna be superficial well not just superficial but bizarre like you're gonna be able to you know they've already regenerated a bunch of different body parts like this one woman had bladder cancer and so they made her a new bladder with her own skin they used her own skin and used stem cells and grew her bladder in a petri dish and then put it back in her body yeah great works great haven't talked to her about her pee the promise of growing new teeth dental stem cells could revolutionize treatment for patients who face extractions Wow growing new teeth fuck what a weird world we're living in right that's got to feel good for you though to be thinking about the future like all the stuff you're doing yourself right now all the injuries and getting banged up yeah squirt some stuff in there and fix everything for that all right Stevie so January 20th everybody should watch UFC heavyweight championship live from Boston Massachusetts I'll be there I can't wait good luck to you brother thanks for doing the show man oh yeah John sure ladies and gentlemen steep a Miocic heavyweight champ of the world let these bitches know well nobody was in the house oho [Music] I know
