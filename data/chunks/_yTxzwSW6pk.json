three-two-one yeehaw i walked in you guys were watching soccer I was hugely disappointing to England's and penalty kick okay dude what happened like the World Cup man if they win they move on so with the penalty kick and they just won they just won England's just won we just fucking insulin are you guys Bruton for England YUM are you I'm English man and half English MA are you my mom was born raised there bro I think I know most people do English suck so you really root for England yeah big time no shit yes if US isn't in it you know you know what's happening when they're playing or do you know when the ball goes in no I have kind of an idea I would say I'm a blue belt in soccer really a blue belt yeah like I wake up early and watch the game the only World Cup dude I was in Boulder you know boulders like the People's Republic of Boulder I don't have to tell you you're from Colorado you know what it's like oh just go there Sun boulders ruff yes it's there they're like super duper liberal and people were unnaturally happy about the World Cup like super excited that they know so much about soccer and you know I was at a bar and it was like yeah that'll make you hate it if you go to England right you'll feel good about it but he was this certain type of white dude I not see you you know I mean well they probably had a dad that was in the Navy or some shit got bullied around at home and they just went the total opposite hardway know shit happens he's a tough sell especially if you're like an athlete like a black athlete like God that's what I know they struggle a little bit oh look at the beautiful mountains like bitch I don't hike awesome come on give a fuck about your mountains that's why they struggle I think recruiting really what's so beautiful there though yeah yeah if you're into fucking hiking and I can roll on drafting and just people are super nice too though they're all right they don't give a fuck about sports where if you go to like a southern school like Georgia or Tennessee they get pop your God every fucking period is that bad that they don't care is it good like balances know it sucks you got nature out there though Eagles and shit that wolves and bears are in wolves and grizzly bears and making their way back into Colorado really you know that goddamn time interesting why were they gone well they killed him off in 1800s and then they reintroduced him to Yellowstone and mostly they stayed around Wyoming and Montana where Yellowstone is and they made their way into Idaho but now they've definitely spotted them in Colorado and they've also a very credible source in fact my friend Adam Greentree took video of what he said was a grizzly bear and he knows the difference he knows his shit yeah I was in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado last September so they think that there's a population of grizzly bears Adam would know he would know and if you watch the news like the local news in LA which I do so what you want to get depressed you there's a bunch of black bear it's like a hot tubs and shit yeah in Pasadena Schilling oh yeah they love the tubs well they don't know that it's a hot tub they just know its water and so like for them to find a spot that's filled with water it's probably terrible for them unless you have a salt pool you know hot it is doing the chlorine the chlorine yes I'm saying like if the Bears drinking all that chlorine she hasn't that pool you know a hot tub yeah that's like that's dick superman' black boots yeah what percentage of hot tubs two people fucking 100% is the answer 100% one Pasadena sparsely Pasadena they're just rocking it out up there yeah there's a lot of bears up there there's a funny video man of this dude in Pasadena and he's on its phone and he's walking down an alley and as he turns and walks down the out he's just on his phone and he's looking down he's not looking where he's going he looks up and there's a fucking bear right in front of him in the bed under shit the bear doesn't know what to do and he just runs like what does if you can find that dude homey is just not paying attention I would shit my pants oh yeah for sure it's like you saw the you saw the homeboys in Seattle get fucked up well one died by the mountain lion yeah that's super hungry mountain lion yeah just on a bike apparently the mountain lion was emaciated it was all fucked up and sick and it only weighed like 90-something pounds but it still fucked both of those dudes up but they tell you that go use your bike as a shield and scare them off that lands like what I don't give a fuck about your Trek but yeah they hit it with the bike apparently it didn't do shit how about homeboy was like dude you're gonna attack I'm gonna run and get help way to go asshole yeah runs off and that line goes where the fuck you going and they want him yeah I'm boy got away you know that happened in Beijing too with the lady who got out of the car and a tiger attacked her at the Wild Animal Park yeah that's what's good she got a car the tiger attacked her he's a big beer it's a big bear that's a fucking terrifying bear so this guy he's on his cell phone where's the dude that's a pig yeah here it is here it is watch he's like fuck we just by the way the worst fucking thing you could do just super lucky see if you could pull back you can see like where the bear walks behind those bushes yeah right here so you're supposed to get loud right like get as big as possible you definitely don't want to run away because their instincts to chase yeah but they say when you get loud and like challenge I'm like you hear about that you brought that Boy Scout leader know who they rent they solid bear and you know it's like played a door or do your thing you know or you know when you play dead or get real big and loud like they don't know exactly what to do by but I guess in the Boy Scout fucking handbook says to get loud and like make a scene I know if I got loud made his scene and that bear was like oh cool hey kids watch this a dumb asshole first and from the whole squad oh no yeah so they don't I don't think they know exactly well the problem is bears are just like every other animal right like think about dogs all dogs are different man some dogs just come over their house and they're like hey what's going on how you doing and I'm something dude you come over the house their dogs checking you out like I don't know motherfucker I'm not sure about you Austin they get around you and the hair comes up you're like all my guys hairs are the worst as his hair up what's going on here I think bears are probably just like dogs and that they're just they very they say it also depends where you're at like they walked into his cave so he's like you're in my house give me that asshole it's terrifying I don't think you're that Cub Scout oh my god apparently the worst thing that could happen is you walk into a female with their Cubs game over yeah female grizzly with her Cubs should just light you up do you don't know chance it's not like you're gonna what do you do house listen some bitch on the news because they're talking about black bears and hot tubs and if you run into one this lady is saying kill so hilarious punch him in the nose their noses are super sensitive or go for the eyes yeah let me try that they bite each other's faces people have to understand like can they fight with each other which they do all the time they do all the time they're always fighting I've seen bears in person fight in the wild I've seen it they just fight especially during the the rut like in the springtime they fucking bite each other's faces and it doesn't even look very anything happen they bite the shit out of each other and nothing happens so you face with your little bitch ass hands like what are you gonna do Kalen has an old bit where it's he's doing special so you won't mind me saying but COUNTA has a little bit where people go oh just punkish punch a shark in the nose SiC your punch underwater he's like that exact same thing I've thought that exact same thing like how much could you generate underwater like people go underwater to work out you seen that famous photo of Olly he used to do a lot of shadow boxing he's in the water water yeah I'm John recreated it I've seen one it's fucking paint that's right you know GSP does a lot of work in the water he was the first one I knew he was doing work in the water and actually for I mean months would drive down to Laguna Niguel where he's working out we do these water workouts and we're in the pool we're in the pool for like two hours as like bro I did it for two weeks I think is yes you coming in on Wednesday and I know that sounds more like someone with a mental disability like Stephen Hawking you sound like someone who doesn't know English that good not good so anyway because you're coming home Wednesday I won't do that extent again and I was like nah I'm not man I'm taking up fucking pool you'd be in there like two hours you'd have these things yeah well he does a lot of jumping which is really interesting I was thinking about I was like yeah you could generate maximum force like jumping in the water and it's probably like really easy on the joints and if he Harrison it's easy on the joints but I was listening to one expert talk about it actually I think Lauren Landau's dummies he's a strength coach for the Denver Denver Broncos now are you saying it's good to mix in but to do it every week all the time especially in the sand or water you're not getting the same explosiveness you're not generating the same explosive power so you should mix it up yeah it goes if you're just doing that you're actually set you to make you less explosive Wow see those might be bags the different like land out but those dudes that are just on the cutting edge they're constantly like comparing studies and just trying to get that little extra edge and it is so interesting now it's so like the world of strength and conditioning has never been like more complicated there's no more bro science though also because there's actual experts alike you can look it up now right like back in the day my buddy like dude just eat fucking egg whites which we know is a terrible thing just the eggs like and drink milk and get fucking swole you know everyone had all sorts of weird fucking diets or just take this BSN and EXO explode and you'll be jacked bro yeah there's so many variables still there's still some some variables but when it comes to like the guys that get paid big bucks to Train top level athletes they seem to all be kind of on the same page correct Lauren endo is one of my best friends kind of a plyometric stuff a lot of plyometrics and they all usually they all agree on similar things like they might have this variation here incision here but most I'm agree on the same fucking thing yeah I don't want no one's saying you need to be powerlifting only and no one's you know no one's doing anything stupid a lot of are saying you know doing like max wraps and in multiple days and all this stuff like that's not the way to go anymore no I mean oh yeah it's over but I say fuck that noise I still do the meathead days yeah like sometimes like whatever fun to be mean italic get those jean shorts out nice 3-hour workout for Ross was looking for Decca Frost was giving us some insight into that like his philosophy on training what he said it was the most interesting thing he said Mark's mission about as smartest people get but one of the more interesting things that he said was that you should never feel sore he's like you should work out and you should build yourself up to the point where you never feel sore and never push yourself past your limit she'd never be like never and wasn't working out or draining - he was talking about trainings talk about it he was talking about just do more do more of it in the day interesting yeah he was saying that if you do like sets it like do a set it like here's a for instance is I'm taking it out of context is his example yeah I was like if you did certain I forget the numbers he was talking about but if he did a certain amount of work it's just a paraphrase say if you do 20 chin-ups you do two sets of 20 chin-ups you like you barely can get 20 and you're burnt out afterwards and you're wrecked or instead of that you're doing 40 reps right either way do 40 of them throughout the day but do it five reps at a time but do the same amount of work how the hell you ever feel that stamina it's good question but the idea being well I think it's a different thing but the idea being like to get yourself into this position where you can train hard especially with like physical fitness type stuff shouldn't break your body down totally you should just give your body enough of a chance to fully recover and then build up I think we have to be a little careful with it because Frost specializes in mixed martial arts well there's so many disciplines right when you can't go balls to the wall in strength condition you can't just break yourself with wrestling you can't throw pardon sport you have to kind of model those things and figure it out so I think it's a little bit of biasing he's right I think as far as it goes is mixed martial arts Loren Lando's been saying that forever because I'd go super hard in the weight rooms I'm telling you tonight you have wrestling you're be screwed man I've got to figure this out you got to figure out this formula man that's a long time ago yeah they think that doing weightlifting in lower reps more often is the way to do it yes it's fucking interesting man but when you train it for a fight you're gonna have to push yourself right if you're gonna there's gonna be certain things like whether it's hill sprints or whatever it is I mean you're gonna push yourself to the limit and I remember his Bisbing NGS we have the same concept and training with both my mother Bisbing he would go so hard in practice like his his when he would warm up his repetitions striking hitting mitts wrestling jujitsu everything was super high pace right um this is where I get my Carter from I'm doing the actual sport of it I'm not gonna go around fucking spreads she can do more wrestling rounds and GSP was very similar you'd go super hard in that aspect mmm yeah GSP is a wizard with that stuff man I mean he was always at the cutting edge became to doing gymnastics remember he was really in a gymnastic you know with him Enoch Marquardt and him would do it together so in my big ass I'd watch him do all these flips let me let me try this bullshit back in cartwheel and they're like very good man it's good you're getting better fuck you guys does anybody your size do that stuff it's gotta be the biggest one in there for sure and the rest were all eight-year-old girls who are just monsters ESP I just look like this big Shrek character in there gymnastics is probably like the sport that gets dudes the most jacked when you see like ring guys or tiny though right but they're you're skinny small person I've ever seen like a real small person just I'm sorry a small person they're all jacked are they they're all jab badasses bro I don't think it's the same thing we're talking about I'm saying I'm safe I'm small I know they're small though so third Jack mm-hmm like if like if LeBron got in gymnastics he's not gonna be jabbed but what's the average size of like Olympic gymnast 5 3 are they really tiny tiny sake Jack Jack but they've also been lifting like that since like four months old all I was getting at sorry before your horrific no I cry correct it's that small bolused rant do you know what ablest is it's the newest thing nobody say if you make fun of someone who has a diss ability your ablest including stupid people tall gymnasts is no oxymoron okay the average height for adult male gymnast is around five four two five seven Jonathan Horton is listed as five one five six five eight so five the tallest one is my height five eight I mean he's like the Dikembe Mutombo who's the tallest like the tallest girls like five - oh Jesus so that makes sense and then our stud does it say gymnastics stunts growth is that really if they think they start super you said that break below that there was an article does gymnastic stunts growth is that a real question whether it's done script right that's what I'm saying is it a real question well they say lifting young stunt your growth rate I heard that but how do they know that one listen why aren't your neck why are gym maybe you'd be fucking supergiant if you did may have been fucking weather gymnastics what does it say hold on sorry stunts growth explained hmm I'm gonna tall maybe there's drawn to it you know maybe the short people are drawn to make sense well for it's absolutely a myth says the US gymnastics hmm scientific community is an entirely sure but the idea that gymnasts would have grown to be a foot taller for they it only hadn't spent the time on the parallel bars is absolutely a myth the best in the world is for eight that's a xiamen by a miles is for eight Simone summer off bro Simone don't misgender her friends cause I'm so much closer timeout said Simms for a bro that's a crazy sport man when like everything's like ready set go it's all about doing it in one moment right someone says go you know it's there and then you have to nail it every week but your routine it's over a little slip all those months and will you watch gymnastics I'll watch a little bit you won't watch i watch World Cup I'm just fuckin with you I'm just saying I understand look if you if I find out something you like I'm gonna start marking it that's how we do oh we do we shouldn't make fun you can make fun of some shit that I like man I like a lot of dumb shit you know much get dumb shit you did bring back fanny packs though I brought them back strong you and cro cop though let's be real it's less courageous it's cuz they've been doing it forever over the best you ass as far as the US it's mean Hulk Hogan no Hulk got rid of a long time ago okay well we cross bridges he had it and I had at the same time let it go wow really told you let it talk ya know that sex date came he said fuck that I bet he still got one no no way I bet he does back in the day at Gold's guys would have them there'd be steroids in those they would shoot up with their little bag yeah he could buy it off of him look at that so you don't have one there that's pretty recent those poor guys guys had a shitload of back surgeries man yeah no shit would you expect was gonna happen back to wrestling is I think I believe so WWE heard that yeah probably for that WrestleMania Paris oh yeah that's amazing and chuckling don't eat or fighting so what else you got what do you think of that not my cup of tea but you know I just watch it the eye for sure well to watch it yeah we'll watch it whether you're fucking paying for it there's some people say it shouldn't happen well no I don't think it shouldn't happen I look at it more like if I see I think if Chuck Liddell was still employee the UFC he can pay four hundred thousand dollars just to chill whatever he was doing for the UFC he would not be fighting I think there's more of a money play which bums me out because I think Chuck Liddell Tito Ortiz what they did for the sport should be compensated for the rest of their lives it bums me out they have to fight to make money that bums me out I don't know if Tito does so much because he was very smart Chuck you know it seems like maybe that's the what's going on there but but he also has been saying no you gotta wonder what where this coming from but he has been saying that he misses it this that was his favorite thing he misses it yeah but it's different like if if we're gonna live forever if we're gonna live forever I would say yeah I definitely don't do it because you're just gonna keep damaging yourself if you're not gonna live forever when you're with it so let's say it's 48 so let's say we're gonna live to a hundred mm-hmm let's say Chuck lives to a hundred now he's halfway there being friendly right now let's say we've done never no absolute show medicine brother I have another what am i I'm thirty five thirty solid years left of me so let's say Chuck is gonna Madison's son science I knew shit I'm big though great Great Danes bro so let's say he lives to a hundred he's basically halfway there right dude at the halfway mark fighting it just it can't be healthy man like imagine me in 50 fighting Joe and you're the exception you know like you're in phenomenal shape it's yeah but I don't want to get hit you don't get hit in the face now it's not gonna be pretty not in the head especially if you had all those years listen I'm not hating on it there's a market for it do your thing I took like I said to me it's more of a sad story well like I think they should be compensated or like I want them to parlay their careers like a Michael Strahan or Kobe Bryant you know where there are legends and then they move on to do great things I agree but I also if they wanted to compete it was because they wanted to compete I wonder where it makes sense to tell them they can't or they shouldn't because if they want to do it if they both want to do it like if they had money and they're like oh so what is it about it is it the motivation that bothers me like what is it about a fight like that is the fact I think it's the motivation you created a little bit right yeah a little bit because see I think Tito did better financially you know I think Tito's mind he did really well in Bellator mm-hmm he might actually want this fight just to fight Chuck again I think so I think Tito's on a different trajectory correct yeah I mean he's been fighting and doing well you know yeah he's he's still a formidable guy he's a beast that was a big fella yeah yeah that's both great guys now I will say this everyone who's fighting in these older leagues or if they if golden boy if that's your thing to do like these this Master League everyone fighting that League better pray to the MMA gods Vitor Belfort does not enter that fucking thing juice to the gills oh yes you better just amazing fantastic that fuck out of all those old dudes at the same time dude I was against Instagram the other day I was like oh my god yeah there's something happens to Vitor when he fills up with super unleaded dude it's like peanut butter and jelly he's a different do his words bro like some people don't don't don't do well with Roy to get all Fred and chicks he looks great his skins vibrant his tits are pocket he's all Stan's teeth get wider he's doing straight testosterone he's not mean when he was on see think about this right we know for sure we all know absolutely 100% the people have cheated and taken steroids and got away with it we know that I know we know that especially in fighting especially when the the weigh-ins were the only day you had a pee yes there was no random they didn't just come by we know for a fact but when you watch someone who's just doing testosterone and what else he's doing was a two-man growth hormone and fucking gigantic now I love that man I love it too but what you get there it's a different thing like for Vitor like something happens with him like when you when they allowed him to take it like during the Rockhold fight and the Bisping fight dude his body ate it up but that's a it's a kind of a different thing because you're it's like it's above board all right let me let him do it so he doesn't feel guilty about it you've Jimmy he still he's finding a way where it's still legal yeah when he was doing it yeah he was doing it legally he was doing it legally he got permission from the UFC to do it yeah Commission so let us think if you go back before he did it like would you see when he fought sexy AMA yes dude his body didn't look nothing like that it looks like a welterweight right and everyone wants to go the lot of people go oh he did steroids with whatever sport Sammy Sosa Mark McGwire Barry Bonds you take steroids try hitting those fucking homeruns everyone was doing it in fighting a lot of people were doing I'm like insane names if so when John Jones tested hot against DC right for whatever he does hot for if DC was doing the same stuff would he have beat John the answer's no but was a very close fight up into that head kick right it was a good fight you don't you really never know what could have happened I'm just saying let's say high level fighting correct however but however that's what happens we have to judge it based on that if they are taking the same stuff whatever you want to say John took but if DC you say and do you think the outcome would have been any different my answer is no if they were taking the same so I see the John thing we've gone over this but we probably should go over this again if anybody doesn't know the actual the numbers he tested negative then he tested positive for a miniscule amount was really small and then he tested negative again so whatever happened happened in a very short window and it was an incredibly small amount of whatever that stuff was some call it micro dosing yeah it could be that maybe you don't we don't know really yeah the the thing about it is that stuff is supposed to stay in your system for a long time it would be a stupid thing to take because supposedly it's in your system for weeks mm-hmm but we don't we don't know yeah and also the micro dose and shit is real folks that's real I mean that's what they were doing in baseball they were taking testosterone gummy bears and they would only last like three or four hours and they said hey arrive alive they said I would eat them during the game yeah yeah and then by the time the game was over it's out of system yeah and baseball with that was testing baseball players was the dumbest shit but it was one of those weird American things like everybody's logo Morpho cannoli treating but if we had the Russians attitude about this just be cool man if I mean what is it like like how do the Russians feel about like that documentary Icarus where that guy came on claiming that all the Russian athletes run steroids they don't address like yeah no shit buddy anyways whatever let it whatever we just get over it man kill a few whistleblowers over here don't - yeah come over here let me know it works out for you yeah no but wonder but that's the stuff with steroids I think we put too much we almost put too much emphasis on the steroids wait don't get wrong it fucking helps and helps a lot of guys but if if everyone was on the same thing Jon Jones would still be the Great's all time he'd still undefeated Rock Brock Lesnar it still be Brock Lesnar I think Kane would still be Kane state still be I think everything would be the exact same I got I gotta be serious here man I think you're right if everybody was on the results would be the same if everybody was on the problem is like some people like Vitor just it just his body loves it he's made for ya his body's made for trt replacement it's crazy it's yeah so I mean you know good luck good luck good luck dude now that he's in the Wild West of Brazil and he's looking for some gram wheat on his Instagram he finds his family like how long you been a fan he's all beginning Browns like you might see me fighting his guest goes let's do it like give him a wanker my kid who's gonna sign up to fight that fucking monster but here's the thing how does he get out of his contract does UFC still have him under contract or did he retire he retired but that but just because you retired and I know cuz I retired your contract isn't void it's frozen they're very smart but it's Vitor Belfort I got laid out at all he's done for the UFC I guarantee talk to let him go Dana would let him go too soon yeah that would be nice if they did the scary thing about Chuck is Dana who's very close with Chuck for a long time I don't know if they're so close anymore Dana this is Dana gun he says I don't think he should be fighting like I don't wanna see him fight again I sure as fuck when I'm fight here I hope he stops when someone close to the situation says I'm like oh god but he's gonna do what he's gonna do Chuck vs. Vitor was one of the first fights I ever called completed his contract with the UFC last month and a lost lyoto machida but it doesn't mean he's retiring the Phenom took to social media to hint to return ass fans who they would like to see him fight next oh he's good then as usual free tour though his choices were a bit curious who's he asking a fight Vandelay he asked the fans so he said verily Chuck Tito Bisbing or Hendo will hand on biz means not happening Chuck Tito Wanderlei you tell me you wouldn't watch validly Vitor I would go I would watch that what if say imagine the Tito and Chuck fight and Chuck wins Chuck wants to fight again he wants a fight Vitor again a beat Vitor and UFC 37 and a half and now it's like we're back to the future yeah Tex Chuck might please don't fight Vitor he's a fucking I feel like it's different whatever but wait a minute we don't know Chuck was clean how about get Chuck on the super soft around you can't be eating mangoes and dates and fucking almond butter and think you're gonna compete with a saw stop Vitor I didn't think of that come on golden boy yeah you get that fucking yeah you can't fuck with any legitimate organizations all these let you all these organizations that want to sneak up on you in the middle of the night and test your pee no plan come on go and snitch take a break how about there's guys like you know Josh Barnett and evenly Lyoto said that he goes with Sian with the UFC because of you sada and obviously they've all been busted previously so they have a little different agreement with them but they're saying listen what josh barnett was not bust by Nowitzki right it came out he never took anything we lost a year of his career yeah I don't understand the Josh Barnett case I'd like to have him explain it because it sounds like what I've read sounds like he got fucked no he did no they admitted that they know for a fact he did not right like it came out that same thing like they've had other guys right like the the the dirty bird what's his name Tim means him means they came out that are bad over the counter yeah it's all good right took like some protein powder that was slightly contaminated and that came out is true and with Josh Barnett it took a year to figure this out and then they go my bad bro yeah yeah I know you missed a year in your you know older fight or it's a year of not getting paid my bat you're back you're welcome back now and Barnett's gonna fuck this man I'm out it's not really what they did I promise you that's what they did see that seems to me to be a case where you've made an error that should be you should compensate that fight that's what I'm saying he shall fully compensated he should win force a guy if you made the mistake that's that's like I mean I'm not a business person but if I was a business person I'd be like well this is a clear case of someone owing someone money because you fucked up but what what the you saw is gonna says it was an investigation took us that long to figure to get to the bottom of it that's the process that they were wrong right so if they were wrong so all their investigation stuff they did that took so long to get to the bottom of you accused a guy who's innocent right yeah but see don't they say they say potentially flagged for pd's right they don't say what you're flagged for and then it goes an investigation but they're not they don't say he was he suspended he tested positive a see potentially flagged and then there's an investigation then took a year to figure that out I think that they you saw a like especially under the whatever guidelines that they had coming in here had a lot to work with right there's a lot of fighters you got to figure out who's you got to test this one more organizing so I mean it must be crazy but must be a nightmare I'm not saying it's an easy job I I think it's two months a very hard job and I think it is too much to this 500 fighters on roster but what a legend like Josh Barnett he deserves respect that's the youngest-ever heavyweight champion agree John he's one of my favorite fighters and he's bright one of the smartest men ever graced the Octagon he's such a smart very smart I love Josh Barnett however if you're Nowitzki and you look at the history of Josh Barnett there's a reason to have skeptical Golden Snitch eyes on him because he's tested positive previously right that's what's going on see we're saying you know I'm saying like if you have a track record hmm like it like I'm gonna test over in a tad more vitor tad more that's deep in here what do you see how dare you oh yeah just look at DC like now you're good about your fucking super unleaded DC DC is 40 years old son DC's 40 years old on the natch with just some powerful fucking Herculean genetics just to get him on that super sauce kid bro get him on that vitor shit that gives you veins in your teeth [Laughter] dude when he was there was a time when feet or was there had to face off with him and Rockhold and you look at Vitor like how it was when he was doing the Mohawk to look like it a stingray hanging off the back of his neck look like a fucking stingray with his traps were like he looks so scary dude and this is even at the weigh-ins man this woman the weigh-ins were the real weigh-in yes Rocko told me he goes he looked right out I'm just like what the fuck is this it's just one straw coming out of thigh balls just fucking tears of winstram it was just testosterone he was on other things too oh my god I don't know what he was on it's hard to tell from that picture cuz he's an actual 185 right there I'm very very deflated it's amazing the difference between some guys like when they weigh in like Yoel when he weighs in at 185 he still looks super ridiculous uber jacked at 185 you can't believe he only weighs 185 he gets a little scale radical but then he fucking whoop you mean he just puts all that meat back on your boy your boy Whittaker was like you that motherfuckers yeah here's interviews like he said it was magic he's like it's magic see that man come from that to that he was and also you find him before and he's aging and this time he was even harder he's like something's up there son yeah here's the thing maybe but you know what else maybe maybe crazy Cuban genetics I think that shit should be crazy there's young genetics how much more impressive whether whatever in son let's say is on some whether could beat him twice yeah there should not be a third fight I don't think this decision was just in the second fight now you're crazy I think there should have been 10 eights no I think I need to do rules yeah I think should been a draw of it I don't think y'all won that fight if any if you're gonna give you all ten eight then that's a draw yeah drawn fight and I don't think they give draws out enough I don't draw either because then they're forced to have that I'm saying that I'm fine with I didn't think that a decision I thought like there's too many moments in the fight where Yoel hurt Whitaker like really hurt there was no moments in the fight where Whitaker really hurt you well like really hurt him like had him in deep trouble there was one that head kick the wobbling a little bit let the head cake was when doubt I don't think that even fucking did much it why would his legs at a little bit but if you go round by round watch I fight a bunch I think this was a good that was he landed with the foot right like right in the face top of the hell yeah but also like your round by round I just stylistic I'd Whittaker winning three two and all right let's say I gave you out when he fucked him up that was a fourth or fifth him I was I think was both rounds he had trouble I gave one a 10-9 to you and then if you give a 10-8 you'd still be a draw right which I'm fine which makes more sense to me but I just know people have a hard time with decisions when the guy at the end of the fight is fucking the guy up now obviously this is coming from someone who's a professional commentator so I understand this is a ridiculous argument but the ridiculous argument is if we're gonna judge what a fight is we all know if you're watching a fight fight right if you and I are in a fight and you're on top of me beating the shit out of me in the last few seconds when the cops come in that doesn't matter if I if I've ran around this room and kicked your legs yeah for the first two minutes and then you got on top of me and we're beating the fuck out of me for the last 20 seconds and the cops can talk in prison rules you won the fight you won the fight in the fight but as a professional sport understand but this is a professional sport that's kind of a fight box and if I win the first eight rounds right and you're whooping my ass nine ten eleven twelve what do we do there it is it's a good no it's a real good point dude it's a real good point but the idea is see that didn't hurt all bro he was on wobbled it was already tired dude look how wobbly he is already there how about the kicks by fucking Whittaker winner is so good dude and the fact that he fought that fight most of it with a fucking broken hand in being with one like the first fight John know he's phenomenal you know he's through that hand too even oh no he's in trouble first a couple times I had one round of ten eight see this right here this is a 10-8 man this is a 10-8 again even if you give a 1080 it still it should be a draw then he wouldn't win the fight okay what went wrong two guys are fighting it's a closed round but one guy drops the round drops him and has him hurt like everything up into that moment is close I think that's still a 1080 use demitasse antenna it's I think for ten eighths it's got to be the difference is someone almost got finished this is an almost got finished moment the legs go the person falls the guy gets on top started hounding them to see I don't have a problem ten nine I think has to be a clear fucking bully beatdown for a 10-8 I think that should be a 10-7 I think we should make this shit makes game I'm fighting fighting I really feel like this this scorecard this this 10-point must system is silly the whole thing's silly though the the judging but the silliness yeah you're right we've get that fuckin ellipse but in the numbers like why do we need ten points just because boxing always had ten points there you only using their hands they're not even using their elbows you know just think about all the different things I can't what's worth more is a jab worth more than an elbow oh yeah yeah what's worth more a deity nope that you get out of how much penny points you get for that I've got to figure that out man but but it's also predicated off styles too cuz what happens if let's say I'm Brian Ortega let's take Brian Taylor max hallway and Max halwa and the feet jab in good distance control and Brian really can't get it going with any poles guard post guard and he's fucking throwing arm bar triangle leg lock and Max is kind of defending but he's in trouble yeah they're not given that to Brian down there right they don't know shit up on the dealer get max on top real well when it was on the feed he landed more jabs let's give it to fucking max yeah there's moments where a regular guy is on his back and they're right correct guy doesn't have a good guard or a guy who just tries to hang on until the referee pulls them off but then there's some dudes who have their guard is like the scariest place to be you got it you got to know what you're dealing with you got it get another premises yeah I know that kid Paul SAS fuck yeah one so many fights by triangle yeah it was ridiculous you see that guy fight off of his back you'd be like whoa yeah he's moving quick he was closing shit up quick dudes didn't know what the fuck was happened and all sudden they're jacked and triangles dude how about that max Holloway Brian Ortega fight that's a greatest fight at 45 since Connor yeah and Aldo yeah I agree I agree he's such a dangerous fight for max it's a dangerous fight for both guys I mean this is the first well for Ortega it's not his first time in world class territory right he had cub and he had Frankie he wolf one bolt of them in spectacular fashion I think in this Frankie never been dumb never been done before but the crazy thing I thought just as crazy maybe more crazy was the way finished cub he almost got cub in the first round Cobb is a real Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt free and I know that max finished cub as well but cub was hurt and if I think he had either a broken jaw or it he went to the fight injured yes some was fucking it something went real bad during the fight anyway you know all credit to max he did finish him but it was the way when they went to the ground Ortega locked up that Darce at the end of the first round I was like Jesus this is tight this was tight man when they went to the ground and they were when it was looking when he was cinching it up and then the buzzer went off I seconds the fuck yeah that fights over that's right that was a tight fucking and he did the exact same thing again he was how cool cool he just knew he could do it the thing is in his jiu-jitsu is at such a fucking high level he's so dangerous you can't really train for it either like just just be in the room with Ortega it's that you've seen triangles you've seen arm bars the way he sets up that's so explosive and the angles he hits you can't bring anyone in to duplicate that something so different and what's crazy about Brian is his story like he's a guy who's not gonna go in the talk shit he comes from a super humble background and his his demeanor inside that octagon when even early in his UFC career when the the it was not going well for him and he found some way to he's finished all fighters so found some way to get it done and I think it comes from growing up in that rough background man yeah it doesn't fluster him he's like I just I need something he never gives up he's like hey something's gonna come something's gonna come and I think that's huge in this max hallway fight because max distant control is fucking second to none man it's gonna be tough for Brian to get in there I think once Brian can get it an underhook I think we're gonna see him jump to half guard something like that it's gonna be interesting it's gonna be interesting to see a Brian could turn to a jujitsu match but the thing about Brian is he's so comfortable with his hands man he's getting more company and doesn't train doesn't like the super team yeah he's amazing but max Holloway dude when I saw the second fight with Aldo the second fight with although there was some moments in that fight where I was like cheese well he's one of my favorite first dudes on another I know but he was overwhelming although like he went into that fight you know and basically when they announced the this is where the his phrase where it started to hit me it is what it is you know I love it that was his attitude to go fight an absolute future hall-of-famer who was thought to be the greatest featherweight of all time a guy who you know think about some of the spectacular chaos of Chad Mendes and I mean he was a monster when he was young Cub Swanson flying knee WEC dude he was a beast and for him that fight and be like it is what it is like it is what it is fuck that man he just smashed him just what he was gonna fight fucking khabib oh yeah and he would have if they'd let off yeah if the Commission did pull him off the weight cut he would've fought could be bun like how many days notice what was that eight days yeah fucking that's how much of a badass he is super short known I also think what the reason why I love this fight it's so good for the UFC especially just for the both of them is Max and Brian are gonna fight multiple times this I think this isn't become a cool rivalry are you gonna see him go from 45 whoever wins is I don't like Carrie I love both those men I fucking love both those guys whoever wins I think eventually they're both huge for the weight class and Max is younger than Brian they're gonna go to 55 even Max's team goes he should be a 55 he's fucking huge 445 well you think about how much weight he had to lose to get to 55 I know he pulled them off the weight cut to 55 which is crazy 55 there's some fight for him but I think and this is great for fighters man like with with Aldo he was never that big until Connor came right and there's this rivalry DC John Jones 80s like there's these Rowley Misha Misha Ronda there's all you know Holly run there's all this it's stuff starting to happen and then people fucking tune in so I think for Brian and Max they don't need to talk any shit they just keep being humble their skills speak for themselves but their people want to tune in for that and you're gonna get a bunch of fights out of these guys man and I think you're probably right my dicks hard about oh I know I love it man I get goosebumps talking about those questions too yeah they're pretty badass it's nice to see just anytime you have a guy who's defending his title and you have a who you legitimately think could be a champion and you see look you look at the two of them like I look at that fight and I go I don't know I don't know what I don't either just don't know if if max makes one mistake capitalize on it fine so dangerous so dangerous in certain me is when I first met Brian gears going he's in the gym remember he was mopping mats and just doing this thing and Hannah would bring him on the road he even goes on the road now with him and they teach cops their their tactical stuff and they do these seminars and he was like Kenner's little guy and I was took him serious cuz Jitsu was ridiculous and he trained with me and all the stuff but I never thought best in the world you know yeah what's up man and I see when when they told me cuz I quorum for a fight and then they go dude ufc's come in Colorado not yet you know I'm cautious Larry I'm like no no no please he has to work on stamp don't fucking let him do it man and then I was like dude he wants to do it and then fucking and I was way off that one fucker he got good he steps up the level of competition well he definitely does but it's also he's so good at Jiu Jitsu that he just took whatever that focuses that God I'm so good at you just do and apply to the striking and now is that he's just a winner he knows how to win you know I mean he knows how to put shit together when he landed that uppercut Frankie and I was like Jesus vicious like Frankie's a hard guy to fucking hit clean impulse yeah great main yeah well an even greater and he came back and won that fight which was which is insane drawn the first fight ko is him in the second fight those fights were fucking chaos man I'm the best but the fact that Ortega took him out means some people say well maybe Frankie's at the end of his rope he's in you know he's in his deep in those 30s now and what is he 36 something like that right 36 34 either way though it's Frankie Edgar either way it's Frankie Edgar yeah and then he went on to beat cups Watson won four weeks later technology yeah 36 yeah just phenomenal conditioning dude and then also on this card he got DC fucking steep a to me is like the first real like you wear in the super fight here to me this like the first real real super fight like GSP bismi I like that's cool that's the thick ass GSP I guess that's super fight but decease t pays a fucking real superfight that's a real super fight I love it man you know what I'm looking to almost look for to almost as much of Francis black beast that's right son Derrick Lewis Francis and gone oh whoa I know everyone thinks to me a first round knockout there's going to throw caution the wind I think Derrick Lewis double legs them either in the first round or set ground and beats them via TKO really yeah damn how good is Derrick's wrestling I mean the explosive dude use play football you know I'd see I think people are making mistake going Oh Derrick just gonna go on the France school and then fucking plant their feet and just fucking chuck the bombs I think you're wrong man I think you're I think people think that are wrong I think Derek's gonna mix it up if he's smart I'd I just I think what I would do if I was them and what Derek in his background and Francis working on stuff I think Derek's gonna shoot out the crowds gonna boo but Derek's gonna shoot and then his grounds for crowds little boo if it's a good crowd crowd that understands the danger of Francis on his back and Derek on top Derek with big ko power stop Travis Browne I bet they might be thinking oh shit this is gonna get crazy hopefully cuz it's not like if Derek takes you down he's just gonna hold on to you there's gonna try to submit you nothing punch you is gonna try to kill I can face that Travis Browne key TKO or a KO volitionalists it's one of the worst ones Bisbing root dan Hendo and then that one yeah yeah it's like you don't want to see that replay and that was a rough one that was a tough one and in Ghana man you got to get to him first the thing about getting to him is you're running in Amherst you gotta get to him gotta get to your runners you got to kind of stay back and then the cardio get still oh we only saw him tired once but it was a big one you only see him out of the first round once right yeah steep they figured it out he just he does also steep a like we're good right I get France a lot of shit but that fucking CB he's the most commune Oh accomplished heavyweight of all time yeah I mean you have to look at him his accomplishments you look at the guys that he stopped and the guys he defended his title great stop Fabrizio wins the title stops Alistair stops Junior dos Santos I mean the only reason why Stevie doesn't get enough credit should is because all these guys are a step past their prime right like to me yeah and I don't I love Steve to me what's more impressive when came bjds that was prime JDS who was the motherfucker motherfucker his fucking head right in the middle of his chest and did work after getting knocked out in the first round eyes Fox's fight in MMA history he's insane insane insane like that that to me that's a little more impressive than what when when Steve baby JD is because the Jets jbs after an ass-whooping by Cain rounds it is more impressive but you know it's almost as impressive is surviving that first round against Francis I don't know who would there's not a lot of guys that would have survived that round the waist deep a did dc-dc man I wonder he ate that fucking punch from Anthony Rumble Johnson that kid popped the fuck back up there oh god yeah Jesus Christ but John K Odom yeah it's John Jones yeah John Jones beat everyone we're talking about but maybe see the thing about Francis I'm very curious to see what he looks like you know I'm very curious to see what he looks like in this next fight we're gonna find a lot about whether or not he's able to correct mistakes whether his conditioning is just one of those things with all that fast twitch muscle fiber whether he's not gonna be able to go five rounds hard I don't think he's gonna turn into fucking Nate Diaz or something like that I think it might be a tad better the way you get better is not using all his energy on power punches like so maybe it's more of an experience thing but with Derrick Lewis he also pedal to the metal and hits hardest fuck - he does and he's been you know he's been in some serious trouble that Travis Browne fight like he was in serious fucking trouble man yeah he's uh he's a warrior for sure I mean that guy has been some crazy ass fucking fights crazy fights he's dangerous both are super dangerous I mean he wants that fight - Derrick Lewis is asking for that boy wanted now they both wanted that fight this is gonna be crazy super crazy I think the craziest thing on the card to me is how many people are riding off DC he's the underdog against eBay yeah I have DC being a man do you yeah I know you hate pigs but when I when I break down the fight I look at what that's we'll picture mixed eBay like super small and fucking DC like Giants deep a looks DC looks like he's like a fucking gigantic it looks like Brock Lesnar's yeah one says 76 inches 171 inches now that bothers me man like that the reach the height because DC's dealt with as entire career gus ofin john jones little guys had even bigger reaches i think also one thing to take into consideration steep a doesn't throw a lot of kicks he's not a big kicker he goes yeah he's more of a boxer and you know he's DC he's also gonna be able to get under him easier mhm then any guys ever fought before I mean DC's what 511 about 511 if that yeah you know he's gonna and he fucking he has top of the food chain wrestling man remember he did Henderson dude and Barnett in the air they launched him in the air fucking slammed him Barnett's ouch big fella yeah and can grab his fucking hand grab his fucking ass off and DC took him for a ride son but the Henderson fight was the most impressive to me because Henderson even though he's smaller than DC he's a fucking stud and he was an Olympic silver medalist himself and DC just rag-dolled MC and people go I see some people discredit DC a little bit when they go when he won the Grand Prix in Strikeforce that was a different time those heavyweights are older and you know the games involved while I get Steve Bay I'm like heavyweights haven't really evolved that much man you don't see a guy throwing a lot of kicks and mixing up wrestling at jujitsu like you look at Steve Bay's game it's boxing or wrestling you know that's very similar to what DC's used to beating so the times when he's in trouble is guy like John Jones who fucking mixes up he's a fucking nightmare well yeah that's what I'm saying when DC goes in a fight and you're just boxing or wrestling DC's is the reason why DC is gonna go down as when the greatest of all time is his mental game bro he's so fucking he's fucking fight like he was crazy yeah he's toughest shit and you know the like if you look who else does it the way John does where they're really good at everything they win by submission they win by knockout they win by you know Mighty Mouse you'd have to go all you have to go to a lighter weight those are the two right because even Cain Cain with do muy Thai and Cain would for sure wrestle and ground-and-pound but he never really submitted anybody know Cain's thing was wrestling just smash it yes yes yeah I'll work you get you to get you exhausted to the point where you didn't you never even believed you could be the price the grind yeah which DC has been training with Cain forever this fight yeah and and who came back now training yeah he's helping him Wow so so when I look at that I go like a cane style is almost identical to fucking steep ace but steep as a little more power as far as cardio wrestling Kings better at those things man well Cain was better than anybody that ever lived for like two years dumare yeah there was a mountain mean and he just got injured so many times there was so many injuries with him but like when you look at what he was able to do with real fucking tough guys just break them down real tough guys but you know he's had shoulder surgery back surgery knee surgery I mean after a while everything was just given out because of the force of his will and his workouts are so fucking tough those guys at AKA you know like Dana was giving them a hard time at one point I'm saying something about you know that they they're always getting hurt but then that's what how you get killers like Cain to get a guy that's got that kind of mind he's used to being in that horrible misery of trying to break someone he's used to it does it all the time what is DC they all do it all the time then DC went all go there and train and remembered DC before he went there he trained with us in Denver he didn't he wasn't that good you know loved see his wrestling was ridiculous but he moved there and then he just falls suit he got John Fitch young con checked yet fuckin compete khabib you got Brock old yeah man when Rockhold gets people on the ground smashes him when he got widely on the ground Wyden was stuck under a building whose same thing with lyoto machida you look at him and you go over Brad's ranch same gets you down and his fucking top game is just murderous because of who he's training with his training with those guys I have friends who who are watching train down in Florida and they were just saying his jiu-jitsu they wouldn't give me names they said world class jutsu guys he's fucking up rolling like just destroying no he's a knight he's a freak athlete he's strong and he's long he's got like long leverage but he's also got physical strength he was supposed to fight dust until he hurt his leg well uh he got a huge gash in it his staples I think he posted that would be a naturist invoke on blows Damir no time no time son so you think steep a and DC goes to DC by decision yep thank you out wrestles them I just think you outwork some I think yeah it works them and I don't think it's a classic fight I just think hopefully more people appreciate DC out to this Ida look at mo them they both have to embrace the grind thing as and as long as DC can avoid that big power punch early on he's gonna be fine and he's so smart man well I definitely think he's really smart but I also think that steep a is a really good striker and he's a bigger guy and he's got a long reach and he's probably one of the best heavyweight strikers that DC's ever fought he's got real one punch knockout power at heavyweight he throws clean shots he doesn't have any fat its punches he'll stand hand like this and drop one - Yates is his best shot he's got a chin he's tough as fuck he loves being champion great you know he might he might have a lot to prove here and you know he doesn't throw a lot of kicks but it doesn't mean he can't he can throw him if he wants to if he thinks that's part of the strategy and he wants to throw head kicks I mean he'd be cool to see I don't see I have he can kick he can kick it's the difference between kicking and practice and pulling off against a world-class that's true I like DC has tendencies man and that's where John that's why John John just goes i'ma knock him out by head kick because if you look at the video DC's here he's he's down there man he's susceptible to it so that's why I seize it but they did John fake a right hand and then throw that left high kick he was setting up he was thrown to the body throwing the body and then threw it out and then you see DC go over and whack yeah let's see if you can find that clip of John Jones ko in DC here it is powerful Jamie oh man just landed it perfect let me see that one more time yeah you know what tension I don't let go go back to sorry go back to beginning watch this dude that was beautiful the way he did that I was hoped on comes back it was beautiful there was like no fat in that at all man it was beautiful so amazing boom think how good DC isn't for him to do that amazing ridiculous smashed him dude look at this so ridiculous damn he took a couple extra shots there that he didn't need to take well there's a lot of down there now they're even going back at it on Twitter but had on Jones here's the perfect case scenario if you're you know if you're Scrooge McDuck and you're sitting down and you're looking at the UFC robe roadmap you're like we love steep a he's been a great champion but if they could plan it like you're fucking Vince McMahon and WWE you want DC to win and then John to come back and that heavy weight you have DC John Jones fighting for a world title heavyweight and they have Brock going I got next weight in the back gun I got next kick Euphrates ratings ratings ratings ratings ratings going snitch take a hike I like it let that sink in another one is what if John suspension lasts longer than we think we don't even we're assuming that John's gonna get a suspension that he's gonna be able to come back fairly soon don't be the no-fun please well what if Brock comes in and Brock fights the winner of DC and steep a let's just say DC wins I'll take it okay and DC DC could beat Brock that's an interesting fight DC vs. Brock's an interesting fight great fight Brock's got hands as big as his table he's fucking any Ken Russell's that hunk of restless ass hop the question is can he do it clean at his age cuz he took like 12 different tests is clean talking figure it out like the last one I think the USC wants to make that paper you tell you solder to scram for like dinner like go grab a cup of coffee it's Brock and John grab a fucking cup of no one no one's gonna ever let that happen this is we're talking trash this is nonsense talk you're crazy if you mean you saw us all clean like the government what are you saying first of all you think the US government is clean I'll call Eddie Bravo right that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying you saw us like the government son everything ain't fucking done by the books if I'm Dana I'm like you open up your glove compartment box yeah you keep that and you made a greasy mouth shot keep it greased boys come over and punch each other in the face yeah fuck up our tspn deal Wow and who wouldn't want to see that yeah maybe yes Pam posed them aside take him into some smoky room sit down there with some Cuban cigars what are we doing here fine whiskey how long is their deal with you sada do we know you have any idea I don't know there because it's sign a contract no I bet there's a countdown in Dana's office just every day [Laughter] the whole thing is kind of crazy that it's self-imposed right nobody doing man well it was a great was it's a great move to sell to sell yeah well there's the move 42 so genius monster Lorenzo's a goddamn genius he figured it out and you know now he gets to just be a fan with four billion in the bank you what what he's like yeah I know just smash you added to make an omelet man but it's a great success story because those guys were down 40-plus million dollars in the hole yeah when the ultimate fighter took off they they had spent their lost 40 million putting that to them though it's enough 40s 40 but still lost see if you lost a couple hundred grand you would survive but you'd be like shit piss for sure he'd be like fuck this is not good it takes a long time to make that mind especially I get to my boy to run and it's fucking up you know yeah exactly 240 million dollars it's 40 millions of dollars I agree well I'm appealing I'm like I don't want that money going away so it going home get my dick sucked like oh my god that sucks anyways let me just walk in my giant mansion you gotta think of how many different businesses they're running at the same time though they had like 20 casinos 20-plus casino stations they had Green Valley Ranch Red Rocks rocks his dodo then they just bought out palms - oh yeah homes little rundown but whatever ten nine no that's Steakhouse there oh that's one of the best steak houses in Vegas ghosts Baram '''l goes party should be dope that's old-school I used to stand up there I've done stands and ghost barbs one of the bars there one of the bars downstairs there's a there's a laugh act in Vegas right there is now yeah trying to bring it back ice is there all the time I think it's in the Tropicana does that make sense The Laugh Factory Tropicana Panetta the Comedy Cellar yeah that's in the Rio the Comedy Cellar supposed to be really good who's running that though someone we know is running that I thought the Comedy Cellar I don't know Ian's there a lot though Iannetta he says it's great Vegas to me is always a weird vibe obviously you're there during UFC fight we can you do your huge fucking stadiums but I'm saying as far as the crowds usually it's not UFC crowd yeah well there's so many things to do first of all right Celine Dion I could be on ecstasy right now why am I here listen you talk I do I conclude the fucking roll in my ass off why am I here there's so many things to do like if you have you ever been to one of those circus always sure have have you been to love the one at the MGM no but I've been there Zumanity with a friend and some drugs and this is one of the best times ever ever ever how about when Disney uses those robot flipper things to do a circus elation how crazy was that I posted this online I saw this this this article about Disney's making acrobatic robots do these robots flip through the air and land and jump into holes and shit in the middle of the goddamn park these robots the Disney's making their animatronic robots but here's what's fucked up about it what's to stop someone from using these and making like a super warrior with the same technology this is all under the guise at Disney these motherfuckers I know what they're doing so look at these things dude that's a robot that's a robot son look at this look at it swing and look at it let go and talk perfect jump into a hole yo dude that's gonna be a kill robot that we send overseas to fight battles look at that thing fly through the air and boom this is nuts man I mean this is really insane stuff what the fuck they're doing this they're gonna have this I like the Pixar parade or some shit for all the kids I think they're gonna do this for movies for shit like that so that you don't have to risk up many jobs I'll see ya dude that's so stumping oh my god that's tape Fletcher yeah but she states acting he'll slide in he'll be able to make it he's still gonna be a character yeah he doesn't CGI a face on that paint faces they're not even gonna need people for voices half of that movie Logan the Wolverine movie yeah he wasn't there what what there's a video you can see where they show you how they CGI'd everything he wasn't really there for half of it or they act they did it very strange that movie's depressing anyways yeah like your Wolverine panels at goddamn driving them limo and shit Oh after it's over he's like a limo and fucking Xavier Professor X is liking some weird fucking hot dying and thought out it'll bum me out bro don't watch it I'm not a movie the wrestler that's terrible yeah it's a bump yeah depressing I couldn't first class all the way anyways yeah Vegas is weird what we're getting at and Disney's trying to take over the world the Disney's about to work with DARPA that's what's going on son that's Boston Dynamics or whatever it is Boston what's the company yeah boss Dynamics Disney does everything to see everyone he's not doing that this show all breaks down this is all a robot it wasn't even it was a stunt double guy what fucking he's a resistible guy does this and then they put him on top of that oh look at that they just have this nice if you can make a robot do all that stuff then you could use it to put his face on there and whoa Hugh Jackman got super Jack bro he's on that vitor diet he got so swollen I got but he doesn't look like that anymore like in this one we had to do America's greatest showman you can't be all jacked Singh in there right so they just mapped out his face but the thing is like if you you see him in this one he doesn't look as Jack does he didn't like the earlier one he's older it's all supposed to be right if his body can recuperate from anything well fuck the aging exact come on why is the agent like that Stanley come on where he's losing some of his muscle buddy still throwing people through the air attack at all his shot recovers right away but his fucking joints hurt his arthritis arthritis no no you really move like it these days I don't know if he officially does I'm just saying it doesn't make sense how about they come out with another fucking spider-man oh thank god they need a new spider-man they never want to pay Peter Parker - when Peter Parker starts getting big they go yeah well guess what we're gonna reboot it they keep telling the same story over and over again with subtle difference my spy rants Tobey Maguire you fuck you fuck anyone else God he cries I'll tell you what though the only time that that's worked though the Hulk yeah they've done this they started off with that Australian dude from chopper what's his name Eric Bana Eric Bana he was number one wasn't thrilled about him as the Hulk not his fault it wasn't his fault wasn't the best managed script and then Ed Norton pretty good as a Hulk fan of it no I was like okay I could buy this but then Mark Ruffalo best Hulk best one I believe that me too I believe he's really a scientist too I really believe he really understands genetics you know yeah just like Christian Bale is the best Batman you're talking about real act I agree sorry Ben Affleck I agree how about Michael Keaton's Batman who's a fucking cat suited goddamn Batman how you recast Michael come on this George Clooney's Batman - he's a fucking mr. steal your girl I bought I brought all when Jim Carrey was the Riddler and then Tommy Lee joint Jones was two-faced those are the best Batman's when they were like oh we need to make this more real like fuck you I liked Arnold Schwarzenegger as mr. Wayne man who was the Riddler Jim Carrey was the Riddler when who was Batman George Clooney no Batman Returns bro Wow but Christian Bale's are Batman Forever sorry it's too real do you know Christian

putting unbelievable stress on your doctor he's a beast he's English you know that I thought he's Australian is he is he English bro a lot of them are Australian the three for a loop but Jackman like

a real girlfriend that's so crazy people are real people like everyone's really your hating on someone because they're trans not you yeah yeah like why would you assume that she's not super nice and really friendly and really smart because you're prejudiced because you're just looking at her and deciding that you're hating now is she a dumb ass probably but does that matter you know I'm saying does not matter it's all right anything might not be as smart as you how much is that how much of that is her fault now this as I've gotten older and wiser when even my me dumb people I'm like how much of it is really their fault there's not into that stuff maybe they just got a bad roll of the dice with life and with genetics and the whole ball sometimes a bad roll the dice is you're genetically gifted if you're a girl or a guy and you look super pretty and think I'm easy - you never have to read a book or get balls deep in a sport or sure and that's to me that can be a curse yeah dude there's a curse to that because then things get easy like you want you you want your daughters you don't wanna be tense right now I'm like sevens strikes seven strong seven weird like guys liked it like the shrimp guys types they still gotta educate themselves right you know like you want blonde asses and big titties you want just like yeah you know I'm saying oh yeah for sure you don't want Nicki Minaj's your daughter in that ten the tens of sprint seven is of ultra marathon yes day a seven for many many many years good like a gym yeah they could hang in there but they gotta work for it like you don't want to give it to him you know I'm saying the problem with some tens that go to eights can't handle it but even when they're eight they're still hot but in there but in their mind they're not anymore in the Old Testament it was hot in the eighties there so there were tens ladies this one they had the gated shifter ass Drive one now like what tough fuck is going on stooop the Fred Flintstone qur'anic you'll have to get out do this no I mean want they're worth like a million dollars or something I tried behind one yeah I go in these weird fucking I almost bought it don't worry the other day I knew a lady at her old Ferrari she bought an old Ferrari in like 2015 she bought like one that was the one from magnum p.i oh the 364 is that what it is think so is this cool little car but it was just always breaking you know those things they're just not gonna it's not you can't drive across country in that car no somebody's in driver every year yeah they'd be fun though I looked up a bunch of cars I would like to have a bunch cars do have a bunch of Ko yeah don't jump into this come I'm still hustling don't try dude you're fucking hustling your ass I put you I don't have all the cars you know what I've been getting into man old plain-looking BMW m3s like an e46 amore Wow alright I'm for that oh shoot Guetta 8 Series with that video well maybe but I look like old scars I'm talking about like a 2005 me - I got 8 Series I'm talking like 1994 but those are well that's when the lights go yeah sick that's where I draw the line when the lights go up can't do it son that's Rossa of the BMW you like do the 95 3 Series yeah I came that canary yellow I did I did like those I like the ones with the big wheat in the back this is the m3 with the wing and the back everyone loved those tiny ass little car - man you go near those cars today they don't make anything that small anymore or not no BMW doesn't at least look at that those white lights oh that's like so your that's a dope look and that's an e36 right that's an e36 bmw yeah um Google silver efore t6 BMW you thinking about getting one of those I'm thinking out of all the cars I know right well that's how I guess yeah are you gonna buy it to run and look all the time look at that I like that you know what I like about that that's not that that's I 95 yes 2005 what I like about that yeah that's not that's a knife yeah it is isn't it 40 seconds active yeah no not so that's what they look like that's an m3 that's exactly it looks like I'm a fan of the model it's a very plain-looking car usually you know what some people do with those they just juice the shit out of the engine and change the suspension and the thing about it it's a light small car that like moves well I think that car probably only weighs about 3,000 pounds like Google how much does a 2005 BMW m3 where those were Porsches are laughs fuck - though man uh just Google how much does it weigh was it the weight I mean we could go buy 10 of these right now Joe no no no the 3400 pounds so that's pretty light in comparison look like a new one I bet the new ones are 3 or 400 pounds heavier than that that's a big deal the new ones are way fast wait wait wait wait that's my real they take these and they put crazy engines in oh they belong juice a month because it's a smaller car that's one the original like cars I remember kids just fucking jack and big exhaust on you buy your shirts do you ever see a kid who spent so much money on a really shitty Accord and put scrub just if they sell it at Pep Boys don't you have to put on the goddamn car why do you have all that shit all over the car what are you doing and why and it was so loud I'm like curse name in fast yeah I have that horrible fuckin that's those kids thought they're so cool well I guess it's cooler than the car as it is no probably not even because what it is is just transportation you're supposed to just accept what it is it's peacockin yeah like look at this right again you're not doing for girls you drop for dudes other dudes like oh that's pretty cool girls like what the fuck is that thing yeah look at that Honda Civic doctor makes my dick go limp like that psycho Civic they can make those things fairly fast though can't they yeah I just not into this I wonder timeout yeah what is that Ford Focus GT is that that little tiny lollipop go fast as fuck yeah that was a tiny little come on son like that though you want that Subaru WRX STI the Ford yeah how much does that thing weigh though that's a tiny little car right that thing looks like shit 3,200 pounds is a tiny little car bro dude you brought up 95 BMWs Ford Focuses and civics well you know man you know I have that white car the the white 911 rs fuck yeah that car ruins me for everything else cuz it's so light there Carly weighs 3,000 pounds that thing's insane ruins me for everything else nothing else fun to drive everything's fun I love cars yes sir then that thing is just a different animal it's like the difference between like a dog and a cheetah like one of them was like dogs run pretty good pretty good job but then you see like Jesus what but what if you got about dog what if yeah they're weird but what if you got a 911 T who lights a 911 T then Supra send it to shark which is to blow the ass out the front or one of the new ones yeah yeah things light its fuck they're very light yeah the 911 teaser yeah I'm sure they could do something like that because they don't have you know they don't have handle they have nothing I know back seats that's record light yeah they what did they get them down to I forget but is it gt3 weights there I'm let's see they're lighter aren't they gt3 Touring package absolutes gt3 without the crazy wing and it's just because which most people are not taking them on the track you're just driving a fast car around town 35 I can have that thing so the GTA 200 is this the gt3 or this the TT 3200 that's pretty goddamn light for a Porsche yeah zero to 60 for 3.4 seconds yeah but you can soup that fucking thing up yeah I wonder what is the horsepower what does it say see the what they're doing with yeah that's a 370 that's not even the s engine no man that's the regular engine there's not turbo now though go to 911 gt3 Touring I bet that's just as light but that's got like 500 horsepower that's my that's my necks right I didn't want that on McLaren man but you have that GTS which is a very fast car - there was a fucking great there was a big article about one of those recently I know people they say it's that one of the best like daily drivers bro that's 3100 pound son bro 500 500 horsepower 3,100 pounds that thing must be amazed this is what I want to do only get a touring I want to order it I want to in that mint green look how pretty that is they just nailed that shape you know I love it's it's one of the more interesting things about cars is just the physical shapes like what they've managed to like make iconic like the Porsche is such an iconic shape they don't need to do anything they do little subtle changes to the back and the exhaust that doesn't bother me yeah they just keep kind of tweaking it a little bit they keep that shape like every 911 looks like a 911 like if you look at a 2019 Mustang and then you look at it 1965 Mustang how do I know this is the same thing I know could barely tell this is the same thing you could have a 911 next to like you'd have thought that 964 that's like a 91 next to a 2019 and you go I see this is there below 911 it's 100% yeah that's the only car that I could think of like that cuz old Ferraris don't look like new Ferraris at all not at all I guess the new challengers look like a little bit like little challenge yeah yeah they retro - down a little marrows they're trying to go back to it coming out Camaros did like a new take on it the newest ones even that is a gt3 RS and all green Seinfeld gets like those and shit that's an amazing car man and that's cars more than 500 horsepower they're so light in that design you like that you think you're a dickhead for driving around town oh yeah for sure like I'm green of a lime-green car that says gt3 RS on it dude Mike says GTS and it's fucking hot orange you should only wear a golf club shirts from exclusive golf club golf clubs that no one could join if you try that and then have those loafers on with no socks smell like should smell like what's that what is it called when you might have down money to your kids they have one of those accounts what are those founds trust funds yet City Trust fun that's a I'll tell you what man that's all the handicaps you get in life one of the biggest handicaps you get is a trust fund there's something that happens to kids leezar securities the ones that i've ever heard of not just security but a large income just given to them by their parents I just don't have to work on it yes you know I read a statistic that it's like they're for hunt more likely to die before the age of 40 when they have that much money Jesus percent four hundred four cent I know a couple people that have had one of those deals where they had one of those and did you like them nothing I felt that I felt sad for them I know it felt like they they weren't really done like if you're an egg and you still got that gooey stuff on top it's like it's not quite done rich kids are counting on inherence to pay for retirement well-off young people hold on are you going well if young people say they need money from relatives and friends to guarantee their golden years stay gold see that's just click baby that's just some click baby shit I just saw her the other day you guys just mentioned this like 63% of them 63% of affluent children between the ages of 18 and 22 say financial stability retirement will depend on inheriting money you know it's just that's one of the things that Tim Kennedy said when he was on the podcast he said hard times make hard man hard man make easy times easy times make soft men where's Tim Kennedy to preach what do you do what do you do with your kids like my kids grow Marshall Monica martial arts for the girls you gotta be balls deep in martial arts just so they're like in ninth no no just to get I think you got to get a certain amount of like actual hard work in in your life more shorts gonna do that for me I think there's something to it there's something to go like valuing goals and to working towards things and then being in difficult situations we can play sports yes sports in general yes for sure I think all sports yeah I think articular it's more personal like when someone strangles you somebody gets your back and then sinks that fucking body triangle on you and you're fighting it off and then they get you and you have to tap that's very personal you'll get humbled for sure but most people don't deal with those kind of things in life I think the experience of dealing with those things in life is very valuable because you can relax more you can relax more you know there's some people on fidence yeah well it's not just that you've experienced bad things bad things in terms of like bad defeats losses getting smushed having a tap there's a lot of people that have never liked how many times you ever roll with a guy that never rolled before and the moment you start rolling with him you get him on his back and they start hyperventilating panicking they panic cuz they never been there before professional football players basketball players I've rolled with them they get down like oh shit oh no they realize they can they can get up and then you start closing the gap the gap on them here's the problem with my only problem with martial arts if you're just gonna go down that road is when you're in that dojo where the fuck you're doing the martial arts when they leave they know that's they're not many people have seen it right like if you and I are rolling and we don't know each other you tapped me out I leave there not too many people see it the other class might see it when you're professional sports we're playing basketball football and the games on the line and I give him bears cuz I dropped the ball I whipped and struck out and the entire audience sees it and I have to deal with that mayn't come back from it and back alright I can deal with this man I've I fucking struck out I play game next week right I got to go through class people who make fun of me I'll figure this out to me that builds a little something different yeah it's also teamwork right that's a big part of life yeah hard-working other people yeah being able to perform under pressure but also facing that adversity and knowing up because if you tapped me out Mike liked me when I go to school no one knows that that's whatever when I when when my class knows I threw an interception like fuck shop threw that interception man one day everyone's like dude what happened like I know I know wait till Friday we'll see what happens Friday no yeah um Bill Buckner how to leave Boston you have to go in like fucking he had to go into hiding yeah the ball went between his legs everybody freaked out dude I remember people walking around two people were walking around the neighborhood while I was kicking the snow and angry they were just so angry people were leaving their houses it was like there's reports of it all over Boston that people just slant they couldn't deal with any more cousin they would just slam the car the front door rather and just walk out in the street like what the fuck they're smoking looking at each other like how the fuck do you drop that ball dude imagine you be daggone tragic look it all of it is rough I think sports are definitely great for four kids for anybody developing even for adults I think they're good I think competition is good the problem with people is they they get nervous about trying new things or doing things and I think one of the things that gets you over nerves is having done difficult shit before and one of the things about jujitsu is that that's such a claustrophobic feeling like when you're when you're locked up in a triangle and you're just trying to get like a hand in there to protect you just just try and you're feeling the squeeze hey fuck I might have to tap and you try it and you make your way out of it and that being able to do that in your life like knowing I've been in a bad spot before knowing I've been someone's been on top of me before and I didn't think I could get up I think it's a very valuable thing for people to experience and I think it's a good thing for people to learn like it if you could start out as a white belt and just deal with that stuff that you get up until like blue belt and purple belt we start developing some skills and putting some taps on him if you can get through that man you can get through anything a guy can get to purple butter a girl can get to black belt or brown belt those people that man that woman that can get that far they can do a lot of shit that a lot of people can't do for sure for sure for sure I think giving your kids that opportunity is is a massive thing you know and I know your kid's gonna learn how to fight how the fuck is your not alone ran up device you all right cuz you know I watched a lot of fighting so I come in the house when I get home today hope because he sees all the fighters boxers and USC guys they fight with their shirts off when I walk in take shirt off I'll show you video him admit I don't know what to do get encourage him yeah don't tell him not you don't fight son he only does it we made good yeah he only does it with me but like you seen Eddie Bravo's kid do martial arts yeah be do seen headers I haven't done what fuckers on a teddy bear Kennedy's post he's like a teddy bear doing like arm bars you know and he doesn't drills with his kid he put post videos of drills he does with a kid his kid is not learning the system I think that's kid fuck yeah his kids gonna be an assassin you know what kind of jujitsu Eddie Bravo's kid's gonna have pretty gnarly because he's around this kid all the time like Eddie is a diligent father he loves that is hilarious he takes the back look at that he's like two and a half that is hilarious this kid is taking the back at two and a half that is so funny is the best teacher in the world of course yeah that's amazing only explains about Anne Hanner I think Henner to this is like his biggest pupil in terms of jiu-jitsu I mean obviously Ronda Rousey was most famous pupil look at that I buy that kids got Rhonda had an armbar before she got this she did exactly but Brian Ortega has everything he's got everything he can choke you could take your back you'd fight you off his back Brian came in there and didn't know anything yeah it was a tough gang member want to be out well I shouldn't say wanna be was a tough gang yeah from the streets couldn't afford it so Henrik took him under his wing that's amazing and now he's one of the you know he's number one that's a bit early in the world not named max Holloway that's amazing yeah it's a cool story hen are such a good instructor man I love listen to him talk he's so enthusiastic as a contagious you know I got a video online you could sell anything we're gonna make watermelon juice guys okay watermelon juice I've had a lot of coaches since I was a very young kid and I've never had anyone as it farts like a better coach than enter grades Wow I know they're from the source man I mean think about that yeah but there's a lot of those guys from the source but they just they're not they're not Hannah and all those guys are great as far as like the as far as egos and just being like you're cool like you didn't hang out with Henry anywhere it was like a great time and he knows a thing or two about everything like he's like you say surfing and he's a black doesn't serve fruit he's a you know sushi opened up his own place now he has his own jiu-jitsu player they left his dad's place they went right up the street now him and his here on Iran yeah oh that's amazing that and it's ripe the streets don't torrents very close the facilities were Dick is the old place still open I'm not sure I'm not I don't know the details on that but I know and then here on doing their own thing now they're killing it that's awesome yeah dude it's very lucrative in Southern California think about how many jujitsu schools especially if you're I mean Henner and here on top of the food chain but as far as business mind to that's what make 10 are so special his business mine is insane yeah inside the Gracie University that was all his concept isn't holding he came up with that well let someone who lives in the middle of the country that's a great thing I mean it's not as good as being instructed by him it's not but if you live in the middle of the country and you don't have access to other instructions that's a note in Wyoming you're some shit and you can go online the real place Snowden my wife you snowed in Oh you know I'm saying sounds like you found those sounds like

let him off the hook right I don't we never hit right that lets it that to me that's the problem with you side as they go this guy flagged but then if they get you know proven innocent there's no big write-up there's no big announcement like there should be a fucking needing to be proven innocent maybe it was um wasn't a diuretic or something like that yeah I was diuretic maybe didn't get proven innocent I mean when was the last time he fought maybe he just has a fucking Gore is it steep a that was classified how long ago was that last year was a good fight so how much time do you get suspended it depends where you're at but six twelve months right depend what you took right but if you're gonna take a diuretic is it the same as taking choose I took a steroid you get longer right yeah hmm it's all weird man it's almost someone confused I'm just like what they say about the Tour de France Tour de France knows how I pronounce it like Bryan Callen would appreciate done to de France Tour de France they say that it's healthier actually to do that with drugs there's to do without drugs it's so brutal in your body that won't work Lance yeah don't you think fighting the same way yeah I get so taxing your body yeah that was my point yeah I mean I really do but I don't want it I wouldn't want everybody to say they have to be on it like everybody has to be on it I wouldn't want mean that seems like maybe we shouldn't do it if you have to do to Santos admits he's still scared of you sada I won't say it doesn't bother me hmm I wonder what the actual he was flagged but he was proven innocent that's insane cuz we there's no huge announcement about see that's dangerous right because if he that I mean how long did he get sat out for months it said and it hasn't fought since then he almost fought again right after see but you're guilty it's like if a girl cues you of sexual assault right off the bat if that goes on Twitter you're assumed guilty with these guys it's up he's a drug user but then I had no idea he was yeah I know I know I saw the announcement that they were making that final oh yeah always backed who was he supposed to fight though he was supposed to fight someone else and it got rescheduled I believe my rants in gatineau is Francis right the one thing I wish the UFC would do better even that's in the UFC but be great if they did is announce when a guy is vindicated when he's good to go I need a fucking celebration likes a birthday so they're they're good to go the other thing is when guys retire like so many guys retired like let's do something for them at like guy like Rashad Evans mm-hmm UFC Hall of Famer one of the best guys to ever do it great dude he put the UFC on the map let's do something what should they do for him I need fucking something our celebration of his career some just I need something man you just can't go yeah thanks for the times here's a tweet I just I don't feel like that's right not for everyone mmm but for a guy like Rashad we need something won the ultimate fighter won the light heavyweight title think of his rivalries with fucking Jon Jon Jon Jones Quinton Rampage Jackson bass being too tough fighters never fight like he's had some crazy times yeah it's funny man fighters people think about you as you know your fights you have late in your career they forget that crazy fights that he had earlier in his career oh my god see I think the ones that he was doing these past whatever four or five which were tough to watch I don't think of her shot like that yeah it's a different guy and there's something that happens to fighters or the human beings when they don't want to do it anymore and I mean I think it happens with every job but if you don't want to do it anymore and you're a printer it's not like if you don't want to do it anymore in your fighter correct so if you don't want to do it in your fighter and you kind of half-ass it and you're in there with a guy you know like Glover Teixeira like Anthony Smith I mean he's in there against dangerous guys that are trying to kill hungry lions yeah it's just it's a bad place to be it's a bad place to be you you got to be all in in this but but it's not a sad thing because you know like that ridiculous safety for the Seahawks is retiring he had some neck issues you try to try to figure out he's a pro baller and he retired after eight years I want damn it yeah that's a good run man I like how long's were shot been fighting that's a fuckin run man dude he won that season two as a heavyweight the heavyweight yeah remember II fought bad Brad was Brad I'm sad I'm so that's right and the rumors fight after that with Shawn Sam Sam and Dana egos Dana's give him a stink eye because the fight was boring and then just attack and fight Merilee knocked out Chuck Liddell that was like the first he did this to his heart yeah I'm gonna have to mount with one punch dude the special do I think about Rashad he was so special to me in my career because he was like in our camp and he was like the guy when he won the belt image train with us won the belt came back and it was the first time where like he would speak truth to us cuz at the time had a girlfriend I was super in love with I didn't want to leave and go to Train Kellis stuff he's like dude how old are you like telling he's like I'm telling it's gonna be different man you got to make decisions now based off this and you just drop knowledge about the professional life of fighting and I remember when he won the belt he was he was sitting down it came back like a week after training and I would dude fucking crazy did you just feel like out of this world you feel the exact same man nothing feels different I feel the exact same he was it's cool and you want this goal and you achieved and I have the belt he was back to work man he was I thought I'd feel completely different heels gotta get better now I get better he goes nothing it's I feel just like you do man felt right before I won the belt he fought Machida wouldn't Machida was Machida Machida man that dude there was a time for a couple of years where Machida was just put on peace scary scan the FC for awhile he was such a weird guy to fight man because he'd be like doing this yeah all this weird and then he would blitz in on you nobody knew what to do knockout power man that in his last fight with Vitor goodlow that was a one of the best knockout so you pulled that up pull that lyoto machida chaos Vitor Belfort and now he's in Bellator bellick were making some waves son getting saucy over in Bellator right yeah see how saucy things gonna get to look like Ryan Gordon dude how bust right here he's almost 200 he knew just I mean he was out cold almost no right like this is embarrassed and this makes it more embarrassing hands-on yeah my eyes rolled back yeah damn and then and then you know I guess the I wanted to work with him a little bit but he just went to Bellator cuz he goes you saw this way to strike now I'm out yeah that's what I'm talking about let's see can we see in real time no they'd only have it here look at this man look how fake said boom one more time see what's interesting is like Vitor always would talk about Stan and square you know when I first started trading Karlsson Gracie's in 1996 old school it was before Vitor made his UFC debut that's when I first started jiu-jitsu and tour was 19 Phenom he was always talking about oh here it is in real time look hi moves man Leo so sneaky look at that that is phenomenal and give me that one more time son in real time think it sounds knew that Lia Machida the way he's moving here it's so spooky I mean he didn't even see that coming he's he's looking at these crazy hand moves like and remember before the cbiit on Andrews who's a big up-and-comer football player at Alabama yeah if you beat him start to beat torment yeah I'm out yeah now he's that Bella Tori you get Roy McDonald Giga I'm sassy there's some fun Michael sent his brother over there to test the waters like tell me there's some cool fights yeah especially if they let him get saucy I mean he's 40 years old do the other scary thing about Bellator is that days on days on days at die zone or the flick they're gonna call it it's given them they gave them a 9 figure deal who the day I murdered about this does own deal I don't know what you're saying there's no easy n what is that it's their streaming service so now they signed with them so now Bellator you remember how they had tape delays how you can stream it digitally for free you get that now for fighting wall D I think you have to pay for it just like much I don't know but it's streaming on your first one's gonna be free their first like welterweight big fight is gonna be free everybody wins in Bellator deal with days into streamed live events so thinking about who they got right okay the guy gay guard who they his people just contacted me I'm gonna get Gegard Mousasi on the podcast love it he's fighting Rory MacDonald yeah so they got gay guard they got Rory MacDonald - absolute world-class fighters absolute world-class top of the food chain maybe the best 185 and the best 170 in the world certainly in the argument right then you know look Ryan Bader's never looked better Ryan Bader's never looked better he might have you a tournament man I never beat John Jones but he's never looked better you know I'm saying the nominal I mean he looks fucking incredible we knocked out King mo he could be heavily champion it could be hey he's light heavyweight champion right and who knows man maybe him going up to heavyweight would be better for him I mean maybe doesn't have to cut weight maybe he could fight more Jimmy especially as an old as an older guy in his 30s if he can beat me tree own that's a lot well he's really gotten better and better and better she's never never stopped getting better then of course you got Paul de Leeuw one of the most exciting motherfuckers in any weight division who's got our nuclear missile for a left hand his life stuff Michael venom page phenomenal who did talk about probably until his last fight with Fitch was brutal man that doesn't fit Fitch is gonna fit why make that fight that's what I'm saying why did that fight what are we doing how would you diminish this bitch bro why would you diminish daily like in in terms of usability after the Larkin fight so he cares Larkin who Larkin I was felt like it was a dark horse at 170 especially after he fucked up Neil Magny moto mags I was like dude this guy is he's got a lot of weird skills man Larkins got a weird way of moving he's got that oblique kick that he does to the body then he struggled in Bellator II came over there you know it's Lima Lima them motherfuckers him Lima beat him but it was closed lost two in a row and then he got ko'd yeah see man you and asked you in a slugfest with Paul de Leeuw dude that dude has got something crazy in his left hand but you know after doing Paul de Leeuw Michael venom page 9 Paul de Leeuw signs new Bellator contract except Joe Shelly's call out oh Jesus Joe Schilling not yes Joe selling shillings fighting him I'm a no Paul Ted is not taking anybody down they're gonna stand Sun that's interesting if there's kick boxing match I'd be more excited but do you think Paul deal is gonna try to take him down after all the shit he talks about guys taking him down I don't think there's I don't think a chance in hell yeah yeah see Joe showing fighting kickboxing borma best kick box in the world MMA is tough for him he wants to fight him I mean now that's doing I'll watch it he's doing for sure the problem that Joe's been having is they don't give him enough money in kickboxing Bellator kickboxing even it's just not materializing because he's not with glory anymore right spell tour yeah I know but he was in glory tour no right yeah he was in glory and then he came over the belt or a couple years ago he's fought well he's Isle of Wight suffice yeah I loved watching bucket boxing for whatever reason Bellator kickboxing just does not have the appeal kick doesn't have the beat it's crazy to me man I do not understand I do not understand really I do Stan I do if boxing is popular how is kickboxing not pop I don't know I watch box I'm much rather watch Ealing kickboxing did you watch Rico Verhoeven z-- last fight sure did fucking that was amazing it was cool against not stopping my plan through in Siddiq you're not stopping your Friday night for it I would if I didn't have shit to do I know but but yeah but have shit we've done glory fight companions halfway yeah I did a glory fight companion with Joe shilling and who else did it I was in here well listen you would have been here true I never miss fighting you're gonna make fun of the things I love like I made fun of your soccer I see what you know full full circle sir I gotta find something I love kickboxing nothing I enjoy kickboxing I think Glory puts out the best product I think Glory's phenomenal I'm actually bummed out that lion fight is not on access TV anymore yeah they lost their deal with access TV well if you were done fight plans for lion fight but I still be around so did one no no no I think we only did glorify companion for glory BAM Josie that's right Eve Edwards and Joe shilling son 2016 sorry what he got it since then she didn't have time man okay it's cuz it's kick boxer I still love it but you shut fucking down for you know what we only did one Bellator - we only done one Bellator ever hopeless that was a big Bellator yeah who was that who was fighting it was all chaos and Submission it was amazing amazing cards no fucking dork you son of a bitch you me and Eddie Dino's phenomenal night was it fate or Mitrione it's 198 but it's not who was it fate or fate or Frank Mir oh yeah yeah pom-pom bombs on bombs yeah phaidor Frank Mir was chaos yes good night but you know Frank Mir I really appreciate that guy I appreciate the way he thinks and talks about fighting too and one of things he said is like remember fate or hip tossed him slammed him on his back and he said he just got up and just wanted to swing out I'm his ego got the best of him and that wasn't the plan the plan wasn't just recklessly abandoned and do that yeah but he almost beat up he almost beat he had a mob well this is the thing I think phaidor gets you into his groove like he did that with Arlovski he's done it with a lot of people he gets you into his groove with any cracks you it's game over he's done into Brett Rogers but I think that I was I was curious to see how that fight was taking place because in the beginning Frank was catching up he college young rushed in but Frank also said ring nuts is real like he's like do I needed the experience like I felt that kind of right like nerves and stuff going and fighting a long time it's like it's been a long way out for me he's long he been off two years two years he's I guess need to get back in there yeah where's my net supposed to sign with them with Bellator Scott Koch is on the phone with Barnett and they've worked together before so you know that boy Barnett gets in there yeah Malik Mario Batali's in the kitchen right now making some sauce basil and some garlic fuckin let them get sauce Arnett saucy against Ryan Bader well who do they have they have Bader they have jounin Chael Sonnen Frank near remember Franklin when Josh stop Frank Mir house he realize how good Josh's Josh in a nightmare he's a nightmare barely beat the brakes off Roy Nelson beat the shit out of him for five rounds beat the shit up and showed some serious cardio serious cardio to do that for five rounds yeah josh is a nightmare for all those dudes nice phenomenal yeah he might be Bellator heavyweight champion he could special if you let the man sleep in why wouldn't you oh just trust it's all healthy older just skills four days leave him alone yeah that's the problem when those old dudes get ahold of that juice they got all that years those years and years of learning and experience and then also their body starts moving like a young hands body again that's why TR TV tour was so fascinating he might go over to Bellator I wouldn't be surprised well he might sign with Rison but he might go to Billa but if he's not a dwarf or a beat or he's like he's like dude are you know you guys test a little bit I don't I'd only want that like belt or size to strictly I don't want that well that was one of the things that Rory I'm not Rory that Gegard Mousasi was talking about guys fighting him who was he who is he bringing up that he would need extra testing from he was just talking about this Gengar was just talking about this like so 205 or 85 years boy he at 85 who wasn't Machida that's wrong Machida yeah he would say that's right because he lost a decision to Machida over in Bellator he wants extra drug testing for lyoto machida if they rematch I don't trust that guy said whoa no problem man we checked yeah we make sure on it looks like pee tastes like pee instead of once we did it twice the other confirm it's PBS we let him know six months in advance when it's gonna be touched heads up he's getting tested a lot yeah we post-dated on samples he has a full schedule you want it too yeah we have 12 urine samples we took them on the same day but that's what they need to do man even that's too strict for fucking Vitor though hey have you heard anything about Tony Ferguson how's his knee doing I don't know what is going on with Eddie Eddie Bravo just had shoulder surgery a couple of weeks ago he just took his um I think actually a week ago just took his stitches out it was yesterday at frame F so she cuz I remember last time I saw him Pournami story he's like he's going like this backstage I'm good man I'm good he's doing this well it must not have been good he must have done something and heard it again and realized he just should go ahead and bite the bullet and get the surgery I need to get them sentence tells or whatever the samurai I need them stem cells left team Dagestan breaking if the negotiate negotiate the fight okay this is Russian translation team kabhi versus notorious MMA will not be achieved then next week UFC announces fight team khabib versus Tony Ferguson XT UFC 229 October 6 how can he come back that we didn't wait a minute wait a minute this is in a real I mean mmm a team Dagestan that doesn't work yeah but wait a minute let me think of like when Tony go to Tony Ferguson's Instagram chillin like breakdancing right when did Tony Ferguson have a surgery that was before Brooklyn so before Brooklyn was what how many months ago was that two months ago correct there's no way how does he do that to and from from former what I hear Conner Burriss khabib is happening yeah fuckin happening this year mmm that's that's what the that's how the UFC gets him out of jail said this I don't think they give around I mean we find out what's gonna happen in in July right and so there's go to these just go to the actual images the yeah go back and then scroll down let me see that one right there the words moving around or as a video let me see that this is him recently hmm it's fucking slow yeah he's just controlled I mean he's a absolute freak so when he's ready to go he'll be ready to go but it almost hurts him because he's such a freaking he wants it so bad he might not be ready right and he might hurt himself yes but he's got to be with state-of-the-art guys man I'm it's Tony Ferguson he was that one up there with the so he's doing that one right there no right you just had it there you go look at this so he's getting on his knees and crawling across Matt's sure this is it this does not totally look like a guy who's ready to fight though it looks like it's breaking down to be even a guard tissue would be a little strength flexibility motivation creativity increasing tremendously not 100% but close champ stretch all seven weeks out 11 weeks out that's not much time and that's not even three months that's a weird thing it's like you know these guys they have incredible willpower and incredible endurance and incredible like just the focus and drive and discipline to get better but your body has to heal if I'm the UFC I'm paying to another how stem cells work but if I'm data I'm paying for Tony see it's a stem cell doctor every week yeah I'll lay back I don't know where that would totally help I mean maybe it would help I think everything helps a little bit right it's amount of what how much is it's not like you could really measure it like you've got a body chart where can look at your diagnosis and go oh yeah look after we shot the stem cells in look your numbers everything and a help I'm fucking fruit roll-ups oh yeah yeah I mean I'm sure he's I don't know what he's doing I would assume he's doing something I would do growth I would do a shitload of growth which you might get flagged for I don't know what they're doing with testing but I don't think you could really test for growth I'm honest with you do blood work I don't think they're really in bit eight yeah man I think it's real real iffy whether or not they can catch you doing that the igf-1 yeah to catch growth and it's half-life you have to do bloodwork so I don't know how they test these days how do they test them they randomly show up they get blood in urine or just I have no idea they've never - that's just your happen those guys could probably get away with it correct if they flag you with it and then you're out for a year yeah but but if I'm injured and and I have a doctor's prescription for hdh to recover I'm doing all that HEA what they like you do that with with the UFC allowed you can't even have a fucking IV like while he's going through all this he can't take an IV all blame is that if he feels dehydrated that house too terrible what do we owe this what if he wants to get an IV nad drip which will help him recover I know what if he wants to get a IV in that that's not even like outlawed what if you want to get IV vitamins like a vitamin infusion but do that but for the if you're in the UFC business why wouldn't you want that gotta be on all the HD hdand get just to recover taser nothing so he can fight khabib to fight for 155 which we're all vying to see yeah that's good for business yes a flying fuck what do you want him for sure on the stuff that you can do like platelet-rich plasma or you know to send him down to Panama fucking like a David Lee Roth song look the thing about Panama and going like dr. Neil Riordan and doing all that shit that Mel Gibson was talking about on the podcast with his dad yeah that stuff's legal it's legal in Panama you go down there and they'll do shit that TJ went down there st Jay's going on there twice he's gone in a night well it's all legal total is doing it's legal it's totally aboveboard you're allowed to do it I'd fly that fucking doctor in here and not have you can't do it here you have to do it in Panama because they're doing things that aren't legal in the United States well why either way private jet Toni's whoo you know I'm saying I'm saying anyone gets hurt we got this cover this this is not enough money though see the thing they said to the UFC made more money last year than ever before right it's like a record year okay a lot of it was like all these deals but do you know how much money they must have to pay every month that loan yeah four billion dollar purchase that's so much money yeah they just signed a few fucking nut with ESPN and the streaming deal European plus but do you think they have enough money where they could fly guys down to Panama every time everybody gets hurt all 500 we're not on the time talk about special treatment I'm talking to Tom Brady I'm if I'm the New England Patriots I'm flying down there by any means necessary okay when do you take it off when do you not allow it do you let michael Chiesa fly down there nope you're shaking your head no angles Pettis no what do you rate it we'll have to find out it's also Pettis has an executor okay Kevin Lee send Kevin Lee down there probably kids I'm like a shitty promoter yeah no levels to this game where like like if LeBron gets hurt we're supplying them somewhere yeah michael Chiesa number nine Kevin Lee number five okay do you fly down Dustin Poirier a few numbers no he's lost two we're not oh you don't fly them down two nights can you charter a plane and get a bunch of I may not want sir this is he now you're talking when from the michael johnson fight with Justin gay G he gets flown down for the rest of his fucking life okay we checked brain cell yes we're gonna go through the ears inject brain cells I'm gonna get him to live with his head on one side or fill his ears up let it soak into his brain you know this holes in the air and then let him lie down the other side fill them up with stem cells just go right through the nose we're going to the whole body I mean I'm giving khabib Connor Tony Eddie Alvarez and aadya the fucking frequent flyer card in that bitch do you know that that's something that Kyle Kingsbury said he did he did some sort of nasal exosomes right you know remember him talking about that did you talk about that on the podcast or off the podcast he's into all kinds of crazy acts state of the art shit oh that's great he's a big fella yeah that's a big fella that carjacked super athlete too does everything to try and get the best body possible well now that you were sit on it too like that's his job correctly always on the on top of bringing everything new that's coming out what can help and what what's the newest latest greatest shit so you're saying he injected testosterone bright into his exosomes with that I think is this shit that makes stem cells effective into his nose what was he talking about that was a Ben Greenfield god damn it and you know the thing was Ben Greenfield this is why I think it was okay in our man Greenfield and Greenfield crashed his bike hard and really hurt himself his nose yeah he hurt his head okay and one of the things he did that's who it was one of the things he did to mitigate CTE is have exosomes shot up his nose he did it IV had it done up his nose and he did like a full body exosome treat and help dude is it do you know Ben Greenfield is I've listened to him I gotta have him on your show on fire oh yes first of all he's a super genius tell Brian to shut the fuck up always talking I can't I feel like Brian sucks no but he's also super athlete like he does a lot of crazy shit like tough mudders and all that but he's on the ball when it comes to latest and greatest stuff he did a whole article for was it Esquire or when he shot his dick up with stem cells and Hospital the different things on his dick oh yeah GRP instead it was dick yeah any self-administered as dick has like gills now he's a super genius I'm in then but Brian will teach us to go save Jim I'm saying Brian shut the fuck down or leave them at home I know tell Brian we don't have the French Alps where they street skiers hey god damn that great this made just today please let him go please don't ya I wouldn't Ben see arts wind him up tell me drop science on me dude that dinner you're at that you posted with all those smart people yes trying to solve the world crisis or what was going on there where'd you guys he eaten talking shit like you talk shit like we talk shit Brian no smart shit though there's some shit talking especially if Sam Harris is very funny believe ya he's very friendly smart dude yeah he's real funny Eric Weinstein is very funny Petersen was there yeah and Jordan Rubin dave rubin rather is Dave Reubens a stand-up and then Jordan Peterson can be funny sometimes he's uh just insanely smart though didn't work does one person start the topic and you guys go around like a roundtable no we were all just talking and then some sometimes we were all talking together and a couple times broke off in a separate conversation ain't gonna groups yeah there's a lot of people yeah you know those big dinners are tough don't really talk to you break off in groups who's close to you know yeah it's fun though it's fun knowing people that are way smarter than you that's my entire friend that's what you want though yeah you don't want to be the smart guy in the group you're a fucking that's not good don't want to be the toughest guy in the room yeah you don't wanna be that good just need tough training partners get ya know you don't be the best fighter in your gym well really interesting people the it makes you crave interesting conversations makes you more interested in different subjects they motivate you the same way like if you were training with Brian or take it you'd want jujitsu to be tighter you would even motivated by watching them it's like I did a podcast I think drinkin bros with matt best and those guys mhm and they're all super high-level military guys they're asking about fighting or whatever and we're doing our dick jokes I'm like hold on cuz I want to hear what they say about the military because it was fucking that their black belts in military and we're a combat experience yeah so I flip the script on them it's fucking fascinating well your listeners gonna hate this cuz they probably know this but it went by in like missions and how it goes down I was fucking fascinating man it is I don't want to talk bro hear them talk you ever done podcast with jock oh no I fucking uh no jaakor I don't know him at all you do I will really on the other day and felt like tweeting like what's up now bit earlier than Joc Tommy you up I think like for something but he posted he was up at like 5 something is he's been on the carnivore diet before was the carnivore diet he just eats steak I look at him I think that steak you know no on the podcast he would be a great guest I know we I think someone goes man we need get drunk on firing the kid I put let's do it and he was he was I'm there but you gotta figure yeah just yeah I'll give you his number I'm the show but uh he's he's one of those dudes where you if you read his stuff enough and pay attention now it will increase your motivation it just will he's the real deal you know he has this video call you ever seen his video good you ever seen good please play oh my god how long is it's gonna give you a rock-hard boner what is it a couple minutes two minutes long it's tough to motivate one of my favorite I I watched this at least once every six months I'm not bullshit really yeah we played it on the podcast right go fullscreen and give me some volume and don't start a prematurely you son of a bitch let it load up what am i don't direct subordinates one of my guys that work for me he would he would call me up early positive what's his background Navy SEAL commander I'm in say no more affair okay a direct subordinates one of my guys that work for me he would he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problem some issue that was going on and he taped my awesome we got this and that the other thing and I look at him and I'd say good and finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said I already know what you're gonna say I said well what am I going to say you said you're gonna say good [Music] he said that's what you always say when something is wrong and going bad you always just look at me and say good and I said well yeah when things are going bad there's gonna be some good that's gonna come from it didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted good didn't get promoted [Music] in tiny dip Oh mission got canceled good reading focus on the other one didn't get funded didn't get the job you wanted got injured sprained my ankle got tapped out good got be unexpected problems we have the opportunity to figure out a solution that's it when things are going bad don't get all bummed out don't get startled don't get frustrated if you can say the word good guess what it means you're still alive it means you're still breathing and if you're still breathing now you still got some fight left so get up Dustoff reload recalibrate re-engage go out on the attack gangster dude when it comes from a guy I know like him I know he that is a different meaning behind different meaning you guys speak I listen then I feeI here that sometimes when I run when I'm running hills and listen tired I just go good good keep going I'm tired tired good so stay working hard good fight with your girlfriend but good I'm bringing a bitch it's having that attitude though like making that switch in your mind to just look at things at a different way everybody can do that everybody that's not unattainable when you listen to something like that the real beauty of something that inspires you like that is you hear it and then you can actually put into action this is but do you ever have a problem being self-motivated Joe like I like the don't give wrong that's fucking fantastic I've never been a guy who's been drawn to the motivational stuff for yeah I just never have been I've never needed it I've been blessed in that regards I don't know what it is I like what even when bad things happen I'm always super positive always not it's great when I see bad things I'm not comparing my bad situations to fucking jock on the in ward right I'm talking whether it's a foot wet one I lost a fight if something's going wrong if stand up and something business-wise I don't get something I'm usually all good I always use you pretty positive you are you're very positive guy I think that's one of the secrets to your success is that you look at things in a good way and you have confidence and you act you know I mean I tell all these young stand-ups I go Brendan Charles been doing comedy for two fucking years you got to look what he's doing this is what when an athlete goes after something like you you have the work ethic of an athlete and the mindset of an athlete but you're also funny see the thing about comedy is a lot of people that are really funny are also we're sobs we're personal saboteurs we self-sabotage we are impulsive a lot of times get addicted to things it's like real like the type of person that becomes a stand-up is a person who says ridiculous shit they say things that socially unacceptable things they know it's gonna get a rise they hang around with a bunch of other degenerates like you and me hang around and you get you this is a certain style of person you know like a Joey Diaz style a person but you're an athlete who has those attributes so for you like what I tell it like young guys in particular go this highlights the importance of discipline it doesn't make you less funny that's a cop-out like a lot of people think that discipline makes you less funny there's the comics have these weird cop-outs like you want to work be a guy works hard you want to be a guy it's funny some guys are funny in this effortless you know that's nonsense working hard in everything should work hard in everything everything you try to do you should put the more attention and more focus you put on it the better you're gonna get at it correct yeah I just don't wanna be a loser yeah so just I don't want to embarrass myself or people either if they pay for a ticket on one bike dude Jesus Christ well also you can do it you can do it correct you know you can do it so if you can do it just keep doing it yep get better at it keep working at it keep swinging it's a fascinating thing to do for a living man you know the best kidding me but discipline man so I've um I've never necessarily had a problem self motivating but I've always drawn inspiration from a lot of different sources really yeah I go to the rocks Instagram page every day every day no bullshit cuz he's always hustling I see the rock he's fucking around a jet he's always in the gym but don't put the rock in spies what Kevin Hart doesn't know no he does too not only not on jets the jet thing is but when Kevin Hart's in the gym all the time that inspires me for shit worked out he's constantly the gym doesn't mean I'm gonna work out because of Kevin Hart no you're gonna work out already you're just like fuck it like watching people kick ass there he is BAM the RAI also like people kick in it like I I don't hate anyone I root for everyone like I it's almost a problem I root for everyone you almost think it was almost uh it was my downfall as a fighter and as a football players I would root for everyone I think I want everyone to do that but but it helps me in comedy like I want everyone to do I want the everything to be good yeah I did a show at the ice house and like you need to open up for you and so I called Emily at The Comedy Store I'm like hey do you have two door guys who are vying for spots like fuck yeah me a list so every show I'm always trying to bring the door guys in that's fuse I'm a how can i you know I'm saying it's like yeah everyone to do well that's because when I look at like what inspires me is like when you post a video in the crowds in Idaho or whatever or Chris D'Elia you know or are like the crew when guys are willing to me that's it's trying to keep up with that I just I feel like I'm in this we're in this race right yeah and this race together and everyone's fucking beasts and animals and you gotta you you're gonna fall back in the pack man be a loser and get fucking eaten by these lines or you keep running with these monsters yeah that's how I look at it well it's it's a great attitude to have in anything if you want the people around you to do well it's a great attitude to have with everything that's been it's one of the major secrets to my success for sure is have a bunch of people around you that are kicking ass and then like helping them you hopefully everybody promoting everybody letting everybody know and encouraging everybody and then you know when everybody's doing great everybody's it's just it feels it's it's a good feeling for all involved when people go selfish and they only want a good thing to happen to them and they get upset if good things happen other people that's poison man this jealousy doesn't work it does the opposite of work it does that's so there's a there's an actual quote about that that jealousy is one of the rare emotions that achieves the opposite effect that it intends to because you intend to like diminish someone by being jealous of them but in fact you diminish yourself yeah you're putting energy into thing you can't control it does not mean yeah I forget who made that quote but it's even uglier when it's jealousy amongst friends that's that's when we all have seen it it's weird it's a weird thing to see it's weird to me when I was fighting is weird to see people who won't mention names but we're on the same group and a guy which would be fighting you could tell they didn't want him to succeed I like did we we just went through eight we can't like tough I'm like oh you're jealous met with his success it's not gonna you can go on your own path that's a weird thing man and with comedy we don't see I thought I'd get it way worse I thought people gonna fucking hate me when I walked in the store laughs actor but we I don't see it around there and if I do it did not say it to my face no well it's also why you're proven to actually be funny you're in it doesn't nobody gives a shit everybody just wants you to be funny but if you were like some guy who was like maybe an actor that was kind of half-assing it and people would come to see you just because you were an actor weren't really trying he didn't respect which we've all seen in the cast well there's been a bunch of those people that try to get sitcoms back in you know the early days and during the sitcom days when there was a lot of comics like that we're getting these deals and then they would do a sitcom based around them very few of them ever became like a Seinfeld or something yeah but they gave it a lot of deals man bellman so there was a lot of actors who got into comedy and put together like a quote/unquote act to try to get a deal like they would they would do it because they would look at it seeing like look if they're just gonna audition for shows it's really difficult to stand out from the crowd I mean unless you look like Luke Rockhold or you got some you know you're the perfect Ryan Reynolds looking fella yeah it's fucking hard look and then if you're a girl like you have to be like really hot or you have to be really big like you have to some has to be funny about you right well if you're a stand-up there's no rules like you can be Ali Wong you can be Roseanne Barr you can beat me there's no you just have to be funny yep like anybody right so a lot of actors looked at it like oh I'll just put together an act and all man stand-ups would hate that oh my god I hate them I'm sure wouldn't go well either because it's within like it's whoever it is let's say fucking John goodness I start doing stand-up right and he come onstage you wanna go fuck that strong Goodman and after about three minutes like okay that's John Goodman the fucking do man well that was Michael Richards you know Michael Richards was a didn't really have a background in stand-up he had a bass I didn't know that yeah he was like he would do like he would wouldn't didn't have like an act he would do like he would fall down on stage and play like he was doing crazy the character he was right yeah it was very strange and I don't know if he did it for a long time and then stopped doing it for a long time and then started doing it again after Seinfeld but before he had that you know air quotes incident at the Laugh Factory um you know we'd seen him a couple of times and it was weird you know it just it was like a really really famous open mic night guy Jesus Christ yeah strange it was like a guy who's soup famous but really hasn't been doing it that much you could because you're going up at the Laugh actor commies yeah I'm gonna remember it's murder they're not booking those people so it's murders Rome for whatever reason you got in but you're on that line up with pill burn you and Illya we got to go up and the crowds used to seeing hi laughing fuckin stuff yeah this was like what 2006 or some shit when did all that go down with him Brian cities at the improper control well I had got back to the comedy store and I think it was Brent Ernst I think I think he saw yeah he was over at the Laugh Factory when it happened and he came back he was like he was like yo I just left the left factory he goes fuckin Cramer's up there throwing the end bars dude it was crazy he lost his shit he was getting heckled so we had heard about it but then what it would have won the cellphone video got TMZ released that shit everybody was like oh game set match like this is a new thing dude yeah I was weird man I was uh I was gonna said in the belly room the other night and I've never seen Brody Stephens who stand up I've never seen him and then he got up there and just he can I know who years obviously he's always around by mercy movies and he just came out like doing crowd working not using the mic and I looked at Sam I go what the fuck's he doing man he's like just you've never seen am I gonna use just watch and it was so funny man yeah it's just fantastic does crowd work for that he does was warm-ups for so many television shows for so many years that he's like super comfortable just talking to people yes yeah it was fuckin done a special came out recently I think it's on iTunes oh really anywhere else live from the main room it taped it and the maid doing that set that's the the Kinnison said spot no shit dude that's so cool Wow when did they do this just came out a couple weeks ago yeah he's talking about on stage good for them dude that's awesome he can go around and he'll go Iowa like yeah for my goes there you go moves on the next place like Jesus Christ it's so funny he's a weird I'll be here to 2 a.m. yeah 10 of 2 a.m. I'm like what the fuck that's how he kicked it off him like what is going on right now well his uh his style is so unusual because on paper you would never understand where the punch lines are but then when you hear him say you can't stop laughing huh yeah it's like I was dying I don't know if he writes it or if he just does it I wonder I'd like to ask him if he writes stuff down or if he just does it there's a few guys like that that are just funny the way that like Theo's like that funny the way they say shit like yes Theo says shit that I could say the same shit it wouldn't be funny but he says it and it's fucking hilarious yeah that's the king about comedy man like nobody really knows what funny is until you hear it but there's also something Steve Simone mmm-hmm he was saying because I was telling my god he goes man you hear a lot yeah I'm trying to just jump on any one shows cuz I want to make sure it's not my crowd you know cuz you gotta figure out what's funny cuz you just play to your shows I don't wanna be that guy who told you that who the fuck told ya goes everyone here is trying to get their crowds he's when you're on the road you want your crowd man I'm like I know but I'm here I wanna make sure it's not my crowd cuz I feel like the funny uncle at the barbecue if it's my crowd I don't find out what's working you guys house like if it's my crowd that specializes I've walked off feel like Kevin Hart like what fight that was a fuckin ne+ but then you go to the comedy store it's not your crowd like that was a D I was a fuckin dude that's true but if you go to the Ice House and it's your crowd and you actually record it and listen to it you know that's important you can tell what is actually gonna work what's not gonna work you can tell and then you can tighten it up so you have extra confidence at a place like the ice house to do different shit to me what it's like it's like cross-training like it's not a bad idea to do some kettlebells and run some hills and do jiu-jitsu it'll probably make you jujitsu better and I think just doing crowds where no one knows who you are is great yeah but doing crowds where they know who you are is great too and as long as you're paying attention you get a different thing from from each one yeah you're right yeah it's I mean the you also get different things from different sized rooms you know dude there's certain things that will work at the Laugh Factory in certain pockets that won't work anywhere at common its those strange doom is a weird dang man it's very strange strange as it gets you feel enter different energies it's so cool it's so fascinating man you want to talk to him about the comic store in like the history of it that steve simone just oh yeah he knows a lot shit Steve's been around for a long time and couldn't be a nicer guy it might be the nice gun it might be the nice guy that's ever lived almost like there's like a darkness back there that I wanna know what's going on well like push him come on he's doing dad and I was like we come from a good family it sounds like Jesus come from a nice guy from a good family just world Games open up Ferrari in San Francisco I was he yeah the Cobbs Cobbs is an interesting room it used to be the tiniest room he used to be like 150 people a little tiny room on the road but it was so good everybody wanted to do it and then they moved to that place which is like 450 450 giant ass ceiling it's a big place it's been crowd there too yeah liberal well that's San Francisco man San Francisco highly educated very progressive it's you it's you're doing a different kind of comedy there didn't abortion joke more for reference but it did not go well yeah yeah you can feel it yeah is anything worse nope but you know what it is is when you run into a subject that people don't accept you got to ask yourself okay yeah does my sense of humor different than theirs or did I do a shitty job in figuring out how to get that subject to them you know because some subjects like there's quite a few bits that are gonna be in my Netflix special that when I first started doing them they weren't that good there was something missing like I knew there was something there but you're you don't you only know so much when it's written you really find out what's good when you try it onstage and then that's when it sort of comes to life so I have almost every bit that I've ever done written in some way but they're all rarely the way I do them yeah you know once you get on stage with it that's when you start fucking with it and figure out how to do it get more of an outline yeah and then week on stage like yeah but it's you know along the way sometimes it just tanks you know that has to happen some guys stick with it though don't they so crazy my god this isn't where I say just the other night man ah we round move it around but a good beating like doing it where it doesn't work makes you just refocus let me go back look at this thing and figure out why these people got upset oh you know what if I just do this first then they'll know where I'm coming from first they'll let me get away with that because they won't think I'm an asshole you know it's weird and you finish your especially finished editing yourself yeah that's uncommon right well I didn't have much to edit in terms of like content it was just how much should I cut out and where what you know which show was the best one that was what it was really the lot of the best one was the first show see I heard Tony as soon as you guys got done cuz I attacked you in ITEX turning he goes I don't even know why we're filming a second one home run off first I really was yeah out of the park fuck sakes it's fun man Wilbur Wright that Wilbur theater is amazing that place is you know cuz it's like a theatre but it's also like a comedy club because it's like there's nine hundred or eleven hundred people in the room and I think it's like five hundred three hundred three hundred or something like that yeah finds you the palm so if you're you've come kid the palms yeah the palms it's like people right yeah right I love you where most theaters so far he can't feel it Katt Williams did the palms one time when we were there I didn't get a chance to see him now God he's fuckin for ya he was there I think he was there like the day before the UFC or something like that my brother wouldn't saw a Kevin Hart he was at Pepsi Center oh yeah I wonder how the fuck do you pull off stand-up at the Pepsi Center Jay goes I know and my brother's a little bit of a hater by nature because it can't be that good and I'm like dude he's like the most successful comic ever touring in these days I bet it's pretty fucking good and he goes in there and he was like a brown stage like 3:16 thing goes dude it was incredible that's the best he's ever seen Wow which is crazy so fucking powerhouse man guys are hustling performing powerhouse yeah interesting right it's interesting when you see those super winners those super winners that just pushed the envelope of success it's weird you know those those qualities are very strange it's also strange in comedy because someone Kevin Hart might be your cup of tea but then they might hate bill burr which it's very strange to me that's silly why don't say hey yeah I know maybe you know I'm saying like yeah like bill burr might be just okay to you but Kevin Hartz it you're number one yeah but that's okay that's normal the breeze always gonna be people that have different tastes that's the same with music that's a single force every percent yeah it's crazy time for standup though if you think about how many different comedians are really good right now and have specials it's nuts Netflix is blowing up blowing up do you know Russell Peters is the first comic to get a Netflix special when did he get is a long-ass time ago we have an interview talking about I think it was with sway in the morning and he was the first one they say how much did they pay you he talks about it he knows he goes ten percent of what Chris Rock got paid and they looked at wait a minute when was he the first one what year was it old school really find out look at I know Russell Peters commie special meters is a monster I had one on Netflix in 2005 I think Russell Peters beat you probably he was first pretty sure he said he was first hmm 2005 got damn damn I didn't know enough flicks was back then yeah nobody knew that was part of the problem going on when people like my specials on seesaw like all fuck so what else is going on this weekend with the UFC what are the fights are there well you got the the Ultimate Fighter finale on Friday present any others on that card style bender pull up to Oh style Brenda Brad Tavares versus tile vendor perhaps a motherfucker man there's rap beats um but I think I love style better but Brad's been quietly for know but also Brad is a guy who the rumors he's injured going this fight he was gonna call the fight off he's in her dare you say that online no it's all over it sounds it yeah it's he injured with I don't know he supposed to pull out but he's doing through it so it depends people forget Bracton fucking wrestle - hmm that's a fire style bender from Nigeria 13 and oh son he's a motherfucker who really is he's so exciting damn that's very good let me see the regular UFC card again that's a big fight so that's the headline fight yeah it's ultimate fighter which is mmm you see there's you see they're selling the ultimate fighter house attend you know open fire selling they're selling it really five mil son you want it five now well good investment it's like nineteen bedrooms people peed all over that house he's gone there it's gonna smell like a dudes ball juice jacked off and the hospital son sow robbed font that's a good fight right there that's a very good fight gokhan Saki and Khalil Roundtree I can fight that's a real good Felder Mike Perry dad the fucking fight that's right remember the holder at welterweight very interesting he's out big dude Felder has to cut some serious weight to make 155 Felder's a monster on the mic - he's a great commentator very smart Paulo Costa in Uriah Hall that's very interesting I'm not for 2.0 I'm not saying Paulo kosis on all the drugs but how does it pass this fucking test what whose nose is clogged up for that sniff test how does he just not live wherever South's his dude he is first team all and over not on that car to go yeah we get it it's close jack are close in Landover nada that might be the sleeper the night folks yeah I get this one's even talking about that fight he's on fight paths that's crazy dude hooker and burns as ammo fucking fight - Gilbert burns Dan hook or holy shit what a card this is yeah dude this card is insane great card this is an insane car cuz people aren't even talking about this hooker burns fight dude you know it's gonna be sad though I think what our view numbers oh how dare you you never know steep a vs. DC I might get into the twos to be hundreds well a lot of people like max Holloway and Brian Ortega you don't think it can make it to do hell yeah 200 200 be a nightmare 250 was the last one right just uribl now good I see I'm hoping it does around five to six hundred make GS we again need GSP back bring Jes baby he's the last one they get real good numbers you got 850 right I know but I'd say I think this goes around between 400 600 yeah what do you think Jamie I hope so do you meet a weird face it's tough to tell these days I think they need to get rid of the pay-per-view model it's obviously not working what do you think they should do I think they should put these on for free I think Jewish colony is being these major fights oh are you gonna pay people well the paper you model top for MBA guys are getting more than the top ten NFL quarterbacks and those games are all free so there's models somewhere right there's a model that this model is not working yeah but NBA is way more popular than your but it's also free right but the best world the the sponsorship deals the endorsement deals are you know they have major endorsements right but there's only so many endorsements they're gonna get behind cage fighting you know it's like crazy games in for a Bud Light Miller Lite like we've got some bit more now right yeah roughly the same amount of people also like same amount of fighters say my name ba players about 500 yeah there's no comparison in terms of overall viewership though like what is a big basketball game NBA Finals 35 million yeah yeah I'm just saying I think the pay-per-view models so old-school especially now with illegal streaming mean Jane we're talking about it right if I'm not that guy cuz I find I'm not trying to steal money from UFC but there's a link I can go to every time that's in HD on have to be a fucking dime for everyone but so many my friends do that I have so many people so they're going to jail when Uncle Fester finds so when the numbers are low you got to take them consideration those 18 to 36 males can figure it the fuck out they're not like $70 no I wonder I wonder if you just had it free if the numbers would be bump it's like you got to make a big fucking risk to do that because you got to think of how much money the UFC has to pay every month to make that loan to make that monthly nut that's on them that's not the fans problem that's true the other promise think how expensive is be a MMA fan these days so I'm I got a four cup money for ESPN Plus now just to watch how much that was it 99 good call it low in five bucks a month so it's like I think it's 10 okay okay $9.99 so got that right when does that go live because the fight pass is still 2019 January so you saw how to pay for that so money additional money and then pay-per-views there's one every month so if I want that that's 70 so that's $80 a month just be a UFC Fan yeah now following watched eyes on dies on dies on Bellator I got a pay how much is that gonna be $9.99 to watch the Bellator now that what it is let's say it's $9.99 less than that I'm assuming something's wrong with the streaming service so if they just had a free streaming service and then you had ads do you think they could make it up I'm sure I'm a bit what my point is it's gonna expensive be a MMA fan and you're losing fans right the numbers aren't declined obviously there's a business model problem what if they made a deal with Netflix they tried that Netflix Amazon those guys didn't wanna play game they want your audience isn't big enough really no they went well Twitter went will use the NBA we're going to the NFL route because the other sports are too big hmm Twitter what if they showed it on Twitter can you get Twitter on your TV you could if you have it on your phone you could almost get married yeah you could just the screen yeah yeah what are your phone runs out of batteries the middle the fight your friends call your pussy plug it's not linking it's not playing off your phone directly now when you do it I do it through Apple TV but you could do it through Google Android right you can do like Google Play you have like a stick that sticks in the USB we're sure yeah there's a little symbol interesting I mean down all used to be science fiction just a little while ago but I I see shit on my like someone sends me a YouTube video to watch if I'm home watching something on Apple TV I'll just stream it right to the TV set that's amazing like on the top by the bar broadcaster TV thing yeah it's just I feel like the UFC's has this old-school model right now but with the UFC plus ESPN plus it's at least headed in the right direction but the paper your mom especially expensive is to be a fan right now they're making it tough I think it's gonna come a time where you're not gonna need any streaming service you just be able to type a website address into your television and it'll be Universal everybody will have that I think that's that's real close like a lot of people getting rid of their cable yep dish apparently young kids they never watch cable ever yeah I'm a dish fan but most young kids don't fucks with any of this yeah like what dish what that's interesting right don't ask huh the only thing it's good for really is live events yeah that's everything else Netflix is more popular than broadcast cable and more in TV viewing hmm Hulu and YouTube I think it's Wow the thing I read said it was it's got more viewers than all of those combined but Wow that's accurate broadcast cable Hulu and YouTube Netflix has more than everything see if Netflix got the UFC that would be crazy for the UFC for the UFC it flicks like dude what if I pull on it they could they just said we have so much like how much is your not much resilient 4 billion um ok well just write them the check we'll just buy it and it's like a pair of sneakers every day just they could do it man I wonder yeah they would that would be but then how would you figure out how people get paid you'd have to give numbers right it would have to be in the contract because that's one thing about Netflix they don't want to give away the number so if you have a comedy special on Netflix and you ask them hey how's it doing they go it's doing really well yeah but you're really happy yeah but you know because like you they go you want to do another like almost went pretty well if you do have special in there and you're like how we doing like all right yeah keep on keepin on man yeah do you want to do another workout we're all set it probably didn't go well you don't have exact numbers right which I feel like is a little hairy a little dicey because you have no negotiating power yeah I see because if you're like hold on let's say you for instance you like hold up a hundred million people watch this I need more fucking money right like to them is 5 million watching good is a hundred mil where we at here then we negotiate that can't be right like they can't be good but it's their business they started it it's the thing is like that's gonna join how to do it right do it on HBO and then you get real numbers or you could do it on Showtime and you get real numbers are you doing on Amazon's Jeff Bezos tells you go fuck yourself do you think you're at a disadvantage for non Netflix these days because because here's my argument that I had with Brian about things to no special is Knepp don't give Netflix as the king man and if you're ro if you're you if you're bill burr if you're Kevin Hart if not coming hard if you're fucking Chris Rock any of those guys right there painting mass amount of money and they're promoting it but if you get lost into that shuffle because they have so much content now right it doesn't pay off I don't know you know I'm Gaffigan interestingly enough decided not to do it and he could do it anywhere and he decided to do it on on all platforms so he doesn't have it on Netflix but he has it on a bunch of different they see where Gaffigan put his but he did it on his own site right and released it very louis c.k style yeah I think um he actually I think it's available on Amazon I think it's available on a bunch of different things he's so established though yeah sure napkins motherfucker people still ask him to do is hot pockets yeah that's a good point because I think that they probably no matter where he goes his fans are very loyal they'll go seek it out he's one of the biggest in the world yeah but I'm saying if you're like let's say your guy like Bryan Callen I'm like where you get the most exposure honestly YouTube the most exposed free would just be release it for free for sure but and that's very expensive to do it says Gaffigan 'he's noble ape initially will be released on multiple paid TV and digital platforms including Apple's iTunes Amazon video AT&T Charter Communications Comcast Cox communication DirecTV holla at DirecTV Dish Network oh shit Google Play and Sony Playstation says worries who do almost as Microsoft's Xbox an album version will also be released on the same day in digital and physical formats the motherfucker good friend owned simpler well he's a five-dollar download field louis c.k now hmm yeah it's interesting it's interesting because I think that he could do it so if he does it and then it really works out well maybe Kevin Hart might do that too he might say listen I could charge $4.99 well you could do whatever he wants he might be like hey I'm Kevin Hart I could just have people gonna go watch my special but if someone can do that yeah there's a small handful if you're smaller level comic let's say b-list you can't do that make money people are gonna see it so maybe you get you get money back when you go on the road like holy shit that was great news free so down the road and doing theaters now maybe well that's the thing office do you know how many comics have done that and had a youtube video that became a giant smash and then we're selling out theaters what does that girl Angela Johnson you know Angela Johnson yeah TV is that hilarious bit about the Vietnamese girls doing her nails yeah that bit got on YouTube and she was selling out quickly gel yeah crystal gel she's hilarious it's very funny yeah fucking hilarious she was selling out giant plays well to that extent not that Kristy Lee is similar to that but crystally on snapchat but his videos were so funny yeah it made him insanely poppy so long saw their stuff but that's when the you know he had millions of followers on there yes we going to City and he's a brilliant comic and you know he's full when the biggest of the world now he's so silly he's a unique kind of silly so weird silly you would hate us if you saw our text every day about shoes and fashion the easy Big Easy dad shoes came out like dude I can kill you want a pair he's like yes and what are you dad shoes Jamie you're gonna well you might like him you like him more than the 350 boost just do I'm not read sweet I know I'm wearing these just for you when did you get those converse actually sent to me I would never I was gonna say there's no you in the store they sent me those but I put myself where these mother hell yeah those are easy those things those are easy and you like those no San Jose Sharks man I dunno a shark no let me just say this that was the first easy and I could I can get them they're coming out but I'm gonna pass I'm gonna pass on those you know you know Chris you want these on what Chris these only good on small guys goes you're right but I'm smaller I go but the right outfit and small jeans can wear em to your right brain we're going back forth I said to Brian went fuck you because Brian likes to wear those boots that make him look like he's an Italian painter correct and wishes he was taller yeah he's get those boots with like wooden heels with leather soles that are really slippery straight and then they have zippers on the sides he's supposed to wear these when you're in Catholic school like

correct like slides and socks is okay okay why do they have rules like that it's the streets bro no one is it's gross if you like that sock on your toe with that bar I can't live like a master splinter so remember those ninja shoes what they called tabbies oh my god that's hilarious everyone dudes you don't wear those kung fu shoes do you remember those kung fu shoes did you grow up in the East Coast did you know a lot of dudes in like the 1990s and certainly in the 80s would wear kung fu shoes just dress up like they knew kung fu there was really those things oh those are Todd's those are called pods that's it those are kung fu shoes son dudes would wear kung fu like they knew kung fu because they had those shoes on and dance I'm sure I thought those are different those legs are more fashionable yeah that's first once you show her some bullshit somebody had a bit about it about dudes no no I think it was um do you remember that guy that had a bunch of fucking he had a bunch of bunch of specials on HBO Robert Townsend remember that remember Robert Townsend remember he had a bunch of HBO specials read a bunch of different comedians on I feel like someone on one of those did a bit of kung fu bit about dudes in the ghetto who dressed up like the were kung fu outfits I'll tell you who I don't fucking trust dudes that wear Aquos thugs what do you mean by aqua Sox like blue socks no bro aqua Sox like you went to Waterworld or like a water park aqua saw where a mountain public do nothing dredged a fucking girl up worse than aqua song drives Massoud bring a fucking dog rather you can still give him at Walmart and shit who wears them my dad warned when I was a kid those yeah you walk around with those long at yeah forget the waterpark so your traction oh here that makes sense but dudes where I'm in real life yeah hmm assholes want to be a superhero maybe they're just ready for water at all times like what is the purpose of those so you don't slip on that the outside of the pool yeah it's all hot and shit okay to quit being a pussy how about that hmm but those are like fairly similar to like minimalist shoes see those are cool so you bring up cool ones wait wait wait hold on how is that cool those are dope bro like that well that's some shit you would run in sag what yes I would I know that's what I'm saying I'm talking about the original aqua song but it's different see that one right there that you just showed that last one the last one the one above that the one that looks like a normal sneaker yeah like that like that yeah that's does look real similar to the shit I wear when I run some TVs I run the with those they have like nothing to them there's all those yeah I love those they do my feet are way stronger because of running that way a hundred percent made a big difference it definitely made a difference yeah because your feet after work way harder it's not like if you run in a pair of like I like to run in like Solomon speed cross shoes yes they got a lot of traction you could run on anything you don't worry about we're stepping you just stomp on shit but you don't you don't your foot doesn't have as much engagement like when there's no cushioning at all and it's a thin layer your foot is like pushing off and gripping some shit but you can't just jump drink things you just can't go fucking full no shoe note I tried yeah oh fuck it you get that plant you got that planard right dude I'm back to cushy shoes yeah Easy's and shit but you don't run anymore right I need some I need I need to inject some shit into my leg fucking dude I'm telling you they can do that now they're doing they're doing ever home boys around here oh yes they're doing all kinds of shit now son you know what else we should do was you show us don't cover this we should do it on air we should get nad drips yeah yeah maybe they'll do it in here and do it it's supposed to be insanely painful if you do the push any V where it's like 15 minutes it'd be funny if we did a podcast it's supposed to make your guts wrench like someone's stomping on your stomach but if you get through it you get through it in 15 minutes versus eight hours hold up these low tourettes and what to do it's supposed to be incredible for anti-aging yeah 15 minutes ago two minutes of like just the worst podcast of all time I think it'd be a fun podcast
