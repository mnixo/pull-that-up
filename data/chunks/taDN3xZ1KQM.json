you know I got a new bit about seeing a couple fucking in the hotel room across from me did you yeah so I won't do the bit but I'll tell you the story which is basically New Year's Eve in Portland the hotel is like a horseshoe shape so I'm on the tenth floor and I look across into a room and the curtains are open lights are on chick is on her back legs up and this dude who's ripped is fucking hounding her and I'm just standing there looking at him like like this is the greatest thing I've ever heard this is great things ever happened I got I slept my bag in my hand and I'm just transfixed and he keeps fucking I'm like high-fiving the glass like go man and then and so I had the curtain closed because I didn't want them to see me but I pop my head through the curtain from the 1930s and then I start thinking about what it must sound like and this where it gets creepy creepier is I leave my room I walk down the hall and I stand outside the room and I listen and I hear him grunting and I hear her go so I go back to my room and I call the room no just watching them waiting waiting he didn't pick up but if he did I would have been like [Laughter] [Music]
