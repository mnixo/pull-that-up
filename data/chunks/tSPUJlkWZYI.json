join my day Joe Rogan podcast my night all day I see it I wish that uh fighters appreciate the science of boxing more when GSP one of those fights he trained with Freddie Roach and he came back with that fucking jab mm-hmm it made waves but a lot of people didn't copy that well our last he did first it was like nah let's just go Boosh you know he's like holy man is realer amanah núñez boxing trainer is Howard Davis his son okay in American Top Team so she's I don't know why people don't incorporate that much more like that is just so much to learn you said there's three levels of striking pretty much in the UFC you know we had a discussion last night when when uh the jujitsu guy 170 came in you know he came in he was a great jujitsu guy he wanted uh what's his name the guy that triangle Jail from the top demi-monde Demian Maia that guy came in he one of the first couple matches jiu-jitsu then somebody told him he was a boxer yes he started hanging it up but now he's fucking back to just yeah that'd be one you know why but I grab you like it if you're on des there you go Ronda 100% Ronda just said okay imma take a year off I'm gonna go to the back Olympic wrestling facility wherever just focus on wrestling still work on your strike and go with Duane Ludwig that would be awesome or or Rafael Cordeiro mix it up you know I mean you got to change it up now obviously but wrestling should be the focus when you see a Ronda Rousey promo you shouldn't see her hitting mitts you should hear shooting about getting the clinch double leg takedown singles it should be wrestling everyday twice a day for the and but think about her camp her whole camp it's just a boxing gym her head coach is a boxing coach so they want her to be this boxer people sold her as a next Mike Tyson so you have all that coming and she was Merkin girls remember I was on board Jenna like damn her striking she's knocking bitches out then he's just a level it's like the word what's the level she's knocking them out at yeah but but I think the media in a lot of people like ding she's a knockout artist so you hear those and her cants going you're knockout artist she can strike with anyone right and her coach like looked was always the case you remember when Gerald fought in the UFC it was always the case when Gerald is up was he a black belt back then or brown belt it was a brown belt really good jiu-jitsu guy though but his fucking striking coach had him convinced that he was a Thai boxer he's like you're gonna go out there and how to kick and I remember Eddie and I would train we'll watch him hit the bag and hit the myths and stuff and I was like man there are some scary guys in the EOC and he got a real scary one at Josh Thompson yeah Josh Todd was like yep none of that no no no it was it didn't go down like that happening know what ended up happening is Gerald's Jiu Jitsu Zell Struble as we're talking about his he was my first student my first before 10th planet I was teaching Jiu Jitsu to a guy named Gerald Stream and he was a blue belt at the time and I brought him up showed him oh he got really good at the twister a really good rubber guard rubber cute first meathook rubber guard triangle and MMA history in a gladiator challenge show he was kicking ass and then he fought Jean Silva in England in London and it was a spectacular match Joe showed that fight to a Dana White Dana White game of shot game Josh Thompson right off the bat he started he started working Muay Thai with this Muay Thai coach and his six months he was training six months with them right and he'd been doing and he wrestled in high school as well so he'd been grappling total at that point I Joey what do you read into the mic no I'm hearing some for sure Chuck it was confusing my spirit too right but anyways so anyway so he would either sit and and it's an interesting point I was just thinking about this it's the exact same thing it's when I'm when I striking like let's say I got um a striker Muay Thai came in and he'd been doing more time for ten years and he wanted to learn the ground and he was doing MMA he's already fighting MMA it comes up a lot I'm gonna show him Jiu Jitsu I'm gonna be in his corner I'm not gonna be telling him to take his ass down and wickham Jiu Jitsu BullGuard I'm like he just it's been six months let's relax but I always get involved what get involved what I want to see is that dude when with this Muay Thai and it gives me another fight to get his jiu-jitsu him the longer we avoid the jiu-jitsu in my eyes the better we woo we got away with another one now we have another four or five months to work on the jujitsu but that's a good way of looking at but there's a lot of turns out there's a lot of strikers striking coaches out there that'll take some grappler in teach him striking for six months and then corner him in an MMA fight and like instruct him to stand with this motherfucker you remember what I said all the guy to the side say do don't listen to this guy you're not standing with you remember when he said you know many times I had to say that up like my guys I go to listen to this motherfucker all right you're taking this motherfucker even hotter grace you came out John jr. remember what I said do you remember what he said to him he's been cock ready yes in six months you said was Bangkok right he's gonna go out there this is what I do but you know what it was a it was a good thing it's a good thing because this is what happened is he Adam so believing that he was Bangkok ready after six months of more time that when he did the walk out in the UFC he came out we died yes dude with the Muay Thai headband I love a bicep bracelets with oh yeah judicial high carb dancing and doing the boot I think he was in the Octagon and did you know he went around the octagon and blessed on this yes doing they're doing then Josh Thompson sitting there and I talked to Josh Thompson since then yeah Josh Thompson wrestled in high school and he's a really good striker he was fuckin up people off his back it was triangle people we knew all about Josh Thompson Gerald was not you know he was not in the best frame of mind for that fight you know - because Josh Thompson was a fucking killer back then he was a killer well he was in his prime back then that was Josh when he was he was one of the top like five or six guys in the division for - ear me AFC got rid of the 155-pound division it was him and Eve Edwards yeah Eve Edwards knocked him out that was like Eve Evers became the uncrowned King so this would happen it's so luckily and this is according Josh Thompson Josh goes dude I was so worried about his stand Jules stop it then when we saw the fight my whole thing was how get down no no the whole whole thing was for sure Josh Thompson's not gonna want to go to the ground with Gerald that's where all this good shit is he's fucking people up in MMA all his fights up until the u.s. he was fucking people up with his jiu-jitsu so how are we gonna get the fight to the ground we were thinking about pulling an elaborate unorthodox guard pull how are we gonna do it that's what I was thinking I go cuz six months I go I know he thinks he's Bangkok ready that's six months man ready you know such a great teacher zone so Sanka Kragh Josh kicks him down and I was sitting there thing what the fuck thank you he takes Gerald down because he's so worried about it some good and Gerald dude right away throws up a Hellfire with his guard he threw a lot of heat it was pretty badass to see but at the end of the day first he almost had him an armbar Josh pulls out and then there's like a scramble on the ground Gerald goes for a leg lock because he finally pulls out of his guard and then general who was really good at leg locks and he went for a leg lock and then Josh Thompson hit him like in the back of the head of Nationale killer yeah that was one of those exhale yeah that was one of those going you know going for two leg locks is risky touched artists know what started us all off uh people that does coaches that get these fucking people convinced that that's dry killer in one particularly every camp though because in every camp especially if you have like a superstar camp and this come from my own personal experience you have a superstar wrestling coach boxing coach jiu-jitsu coach you know you're spend your time with them they want to see you win with their shit yeah yeah but there's yes even let's not even coaches go don't see the way to toss them off the W should be number fucking one it's nice when they win with some shit of course like fog like you showed me that shit that's always good but it's all about the goddamn W that's number you gotta have like a head coach you gotta have a head coach that's not a striking coach knowledge is like a head coach like a Matt Hume yes a head coach you know like when he works with DJ they do everything yeah you know they work on submissions together spar together you work they work on all these different techniques and it's total technique and tactics oriented conversations in how many Maxim's other though in the worlds like five if at all one its hat is honestly that's like in my mind it's like he if he's not number one it's him and for us a hobby I count two that can do it all yeah that really out the game in and out can do a game plan from standing duress in the graph yeah I mean I think those the one guy might be better for you one guy might be better for the other but those that those are the top dogs there's two is there such wizards on the ground or Wizards too and they they could physically do it too that's like a big part of it and plus they know that transition like sometimes if you go to a pure Jitsu guy like dude this isn't gonna work I commit both hands this I'm gonna blast in the face do you men want George chrigel like he was a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu back when there was very few black belts but then he became he wanted to stand and bang with everybody and that was his thing yeah became this thing standing there banging and that's that happens so often it's it's so crazy it's so rare that a guy comes back and figures it out like gaming my house Damien my tried it that way for a while yep you got sucked into it and then figured out sorry Rhonda shidae took it to it what's that expression you go to the dancer what took you to there yeah expression yeah yeah I know it's turn know what I always is a lot of early I saw a lot of high-level Jiu Jitsu guys coming to the UFC that their hands immense immense yeah like it's like a three striking mm-hmm and they never evolved to that now the fucking striking is evolving quickly a Jacare wait John quick you know it used to be that the only guys the only black belts that got to the UFC were like the guys that were only dedicated their lives that did you get to they just started learning striking you could tell upon oh you could tell like holy shit they're they're just trying to fucking get some kind of clinch it's obvious but now with there's so many goddamn black belts in Brazil now that it's not about it's all about you know here's here's a hundred black belts in the camp we're only gonna take the best strikers like the the fierce ones you know the guy the days of pure jiu-jitsu guys coming out and looking like this that they're long gone now you can't you can't get it get through the minor leagues in a way like that your attitude is like I got this [Music]
