game Joe Rogan podcast by night all day it's not official until the music starts that who did that song Brian did it I'm sorry that garage Jesus fucking master it's a garage band master it sucks because I hear it all the time in like stupid TV shows and commercials now like like like one of the riffs in that song oh really yeah it's uh it's what because it's a garage band riff yes yeah there's parts of it that are just straight-up from garage beneath a little bit yoshi mail our friend yoshi is here Hey Joe what's up Yoshi and brought his friend David Cho who insists on relentlessly relentlessly torturing Yoshi it's pretty fucking good at his nickname this is a strange nickname Yosh Yosh email yes why why would that why would they call you that is their story to go with this well for people who do know Yoshi they know that he used to work in the porn business and his currency it was porn like if if he needed to get tickets to something like Yoshi knows a lot of athletes and and rock stars and whatever and he's like hey you guys want some porn and he's always there with the box of porn and if you've got a box of porn from Yoshi you know that sometimes he hides some female panda that's true do you hide it in there is it like your way of just like letting people get a hold of it so like people who wouldn't ordinarily watch you were like well fucking I got the DVD no one's here but me let's just throw this on what are we trying to do I'm trying to figure out what they're into he likes you know he likes he likes to make people uncomfortable no but you know what sometimes even when they're angry I could do it's a fake angry and do you really like that oh really it'd be interesting that if you could have a camera set up to see how long they watched it before they turned it off ya know they're like this is disgusting and then get the lube out and they did a study a while back where they they took men who were homophobic and they showed them you know I heard about these guys having sex and they showed arousal mm-hmm Oh opposite I heard that they got like like a flight-or-fight kind of response like they get really like aggressive and angry really yeah what I read was that was penile arousal was the word and that they there was a recognized arousal in the male's mm-hmm that were especially homophobic especially angry about gay people is much more common for them to actually like Yoshi fighting off gay thoughts like Yoshi gets aroused thinking about a straight male watching shemale porn where did that come from Jill by the way don't believe everything he says okay all right well you you fuck it you tell me if I'm lying then so I so Yoshi you know like everyone in here watches porn you you you watch it you jerk off to it but this this was this guy's life so he what what gets this guy hard a guy who like a nine-to-five job watches porn from morning till night right just asses dicks penises and pussies just smashing together like over and over again and a lot of the times when I used to call him I'm like hey Yoshi you wanna go get dinner or something he'd be like no I got to finish this tranny porn and it was I always thought it was like he was just fucking with me right but then he's like it's not this like niche thing it's like huge it's our number one seller and it always has been what yeah whoa whoa whoa whoa Wow that's what I say it's just something that people weren't they love this shit black trainee porn business thing wait is this like huge the biggest underground in jewelry ever it's huge and untalked about that's crazy the number one seller even when I work at the retailer in Seattle we're booth and at the end of the month we do tally of which movies sold the most top ten it's always combination gay or trannies that's fucking crazy Jamil is there a lack of that well there's not a lack of that stuff on the internet and so I think we'd have to purchase it like why are they purchasing that more than anything else is that what the demand is the man is matsan there's not ever trainee love and dudes are they're out what do you think it is is this what I think it is it's so easy now but by the way I it really shocked me that we started that whole podcast trannies oh wow oh it's on you yeah I not why is it shocking new Yoshi milk no I talked about you know let's talk about life better we're talking about you don't worry about it all right so what is your my thing is it's just you know if you think of the things that we used to have to jack off to you know we're a bit older like the Sears catalog and it was just you know if there was someone at your school that had got a blowjob like they were like the hero right yeah like now like eight year old kids are giving each other Bulger it's just talking about Jim Norton all right go ahead no I'm like yo she's a grown up adult male that watches porn all day but think about like a regular kid who just like discovered the Internet and his first boner like he can already watch anal and everything right so I think I think you do anal you get blowjobs you have sex with your girlfriend and you're like sixteen and you've already seen and done everything you're like what's the next thing you know that's what I think I don't know I might be wrong on that but you know what's I don't know you you're in that business what do you think why do you think it's such a huge thing I have a friend in Boston professor of evolutionary biology but he did like a research like full very popular body parts in internet search this is according to hundred million research obvious one tits ass feet and penis according to her in one hundred million research by men and according to my friend it's because we're interested in all the different sexual cues it's it doesn't make you gay person I think it's part of our competitiveness like guy urinating bathroom kind of look over a guy's penis you know it's not a gay thing I don't think well the I think part of the idea is also that a lot of people have these sexual thoughts about men because they were imprinted with some sort of sexual experience by a man when they were young well there's molestation or something like that whatever it is they had some weirdness that happened with another boy and because of that they have like even though they don't have homosexual thought they're not homosexual they stay can still get aroused yeah by the idea of man or by the idea of doing something not supposed to do right looking at a guy's cock if you fucker shemale is that gay yes check this one out change he's not as gay you jerk off to a shield morning is that gay check this out uh no no no but it's questionable what is that wait show me avian there was a ton of these guys or they look like a normal guy but they had the nicest tits in the whole entire world and so like they would pull out their tits too before girls that they could just suck on them it looks like a guy that totally looks like ya and that looks like like a like an older actor yeah like a regular lookin dude yeah yeah that's so strange they're everywhere it just got normal-looking blonde or didn't McDermott it's like Dylan McDermott with giant tits that was amazing Cathy the name infers weird what is that is that a new look yeah there was like there's another one like that Danny I forget his name Jesus do you know who I'm talking about Yoshi he's a short blonde here yeah I remember the last day any something he was another one short blonde hair I got you a present when I was in AV and I brought it for you it's it kind of fits this conversation to have you son of a bitch whoa you can frame it maybe what is this it's dudes with the hard dicks in their pants oh let me see if you think you're funny why you paid money for this you really wanted to oh well if you don't want it I'll take it I bought it for you really drunk then next day I was like why did I buy this rich oh this that's why but it's good artwork he was aroused by it yeah he was he was I got a little tingle right there looking at if you're not he really wanted it for himself but what while he was purchasing is like this is for my friend Joe so it takes the gayness away from him yeah if you're gay and you saw that you'd be psyched yeah that's all I thought it was funny if I was like that gangster fag shit back in the day Joe will think this is hilarious yeah do you remember that there was a rapper named gangsta fag and he had like all these gangster rap songs about having sex what dude this shit's huge too yeah in New York have you seen it like now like home yeah yeah like it's like super hardcore gangsters but then and they like look like gangsters but they like wear pink and like I forgot what the movement is called but it's in you see it a lot in New York wow it's like they're on the subway just like making out look what the fuck you looking at shit yeah look we need another wrinkle in this society yeah what we're looking at for the folks listening on itunes this is - it's a famous photo of - look at they look latino gentlemen yes take Fletcher and gang like tattoos and they're in the top together naked well no biggie yeah totally not gay just a lot okay apparently that's in the Latino community in prison it's a big thing it's gay for the stay gay for the stay yeah that a lot of dudes they go gay when they're there inside and then when they get outside it's like just shut up about it Wow oh yeah well I want to ask you about that because you do all the UFC stuff like sometimes you know okay so UFC starts right and it was like tank Abbott it was like it was more like Street Fighter back then there was like a sumo guy with like a boxer right and then at some point it all went straight to like grappling right right so on any given UFC fight if you just walk into the room while the fights playing most of the fights end up on the floor right a lot of them do yeah less now I think then more recently right and then they're wearing the you know the type short shorts with the boner bulges and they're right there's a lot of 69 going on there's a lot of like head to crotch grinding yep it looks very homoerotic you could if you were into gay dudes and view into dudes especially if you were in athletic dudes I would totally see how you could see two men grappling especially bare chest to bare chest as being a homoerotic and just as you mean people but it's really based upon your sexual preference if you're into that yeah you would think that's homoerotic but if you're not it's not you know I'm sorry if you're not gay it's just two dudes fighting right you are gay you'd be psyched maybe you can enjoy to another level like it would be like not just fighting but fighting with like two hot dudes you're like really getting excited by so you're getting excited by the fight itself yeah and you get excited by the fact that you would like to suck both their cocks after it's over thank them for the show yeah I mean you know sometimes we're not these you know this move at the strip club when you go and the girl like gives you a simulated blowjob like she's blowing you but right use at the top of her head yeah I seen that in a UFC move like the guys like grinding his forehead on the guys crotch I'm like oh fuck a stripper just did that to me ah yeah good job you wouldn't want that if you had a big hard cop on though yeah it feels good you want like sweatpants that's true I knew a dude who used to take those nylon sweatpants you know the nylon sweatpants that dudes used to wear the joggers back in the 90s wherever those blue nylon sweatpants people used to wear yeah he took those and he sanded it with a thousand grit sandpaper in the crotch they would get it like he could hold it up to the light and see his fingers and then he would squirt Lube he's shaves cock and balls Oh complete complete shave I like where the stores going to squirt Lube all over himself put his sweatpants on and then he would go to the strip club and it was called shooting who goes shooting and the girls would sit down and we give him a lap dances essentially he was wearing a condom Wow pretty clever you know he's a very smart guy yeah I used to live at the strip club pretty much in Vegas and nobody figured that out there yeah when when when like me and my friend Harry when we'd go we take our jeans off and like to put on sweatpants right someone new to our group would be like what are you guys doing we're like dude we're about to get lap dances but this is this takes that to the whole of it well let's do it brought out grinding down brought out sandpaper to the point where the shit was like almost transparent it was using like 1500 grit which is like what you would use to gently clean off the shaft of a pool cue that kind of dust just a slight level of dust every time ass this is so me and he he wore that shit down when he'd get his finger so he could see his fingers in the light and that's what he knew like it was technically still close what was this guy's this guy's name happened to be Yoshi not that clever that clever this guy was a very smart dude I won't give his name eyes but he it's like and it's imperative that you shave the cock and balls because you want to have no hair no hair anyway yeah like I'll technique to everything that's fantast and then he's like then you go Astroglide but then one time I guess he put on too much Astroglide and a girl got on his lap but she was what the fuck right the fuck is this and he was like oh yeah I'm sorry she was what are you doing what are you doing I couldn't believe he was horrified please you know he basically took it too far yeah he wasn't you know he just wearing the nylon pants and you got the lube on underneath and she really probably can't tell at first but he like had a puddle in his pants Wow he tried to get crafty they tried to make a monument to this guy like every strip club well for a long time like he's got his own business and he was really dedicated to his business very he was selling shooting pants he he he had this business and so he didn't have any time for dating so what he would do is he would go and work all fucking day on his own business then he would eat dinner he would order takeout then he would go to strip club in his shooting pants and he would the ritual get one off and then they'd go back home and that's what he would do every day whenever he wanted to when everyone and that was how he avoided relationships for the longest time we just go shooting cuz he was just he had a few bad relationships and he got fucked over Jose chicks he was in his 30s mmm mmm smart guy and he just was like he was very logical to his approach to solving problems worse yet no I haven't talked to him in a long time I don't know can I ask you a question sure so I just walked in here and you guys have all these sex at dawn books and like I read that too cuz I'm interested in yeah and sexuality and all that stuff especially the shemale stuff so when I look at you I see like the lat of a dying breed of man like sort of like the intellectual jock like you like you like a pretty big guy that can beat the shit out of people but you're also like well-read and an intelligent so what what is your whole take on all this like do you are you married do you have a girl yeah I'm married oh you are I'm married I've yeah have kids and everything I have the whole deal yeah you know it is crazy and like recently or for a long time I've been married for quite a few years now but for me the the difference that happens when you when you have kids right is so hard to wrap your head around like for anybody that's not married and doesn't have kids right like once you have like a little you a birthday running around like the love that you have for them is so it's really you could never imagine that it would even be possible so it's a real mindfuck went how old are your kids I have a 16 year old stepdaughter I have a four-year-old and a two-year-old whoa the four is almost five the two zone is three yes pretty major unbelievably fascinating and cupcake over enemy so so when I hear when I hear you you're like okay here's like the married path with like kids yeah and then here's the other path with the shooting pants yeah you know what man shooting pants if that the whole deal is finding a compatible person right if you don't find a compatible person you find somebody wants to fight all the time fires want to test you find someone who's just not at peace themselves you're gonna have fucking problems yeah but you always find something wrong with people yeah but as a you know a man who like probably gets hit on by chicks all the time those fucking ring girls are super smoking hot like I mean how do you deal with that just jerk off keep it together do your best I know a great guy that has a immense collection of shemale porn that I could hook you up with the idea of carrying a hard porn is so ridiculous these days with all the websites yeah does the industry frown upon the websites that they look at it the way other people look at you know he's so annoying do you know what the that there's still they still print video cassettes and like the VHS like I don't know any who buys porn episode from myself but for in general I don't know one person whoever buys pornography like DVDs right even has like a porn pass or any of that stuff and so yo she educated me that he said that the last the thing that keeps this business alive is people like 50 and over all pervert yeah that they're scared to use computers so they still go to the store and they buy DVDs and VHS tapes yeah and then once their debt dead then this business will be dead so the old perverts who just stuck with their ways yeah they have this way they like the remote control they like bills sit there on the bed they're also prayed the government might get them they're probably right you know because there's no you know there's nothing of it on their computer mm-hmm cuz you're trusting the companies that every one of those girls are 18 and older it's a funny thing man but if someone who's in a high position of power let's say a political person and they found that they had tranny porn house even though it's totally legal right and you know you're saying it's the biggest market yeah so it represents a lot of human beings rather into that stuff you'd be done right yeah for sure how weird is that well I was how weird is it that we give a fuck about like Jimmy Norton is a very good friend of mine I love that I love that guy I don't care that he jerks off to trainings at all it doesn't bother me that he's had training experiences it's hilarious when he tells you about like the the fact that you would judge what tweaks someone sexually the heart wants what the heart wants but it's complete like that's a weird sort of homophobia that's still accepted it's it's a weird sort of prejudice that's still accepted that your sexual preference and even if you're a nice person you know even though you're nice and you know you're intelligent will will judge you based on whether or not you jerk off to dudes with dicks or dudes who looks like chicks my ex I remember even ladies late 80s that stolen or didn't want to have interracial tapes thinking most of the customers in Seattle would hate it but the reaction once we got the interracial stuff is opposite it's always the white doctors white lawyers ycp yeah yeah you know so well the disproportionate amount of racial porn is sold in the deep south oh you touch like number-one poor market it's white dudes white dudes watching black guys fuck white girls yeah the couple of gnomes damn it yeah those are weird that's something I didn't see common the the cock cold market yeah if folks if you're normal and you listening to this and you're not all fucked up in the head like us where we could just say cock hole and no one has to worry whether or not anybody understands what it means apparently there's a group of dudes who like watching other guys fuck their women yeah yeah and they like especially like big black guy Samantha what is it call the mandingo yeah clove or something and there's a lot you bring like seven mandingos mm-hm it's like like it's like just this black crew of like guys with dicks like you know over 12 inches whoa and they just come in like 12 inches just stop and think about that it's not just one dude there's like many guys with dicks over 12 inches out it's like a horse race I think the Vice guys made an awesome documentary about Italy yeah it's about is a big deal it's it's just specifically about the cuckold stuff like its cuckold from mandingos oh like it's a mandingo I didn't I didn't even know like that was a I thought mandingo was just the name of a porn star but I guess it's a whole movement I think the slave owners had a one prized black guy in each farm and did I think they call them mandingo I think that's where it started it really yeah so you can go to this and get your wife mandingo - oh god that's fucking insane and remembering about it I don't think that probably would and I don't want to know I see Joe going to one of those parties where you are wearing masks you know you oh yes but I wear a Batman man yeah when a white porcelain bullshit if you make me matter what mass would be Batman but the if you when I did Dave show we were talking about David tells porn show babes old porn thanks for doing it but it was fun it was a lot of fun yosh works on that show oh but when i did it we were looking at John Holmes like his dick ain't even big by today's standards like it's kind of crazy like he was the guy who had the big giant cock yeah now there's so many black guys with dicks way bigger than John Holmes well they weren't allowed to you know yeah they weren't allowed in the porn back then that's why that's how it is I think so yeah machen so people had to get tired of white people fucking white women where the leg lifts we got a million videos of white girls getting fucked by white guys with 3/4 hard-deck ok can we bring in some brothers yeah and they're like okay we'll just try this out and see how it works boom smash hit big black dudes with giant dicks fucking white girls and just changes though and for girls like that's like part of their currency right that they haven't had interracial like that's like they that that helps them sell at a lot of markets right yeah well a lot of the stars they that their manager would tell them don't do it don't why Rachel well he charge more money I've I've talked extensively I just started in my podcast with Oslo Kira who just won 2012 what is your podcast called alright so just like for the same audience out there that doesn't know what cuckold is the name of the podcast is DVD a sa and it's all the podcasts or a DVD a sitcom but basically this is pretty much all I talked to awesome about because I was like is that true when you fuck a black dude then your rate goes down and that was actually sort of a myth but the shit now so DV das a stands for double vag double anal sensitive artist and always gets pissed because she's like they've get it straight I didn't do DVD a cuz if you do DVD a then it's for dicks at the same time she said I did DV break and then at another time I did da yeah so that's two dicks in your ass at once and it's like you know it's medically dangerous I mean she can't sit for like a week after that I mean it's like really yeah it's like weird we just grilled her about this it's and the thing is why is she do that she's a little you know she's five four - yeah there's like there's like AI the yo she knows more about porn than I do but for for what I know most other girls that do this are usually like ugly and no-name porn stars so for someone like awesome who has a huge name to do it it's like it's like whoa like and she's tiny you know why is she doing it because it will check out insatiable - Jo yo I will explain it I went I went I went with her to the porno insatiable I went with her to the porn Awards last year and she won best anal best double penetration to two years in a row so I was like you know after the thing you know it's a weird thing to celebrate you know right because it's like you're the best but fucky right you're the you got butt fucked the best out of anyone this year right you got penetrated oh my god I'm so happy for you oh my god you won the award that's amazing yeah but you know I love her so I'm like sitting there and I'm I think I'm just like there's not a huge success rate for porn stars after porn right like it's like you either got a bag of rich dude or you got to get out before it just completely destroys your soul and it's too late yeah no you're absolutely right is there a documentary about it life after porn yeah how is that great I just saw the first 20 minutes and it was like super sad and I was like yeah and and I was like you're at the top right now you won the fucking she was walking out of here like this with like all the awards I was like you won everything this year and last year right and like you fucking dislike fur I'm trying to tell to quit I'm not trying to tell her to quit but like start like like if a porn star one performer of the year like ten years ago right that means she was like really sexy and like did sexy shit like if you went perform of the year now in 2012-2013 that means you took dicks like brutally like you're like slant like like a fucking bag of dicks like just and they're giving them awards and saying good job and so these girls are working towards these awards did you watch these oh yeah they don't they look like snuff films yeah they are like getting well rag the crowned and thrown against the wall and like it's like caveman shit yeah her her if you check out insatiable which i think is not gonna do anymore insatiable as an example insatiable she's getting dragged by her hair down there and just pretty much gagged and I mean it does look like it looks like rape or something that's what people want there's two things people want now like shit like that it's a parody it's this thing with the the shemale stuff it's like they've already seen everything what's the next thing and it's funny I said what is next are you gonna have to fuck animals you can get your head chopped off in the next one yeah you know what is she saying she she's one of the one of the girls that genuinely loves porn like she loves being a she's like and that's why a lot of the fans like her because she's not like oh I'm just gonna do this until I get my real estate license right like she loves it so she seems rough sex she loves fucking she loves it here so she's amazing I love her too you know it's a funny thing that people would like you know the natural instinct is to go oh god what the fuck are you guys talking about she's amazing she's taking two dicks in their house oh my god he's amazing but the reality is porn is something that a fucking lot of people watch but nobody gives anybody credit for being good at it oh I mean that's the other thing - he's right about that because you look we've all had bad sexual experiences where someone wasn't into it right girls like you know and you like and you know you're losing your erection she's like what's wrong I'm like what the fuck's wrong with you like right kind of a conversation we have in here this is nuts so what you what you see like in a scene when a girl's like really into getting fucked right the reality of it like gets you excited right but if someone sucks at it it's not good like a ball seemed bad porn I mean there's a lot of porn out there it's not all good and usually the hot chicks you know they don't fuck like ugly fat girls you know so when you have a hot chick that does fuck like a you know fat ugly chick then it's like amazing you know and she's amazing because she's done since we're gang bangs bunch of guys yeah and I know half of those guys didn't take a bath and she'll smile and just do it like professional oh yeah random stranger that's that's the other thing much like opal Mike bull porn so these guys are open II know you don't want that Mike to be that closed mouth cuz that's the other thing we figured out is like the podcast is pretty much me know she and AUSA and all this dude does is eat asses out of hookers and Austen she she eats a lot of ass in like no she said a lot of those guys don't shower and stuff so I'm like I'm on a show with two people that he'd ask and all day don't get pinkeye from his mic or you probably have a good immune system because of that your immune system is doing battle oh she's AIDS I'm good I'm good well yo she's AIDS and Brian's aids in the same room what they are is like two competing beehives and they fuckin they're hovering in the middle of the room trying to work the situation out Yoshio is Tiger who's AIDS dominates this room you can only get it once right twice we had this guy on and I have to tell people listen to this podcast we have found a molecular biologist to debate dr. Peter goo Goo's Berg we had this guy on the podcast and a lot of people got really angry at me he's a professor of biology at the University of California Berkeley and he's got this crazy theory about HIV and AIDS okay and he doesn't believe that HIV causes AIDS he believes that the drugs that people give people for HIV they're what really is going on with these people is they have a compromised immune system from drug use you're giving him a drug that's designed to kill a disease they don't even it's not even the the cause of their illness he's saying the cause their illness is the fact they're taking all these drugs and the people that are in HIV research they think he's fucking crazy and a lot of people got mad at us for having him on uh-huh and it's a controversial situation because obviously he's smarter than me I don't I'm not a professor of biology he's got tenure and he does like peer-reviewed stuff on cancer that's very well respected like to this day but he's got this wacky opinion on on HIV and you know he insists that no one wants to debate him so we got this guy who's finally willing to debate him and I'll nounce all of it when everything gets signed away and we figure out what day they're gonna both fly in but we're gonna bring him in here and we're gonna have them debate as long as it takes on the podcast and there you know either Duesberg is fuckin crazy or Duesberg is a genius and we have a real problem with the way people perceive this one particular disease I don't fucking know I'm just hoping that I can figure out how to navigate through the waters cuz I'm basically gonna be like a referee in a contest that I don't understand right but do you know anyone with AIDS besides Brian and Yoshi well they have the most AIDS but yeah I know a guy was HIV I know at least one guy the only the only time in my life that I've ever seen anyone with AIDS and it was like a lot a lot of AIDS was when I was in Africa like that's like that was part of Duesberg problem with it he said that what you're seeing in Africa is not people that have HIV it's people that have no no nutrition it's like you're seeing compromised immune systems because they're they're starving and they're they're in horrible climates where there's a lot of waste around a lot is it like you're seeing a lot of different it's things he's like they're not testing these people for HIV he goes and the the amount of people that they have tested that that do have HIV in Africa he said the number hasn't increased but the population is tripled the population in Africa they were saying is gonna be decimated by AIDS and he was like well if that's the truth why the population increased by threefold population was like he said it was like this is all Duesberg I'm paraphrasing but he said I believe it was like 500 million and now it's over a billion so he was like the population tripled they got 12-inch dicks they like the fuck yeah well the idea is that if AIDS was a communicable disease and like people are describing it it would have swept through Africa and decimated the population and he's saying because it didn't and not even by any stretch of the imagination he said it's it backs up his idea that it's something that's brought a bond in Africa by poor nutrition in America by drug use I don't know man I know gay dudes love to party and that's something that can't be ignored right fucking love to party and it could be a combination of them loving to party makes them more susceptible to certain diseases and illnesses but we all know that I have I have a friend who they they you know they're married and they're you know they're they're gay folks and they have mmm-hmm have a total normal married life but they also have friends who are gay that they talk about there are their buddies that they party with and these guys are fucking savages when you get a direct line into how gays and these are gay professional men I mean one guy they do DVD yeah one guy owns a clothing company and he's really rich and another guy he owns some other business and he he actually pays a straight guy and has sex with him he's like got the straight Russian guy that uh that he paid like the guy was like broke working in a bar and save paying him for sex and he fucks this kind of regulation up so now I bought that's got a car puts a guy up an apartment and just goes and bangs him and they go out and they fucking party hard party hard man and it might be just be this guy's buddies but you know when I meet these dudes and they start telling me stories about the fucking throwdowns that they all have together they fucking go out and do crazy drugs you know they're in the this dance culture all the time and they love to take ecstasy and they get together and you know snorting party that's part of what they're doing that's fun and that shit will decimate your immune system whether or not dues berg's correct about all of a sumption 'he's about aids that outside of let's set that aside for a minute and just look at the fact that there's so many of these dudes taking those drugs and that those drugs will fuck you up that is a fact yeah whether or not HIV causes AIDS the majority of scientists say it does so I have to go with them I mean the majority support the idea that it's this ever altering and changing disease it's very hard to figure out and then it decimates the immune system it they I don't imagine that you could keep something like that a secret if it wasn't true yeah so having him on was it was a tricky thing because I'm I can't debate him and I had my friend Bryan Callen on he tried to debate him but he got smushed another genius yeah so we're doing that so that's that's coming up I'm gonna keep hope alive that there's a cure for you buddy no yoshi's ages and cure oh let's get his own yeah it's his own thing sorry but it's like a fingerprint and that's like fucking with my aids yeah I'd be like King Kong vs. Godzilla you could get a film camera in there and make a cartoon reenactment of what they say he would just see aids doing battle with AIDS they'll dressed up like gladiators from a scene the Lord of the Rings just just Boger aids and on the other side role aids and they have fucking shields on them on their chests and battering rams and they're going to war inside Yoshi's ass somebody somebody make that cartoon you guys gotta throw that my god after this shows there Yoshi we will spray it I'm gonna let you know ok don't feel sad we're gonna spray it because I saw a few those spit tools dude they flew off your mouth what you got really particularly excited about things that's like panspermia that's how like asteroids hit other planets and that's how life gets to earth your aids leapfrogging on to that you know very moist sponge microphone cover that's a perfect habitat for super AIDS I just wanna make sure they're just joking I don't have a [Laughter] guess what Brian doesn't have AIDS either wink that's that that's the other shit is like you guys are on iTunes yeah yeah we're on iTunes but see like we just started our shit and we talked about like AIDS and rape like every like how the fuck you get off you start talking my poop well there's nothing wrong with it you know what we're saying we didn't say we didn't advocate rape we didn't advocate anybody getting dragged away by their hair right mouth fucked we're just real it's a part of life it's the educational podcast it's very much an educational part I'm surprised we're in comedy we're in the comedy section well out see that's what like we didn't write in our description like it's DVD aasa but we didn't write it's double vaginal double anal right whatever and so you know my manager is like dude you have a porn star on there and you have this fucking guy like do you want ever to have non porn star guests like real guests on you'll have normal yes well we have this currency now like for me I haven't painted in a while and like my paintings have gone like it's you know like ridiculously expensive so I could paint yes to bribe them to come on yeah an awesome man also said last week she said she'll blow anyone who comes on our show really yeah and she was and she said it's like so like not joking like like yeah whatever [Laughter] see that's what keeps hope alive it's good currency to help you here and things like that that is excellent currency you know the people go on your show anyway period you know why would they not want to go on I don't know they don't their career just in this day and age people are silly yeah yeah they gotta relax just be who the fuck you are yeah you know especially in a podcast form is the best place for that because you get a chance to express yourself for hours definitely it's not like you said something fucked up and then like remember when Hugh Grant got blown by that writer and got arrested and went on The Tonight Show yeah Jay Leno goes what the hell were you thinking Jay Leno does his famous line that brought the Tonight Show back and you know when they have those shows yeah they talk about you know the history the war between the Tonight Show and the David Letterman Show that was the show that turned the tide Jay Leno looked at Hugh Grant and said what the hell were you thinking right well when he did that you know and that was like this tiny little conversation that only took place over a couple of minutes right when you'd love to sit you grate down and give him a glass of wine and give him some weed and talk to him for hours you know like how many how many hookers did you get you can tell me yeah I mean you and Elizabeth whatever the fuck her name was her problem she was super hot she was super like one of the hottest chicks ever and like even with that you have to go out and get this strange new pussy you know he got dirty Street yeah yeah you needed that nasty yeah he's a rich famous man if he wanted to he could this is before the internet you know I mean he could have gone to get out like LA Weekly and gotten a prostitute very right they always had that he wanted that he wanted it he wanted to go Street yeah he why don't I remember his ex-girlfriend she's so beautiful Elizabeth really yes surely my reaction was I don't think she's nasty in bed oh you're probably lazy probably lazy may be lazy with you grant oh I bet if the right dude gets ahold of her she'll fuck the life out of it okay yeah fair enough yeah it's just you gotta impress a girl like that you gotta fuck this shit out right that girl's so pretty and she's famous yeah you got to do a lot of work so he's probably tired of doing all that work you want to pull over and just get his dick so exactly bitch can the cars okay yeah ah get out here's your money that's what he wanted he wanted some crazy moment like the exact opposite of what it is at home at home he probably has to work for it man she probably turns him down all the times probably argues with them she's probably challenges that's why I don't understand why you got married because you're you're like a free dude you're like I'm gonna do comedy I'm gonna do UFC shit I'm gonna my own podcast it's like that part of your life is so free and then like I've done like everything I can to like let's be married you know I it's a lot to not be man yeah to not be married and like that's why yeah a little bit well it's it's it's all about finding the right person if you find the right person and you have starting to having children having a child to me it's way more of a commitment I said look adversity yeah okay having a child's way more so got pulling up I suck at pulling out yeah the first one wasn't planned the second one was planned okay but uh yeah badge is preposterous the idea is ridiculous the idea that you gonna write some shit down and that someone is gonna be legally entangled with you and then you gonna have to sit in front of a bunch of other people right when you want to break up with her they have to decide how your money gets distributed and in your situation it's a terrible idea because yes you've got a lot of money well even that's before I had a lot of money that I never was into the idea of it of course it's stupid it's a stupid idea my my wife likes it so I did it because we wanted to make her up and it makes her happy and I'm not going anywhere man I'm not gonna be that guy I mean once wilderness tree huggers I want to make a robot dirty street yeah are they getting closer to making that then you were at the AVN Awards right yeah they had a they have shoes on fucked up people again the Adult Video News Awards they had a lot of like kind of real doll technology there they have one that like talks to you know it's still kind of just like you're fucking a dead person huh well they had a Japanese bullshit to the they had a Japanese robot that was fairly realistic it wasn't a sexual robot but it was a robot that would like talk to you and for companionship the lips moved fairly realistically uh we're gonna get to a Blade Runner day it's gonna we're getting there it's on the way yeah it's a hundred percent I mean if you look at the fact that the the you know the the supercomputers that they had in the 1960s filled entire rooms and they didn't have the power that your iPhone has right just think about that and think about these robots now and what we're gonna have a hundred years from now or a thousand years from now the Blade Runner thing is a hundred percent inevitable you're invited to the wedding with the mayor first robot you're gonna marry a robot yeah dude they'll kill you they'll kill you when they find out that you you you have an expiration date on then but as if you bought superhot robot hookers and they have this implanted memory of their life with you this perfect life with you and how deeply deeply deeply in love with you they are and then they realize that it like on year five they die because that's when you get tired of chicks and you want to bring in another one and program a new life into her brain I like the sci-fi portal real that's yeah that's that's and well your possible here's the other thing is like when you go to like a sex store or a porn convention like that and you see like the dildos that they have like this advanced dildo technology they have teledildonics or whatever it's like there's not a human dick that could do what these dildos do yeah they vibrate they rotate things like this so I think last year right yeah last year was like the first year what and I'm walking out and there's like a hard drive that looks like that and the guy's like come over here and I'm like no he's like come over he's like he's like stick your finger in that in that computer right there and I'm like no I don't want to and he's like dude there was no one else around he's like just stick your finger in that hard drive and I was like all right and I stuck it in and it was wet and it was warm and it was doing things a human vagina can never do it was like and I was like I'm about to come out of my finger and I was like just the same way girls who use a lot of dildos their pussies become desensitized yeah like I was like if I buy this thing right now I'll never fucking leave the house again I'll fuck this little computer box and if they put it into one of these Android things I mean there won't be a woman was a vagina like tighter than that every was a there was a science fiction comic book that I read when I was a kid I'll never forget it's a heavy metal stuffer it was something along those lines it was it was well whatever it was was a black-and-white one I remember it was a robot that started the guy had a robot as you know like a slave or whatever but the robot was like very human-like and like very muscular and big and the robot started fucking his wife whoa and then he went to stop the robot from fucking his wife and the robot broke his arm and like it was like it's a really scary thing this robot had this big giant cock and like it was in the the thing that he was gonna continue fighting the robot was like laughing as he was fucking his wife well the guy's like thinking what did i do like holding his broken arm which is all fucked up while this robot fucks his wife but that image like really stuck into my hand because I if we really do develop a artificial human being that thinks it's a human being right and especially if we make them ridiculously strong right they're gonna fuck your wife and they're gonna break your arm if you try to stop them here get it we're not gonna they're not really that website bright robot cuckolded Robocop yeah we're so desensitized we need cuckolding we need mouths double anal double vag I mean it's crazy they already do that in Japan these guys are into otaku like there's crazy fan of a particular subject like porn or whatever right there during a ceremonial marriage thing with the robots and shit like that in Japan oh really in Japan yes yes my home fence it's weird I get it but yeah they're doing that it's it's really interesting I like I said I'm happy but I wouldn't recommend it I recommended you found the right one yeah but it's not it's very common I don't like to talk okay okay the I'm the only of finding somebody the odds of finding somebody that you get along with as good as I get along with her they're pretty slim I haven't found that many people in my whole life that I get along with right right yes you get it's it's a compatibility thing because I'm not the right dude for a lot of chicks right no and you're not the right dude for a lot of chicks like right you gotta find the one who's like that's what I've been looking for and and well I'm happy to hear that man thank you that's cool man Sookie it's good to be happy and it's the the idea of being able to raise kids it was always like this a real scary thing for me when I was younger like it was when I was in my 20s I thought of it as like a burden that's all I thought of it I was like oh my god right if I had a kid right now I'd be fucked right I couldn't even like feeding my cat or I had a kid like Jesus Christ all right but once you go through the experience and you become an adult you kind of have a different perspective on just the idea of a finite lifetime right and the idea of the the concept of being able to raise a human from the very beginning and like educate them or and expose them to different things along the way how old are you eunuch eight with them how old are you and you on your first kid the first biological kid I was 40 see totally different so guys like you and Bourdain give me hope because I think Bourdain had his first kid or yeah it's it's easier to understand what's going on right when if I was 21 if I got my girlfriend pregnant and I would marry her back then I might get so overwhelmed by the responsibility of it all and not being a cup the other thing is that I'm in a comfortable place in my life we're enough to worry about shit I worry about my job I've been working for the UFC for like 12 years now and then even more before like 11 year it's been 11 years but even more back in the day it's like another two years from another owner right man been doing it so long it's not some I worry about losing so out of all this like out of all the things that you do and you do used to do the fear factor you do the UFC you do your podcast and you do stand-up comedy like out of all these things like which is your passion that you is it all like I love everything or I really do love everything but of all except fear factor I just I love the money from Fear Factory that was hit every now and then I loved it you know every now and then it was fun right it was fun when they were cool people it could be cool but I wouldn't do it for free right right and I would do all the other shit for free cuz you love it yeah it's all the other shit I don't think I'm just doing this for my for the money right it's and in doing something that you you know like the difference between say the UFC in fear factor was sometimes I would enjoy fear factor right when I worked for the UFC I always enjoyed it I mean I like but some people might think is a boring fight I enjoy right because anything can happen it might be boring for a couple seconds and a dude gets cracked and it becomes the most exciting shit ever right right you know I'm ready I I enjoy it so the difference is DIF you if you're doing something you're only doing for the money all right you're always gonna have this this feeling like all right I just plow through this and do it for the money but when you're doing something that you love you eliminate that bad feeling well that's the thing is when I watch those I'm like well like when I hear you're doing announcing for UFC I'm like this guy sounds like he's super super pumped right now like you know it sounds like you're into it so and like you're like oh when you're like referring back to fights from like ten years earlier I'm like is there something in front of you showing the young you remember those now that's not only that I don't even do any research you just love this sport yeah yeah my my research can I do some trivia with you sure yeah alright so the first time BJ Penn fought George st. Pierre was like in Vegas ten years ago or eight years no no what long ago it was probably 2006 I would I would guess I'm not I mean I I can't tell you the exact numbers but I could tell you what happened in the fight so who won that fight well George won the fight know what but who really I thought BJ did more damage and all George did was take him down a couple of times in the later rounds but BJ thumb George in the eye is a very see some some George in the eye on the first round in the right eye and he had a cut and I really fucked with him and that was the first time George had faced like real serious adversity inside the cage because it wasn't a thumb on purpose it's like people have to realize that because the fact that thumbs aren't exposed even with a legitimate punch right a total which BJ's was completely legitimate punch oftentimes a thumb can go right right right into the eyeball right and you could really fuck up a guy's vision from that and you know it was just because BJ had cleaner striking back then I mean he fucking won the fight that's what I think I think you want to fight too because I believe he won he more damage and I think ultimately the Japanese had a better way of judging fights than then the standard 10-point must system that we use which is really like a boxing system this is unbelievable this is fucking cry me Jost Aurelio I mean you watch how many fights the fact that you remember that from the well I've called at least a thousand to use this curse at least even more than that I don't hear a funny story about that fight yeah sure so I just I I was in the Congo how many stories begin with that and I was there I was there for vice and I and I just came back to LA and I have a bit of a gambling problem and the way my gambling career I guess is set up is uh basically yeah 2006 or around that time like six seven years ago when I was going there I was going there every week and winning around $1,000 and and then I would stop that's I could I could for sure go to Vegas and when you know between 800 and a thousand dollars you know and that was what I was doing for money and then I would be painting on the side or whatever and I would do that every week so I came back from Africa and I was gonna go on you know I was gonna fly to go or Drive to go see my parents hadn't seen them in a few months and BJ was being sponsored by the clothing company Ruka do you know RVs yeah yeah sure yeah so Pat the owner is one of my best friends and he goes Dave you got to take BJ's the fight was the next day with George st. Pierre and he said something with the logo was not big enough or something so he still had the pants he's like these pants need to get to two to DJ in Vegas and I said all right so why do I gotta go is that cuz you fucking love Vegas and I'm like dude I I'm still wearing the same clothes that I was wearing in Congo for like two months like I need to go shower I need to go see my parents he's like he's like Dave and then he passes me $40,000 which was the most amount of cash I'd ever seen in my life and he goes you need to go put this on BJ to win and I go whoa dude he's like you love to gamble I trust you he goes go give BJ his pants and you know go get BJ's pants and gonna put this money on BJ doand holy Sh and I was like are you sure dude I was like okay so he gives me he gives me a clean shirt it's just like a BJ Penn security shirt you know said BJ Penn and then security on the back so I take the red-eye into Vegas and sitting next to me in a Safeway plastic bag is BJ Penn's pants and in my pocket is forty thousand dollars and he goes when you get to Vegas go to go up to the penthouse and BJ it was at Mandalay Bay I think he goes go go to Mandalay Bay and at this point I knew BJ I wasn't as I'm pretty good friends with him now but I didn't know him that well back then so I get there and I go upstairs to his room and you know he travels with his whole family then they you know they're usually like loud and fun and I get up to the room and I have I have his pants ago Pat told me to bring you your pants he was like okay thanks and his brother Reagan's like it's just it was like a weird vibe in the room and I was like what the fuck's going on dude he's like come over here he's like the guy in the next room over brought home a 20 year old your 21 year old hooker fucked her and strangled her and then like just dropped her in the hallway and then till there and killed her she's dead and because she was dead in the hallway right in front of BJ's room they they took beat even though they knew he didn't do it like they took him in for questioning that day yeah so I'm like freaking out and he's like dude BJ's have been at the police station all day answering questions and he's he has this fight tomorrow night so I'm like whoa so I run downstairs I call pattern like Pat this was the day of the weigh-ins or the day of the fight the day before the day before the weigh-in yeah so so was he wasn't cutting anyway for that the day right before the fight the day right before the first day the weigh-ins yeah so I I don't know exactly because I just got there at midnight also I go downstairs I go Pat are you sure you want me to put this money on him because he just came back from the police station you might not you know he's like dude BJ's a champion he's gonna fuckin smoke this guy and for a guy who's been the vagus like every week you know I go there every week for like the last 20 years I had never been to Vegas where it felt like this before more Hawaiians that had never left Hawaiian were it you know this was like they weren't even like the main fight right but like George st. Pierre is the hero of Canada so there was all these fucking Canadians in in Vegas and then there was all these Hawaiians and in Vegas and it was just like a fuck fuck Canada and like fuck Hawaii like it was like I was playing cards and people would see my BJ pincher and they'd go fuck BJ Penn fuck Hawaii and then all these people would be like it was like electric like it was like crazy and I was like wow Pat you want are you sure you'd and then this is where I found out that a sports book is not actually part of the casino it's a separate entity that's like rents out so I went I said 40 grand on BJ Penn wind after I talked to Pat I was like hey are you sure you want me to put this money's like BJ's gonna kill this guy it doesn't matter he's a piece he's got the heart of a champion I was like all right and I go in there and the odds if you don't remember everyone already thought BJ was gonna win so if I put 40 grand on BJ to win I would only got back like 30 grand I think and if I put 40 on st. Pierre I would have got back like 70,000 I think so the odds were way in BJ Penn's favor so they wouldn't even take a bet that big so I was like oh shit so he's like and they were all the sports books were closing so they're like you have to do it the next day so I was like all right I'm gonna I'll just go a strip club I guess so I go to a strip club and as soon as I walk in or get out of the car a security guard sees me and he goes right this way sir and then he takes me to like this giant private room and I'm like still smell like shit from Africa and I'm like they just bring over the hottest strippers and then I'm like what the fuck's going on and I realize I'm wearing a BJ Penn security shirt so they think BJ is coming they're like they're like when's DJ gonna come here and all these security guards are like sucking my big just was like BJ's the best he's gonna win the fight tomorrow and I was like I was like oh so I'm like I'm gonna take advantage of the situation like sitting there with my friend Harry were like you know getting lap dances all this shit and then I was like fuck they're gonna at some point expect me to come here so I sneak out the side and then uh I don't think I slept that night in the first you know I was I was it was one of those nights where I stay at the strip club till like the Sun comes up and then the next day I start putting the money down on on BJ to win but it was like seven grand I like the you know the Venetian and then like eight grand over here and had to split it up a little bit right so I the I was like running around and I couldn't get the money spread out so I was only able to bet like 32 grand and I still had eight grand in cash on me and then the fight starts and like you said like it was just like you said like everyone the place is going nuts like it's going fucking insane like everyone's like like Canada fucker ye and it's like and then the fight happens I'm like oh fuck st. Pierre looks bloody first round I'm like this fights done like BJ BJ one and then st. Pierre is a smart fighter so he like deflected a lot or whatever and then when decision time came around they gave it to st. Pierre by one point decision and the place goes blue and they started like screaming like I couldn't believe it like I'm like oh my god because I had my own money on the fight - he walks off stage his brothers like get him drunk right away and then I don't know if you go out at all after the fights or whatever but I've never seen Vegas this violent before in my life like there was like street brawls inside casinos there was Canadians beating up Hawaiians who wines beating up like it was crazy I knew a Hawaiian guy that put his house on you know up for the whole thing and yeah I mean it was people were going crazy I've never in all the years I've been in Vegas I've never seen like a situation like this where he bet his house on BJ yeah I mean it was fucking crazy so what do you win when you bet your house I don't admit in another house I think you just put the value of it up I don't know I don't know the details that's ridiculous so he lost his house yeah so he lost his house and and yeah you saw the fight I mean I was like yeah that guy's an idiot idiotic move yeah I mean especially when you know that the judging in MMA judging an MMA is so sketchy yeah I mean it was it was fucking crazy so then just as I think the girl that I was with for seven years then we had just broken up happened to be in Vegas so I was having dinner with her after and I was telling her what's happening I was like dude I just lost $32,000 of my friends money on this thing and she's like oh and I was calling him and I was saying hey Pat I still have eight grand of your money do you want me to gamble with it and when you're 32 grand back and he's like get your fucking ass back over here like he was so pissed off and so I was just having dinner with her and then he calls me back and he goes you know what I was I was planning on winning the money or losing it so go for it and I was like you want I can do this and remember I've only won $1,000 that was like the most money at everyone I never even had like eight thousand or 40,000 so I was like shit I'm gonna walk into that high-limit room for the first time in my life so but I'm talking with her and you know like right after a long break that you've been together with someone for a long time and you break up there's like that maybe we're still gonna get together yeah so like I'm like fuck I'm gonna go gamble right now and then in this situation uh the fuck was that guy the rush hour guy crashed out Chris Tucker so Chris Tucker and like a you know posse of like 40 people like walk in then they start hitting on her right away right when I got up so I was like fuck I gotta go win this bunny but like Chris Tucker looks like he's gonna I was like sort of stuck I was like fuck these motherfuckers hitting on my ex-girlfriend I was like are I'm just gonna run into it so I walked into the Venetian high-limit room for the first time and then eight grand in like $1,000 chips is like you know it's like this little stack and I split it up and I started playing like my system the way I play and I won about 36 grand within like 15 minutes Wow and that fucked me up it's like smoking weed your whole life and then doing cocaine you know so then I called him I was like hey Pat I'm up to 36 you're gonna win the last get your fucking ass back to Costa Mesa right now I was like all right all right all right I was like I really think I could win the whole 46 top stop right now so I stopped and then yeah I mean I sort of blame basically BJ for my gambling problem because after that after that moment I could never go to Vegas again and just win thousand I had to like went at least 20 grand it's because of the rush you can't go backwards you know right like I'm like I just want 36 grand with this guy's money why can I win it with my own money right so and I didn't have that kind of money to gamble with so I you know I like took a loan out to do it like it was he took a loan out I was I started again I was very confident that I could do it you know so Wow yeah and how'd that work out I made a small fortune doing that I can't really yeah I can't I can't play it most of the casinos in Vegas I don't know what do you play I play every table game poker I don't really play so much I play for fun and like now like sometimes they invite me to like celebrity mm-hm poker things I beat actually all the UFC you guys I'd beat Chuck Liddell I beat fuck I can't think of the guy's name right now what is it about why are you so good at this why are you so good at card games oh I think to answer your question I think it's because I'm really good at also pulling out you know like no I'm not even joking like I'm really awesome at it like people like the amount of fun you do the fact that you haven't got a girl pregnant right now right I'm like because I'm extremely disciplined you know and I knew that I like gambling sex like drink and anything that is enjoyable is becomes an addiction right because you can be because you cannot so I it if you're an addict you want to keep doing it and you can't stop okay and then you're like in like an AAA thing going I don't know I just went into the bar to have one drink in the next thing you know and that's everyone in poker that's everyone's Vegas story right right they're like I was up and then like that's the that's why that Vegas is there because no one ever said you're the type of person actually can stop i I know that I can't stop so I hire someone to come with me to physically make me stop real yeah and I've been doing that since I was 15 you've hired someone to come gamble with you since you're I have a good eye no not from 15 to 23 I consistently lost every paycheck that you know and I would be going back from Vegas with that I I don't understand like I worked at Toys R Us for two months I made a couple hundred dollars and I was like I went to Vegas and doubled it but now I'm leaving with nothing like it was that like I had it right but why didn't I leave with it nobody leaves with it and it was just baffling I was like you can come to Vegas and win people win money here but nobody ever leaves with it what is that what the fuck is that and it's like the same thing as an alcoholic who's like I had a nice buzz going why did I have to take it to the point where I like blacked out and was puking it's like because you can't stop so I was like if I can pinpoint if I can know about myself and be honest with myself that I definitely cannot stop why don't I just hire someone to stop me I tell him look when I get to this number stop me and if I keep going grab me by my throat pick me up and so I developed this whole system of like you know pulling out and and it's it worked for a long time and it actually it helped like in every aspect of my life like so do you have this guy with you everywhere you go well I I did for a long time you know he's like let hold on let me check your balls you're not ready to come yet now he was awesome he's a Harry Kim he was like my partner we hitchhiked around the whole world together we did a show on Vice where we hitchhiked from like LA to Miami Tijuana to Alaska Beijing to Hong Kong holy Sh yeah so yeah filmed the show doing we filmed the show doing it and it's called thumbs up and yeah I mean when did what year did you do this this was years ago we probably did the first one seven years ago Wow yeah so yeah to answer your question yeah I did bring him everywhere with me and doing that allowed the both of us to like actually never grow up you know because we're like hey let's keep fucking let's keep the party going like okay let's just go to Vegas and win 20 grand and we would do it and you know that's that's around the time we met you right and Joe Harry's great he's like caddy weren't you saying like he'll he helped you right and I'll be watching him gamble and I don't have a stomach for like there's times Deb you lose 10,000 like 5,000 10,000 like I I just had to walk away but hair is so disciplined and he gives him good advice and they worked as a team so I leave couple hours later he'll come back they're just poor hundreds of thousands on beds so how does that work they tell you can't come and play in the casino anymore it's not like you're banned but they're they definitely let you know you're not welcome anymore what like they they make all kinds of things are comfortable for you Macau like a casino that is welcoming to me like and I'm not like some weird like math genius or anything my method like I could explain to you right now how to pull out right okay like you fuck a girl and when it feels good you just pull out like way before you're gonna come you know so I could sit here and like the shit with me gambling is super simple and actually having gambled in a long time because I don't need to anymore but basically it's I could explain it to you but to actually do it it's like almost impossible and I know that too that's why I have Harry with me and it's like if you go to Vegas right now because of card-counting because of all these like math nerds and shit blackjack the most max maximum bet you could ever bet on black jack is 25,000 so that's that that's a hand yeah that's to restrict you from going crazy from playing progressive you know like basically progressive is if you bet and you lose you just double it each time so you can just keep doubling forever right if you have the bankroll and you'll never lose right right I bet ten dollars I lose it there and then once you get it back you're out then you start over at $10 a grind you know and they they get you they have a bad like at half of 25 right and so the you're always ahead but I got to a point I mean Vegas the Vegas stories I got I could you know they're just like unreal like I got to a point where they got rid of that for me they would let me bet whatever I want I was betting like a quarter million a hand on blackjack so what so jesus fucking christ what does that feel like in your hands and your feet in your spinal cord it's the shemale of gambling it's like you've done everything you've done everything nothing works anymore like you know you get it you're like you've done everything you've done anal you've gotten the blowjob you know ass to mouth you don't ask mouth you've got the AIDS you got happy to play the shit and now you're like I have like I'm gonna have to eat shit it and it's been and it was progressive it was like you know every time I went to Vegas Edwyn a thousand dollars then every time I went to Vegas I won 20 grand and then so your brain goes well why couldn't you do it with the same style but with more money and as long as the casinos kept letting me raise the max bet I could keep pushing it harder and harder and the new you right now are creating gambling addicts they're listening to this like this guy's smart I'm smart too I'm gonna go out and make a living gambling fuck working here you have to risk everything you have to risk everything like you're ready like you might have to risk like everything you've worked for like your whole life so that you can win your you know you can't pussy out like if you're gonna go for it then you have to pull the trigger so how do you change the odds the odds are that the casino wins 51% of time right more plus plus is it Plus what you're not gonna you're not gonna take down Vegas you know you're gonna just stick the tip in and take and get a little bit and then it's like bail and then do it's like it's like Vegas is Goliath right and you're this tiny little speck and you're just taking little Nick's out of it so how do you you're not trying to take the house down how do you keep doing it though how do you keep putting it on the positive side I still don't understand how you overcome the 51% is the 51% a mathematical thing because they're dealing what is the 51 whatever the number is if people aren't correcting it's it's the house three yeah it's something like that it's always but it's pretty much 50/50 right baccarat is I think the best odds of any game because which ones that which ones I baccarat is like you're trying to get two natural nine a natural nine it's it's baccarat is like one of the stupidest games ever it's what James Bond plays it's a motherfucker it's it's it's the game where when you walk past it's always Chinese people writing numbers down and screaming and tearing up the cards like but basically it looks the most complicated but it's like the same thing as them flipping like there's nothing you can do you can't hit you can't stay whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen you could bet house or you can bet Baker so it's the closest to like a 50/50 kind of bet you can have your bet and so basically like I said you bet progressive every time you lose you just double it and the second you win it you just go upstairs lock it up and you just do that a couple times and then you leave and you won every time Jesus Christ you don't sit there and you go oh I'm trying to like right and you leave when the feeling is the best like like breaking it down to sex again is the best feeling after you come because after you come you just want to go to sleep the best feeling is like when you're about to come you're like you feel it coming you know I guess coming actually is coming is over it depends on if someone's robbing your balls or not yeah coming is overrated I think so well it's cuz you're pulling out all the time yeah it's been shooting loads and chicks it's a hundred times better it is like that's why everybody when you were young you were psyched when your girlfriend was on the pill like oh yeah no condos bomb blast inside of her it's the greatest feeling I'm all times I'm so much better than pulling out yeah that's that's true it's true I'm so psyched that you fucking have this like unbelievable recall with these fights Wow dj1 that fucking fight me yeah yeah that I was very close though you know the real problem is in judging there's a there's an issue in judging there's an also an issue in the way they're scoring fights at 10:00 at 10-point must system it's like what's a 10-8 round what's a 10-7 round I mean it does it is it about damage is about knockdowns is about ground control I mean I just mission it I just hate Canada that's why I was like hi Canada it's awesome I hate how could you say that we're both banned from there Canada is fucking amazing it's so fun me and Yoshi both can't go to Canada or Japan well you're both fucked Anna does this shit I'm going to Montreal and mark what are you talking abou I love it hey well they talk a little odd but they're the nicest people on earth that's for sure I love it up there man I can't I'm getting booked I think I'm doing Vancouver in March booboo so hang on and you had a whole Unitarians last night at a show would ya Canadians the shit man if I left can't America I would move to Canada for sure I would have moved to Vancouver if I was not gonna live in America I need to live in Hawaii or Vancouver I go to Hawaii yeah cuz why he's not really America no America might own that shit nah it's a little shit it's a why and I mean it's just under the umbrella of protection where that is not America that's why that's why a lot of white people go over there and have real problems because they sort of try to treat it like it's the rest of America right right it's instead of treating it like you're moving to a foreign I don't know it's its own nation man they got their own shit going on over there it should be it should be you know it should be like we have like cousin nations like Puerto Rico yeah well like Puerto Rico's like are you are you planning a Exodus out of here I tried a while ago man where we gonna go I moved to Colorado I got a house I leased it instead of buying it just cuz just the check is this managers like Fletcher's leases planes just check it out for a little bit save your money kid right save it for a rainy day you know I'm like let's buy a house in the mountains so it was on the top of a mountain my dog got eaten by a mountain lion whoa yeah that became a bit my act and if you play in a podcast drinking game drink became a bit in my act but it really was true I really did see a mountain lion in my yard I was on it was a huge piece of land we're on the top of the mountain above Boulder you're gonna solve a lot of problems with me right now his view of when was the default it was um well my daughter what my second daughter was conceived up there so it was about three years ago because I have that I have that fantasy of like fuck la fuck the traffic fuck this I just got to get away but then I realize I fuckin hate nature I have I don't know how well here's the thing I don't know the killer mountain lion now the nature is not the issue the issue is you have to understand where you're at you have to understand your environment and you have to have the resources to make your environment compatible to you right you have those resources you're not like a regular person living in the mountain riding a donkey right okay so you've got some cash you could hire someone to ply your fucking driveway you could hire someone to motion detector lights on so if there's mountain lions creeping in your backyard the lights hit them and they run away right you could you could protect yourself so then what happened with you why did you my wife kept pregnant and when you're up in the mountains it's extremely high out - we're at eighty six hundred feet above sea level right and it's hard walking up a flight of stairs right and when you get pregnant it's actually dangerous it's dangerous for the fetus it's not good so you're like gotta get out of there and yeah and she's not so good at driving in snow would you go back now fuck yeah fuck yeah I would live in maybe the city of Boulder a lot I think the city of Boulder is a better movie what was it what it right in the foothills are you from Italy no I was born in New Jersey and I grew up most of my life in Boston okay so so what is it you're just done with LA no it's just that I love LA there's a lot of LA that I love here's what I love about our life I think the coolest fucking human beings I've ever met my life lived here right you know I mean I just met you today but I think a pretty badass thanks Joe um yo she's cool as fuck these two guys are okay all my friends live here except for Stanhope all my favorite comedians live here you know Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell and Greg Bravo it's like I know so many people in LA that I love that this is where my family is it's not just where my family of people that I live with it's my family of humans that I love right they're all in LA however this is a stupid place to stay we're and if we can get all the people that I love and everybody was like listen I love you you love me let's get the fuck out of here why do we have to be in a place in this 20 million people on the fucking highway and there's nothing cool to look at the beautiful thing about Colorado to me was the natural beauty and that to me it's like it gives me a feeling that like your artwork is awesome I love your artwork because a beautiful you're very talented you're very expressive and you know just you talking to you as a human being I love I love when I meet someone and they're intelligent and you could see that intelligence expressed in a form of art Thanks and that's why people love art you know people love art because like I can't play music I don't I don't know anything about how to play any instrument at all so I love music right because it's to me like something I can't do so I watch them like wow it's amazing it's so inspirational exciting and I can take it in and almost as an infantile level what does that say about Yoshi that he doesn't he's a man that he doesn't listen to music neither does Doug Stanhope but I love him to death I love all your thing whatever its life but about it my point was but let me just finish go full circle with this is that in Colorado the natural beauty is so astounding that everywhere you look you like oh right Oh like there was this place that we used to drive we would go up to this area called Neverland and you drive through the mountains to get there right and as you're driving through the mountains like you can't even believe you're allowed to be here right you're just seeing these snow-covered peaks and these giant drop-offs and fucking trees everywhere and it's just majestic and the clouds float overhead and you realize like this is God's country right like you you are witnessing the the impact of your environment is substantial it's the idea that we should only measure things that you can fucking put on a scale that's what you're not counting in is the visual benefit you get from seeing art that's why people buy art they love art they love having it there there's also art in nature and that's that's reality if you live in a place that's boring as fuck to look at or it it's not inspirational right but when you're in Colorado and you're driving you driving up sunshine Canyon somebody loves Colorado's driving are these fucking trees and mountains like the same thing to be said about Northern California right if you go like to Humboldt drive around Humboldt Drive around the where the Sequoia National Forest is where these giant redwood trees and just like god damn like Tahoe go to Tahoe see the fucking mountains look at all those trees and the look at the giant lake and you see you take it in and I love Colorado and every spot you just named I love it too like it's I yeah it's fucking breathtaking it's beautiful upset it's just too white for too white you know god damned a lot of white people if you had a dance contest in Colorado they would call it off it's just the middle of the night they would say no one wins it's it's just completely like it just makes me I guess a little bit uncomfortable yeah you know no I could totally understand that that's why I think Hawaii it's got the natural beauty and its diverse enough where that's a good point you know in yeah that's a good point I could see that the only problem with Hawaii's its land it's locked yeah yeah it's a small piece of land there's no dude the volcanoes are an issue only on the Big Island really I mean look a volcano the real volcano issue is Yellowstone and if that motherfucker goes you're better off being on Hawaii than you are in California right so Yellowstone so then it was essentially the pregnancy that got you out of Colorado yes if she wasn't the new property Wow I don't know man no no see I grew up in Boston more in my formative years from 13 to 24 right and I had a newspaper route when I was a kid when I had a car right I was I was fighting in taekwondo tournaments all i did was deliver newspapers in the morning and then teach in the afternoon and then compete so i drove every day right so i drove in a lot of snow right so for me driving in snow was just nature I know how to handle that shit I knew what it's like to get stuck I got stuck every year right you know it didn't freak me out I've walked miles home her car was in a ditch you know because it's spun out on the highway I've done I did all that shit right when you grow up in a place like Massachusetts you you experience that fucking ruthless weather and you just you just accept it so that that ten plus years of my life is in my brain and I just pull that cartridge out and shove it in there but my wife is from Texas and when she's never driven in snow before also just like oh she doesn't know what the fuck to do when the little ass end goes right right no I know you got a spin into that shirt you got out you I know how to balance a car when it starts to slide and even then you gotta accept the fact that you can't deal with black eyes he hit black guys you're gonna crash right I have all these things in my head but to a person who's never grown up in cold weather that's a terrifying variable that you've just added to the equation but like the blood is death the blood guys get really angry when you turn at them the black Oh black eyes black eye you've never driven on like a road and the rain I was like just try to hit black guys in Colorado black eyes it's the most terrifying shit ever you're driving and then all sudden the road goes out from under you and you start spinning but ever driven on like a Northern Road in the winter no fucking day well that's that's the thing man that's why I was saying I have this like fantasy of like fucking LA and then these visions of like this post-apocalyptic like just riots and fires and I'm like just get out and then I realize I don't know shit about wilderness and nature and like learn you shouldn't learn all that shit you could learn all that shit the driving and the snow is difficult but people have done it they've moved from cow a lot of people moved from California to Boulder right after the 94 earthquake 93 earthquake yeah that's whatever we're that bigger the northern earthquake when I think your instinct is to go colder mountainous and I think mine would be to go South America I you know growing up in Boston there's I there's something that I appreciate about cold weather because it gives you a certain respect for the possibilities of Mother Nature can throw out you write on a regular basis and it sounds ridiculous to want to and put yourself through that right and when I was young I mostly was a person who sought comfort so I wanted to get out of the snow and get out of all that as much as possible and find a nice place where I could take a nap where as I've got older I realized that that is one that's one of the things that sort of steals you as a human being is overcoming adversity and dealing with difficult situations right and that I think it's it's good to know that winter's coming do you like traveling overseas yeah I don't mind it okay I don't like plane flights I like I love going to different cultures plane flights are just such a motherfucker but I love being in any new cultures so it's so interesting to me that people can develop you know on the same planet in in different areas geographically and have completely different sets of values and ideals and I love comparing their their takes on family and politics and it's fascinating to me endlessly endlessly fascinating to me that we can all exist in 2013 but be very very very different that's why ensign on the podcast last night was talking a lot about Japan right we're talking about Japanese culture and why he loves it so much and Japanese people and how how well they responded to the Fukushima incident all those people orderly in line waiting for you know for aid you know like crazy Japanese are the only ones in all of Asia that will wait in line because there's a social contract everywhere you know and I'm not saying that our culture sucks and their culture is better I'm not saying that oh I mean people get real nationalistic and really a lot of people gotten upset with me about a lot of things that I've said about America on the podcast and they say silly shit I'm not saying I'm not I don't believe I believe in hello nerd I believe in human even the concepts of nations and in that sense I love the concept of America more than any nation in the world other than the military industrial complex I don't know remember that when earthquake was 93 94 but people surprised me they were helping each other yeah when I mean they were amazing the people that were usually don't like each other they set that shit aside and they were helping each other I was listening to a lecture on this there's something funny about the complexities of human behavior and emotions it's like it's like you know and people are like hey how come is it possible or we not can we not be happy and sad at the same time right yeah so the the earthquake happened right yeah and it just shook the shit out of my house like my cousin almost got flattened by like this giant dresser right and I lived on the street with a lot of old people so me and my brother went and we went around the block helping all these old people turn off their gas line so that there there was an old couple trying to find their gas line with with a lighter on so so we went around the whole block and we with the flashlight and we made sure everyone had their gas line off so that you know the neighborhood wouldn't explode and then after that then we went Ludi I'm on your bucket that's been sure those four I'm on your team you did the right thing for Humanity you took advantage of a disenfranchised situation you found yourself in because of the inequities of the situation that the the different system that's what we operate under right now yeah we got to make sure everyone's alright yeah the neighborhood's cool and then go get some the inequities of the situation you find yourself in a forced you to drastic actions nothing wrong with what you did you did the right thing humanely humanitarian wise with your friends yeah good for you man that I was listening to a lecture on this very subject today on the way over here just coincidentally completely coincidentally and the guy was saying that the one of the issues that we have with modern culture and the attitude of modern society when you watch like the Kardashian show or you watch like nonsensical bullshit on TV or worse yourself in the the the sort of culture of gossip the reason for that is because we are in a situation where we have a massive abundance of resources yeah where everyone can get gas on every corner and you can go to the store of choice even if you're poor or it can afford fatty foods right so that that that that that lack of need for character and lack of need for any sort of real drastic effort to overcome your environment like everybody else all over the world allows us to get really fucking kunti right and really stupid and right a soft and lazy because we only have to do as much work as we you know we need to survive when survival is easy then your brain is left to fucking dwell on stupid shit like the Kardashians or like you know who wore this dress better or what why is this guy have a car like that I got this piece of shit you know I call it the toilet paper situation so going back to the Congo when I was in the Congo I realized a lot of places they don't have toilet paper like even in like just public restrooms and stuff and for those who don't know I need to shit a lot no no like I need to shit all the time and especially in a country like that where shit is definitely coming so I went to their version of a supermarket which was just sparse they had nothing and I was like I need a Congo in the supermarket well in Brasov Ville the city part before I went into the jungle so I went in and and you go to the section and you go where's the toilet paper and there's a toilet paper it's just there and then you're like okay it's just a thing of toilet paper and you buy it and then reflecting later on when I'm here and I go to Ralph's and I'm standing in the aisle of the toilet paper there's like 50 different brands just to apply for apply quilted scented unscented and you're just sitting there and I'm like which one should I get like which one will be feel the best on my asshole lips you know and then the next thing you realize you're like I just spent like ten minutes you know thinking about something that most people never have to like think about and you know like it's right and then you have all this extra time like yeah it makes well that's why people look down on Americans they look down on Americans who's were supposedly at the peak of the abundance pyramid right and then we're the most ridiculous as far as our consumption and our attitude towards consumerism and material possessions that we eclipse we Eclipse the rest of the world in our ridiculousness and then as evidence of that we provide to this reality television culture that is sweep the nation right and it's just more and more ridiculous attention focused on people that are completely undeserving of it and well why is that why is that coming from America well most likely because we're the ones with the most guns were the biggest bullies right whether the ones who control them the military aspect of the majority of the country the majority the world rather and because of that we the people that sit here in the balls of the dick that's fucking the world we we were weak right we're soft weak bitches that's why we appreciate character we appreciate when someone we appreciate Survivorman yeah which used to be like everyday life a hundred years ago right we appreciate a idea.this oh he goes to the fucking jungle for seven days you know dude people live in the jungle all year-round okay that's their life like we are so weak that like a day without food is what did you do that's most of the world has there's many days where you're not going to find something to eat and you're gonna get desperate and then you're gonna get some ingenuity together to find something to fucking eat right and that's how people survive to get this far along the evolutionary food chain in the first place right Yoshi would you ask eating the reason why you eat an ask is you don't have to go out there and fish for a living yeah I mean Yoshi love salad you know if you were out there catching salmon all day to try to feed your family Glasgow Souplantation I got a pasta salad every all-you-can-eat pasta favorite and personally I watch those shows in Alaska where they do they build fish wheels it's these all these shows of these people live in Alaska and they just live off the land where most of them don't have any jobs right just hunting farming and catching fish and then they huddle in for the winter well they develop this thing called a fish wheel and they make it out of logs and it's huge and like a net like thing that just spins with the current it keeps rolling and as it rolls it just scoops fish out of the water and drop into a bucket well really wild and it's ingenious because they invented this up there independently in Alaska hundreds of years ago like who knows when the invention of the fish wheel was it might might have been decades whatever the fuck do I know I've been out there alaskan historian know but I'm going there with Ari Shaffir we're going there this check this out just settle down Anchorage we're on our way figuring out how to do this we're gonna do this on the day where you guys have the most salmon whatever that part of the year is cuz are you and I are you one show and then go salmon definitely figure out when the like that fishing season is or when it's close to the end yeah because that trip that if I show the thumbs up when I hitchhike from Tijuana to Alaska when we got to Alaska this do you think that they would have hot strippers in Alaska I would assume that if I was a stripper they okay and I wanted to make some real money and about ambitious I would fly to where there's no chicks and that's where last visit this is what her excerpt this is what happens in Alaska ruthless bitches these girls these ruthless bitches that are smart and ambitious and willing to go to a place where you could freeze to death you know these guys they go out on the boats for months right yeah and then they catch all these like crazy fish and crab or whatever and then they come back and they get paid like 20 grand cash or whatever and then what do they do they go straight to the strip club so these girls they figure it out to go to you know a strip club in Anchorage or whatever and so when I went the chicks are like the hottest chicks ever and none of them are from Alaska they just flew in for fishing season fucking mercenaries mercenaries I love it I love that's human ingenuity man yeah that's figuring out the fish wheel right these bitches invented a fish wheel they're like why are we wasting our time in Bismarck South Dakota we can't make a nickel when you can file an Alaska these motherfuckers have money and they're horny as shit right and you just go how many those goes turn tricks uh I have no idea people we don't have to yeah I mean these guys are like they're just they've just been around fish and other on a little tiny boat for like monster genes on they probably shoot right yeah yeah they got those slickers on and they're shooting pants they're like thick rubber and whatever I couldn't imagine what it's like to be on a boat for months with a bunch of dudes unless you were gay cuz yeah but the idea of no no sex at all for months and months at a time why am I doing this oh because I'm gonna catch crabs get the fuck out of here I'm not catching I guess I don't have that kind of time hey Joe let me ask you um I I was watching the DMT experience on Netflix and yours Oh DMT disappearing molecule yeah yeah so you've done it before oh yeah like are you done with it or you keep doing it um the real problems that discussion okay is that DMT is I did it for the first time incredibly illegal and when you start talking about continuing to do all right and people go where are you getting this right if anybody finds anybody well it just became illegal right no it's been illegal for it was made illegal and the sweeping act of I think it was 1970 in a psychedelics Act but what's interesting is that five Meo DMT which is look just as powerful I think we gram for gram it's more potent than n and dimethyl treat DMT is dimethyltryptamine right this 5mi oh shit used to be legal we used to buy it on the Internet whoa spill buy like a bucket of it for like it wasn't that much well and you only need like a pinch of that stuff and you get blasted to the center of the universe yeah so while marijuana was illegal or I could order DMT online right like the first time I did DMT I did five Meo and I did it with a bunch of friends and one of them ordered it online he ordered it Wow he brought it over my house and he had like a fucking container this shit we're like where'd you get this because I got it online like you can just buy it online and is it real and he smoked it and got blasted to the center of the universe and I was like okay am i next and we all sat around on my couch and we I had a remote control for the lights uh-huh and we would hit it and then there was like four of us in the room it would hit it and then when the guy took a hit boom I would hit the lights the lights would go off and like ten minutes later the next dude would hit it whoa it was pretty intense it was a really unique experience how long does it last no more than like 10 minutes that's it yeah five mirrors is Oscar no I have not done now but I'm going with well we've made plans to go Dennis McKenna wants to should take this guy with you I'll take you I did it would you do it Yosh if you go out we'll do okay were you gonna let us film at all would you want to be with us we'll film it yes please you be a part of it go on joy all right I had never done drugs my entire life I'm 36 I've never done it might want to come with us were you gonna go I don't know we're not like I think we're gonna go to Peru I went to Colombia to do it yeah and the selling point for me was the guy that was like my therapist at the time was like he's like I could tell you're like you'll have a very short attention span you get like you know bored with things very easily like you know we could make some progress with you just through like normal therapy and these kinds of things over the course of years or you can have ten years of psychotherapy in one night where you experience like all these things and I was like yeah what what is that and he told me it was ayahuasca so then I went to do it in the jungle in Columbia with him and it was exactly that I mean it was like completely like life-changing and therapeutic and ayahuasca is a in the lastly act in ours yeah you know it lasted like well I had never done anything so I lasted for me more than any other other people there but yeah I mean fuck if you took Yoshi all this fucking darkness inside of him maybe it well you know I know Yoshi I think yo she's a beautiful person he is a beautiful he had some bad circumstances as a young man yeah and he reacted to those circumstances but outside of that he's a great guy no but I when I see Yoshi I see a guy who was born into a situation that he had no control over and he reacted accordingly right the the idea of ayahuasca being like a one day fix it is kind of tricky right because it might not fix you might just freaky the fuck out and bring you back to the drawing board right and cause psychological state instability also I know I'm really dumb can you explain to me like I don't know exactly what it is okay DMT is dimethyltryptamine and it's the it's produced in a bunch of different organs we know the liver produces it the lungs produce it yeah it's an everything they believe it's also produced by the brain in a gland called the pineal gland the evidence for that is disputed it's kind of more anecdotal than ever anything but in Eastern mysticism like all of the images of the third eye or that that is the pineal gland like if you see like all these different like like deities with the glory third eye it's very surreal and that's the chemical I think they say is produced when you dream and then when you're born and when you die well during heavy REM sleep they believe your brain produces more of it and they also believe that it might be responsible for alien abductions there's a lot of theories about that because DMT is produced during REM sleep and most of the alien abduction experiences occur at night and the idea is well you're saying these people are dreaming but they know it really happened no I'm saying it doesn't mean either or just because they're having these crazy fucked up experiences doesn't mean that crazy fucked up experiences isn't a reality right it just might be an ethereal reality in some alternative dimension it's only accessible through chemicals right and that is a possibility the possibility that everything you experience look even if you experience a dream that's profound it's still an experience right what what is happening in that dream that becomes so profound that you sort of see things in a different way you're having some sort of an experience you're you're taking in information there's you know unique ones and zeros that are entering into your mind that are allowing you to form a new version of the world right well the when the drug experience under DMT which is again or you know the quicker of acting form of I know the act of contents in ayahuasca whatever that is is a very potent experience you're experiencing ill or not it's silly to judge right the idea that you can't hit it with a hammer so it's not real you can't put it on a scale so it's not can measure it with a ruler that to me is why it was life-changing because yeah I could have a dream and I'll be like oh I felt like I just dreamt yeah that I flew right yeah but like Joe saying this thing makes you actually feel like you had just flown like like so ayahuasca make it's the same thing well you know it's like people say well it wasn't real it doesn't matter it's exactly the same as if it was real that's me let's be very scientific here let's say well you were having a hallucination and that hallucination lasted in one hour and in that one hour this chemical perturbed your normal sense of visual stimulation and input to the mind and it gave you distorted perception of reality right and then let's say so let's say that's option a and then let's say option B is you took a magic fairy dust that brought you to an enchanted land that couldn't have possibly been accessed without it and in that world you commune with impossibly intelligent entities that broke down the universe for you in a way that you could understand in your brief time there and then let's look at those two things and say regardless of which one is true they both achieve the exact same result you know the exact same experience those are tastic whether it's perturbing your sense of visual input to the mind or whether it's you really go to a magic fairy land and communicate with God right the same thing happens you can make noises with your mouth and use the cultural context of written language and historical reference to sort of like put it in a position where you can explain it to a group of people that are not going to make fun of you but the reality of it is all culture aside all language aside all preconceived notions aside you have the same fucking experience so so was it life-changing for you though I got a tattoo whoa that's a DMT molecule right there all right asides from the tattoo was yeah change the way I look at the whole universe yeah me too I I sort of understand after I mean I understand first of all that I don't really understand any of it right but I understand after I did it that my whole idea of the world that I had used as a reference that I'd use is like this is this and this is that and this is the banking system and this is the government this is it became ridiculous it all became ridiculous and the idea that this could exist and I couldn't know about it right that could have been living my life it became infantile the whole the universe became infant everything sex money driving it all become you're taking the words right out of my mouth I mean it's it's it just shows you the ridiculous it's it was completely life-changing for me but here's the danger in it I think is when I start going off on him because I didn't get a tattoo of it but I'm super passionate about about it now because it did like completely like alter my vision of how I see things is I start to sound like a maniac when I start talking about it welcome to my where and when you start talking about it and get super passionate about it you you know I'm crazy yeah but then I'm aware of the perception of like oh people Dave sounds fucking like a maniac and crazy I was talking about this weird drug and then it and then the thing about it is I did it in Colombia with like 20 other people who are these 20 other people you know it was like this trip arranged trip and it's like it's exactly who you thought they were like weird hippie type people you know the fact that this thing exists and that it only attracts these like weird like dreadlocked white people JEP fringy people when if the right people did it basically I think everyone should do it but if the right people that that didn't hearing all man that sounds like fucking crazy like hippie bullshit you know it could like literally like change the world like we could change the consciousness of the whole planet really could and that's that it sounds stupid especially coming from me because my credibility is limited me too I hope the fear factor and I do Cagefighting commentary and then I do a podcast while under the influence of the illegal drug so it's like look at all those equation only illegal federally why did you have to go to jungle do what can't you just it's illegal in the United States I didn't even know that I mean I'll get you one it is one of the most illegal drugs in the world along with marijuana which by the way the idea of schedule Mun is that it has no medical use which is hilarious because there is medical marijuana approved in California it's been proved right beyond a shadow of a doubt that it helps in a lot of different areas it helps people with cancer helps people going through chemo to get their appetite back it helps people with glaucoma by reducing inter ocular pressure it helps people with a DD the idea that there's no medical benefits of it just because it's not me and then they make a pill for it they make fucking that that THC pill that they I don't whatever the fuck it's called I didn't want to say it because I don't want anybody to buy it right it's cuz it's horseshit alright you know they make like a synthetic THC pill which doesn't have nearly the effects of a just a double cannabis that's something that we were talking about before the show was like and brownies fuck you up we don't just fuck you up because or butts weed fucks you up they fuck you up because when you eat it produces a completely different chemical in your body you when marijuana when THC is consumed in an edible form it produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolite right which is like five times more psychoactive than THC well I believe it yeah you know why that weird feeling that you get when you eat a brownie yeah but I'll never forget this man my friend Brent had a Brett rather had a challah had a company well he was trying to do in the medical marijuana movement first started he had this company whose doing was making THC pills right and I don't know what he did to fucking get this stuff into a pill form but he had this is my strong one and this is my medium one or if you gonna take the medium one only take one right like well why do you have a strong one he goes I don't know Eddie Bravo takes both of them he takes he takes Elysee if you took two strong either took two strong ones or two medium ones whatever he did I took one right and maybe an hour and a half later I was the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my entire life where I was so terrified of everything that I was looking at people and they became two-dimensional right I was like seeing their souls like peeking behind while they were talking to me we became like incredibly psychedelic like way more psychedelic than weed well and I didn't understand about the eleven hydroxy metabolite thing then I talked to my friend Todd McCormick who's this medical marijuana activist and professional natural deodorant user Brown and it's brilliant guy brilliant brilliant guy when it comes to medical marijuana he actually did time he was like one of the first guys to do time yeah for milking in California because they wouldn't let him use the term medical marijuana even though he was operating under state law all right when they bring you to court right because it's a federal trial they don't even allow you to use the term medical marijuana that term you can't say it in court what do you say you go to jail so what do you say you gotta say I grew marijuana and sold it oh and then they say well you're a criminal and then you go he said I was operating in state law shut up you can't bring up state law in a federal court and it's incredible and he and he he went up doing time but he's the perfect person he's like I could always call him he's you know he's a grower so I call him up but I know what is that why the fuck am I getting so high Oh understand you smoke weed every day no I don't like to do anything every okay I don't think you should do anything every day but when you do do you smoke like like I don't smoke weed or any of this they even eat every day I like taking days off of eating do you like fast and stuff not even fast I just drink water and take a day off and eating I've done that before you know it's like the idea here's my problem with fasting my same the same problem I have with healing all right you know like what are you talking about I'm a healer shut the fuck up you're not a healer stop you might give good massages or not a fucking healer you crazy bitch hi I was due for my I was I just started getting Rolfing done Noah Rolfing done it's like super painful deep tissue massage okay and I I read a bunch of different websites I was looking for someone who does Rolfing in the LA area and I read this one lady's bio and it was like I always knew from the moment I was a child that I had natural healing in my hair this is what I'm talking about Joe all this shit that like you like that's good shit but it only attracts like weird weirdos yeah well because you know there's a lot of fuckery in the world there's a lot of fun great psychics you at least jerk off every day though right me or you take days off I'm taking I've taken many days off I never took no more than 30 in a row but I'm a hard worker when it comes to that I did that once for a website project what house long took 30 days off well we just like leaking everywhere I was getting boners from hugs full-on boner boner hugs are pretty fantastic it was amazing it was like wow I'm when I first came to LA I had a girlfriend in New York and we we were kind of like on the outs when I first moved to LA and I was figuring out whether or not I should move her in with me and bring around here right and I was out here working on a TV show for like two weeks right and with by myself just living in the oakwoods apartment complex and I was on the set and this girl she said something the girl was working with and we laughed and she said Oh give me a hug and she gave me this big giant hug you came in through a bellybutton no man I got her pregnant I just the hug felt so good well I was like I got I was like I was at I was on empty and I pulled into the gas station and she filled me out like well then I realized like as a human being at that point me I was like you know my 20 so it's still pretty fucking stupid but I realized as a human being that the human touch is it's not just a luxury right that it's a staple it sustained 'fl for mental management and then if you don't have someone in your life you know of loving people in your life it's not a it's not an inconvenience it's like it's unhealthy right it's bad for your body right it's BAE there's a there was a there was something going on and again and what you can't measure it in the fucking milligrams of vitamin C or Athenian or alcohol there but there was a reaction in my body that was very real when that girl hugged me yeah I felt so much better and I'll never forget that because I'm like okay well I have to realize that this is a real this is something isn't one more thing that we can't measure or conventional terms but that it actually exists and it's tangible and its effect well I mean I come from a family of huge huggers like that's awesome my parents hug the shit out of me that's very unusual my dad my dad kisses me on my mouth that's beautiful no tongue or tongue sometimes a little bit of time especially after whiskey breath right and then in the time that I met Yoshi you know have you ever tried like you know I hug all my friends right this is the most awkward guy ever to eat Yoshi all the title but he's like yeah hug the shadows [Laughter] Jesus that lazy gentleman was a guest moment on our podcast he just came in his pants and we've had gay vblog we had gay people unconfirmed you know what I don't think we have that drawing I got a makes so much more sense yeah we need to get a gay representation oh by the way we're gonna have Melissa Etheridge on the podcast whoa yeah mrs. esteridge actually asked to be on the podcast Wow publicist contact I hope she doesn't yell at me for my cartoonish portrayal of lesbian I hope she actually likes it I like lesbians yeah she might not be this might not be a friendly visit I'm just kidding but we need more gay representation oh no she's a lesbian it's different yeah you know I always trip on the word game looks I'm good looks like check the CVS boner you just got repo'd no he's a great guy he's just very awkward with you mean awkward awkward that's just not me but that's not a very common thing in Japan you don't talk about Asians though you're your reality your situation like your family like you don't want to talk about that I told everything do you tell everybody no story what you did yeah and why you can't go back to Japan no I could go back I just can't get out you can't get out once you go back I would imagine so there's probably like why's that there's probably like a criminal record yeah what it's a little different because tell everybody would happen if you wanted to you mean this is an interesting story best story ever yeah well if you want to listen I don't know it's not a problem okay that's the only reason why I brought this up because I know you're pretty adamant about expressing yourself all the time about I I would say before I finished start the story that Dave was arrested in Japan September of 2003 in the same week I was in jail in LA County so I guess we were meant to meet each other but they apart 10 years ago said this come in September we're in jail Oh someone sounds like a stalker exactly what I would send Dave email if I was trying to get him to get me pregnant so what's your tell us your story so I got an email in August 2003 from my cousin basically my writing scale in Japanese not good so he's wrote in English he basically could roll pop-up dead that's their nice what my father was dead but they didn't know how to write in English so that's the only thing they wrote and I called him and find out my dad supposed to killed himself so wedding a couple days I flew back to Japan and find out what happened because I saw him six month before early 2003 I find out that my stepmother was cheating on my dad before marriage during marriage and they're trying to they're in process getting divorce but my dad can't himself later on we don't know for sure he commits suicide or my stepmother have something to do with his death we don't know but during the funeral I saw my stepmother kill him you think she killed I think so why do you think that the more I hear this story she sounds like my my cousin's older brother in Korea she was living in Korea my stepmother so my cousin's older brother lives in Korea their version FBI they've checked the background and my stepmother flew in the day before the last time they saw my dad I like doesn't mean that he killed her but she lies she killed him yeah she say that she wasn't in Japan the whole time and we find out she lied she lied about that well if you lied about that that's that that kind of guilt lying about where you were is very suspicious yeah so doesn't mean she didn't die how did he die um hanging so I went to police station saw the picture and he was in the hot Sun for like two weeks so he it was dark I mean it looked like he's hanging outside inside but that summertime Japan is so hot and humid decomposing this is this is how I met Yoshi he told this was the joke it was the darkest joke I've ever heard of my life what did I say I'm high I'm like I tell the joke it's awful it's not a joke I just say you know he was darkening and nigger or whatever but uh yo that is not a dark joke or even a good one but but racial slurs the are Kurd then Bobby Lee's balls yes so Bobby Lee have dark balls yeah there's black balls um I can't uh I can't approve without that joke you don't say that on stage dude yeah he did he did I was like this guy's crazy he's like that's ridiculous that's how you ended your acting that's a good way to get your ass kicked not yet but I'm gonna have but basically he had been hanging and he turned black yeah so he was hanging and basically the heat of the house just yeah slowly cooked him yeah I mean I saw the picture the cop told me I highly recommend you don't look at the picture but I needed to see you know because after his death my family family told me that all the horrible things that were have so do you think that she could have possibly driven him to do that dad for sure 100% yeah yeah she lived hundreds of thousands of dead and he she told my dad that she brought one of her cousin from Korea we later on find out it was her lover the whole time so while my dad was working she was fucking this guy pretending to be her cousin whatever just a whole humiliation debt and all this stuff and like was she younger ten years younger but are you sure she wasn't just fucking her cousin this is why guy like David should be afraid of marriage okay never ever never fuck someone where you're confused as to why they're fucking you never the reality is and then the natural law you shouldn't get you should get your shit together first but so so so that happens yeah when you do that man people start to resent you you ever see like a famous dude with a trophy wife and the trophy wife fucking hates being there yeah you know and you see that that that's a that's a sketchy situation yeah I've watched as dude I've watched his white belt yell at him and shit and and he's like like this sort of miniscule famous guy he's a small guy and you know the wife was yelling at my heart company had just he's just absorbed it and dealt with it right and it was really it really fucked me up because this guy's really famous and I was like yeah doing man while in this person abused you this is this fucking shitty person in your life is treating you like that what because she's not impressed with you like what is it yeah I'll tell you why some people made 100 and fucking 30 pounds and she was 6 foot tall and hot as fuck and she really wanted to get fucked by giant black yeah mandingo two giant mandingo Orca so and maybe like what a guy every like the abuse 20 guys an old guy and he's got this hot young chippy and there's no washes with him yeah she's fucking stealing from you man yeah so what happened so I went back to the funeral and somehow she was she didn't know my temperament because my dad's very kind a nice person he's never hit me before but I have temperament from my mother she was you know she was typical Korean women very aggressive you know so I caught her at the funeral by herself preparing the funeral thing for my dad right it was like way up a hill yeah way up in the hill rest of the family down the hill in parking lot they didn't know what's going on so basically I went up to with my aunt and my aunt soul my stepmother and she goes you kill my fucking brother you fucking bitch he leaves it was me and her and everyone knows at this point that she was cheating on him the whole time oh yeah everybody knows she's oldest what she even tried to poison my dad so next thing you know she tried to poison yeah they took the same way yeah you know those Korean dish kimchi or whatever she brought from Korea my dad keep getting sick so they took all the food from refrigerator it's a medical lab they check and there was poison in the dish alright so your stepmom is poisoning his kimchi mm-hmm and anything on and cheating on him and the whole family knows that she has the fucking balls to go to the funeral well she was playing this thing she didn't know anything about me and her older sister have a reputation of marrying a buncha guy and the old Hina mysterious circumstance oh so grab a history or they have a history of that her older sister does this yeah I can thing this sounds like it's crazy it's fucking insane so my answer you fucking bitch you killed my brother she left and then then 10 seconds later I just started running over and just beating the shit out of her and whoa I grabbed back of her head and start punching their face for a long time and put her in she's unconscious no but she was shocked because she didn't hejdå in me to do that and I was a little surprised because I didn't plan to do that I was angry but anything she was dumb enough to be separated by the rest of her family but she was arrested she was by herself you were by herself no one's anywhere near no one near and then stuff grabbed her back of her head and just start beating her face in and put on her ground in a stomping between her legs for like I ball was a lob their pussy yeah stomach in her face or eyeball as well to come out I was stamping her face like after five or six time and I heard some lady that worked at the cemetery screamed that is like kind of I saw that I was stomping on this lady and started screaming so how much damage did you do to her I think if I did it like my cousin called me in like week later and he was actually he was laughing the feeling like yeah if you did it for another men you probably killed her or whatever she ended up going to put a hospital for like two and a half three months but that snapped him out of it the lady screaming so then he ran back down the hill that's true and then like like everyone's like what the fuck's going on and he like grabbed his cousin's car keys no no yes I went down and my stepmothers nephew was walking up the stairs he didn't what's going on so I started coming down and he doesn't know what's going on so I figured by then I would be one person what different doesn't make a fire soul this guy go people this this funeral was how long after Japan but like when you got off the plane and went straight to the funeral right a day after yeah so this guy gets to Japan goes to a funeral and then just starts punching people and then like so you attacked him as well for what reason just because you guys I feel related to her related to her and like what difference does it make if I walk everybody at this point yeah it's like porn starts like what difference does it make you feel will fuck one hooker or 500 once you do one it's really interesting you're using attempted murder and connect it to gangbang yeah well oh yo she kills hookers all the time No kills him with his aides so the oedipal a dear attaboy so I went down the stairs I saw him I sucker punch him he doesn't know what's going on oh my god and there was a little little bad for that no not at all but he I wish I want to do with it I know by was just angry with her and her family right but I mean her family's just people yeah you know a family of poisoning poisonous Pete well you know I mean maybe they don't know what the fuck does yeah right at the time I didn't I wasn't really rational I was just so I sucker-punching he went down and most of these eight you know I'm six foot one most of these people like five one five two right so even though I'm not a physically imposed in America I'm pretty big in Japan you can and yeah I'm Anderson Silva when it comes to fighting and beating up old women but so how old was she when you did this to her fifty five or something oh holy shit she killed his dad man oh I understand listen there's no I lost my fucking my I uh listen I would have killed her i I'm stomping on chick for five times she's dead I don't know how the fuck your pussy stomps allowed her to live so he not he knocks the nephew out I got this list on something to joke about by the way ladies and gentlemen you're right if you're outraged listen to this like I can't believe I got that little mallet where Buddhists scoop the water who cleaned the symmetry I grabbed that step just beat him up but I had a couple times ran down the parking lot and so that my stepmothers older sister and her and her husband I think I started sucker punch him to its punching everybody yeah punch bowl how's your endurance at this point getting winded yeah I wish I would have stretch before that wasn't people Joe I don't I don't know anything about martial art I don't know it was unplanned you beat all these people up how do you get out of the country like cease oh my shit Mike my aunt yo she ate she's the only one when he started finding me back she's the one she had a cancer brain cancer actually but she's the one that you know uh interrupt a fight stop punching him and just told me to leave and I told my cousin to drive me out of there and he wasn't sure because he wanna see your punch come true no no I think he hesitated because he doesn't wanna a somebody who did criminal right but I he's smaller than I am so if you don't think I'm gonna beat the shit out of it well we got on his car he's driving out of there and I went to Osaka international he just got to Japan yeah like a day before and then he would and beat everyone up and then he's hiding you got right to the airport I grabbed his cellphone and called the airline's changed my flight I'm praying there's gonna fly within four hours and there just happened to be one in four hours so I went over there but that was the longest full hours Airport because I figure she'll call the police just hid in the bathroom what happened had they not call the police they never even occurred to them because they were so worried about her they went to hospital with her probably didn't know where you went they figure they figured I was hiding somebody one of my cousins how do you think that they knew that she was guilty to everybody know how did you find out it was your aunt that told you right yeah it was her trying to poison him huh yeah your aunt told you what did she say I think they have a medical record someone this whole time yeah yeah but it doesn't mean she tried to kill him oh no she tried to kill him because of the poisoning no that's pretty definitive yeah and they did a medical lab I don't know how they figure out poison but they took it to LA never eat kimchi at Yoshi's house kimchi in general is pretty strong and yeah I love kimchi kimchi at Yoshi's house gonna taste a little weird don't eat that shit damn so you escaped Japan yeah and there criminal charges pressed against here's a weird thing mostly comps in Japan don't wanna be part of like family dispute technically she's still my family so whenever there's a family I did should be a rather there's even fucking head stomping well generally speaking but I don't want to go back to Japan find out so we remember you and I think Jody's ideas ask me like to go what you in trance like I would love to do it but I was little worried maybe soon as I land there's a Ricker of it and put me in jail there could be might be seen I could get in but most likely I can't get out Dave cannot get in that's a different why can you not get in oh I want to Joe they're a few years ago would you go to jail therefore I beat up undercover security guard what happened well it's sort of that's sort of like Yoshi said like I'm not a huge guy over here but over there like I'm sort of the Henderson Silva yeah what what happened over there uh you know it's I could talk about this for like hours and hours but basically I I in much of the same way where I helped you know the old people during the earthquake turn their gas off and then went looting like have a you know I had a troubled past where you know this is before I got like seriously into gambling like I spent most of my childhood like just like fighting and getting into all kinds of trouble and doing like small-time criminal kind of activities and stuff and so when I went to Japan where it was like the society based on like honor and like you know the light turns red and then everyone stops walking and I was like whoa this is fucking crazy like they like don't even have locks on their bicycles because who would steal a bike that's not your property like right it's crazy like you could literally go to Japan and just get on someone's bike you just I was like this is fucking nuts so that's what I did I'd go to Japan I'd steal some guy's bike and I'd go out all night spray-painting graffiti on everything because like and I would just do it in broad daylight like no one would stop me you know and then at the end of the day I just go bring the bike back and so you know my art was getting a lot of recognition out there at the time so I was going out there like once a year twice a year you know stealing bikes sealing bikes through the community stealing shit like just just causing you know you know damage and chaos in general right yeah that's one thing when we were in Japan some guy was telling me about like the same kind of thing like you could tell these girls anything they'll believe you because your lies to them so like you can tell them like that you're super famous rock star right and you kind of felt bad about it you know like you felt after Bryan's fifth story I'm not really Ironman Wow so you got arrested for doing well yeah I'm you know I definitely deserve I mean it was the best thing that could happen to me else my life in general was getting out of control and going to jail was probably the best thing dude you you guys both are

which was that movie so after I got to know Yoshi you know what a degenerate he is he's like hey Dave they're filming the first asian-american porn where the whole cast is Asian and I was like well that's pretty like groundbreaking you know there's no like like it's gay to know what I guess when you jerk off to porn like I've watched so much porn I could recognize the guy's penis now yeah yeah and you know you've seen enough there's not that many guys so you start to recognize the guys yeah so can you name a agen male porn star no yeah there isn't any right so yo she told me about it and then we went yeah we went and went to the set of the the first day and it was it was based on a weird Japanese poet or someone some chick that like cuts off her lover's penis oh yeah it was very sorry yeah it's the Dannette star and also was the star in that so we hit it off right away and yeah that's how I met also through Yoshi and that was like the first time that was the first like she just got married yes yes got married yeah dude trust me that's all like what kind of a deal is that well it's to another porn star yeah so okay but you know she was the she was one of the first like women that I met that I was like genuinely interested in after my seven year long relationship so I met her on that set and then I'm like this chick is fucking rad like she'll just like talk about anything and how she has to like wash your butthole out and it's just like not in a gross way and it's very refreshing to meet someone that's like so open and honest about everything she's very funny to find synchronicity and the the word dvd-a essay when you're doing a show with aza Kira yeah gold I mean it sounds like David and aza phonetic do you know guys fanatically right but it's actual double double double vaginal double anal that's the website ladies and gentlemen double vaginal double anal sensitive artist if you can't find it go fuck yourself great podcast we don't want you to find it it's one of the very few podcast that I actually listen to I love it yeah man it's podcasts have made me hate a lot of people that I used to not find annoying I fucking listen to their podcast and I want to fucking throw them off the mountain the story of how you first met Yoshi is one of my favorite stories I think is on the first episode of DVD si and just your your how you do his voice is so much better so Yoshi we're gonna bring you out of this funk but prepare for a fucking avalanche of hate mail from people don't like dudes stomping women to death especially when they're in their 50s on ously if anyone out there wants to sit here and read Yoshi think about if there was a person out there that like did your family wrong and what you would do to them especially kill your dad yeah I mean you don't know if she did but at the very least she tried the very least she tried to poison but then here's the flipside to that are you mad at your dad for like allowing a woman like that absolutely the power I was really angry with go what you're doing by partnering up with slots is an excellent move because much like getting inoculation shots it protects you from other sluts being so mystical that they could take over your life you know when a girl will try to move in and like offer you pussy to try to like control your financial empire your Blake pitch right I know where I can get some pussy yeah I'm gonna stop that we're dealing with quantities and qualities we're dealing with a commodities market here now yeah I mean it's it's it's unbelievable David someday you're gonna

many more whoever's in town the idea of the ice house I'll call Fitzsimmons to see if he's around the idea the ice house is we just try to put on shows there where we fuck around have a good time we use it as sort of a workout room it's the last time I did it I came out with like 20 minutes of new material you guys these shows are fucking amazing they're so fun to do and it's one of the best comedy environments on the planet Earth it's a club that's been around since 1960 and it's just like I can't say enough good things about the staff or the the owner Bob he's the coolest motherfucker ever and to me it's really important to support places like this because they're very fragile there's not a lot of money and owning a comedy club and I want to help these people that think about bailing out all right go to desk law TV and you can pick up one of these fucking bad-ass t-shirts design very own prayin headband and there's two different versions of it there's this one that is my favorite cat and then there's that one which I also like the design on but you can't buy that one anymore so you could probably get that shit on eBay you should just make more of those make more of that so at the whole point is that the point sucks the point sucks up the delicious syphilis lid ridden cock good night folks we will see you tomorrow most likely with Aubree Marcus I'm going to try
