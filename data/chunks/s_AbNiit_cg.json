hello freak bitches so this VidCon thing that you want to would who puts this together Hank and John Green and who are they the vlogbrothers they're famous youtubers and I find it very interesting when Anita was calling me a shithead and garbage human that's a direct violation of that code of conduct and did I do anything about it no and I because she's a feminist because she's a woman oh because she gets special if I just use any psyches and why do you get special treatment because at this point she's basically become the avatar of feminism if she fails as real though I swear to God enamel I mean is she respected in that world no no everyone hates her why did they still proper up because she's a neat Sarkisian I shall get as many cents for ironing Watson there's a mythos that's built up around her and it word yes it's um and they've all propped her on the wall propped her up they've all said good things about her they've all defended her and if it turns out that she is in fact an abuser which she did according to the VidCon code of conduct which what is the code of conduct oh I can't remember it with a baton but I read on a video it's one of my latest videos and it was just a quick message to Hank and John Green and I know that thousands of people email them saying hey look she did violate your code of conduct from a position of institutional privilege at VidCon she was on the panel I didn't have a microphone she had a microphone she's calling me names she's accusing me of things that aren't true she and she was doing that while you were in the audience directly looking me in the eye and it was like okay that's fine but that's not right and they've done nothing they have done nothing they've said not to talk and then I found it and then afterwards all I got from her fans and I mean like you know hundreds and hundreds of messages all and I just retweeted them all night with exactly the same language she uses when she's displaying all most of the nasty messages I'm getting of people calling me a garbage human which is what she called me and so she has done absolutely nothing different and so I said right Hank and John she's violated your code of conduct her fans she's incited sudden mob perfer asses exactly as she claims I do but she has actually done this then on the Saturday she was due to be on a panel about cyber harassment see but it can't be harassment when she's a woman and you're a man because you are the oppressor so it's the same thing as racism black person being ratio into white person you know possible the only reason to do this then to not to take no action right is if you are highly ideological and interesting so you feel like they're Heidi I highly idealized only incredibly biased but why are they if they're YouTube stars I mean aren't they like don't understand that the very programs very progress so you're fairly progressive tune on the liberal I'm not progressed what is the difference you know level a little ones Corazon tunes here progressive ones closer Malcolm when I was little I told my dad I was like can we get rid of the apostrophe I was young I was like 12 and he was like huh and I was like it's just a sucks like I feel like like what is it like people always mispronounce and he's like you should be proud of that and I was like I'm not and then and then and then I remember thinking I'm not it's just the only 13 that's rough yeah and then and then and then I started to like it you know cuz I'm like yeah I guess it is my name fuck it you know but when I was little I wanted to chamber I remember asking my parents if I could I mean this is embarrassing actually I remember telling my parents that I wanted to change my name to - Damien Monroe no yes and we are that's year I now want to change Apple name Chris D'Elia - Damien Damien Monroe imagine imagine if my name was Damien Monroe you would have hated me immediately no I wouldn't mind watchin yeah but Dana Theo von no those good tensions name ever my name is Theodore Theodore von but think about him but think about this is why you didn't even know why why I wanted what everybody there know because this is so embarrassing and whatever but okay cuz Damien was is the devil right Hey and then Marilyn Monroe was like pure in my head I was like you have both so this was like a showbiz name I don't know I didn't get very far with it I will do it this time yeah same age like young when I was a black Acoma I imagined a mass of Damien Moreau oh my god imagine now I would hate that hilarious I'm you all do stupid things as a kid I didn't get to die obvious my parents would have let me do that thank God I was a fucking weirdo man I would ask my parents I would I would ask mentors because I always sat like this at the dinner table and I asked him I was like I was like can you call me crazy legs ha ha ha ha and I remember thinking like oh like that would be cool like if my family call me crazy later hey it's Damien Crazylegs Monroe go ahead yeah and then they were like and my dad was like no and I was like but just like maybe just at least at the dinner table I remember saying that and you would be like I'm not fucking calling you crazy legs you need to Kris oh my god so funny kid shit that was even younger the Crazy Legs thing was I was a boy like 9 I have never had anyone really try to pick a fight with me I had a guy at a concert 1 so I get all get all butthurt about me not letting him passing between me and this girl they were standing with me because people kept trying to cut through to get that anthrax and he wanted to get and I'm just like fuck this why do people keep trying to walk between us like Jesus just go around right so eventually I'm like now I'm not letting anybody by so I got my elbows out and people would bump into it and then go go around well this guy he just kept going kept tapping it's like fuck you dude I'm sitting here with a girl go away he was trying to get between you and your girl and so eventually you're like a dick rub like maybe I mean if he asked nicely maybe he would have got one well I don't know it's a bold ask but you know what though fortune favors the bold and I'm a kind human being maybe he didn't want me to rub his dick but that's what he would have got you really got that too like oh you're giving you takes her so the guy comes around he finally goes around us and then he's just he looks at me he's like hey man I was trying to get through and I go look I'm standing with this girl like you know yeah throw some what you just go around and he's getting out he's get pissed about it because I'm dismissing him you know I was like just you know its scope let's walk away now that gets his fucking close up he's all mad he's looking to me like you this and that I started laughing at him I go oh you want to you want to scrap because you can't get through here is that is that it is this what you want to do and you just like well well I go okay okay we'll just move on Oh fucking chest up even bigger and it's just like he looks like he's gonna walk away whatever I'm saying all right you know okay do your own thing he's like who he's just getting even more worked up and fighting points his finger out and I'm laughing at him and the girl who uh who was I did jujitsu in with a fighter she reaches out and grabs the whole this guy's wrist and pulls his hand out she's like don't you don't want to do that and then he looked at her he looks at me and I'm just smiling and he pulls his hand back and I go I know what must have gone through his head is just like this girl's grip is serious and she's telling me don't fucking do it it's probably a good idea not to fucking do it probably exactly but other times there have been like you know I'm not impervious to getting in the mood and so sometimes I've been out and about and someone's being a dickhead and I see it and it's like okay this guy's he's clearly trying to egg something on somehow and so maybe I you know add a little something to that seeing if he'll if he'll uh he'll bite and just what happened you know or I've had some people too old yeah of course I was going to fight you then who you are I'm like are you fucking kidding me I'm some sort of d-list celebrity nobody knows who the fuck I am so get away with a lot I think and the thing is if a guy knew how to fight who would know who you are or forgot as a fan of fighting he would know sure and those guys would be way less likely to pick a fight in the first there was one dude who is at this bar in Fullerton and he's being just belligerent he's being an asshole in this place and and my buddy hammer he was the door guy at the time and this other and they're like come on and he's this guy's fucking getting all riled up and I'm standing there with hammer and just looking at this dude and eventually the other torque high comes over he's like hey you fucking dumbass you're wearing the fucking t-shirt of that guy right there so maybe you might want to shut the fuck up and so this guy's wearing one of my affliction shirts and the guy looks at the shirt he looked at me like Oh this is stupid haha getting your ass kicked because you picked a fight with a guy whose shirt you have on like you you you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt and you can [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
