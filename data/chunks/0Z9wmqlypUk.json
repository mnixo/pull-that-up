is it recording yes okay beautiful yeah we always have these things where it's three hours and white goddammit we can you know at least you don't have a 30 or 60 minute show they have to put your commercials in the middle and everything but by the way I'll give a plug for Legal Zoom that when I first came to California took me two days in a law library to get up to speed so I could write my will and I was glad to see that there's still a discount with Rogan cuz that's my project this month is to renew my will and you know I've known about Legal Zoom for a long time and it's a really good group that's another thing that I think the internet sort of made a lot easier sort of finding out what your rights are oh you know what how the law lawyers mainly know how to use the library and have their secretaries type of policies things you know because they got goebbeis and so LegalZoom can take care of probably 95% of all yours how did you go from being a lawyer to run a computer company well I was as practicing law in Houston and we had primarily a business law My partner and I owned a title insurance company and we were doing news in the heyday in Houston when the savings and loan thing was going on but one day our main client came in and he had a big construction company and he wanted to sue one of his subcontractors and you know I looked at all things said well Jim you know you can file a lawsuit but you're not gonna win because he's in the right here he says oh I know that I just want to hurt him oh so I said give me just a minute I walked around to the next office to my partner I said figure out what my share of the self is worth I quit I'm going home and that was when I I just I had been building up to that because I'd been doing stuff that I didn't become a lawyer to hurt people and do stuff like that and so I just walked away from it and I got in LA involved in multi-level marketing Wow and yeah what I found out is is that if you say hey I'm a lawyer and I'm doing this people just flock to you you know I say that's a people and because you're a lawyer doing well they say well if a lawyers doing it you know it's got to be great yeah so is it like a pyramid scheme pyramid come yeah we're selling uh do it yourself at home facelifts and that's what it was it was before anybody knew about aloe vera one of the first aloe companies and it was really easy to sell we do a meeting and a bunch of people to be there and you'd paint half their face with this stuff and leave it on for like 30 minutes and take it off and it looked like they're two facing on one sides a little higher in the other it's sort of like putting what's that hemorrhoid medicine in your face preparation H yeah it just tightens you up it tightens your skin up for an hour so when you put aloe vera well no this was a whole bunch of it actually did work it did tighten up your skin and get rid of some wrinkles for the yeah oh yeah it worked for the evening for the evening yeah I wasn't proud but and and we sold a whole variety of things oh I don't like actors do that before they make movies I don't think you get this stuff anymore you can get elevate this had some powders and stuff you use a chemical thing you know what happened to Sir fuckin on people's faces no the company went out of business you know there's you know all these parking lot about these multi-level companies they they all spring from a vitamin company nutrilite i think it's called and that's where the DeVos and Van Andel it started my immature life yeah I think Emily finally bought him or something like that but what's that big one that's the big one with the leaves oh that's uh I'll think of a huge company yeah well anyhow the Herbalife Herbalife in fact one of their their first vice-president came out of this company I was in ideal incorporated but there was dear to be great and cos cot and one that the California governor campaign you know I used to know a whole lot about this and they all sprung from the same core of people at one time they all knew each other and I got involved in that for a while and we were selling all kinds of thing and then my partner and I started jewelry company and we kind of fell out and I was into computers I started a computer company it was a pyramid company and you know it was a lot of fun but you know I finally lost the faith because for a while I really believed that you could do these things you know we had a woman who was a German refugee that wound up making 20 thousand dollars a month and stuff like that and so those things did happen but they were so rare finally you know I was able to see the light well it happened after I started taking MDMA that's when I got out of the motivational business and everything and motivational business that's a slippery business it was fascinating to me people that have never been successful at business but give motivational seminars on how to be successful at business now after my computer company crash that's what I got into that's a fascinating isn't it that people would it's sort of like you know like there's comedy classes that are taught by extremely unfunny people I believe people that have never had a career as a comedian had they decided to start teaching comedy and then they started making more money teaching comedy than they ever did doing comedy itself yeah it's like a lot of that back in Boston there was a guy there was terrible comedian he was teaching the local comedy class and I was like that didn't make any like what the fuck was going on here you couldn't get a real comedian to teach a comedy class anyone have any part of it and you'd be surprised how many motivational speakers are in great depression all the time you know we really we'd go back after the thing to be over we get off stage my wife is leaving me and I'm broke and you know all these things we had more problems than our audience combined probably hilarious but you had some good ideas he just had a figure well yeah you know there so they were all you know from a hundred years ago you know there's not much new in that field it's good well Anthony Robbins is another one right Tony Robbins he's a super successful at that but what else has he done I mean you see like have a like a successful real business you know when he first came in the scene I just started kicking myself because I said gosh I was doing that and I'm better than him he's very handsome beautiful yeah yeah oh yeah he's skin he's got you has a lot more confidence than I went yeah booming voice throws karate kicks but you know eventually you kind of push yourself too then he start doing all the fire walking and stuff like that and and yeah that's firewalk hey my wife did it and did not get burned Wow the first time you could do it and knocked it burn - well no I quit I could not do it because I didn't I'm not gonna walk on fire barefoot okay but if you did you'd be alright no the whole idea is getting through Italy if I did I know I'd get through alright because I wouldn't do it unless I was sure it's gonna get through all right you could think that you are gonna be alright and not be alright well that's what happens a second time how far did she walk longer the second time I think it's probably the same really yeah yeah I don't know I mean I didn't know her then I probably think you're talking about it I get it symbolically you know but unless it's fuckery look we all know fire burns why is pine not burn because I don't believe it's gonna burn oh boy I'm not sure about that I think you might be playing games here oh you know the three laws of taking psychedelics are number one cars are real mm-hmm number two fire burns mm-hmm and number three gravity is still a law if you lift his nose three things you can't go wrong that's like the Bill Hicks joke you're the building's joke I'm not mad on acid thought he could fly jumped off the building and he's like if you thought he could fly what did he take off from the ground tomorrow yeah I remember that's so logical logical that guy was an asshole and he was a Houston guy right yeah yeah I left Houston by then when I was going to law school Houston the only celebrity I saw that wasn't a celebrity then was Glen Campbell was was singing for tips in this bar I used to go to but I I used to hang out in lightning Hopkins bar he was a black blues guy and a couple of us would go down in Houston yeah yeah it was that down in the fifth Ward somewhere yeah we'd have to go in a little group but we went regularly enough that we got known were the only white kids in there you know and so one and in he'd you know he'd wrapped with us and stuff and I said hey I can play the spoons and he said boy some spoons get up here and so I start playing the spoons while he's playing guitar you know and he he stops he says you're in law school right yeah I said yeah he says go back to law school you'll never make it as a musician oh no no he did it in a funny way in every night you know he was he was actually right I couldn't keep a beat you know Houston had two of the greatest comedians of all time come out of it Sam Kinison - yes right they had that whole Houston annex down back and then they had like a real creative group of young up-and-coming comedians and they you know they started this thing the Houston comedy outlaws and it was Hicks and Kinnison and a bunch of other guys fascinating sort of a development yeah I went to law school there in Houston and I taught sailing at Houston yacht club that's how I got there well because of Kinison they all had like this unique style that's very aggressive in your face thoughtful style of comedy break breaking things down in a very logical way you know but but making good points but also you know being like really bold about it I heard you and I think is Marc Maron talking about Kennison and yeah well that really gave me a whole new Maron has some amazing Kenaston stories when he was on this podcast he was talking about doing coke with Kennison and you know how he like was hearing voices for like a year they did something he was a young kid then when he was with him you know but she can you imagine he did so much coke he was hearing voices for a year whoa man holy break your brain Batman I was lucky I never liked coke it's like you've never tried it I the same woman that gave me MDMA for the first time gave me my first line of coke and I said oh this is awful man it's like being a dentist's office and she said oh yeah it's always like that in beginning but you know after after you know 10 12 times she'll get to like it I said you know I went through that with scotch and it's cheap and legal yeah there's weird things like caviar it's an acquired taste why would you acquire it why would you acquire something that cost $10,000 and tastes like shit yeah and if you don't like it to begin to I acquire it yeah why I acquired that it seems really silly yeah I never did the cocaine but I've had a bunch of people near me that had problems with it I always associate cocaine with a lot of negative things that I've seen but one of the biggest ones was a I was driving with some friends we were in Revere Massachusetts and there was this two-lane road that we were leaving this area that was like there was this famous place where we'd go to Kelly's roast beef and everybody would go there and get clams they had like fried clams there it's like a famous spot people travel from far and wide to go to Kelly's so we were driving back from that and there's this people behind us people beside us in this car we're doing coke and there was a girl in the backseat and they had the light the dome light on and she was doing coke and she looks over and sees us looking there and she goes like this like as they're driving by just looks at me I'm like anger and craziness fuck yeah and that's how I view coke yeah have you coke is like that lady look I was looking at her you're doing coke II of the dome light on and I'm looking at you and you're mad at me yeah I didn't do anything no I've had a few friends that got into it too far and it's it's it's devastating yeah it's another thing it's another one of those things that your body connects to chemicals and become it becomes a massive part of your life or something really strange reason I've only done meth twice oh that's a weird thing to say and and the reason I would never do it again is because it's the one drug that could hit me Wow the first time I did I didn't know what it was I was crewing for racing sailboats over New Orleans at the Mardi Gras regatta and guy that owned the boat was from Houston and I was in law school there and he wanted me to drive his boat back and trail he's on a trailer that dragon and I said I can't go back you know I'm sleepy I haven't slept in two days and he says here take this he gave me this and I drove straight through from New Orleans to Houston and I was wired you know and it was about a year later I said hey I want one more of those things and he gave it to me and I thought you know I could get really hooked on this stuff I never driver mess what truck driver ever meth yeah that's the real meth right I don't know but I never came near it again after that I've had some people got in real trouble with that to some friends what does the comedown like it's it's crash for me it was just a total crash I could once I finally came down I thought didn't go to class for a couple days you know when you were taking pure MDMA you had no crash at all I didn't not you know because nobody knew that you're I think that uh hmm the other thing is I was working at the time so maybe I was just so busy I didn't notice it but I never had to come down crash when I was in Dallas I had a big one I did it once the next day I had to perform mm-hmm I had to do a stand-up set and I went to coffee shop in the morning and I was reading a magazine I couldn't read I was like I couldn't read I couldn't couldn't stay focused long enough to get through a sentence I couldn't get through a paragraph I couldn't do it I just I did to have it in there I was like wow I am stupid as fuck I was like what's going on with my brain I didn't know about 5-htp I didn't know about supplementing afterwards try to read kickstart your brain's ability to produce serotonin and dopamine but it didn't didn't set me well I enjoyed the experience as far as like what I got out of it but I also thought this would be very dangerous because that reality of the loving warm ecstasy feeling when you're locked into it is very appealing and you could want to do that a lot and then if you wanted to do that a lot you would experience that more or enjoy it more than you would enjoy regular reality and then it would you know it's sort of like a point of diminishing returns not getting anything out of it sealed up for tolerance yeah I did more MDMA than is you know sensible and because I didn't know what I was doing see that was the problem back then nobody knew anything about it in Dallas you know and we know it's safe don't worry about it and there was just no literature there was no nothing how did he get started well the I don't know if the story ever really got out but this guy he went by the name Thomas Crown he was the he was really the mainstay although there's a guy that I'll think of his name in a minute everybody thought was the number one guy in Dallas but he was a good friend of Tim Leary and he's out here in LA and Tim Leary says here try this and that's when he found him so this is great I'm gonna take it back and he he lit up Dallas with the stuff so but I actually did a motivational speech on MDMA one time whoa about two hours after I had taken it so I was still pretty much up there and they'd pay me to do a 30-minute keynote speech at this big corporate thing yeah I was an hour into it when they finally caught me off the stage I had people on there it's one of the best talks I ever gave why they could they cut you off well it's only supposed to talk 30 minutes and after an hour they said you know that's really enough that's nobody there's only one person in the room that knew I was an MDMA it was one of the women there that actually she was one of my distributors and what did she think she couldn't believe I was gonna go on first of all Wow I did a lot of stupid stuff yeah well that sounds like nobody really knew what the hell was going on with that stuff chances you were like human guinea pigs yeah I and in that little interview I did I told about the time that well I took an weigh excessive dose what does that mean what's weigh excessive 1500 milligram what's up what's an average 120 is what is that what you should take you shouldn't that's 120 so you took 10 times yeah and I still have these two cassette - 90 minute cassette tapes that I filled up talking that whole time I've never had the courage to listen to him again but from that time for another 7 years I'd tried MDMA about 5 years ago not long after nothing happened five years after nothing happened about 7 years after I finally got MDMA to work and I only did it once a year after that and I haven't done it now and I guess 5 6 7 years but it really fried my brain now you know Oprah put this bad news information out about the holes in the brain thing and the night before a couple days before that show aired her producer was informed by maps that this is a you know totally bogus it was a lie they put out there there's no holes in the brain it was a blood flow MRI or something like that and I you know maybe I would be a genius today if I hadn't done that but it you know it didn't really fry my brain now it was so stupid I had a monster headache for three or four days and MDMA did not work again for a long long time but it didn't kill me and it didn't I don't think put holes in my brain the holes in the brain thing was what everybody said that was one of those well Oprah Oprah did that you know she had this mr add this woman and the woman knew that it wasn't a hole in her brain you know maps got ahold of it and they they really gave her all the information this is who's about blood flow or something but it was not a hole in her brain and Oprah's producer knew that going in and she still let that hit the air it's her like the Benghazi thing only didn't get busted that's so silly why it's you know why why why but you know I think they probably were trying to save people they're probably trying to like scare people off from doing and maybe in this day and age when you're dealing with something that's ultimately you know cut with a bunch of other shit now I went about it never take something that that I got at a rave or a party or something like that that you just can't trust this stuff and a lot of it's you know you don't know who's making it and we at least you know had good sources good supplies we knew who the chemist was stuff like that but today it's it's really not safe unless you're the chemist er friend of them unfortunately you know all could be fixed but in a way you don't need to you got pot yeah cannabis is really the miracle drug it you know the plant does so much things for you the hemp plant does that cannabis is really a medicinal plant it certainly is but for PTSD there's nothing like MD no MDMA you know but see that would be used with with a doctor who knows this and why and stuff like yeah now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with dancing I've danced all night on it too it's really good but dare you oh it's wonderful how old were you when you were dancing all night on MDMA I was in my 60s you were just learning yeah I'm just catching up you know you kids got ahead of me everybody there a head of us out of you there ahead of me the kids of today or they they're starting from the jump they just need to be cautious don't have to be crazy about these it's just so unfortunate when we have so many dangerous drugs that are labeled their prescription drugs they're there their dosage is clearly marked right we know about them and yet there's illegal ones that are just floating around out there and they're there in commerce there in connection there's money money is being exchanged back and forth we're taking em there's no way you can ever regulate that unless you make it legal you can't you can't yeah it is legal and then you get some kind of a structure to take care of it but then again the argument is like oh that's gonna be legal you're gonna make meth legal to start with cannabis yeah yeah and see what happens you know that oh you down for legal trucker mouth trucker mouth was legal well yeah because you could regulate it yeah but still you'd regulate it and say you know who needs it nobody still people would use it like crazy they'd be way fucked up on yeah they would go to the truck stop you know I really don't ever give much thought to those kind of things because you know I I'm not an activist and drug policy or riot and so you know mushrooms you can you can grow it home now there's a new new method to Chrome and hydrogen peroxide so you don't have to worry about all this you know sanitation stuff why and grow mushrooms and hydrogen process of YouTube videos about been out about two years now yeah 35 hours every second goes up there something like that at least right yeah yeah it's just amazing so it's across I'll tell you another thing not to try is not that it's not dangerous but you know when I first moved to Florida I know a little after that several years after I moved there and I'd lost all my connections and stuff so the word on the street was that nutmeg was very similar to MDMA and you could take some nutmeg so I got one of those little McCormick tins of nutmeg and I capped it all and I took not the big tin but the top to mean putting putting on capsules yeah and I took the whole thing at one time oh my god I got real sweaty I've got a horrible headache and today at Christmas time I can't get near the eggnog if it's got nutmeg on it because I'll throw up to this day to this day nutmeg will make me sick but I have heard of people getting high from nutmeg so what's that um that's what I heard too but well maybe you have to get the big tin but the little tin a big tin of nutmeg well 10 we just get you sick but a big team will get you well I don't know I would not try it myself because a little tin convinced me not to try it yeah there was some guys on my message board that were experimenting I've heard that I just don't believe it is that on the Arrowwood do they have trip reports and getting high on nutmeg maybe they do I don't know I know earth and fire are friends of mine and it's a release of erowid org that's the first place to go if you're gonna do a drug yeah arrow with us and spend a lot more time there than you spend doing the drug yeah erowid nutmeg let's find out they have some horrible stories about about bass all sometimes yeah when somebody asked me well what's this like well should I try this I said go to erowid and read the bad trip reports and if you can't handle a bad trip then don't go but don't read the good trip reports anybody can handle a good trip yeah there is apparently oh there's a page on Arrowwood it's all about nutmeg if I loved this arrow it provides information about psychoactive drugs to educate to reduced harms and to support much-needed policy change you know that that some of their big customers are not customers readers are DEA agent police agents they have a whole separate section for law enforcement and for parents and see they start out it's just a little database for their friends and now it's one of the most visited websites and on the net it's it's a huge so what a DEA agent what to find out more about you know the new drug will hit the streets and that's one of the first places they'll go to find out what it's about that's interesting I wonder if that's how they found out about bath salts I don't know I you know they'd find out about it on the street but to find out the trip reports wasn't you know how do we know what these kids are on what's it doing to them and what do we do - we take them to a hospital or put them in jail and yeah there's gonna come a day when people look back at this day and age and go god they were so nutty like they just made it well we're just gonna add oxygen to it and sell it you know we take this so this is illegal to get you thirty thirty years in jail for one ounce this however is exactly the same effects plus this other weird thing that it does and you can just buy it as basketballs they're gonna go why didn't they fix that why did they let that go on for years and years and years right you know it's crazy and Polly drugging is a real problem with the holidays or putting a bunch of things - yeah candy flipping well you know some of them are safer than others but a lot of the Polly drugging is going on with prescription drugs now oh that's really fuckin AMA yam of prescription drugs just with alcohol that's the scary ones you know in the original hearing for cannabis when they're going to make it illegal in 37 the only medical testimony was from the AMA and that was in favor of cannabis and they cut the guy off and threw my but the only medical testimony in scheduling it or taxing at a time what's in favor yeah we're in some weird time still it's mean it's amazing that 1937 s work you know nineteen thirty whatever it was and they made cannabis legal czar 37 yeah to this day it's still effective yeah a massive amount of couple of generations you know they just had a just get grandpa and grandma just get them and then they're gonna tell their kids and they're gonna tell their kids and everyone's gonna be scared well now there's a huge movement injury AK and geriatric geriatric medicine era wanna really and I know some one geriatric doctor who is prescribing her first patients I I've you know some anecdotal evidence of older people in nursing homes and all that they've had some marvelous things happen to them so it's it's finally getting into grandpa and grandma do wow that's amazing it's amazing after all these years people are finally starting to catch on yeah I've turned on people in their 60s that you know we're very anti drug but they are all sudden in all this pain or they're they're going through camp cancer treatments or something there you know they can't keep their food down and I say hey try this brownie you know and pretty soon from there they're going to the dispensary regularly you know especially if you live your life without it and you thought this is all it's available now at all a sudden you have this new hobby yeah you're here old you can't move around much hey you know there's something I can do here reduces inflammation to a lot of people that have like a serious problem just walking around they take some pot and it just makes you all loosey goosey there's a lot of folks that have experience in pain relief from especially if it's high in CBD s right III I use it for pain relief and actually I when I'm in pain I can't tell it I'm high when I smoke it but the pain doesn't I don't think it goes away except you just don't pay attention to it I'm really I don't know what the mechanism thinking about UFOs have you ever had any experience that when you were on any sort of a psychedelic that you felt was like some sort of a paranormal experience like a UFO experience or like being contact with something or seeing something that you you the experienced where it felt like it was a real thing yeah yeah several times mainly on ayahuasca but there was this one time that still is just crystal clear to me where there was this we are sitting in darkness you know and it appeared like there was a black curtain in front of me with just a really bright light coming out from the bottom and from back behind me this this female kind of entity is just very dark and shadowy I said what is that and this you know this could be going on in my head I admit that but to me it was real and this entity she said well that's what you are really made of that's your core do you want to see it and she reaches down and starts to pull this up and it started getting so bright I said no no no I got scared I don't know why and some of my friend said I can't believe you didn't let her pick it up no but it was it was like a message like you are this bright shining spirit behind this thing to me that was a real entity encounter of some kind so you think that that was like an interdimensional thing that you were communicating with it could have been or could have been a figment of my imagination Olymp act of what went on and what I was thinking and saying and afraid to look at my own core was kind of fascinating you know well it's also what is the source of the imagination and why is the imagination so obviously affected by different chemicals and where's the imagination come from exactly well the imagination is clearly affected by cannabis clearly also affected by caffeine clearly also affected by alcohol definitely affected by psilocybin definitely affected by many many many other things airplane glue do it you have ideas that are different than the ideas that you have if you're in a baseline and sober consciousness and the real question then becomes what exactly is imagination is imagination just a series of chemicals interacting with neurons interacting with thoughts and ideas and learned experiences because out of the imagination comes everything that everyone ever used on earth the thing that wasn't here already anything we made whether it's a phone or a television set or curtain that all came out of the imagination so the imagination isn't just something well you think things up and they well you know maybe I just imagined it nothing happens without imagination exactly the imagination is the source of every single creation it's a weird thing when you look at it that way we don't look at it as something like oh you're just imagining things that aren't really there right well you're also imagining the wheel you're also imagining internet connections you're also imagining airplanes yeah somebody had to imagine all all of that without that there's nothing without the human imagination the world would look radically different it would be a hundred percent natural and we'd be animals the imagination is the one step that takes us from animal into animal that changes its environment radically and starts to transcend itself starts to symbiotically attach itself to its own creations which coincidentally came out of the imagination the imagination created technology that like the glasses you're wearing or the watch I'm wearing or any any of the things we're talking through these microphones all of that is technology created through the imagination right shoes are yeah tech you know so when you see something and you say well maybe it was my imagination I'm not exactly sure what that means let's see I don't really care whether it's my imagination or some other multi-dimensional entity what I focus on what about what am i feeling first what's my emotional state and then what am I going to take away from this what am I going to learn and recently a podcast I put out McKenna says something to the effect of what makes us think that that the entire cosmos can be understood using the neural network of a primate he says we're here to observe and appreciate and I like that you know rather than try to figure out black or dark matter and all that that's great I'm glad people are working on it but I'm not gonna worry about it too much I'm gonna appreciate and you know look at the wonder of the world yeah look at nature it's just amazing man going on just look at all there's different varieties of insects yeah they're just freaky weird alien creatures that we just take for granted they've always been here yeah well a spider leaders we couldn't live without spiders you know Orbeez Orbeez yeah yeah that's good internal yes and there's a lot of theories about that but one of the more fascinating ones to me is that they are absolutely convinced that whether or not they can survive it or not cell phone signals are damaging bees gotta be it's it's fucking with the way they can people high powered lines and cell phone towers you don't want to live near any of those yeah well I think that high power lines has there been a direct correlation ever established between them and sicknesses between some high powered lines not the real super high frequency power lines yeah there had been in fact I know I know somebody who died of cancer quite young who lived under those for a long time and now that was anecdotal but I think there has been there have been some studies now showing because people in certain neighborhoods if sued and things like that I've been around them before where you feel them yeah it doesn't feel that weird mmm-hmm you're standing next and you look kind of feels around you we just realize like this is enough energy to kill everyone you've ever met ever instantly and it's just shooting through these wire lines well we don't know what we're doing to ourselves with all these electronic signals you know you can't get away from it there's Wi-Fi everywhere now there's no cell phones there's TV there's radio think of the information that's just in this room that we can't see right but with the right equipment we can tune into well that's what its gonna be really weird when that equipment is actually inside your brain itself yeah that's gonna be very very very very strange it's getting there to us so close you know they gave person the first ticket for wearing Google glass I saw everything I saw that you know and I think that was a valid issue of a ticket to I don't want people driving and looking at Google at the same time yeah Anette I don't like people talking on their cell phone unless they have hands-free my question is how can they prove that it's active because if you just have that thing on your eyes I don't know I can't I I think they'll beat that ticket but I think it sends a message yeah that cops don't like technology yeah well they like the technology they have it's also the other messages they like right in tickets yeah oh yeah they want to write as many as they can they have to fill quotas feeling quote is one of the most disgusting things anybody ever got away with the idea that there has to be a certain amount of crimes that are committed in a month like what if everybody agreed to only go the speed limit for like a year what would happen what the police officers just explode I mean what would they do if we all agreed that would be an interesting project in some small town if we get everybody nobody has any money that's coming in from there from speeding tickets what do they do because they rely on it you know they rely on it for a source of income there's a couple little towns in a way to Burning Man that's thats most of their income insane I mean look it's one thing if you want to ticket someone because you want to give them an incentive to slow down to make people safer that's one thing but as soon as you start developing like you have a standard amount of money you have to make every month from people you're just saying that people never improve you're just saying that people will never get better at following the law never get better at being safer and just the fact that you bank on that you have a quota that's disgusting there's there were known speed traps in Texas you know that you wouldn't go through this town because it was 15 miles an hour and 16 and get you a ticket and Connecticut's horrible this is Connecticut between Connecticut and Boston there's a lot of stretches where it's 55 fucking miles an hour in 1956 and there's nothing there it's a straight line I just want a gun it you want to get to New York between New York and Boston like three and a half hours at 55 miles an hour we're just going Jesus crying everywhere you looked some asshole disguises a tree pointing to radar at you so stupid and now when Jamie put up a picture just a moment ago but now in in Colorado they're developing this new technology to tell if someone's smoking pot and not look at these things tell if someone's smoking pot enough inside of a building for it the smell to leak outside so they have your villain this instrument that measures the amount of cannabis smell in the air on this tree and they're gonna start to give people tickets for these things you know that'll help vaporizer sales well this is in Colorado I need pot legal this is so fucking stupid are the 40% that didn't vote for it it may be that or it may just be the fact that people are just for control they're just weeds blowing everywhere like you know like tumbleweed you know like the smell of weeds just wafting through entire communities and people are catching contact ties and they've had enough but you know used to be you'd put your pot in coffee and the dogs couldn't smell it now they've trained the dogs to look for the coffee as well I don't know if this is true but a friend of mine told me that Oh what he's been doing is buying bear piss and wolf piss and sprinkling it around his tire tires and in his trunk because he says when a drug dog smells it they go crazy they forget about drugs totally and they want to go attack a bear you know well I don't know the cops do well I don't know this probably is made up but it's a great story wouldn't think would be made up I mean dogs instinctively freaked out they smell wolves yeah yeah and so beats coffee yeah that seems to make sense that's mm-hmm I wonder if they can get in trouble for like pasting wolf piss on your tires how do they prove that bring in the wolf if dog wolf is detecting device just like they have a cannabis metal detecting device but there's some some sense that a dog can't resist this you know the one scent that supposedly universally applies to all animals it brings in deer brains an elf brains and moose beaver piss really yeah beaver smell or beaver beaver estrogen whatever it is beaver scent I know a lot of young men that go after papers exactly which is interesting that term beans they don't look like a bit look if your woman's vagina looks like a beavers take her to a doctor there's something wrong it's not supposed to look like that so if you calling it a beaver why are you calling a beaver because somebody else did before right because well then the other the other idea is that it was created back when they were really hairy we don't know where the internet porn before an internet porn yeah yeah porn in the Internet I think porn got women to trim it down a little bit in the image the internet came along and it was just it was just fire through bushes pubes but apparently the the scent from the glands of beavers is the best sexual attractant for other animals never know figure yeah I don't know what that's about I mean who thought that the beavers were the stud the animal work there certainly a weird fucking animal huh I mean if you see one in real life oh yeah you know and you see they're crazy houses that they build next to the lakes where these giant little lake in the Lord and you take canoe and pipe a pedal out there and there was a big beaver dam there you could watch them and they were busiest beavers busiest beavers and their otters around there and people eat them apparently yes delete them apparently they'll taste bad I don't know I guess when people are starving to death you know I watch a lot of those Alaska shows where people live in Alaska and eat whatever they can get a hold of them a lot of people eat beaver up there they eat beaver tails to cook the beaver tail that sounds like it'd be pretty tough CLD eat a lot of seal marinade it yeah seal and beaver and you know get eat what you got to eat yeah whatever the hell you get a hold of up there probably if you didn't know what it was you'd say hey this is kind of interesting but we just can't be picky they just need a source of calories and proto protein yeah and that's that's right there you take it you know and apparently seal oil is very important for them because it's very high in calories and the cold you deal with apparently that's one of the the best the worst losses of caloric sore of calories is your body burning off calories to keep itself warm it's like one of the best ways they say to lose weight it's actually to walk around with like less jacket or less coats then you would feel comfortable with because you're not in order to keep warm is actually burning off oh that's interesting so are you gonna go hunting in Alaska no I'm going in Wisconsin I'm going our city this weekend oh wow yeah yeah what are going on I would go on Alaska too though what are you gonna after deer ah yeah there's a guy who's got a farm it's overrun with deer and he brings in people to hunt them to manage them every year because you know that the reality is as you said especially in Wisconsin a lot of them are gonna die by predator there's a lot of them we're gonna be hit by cars a lot I'm gonna freeze to death and you in order to keep the herd healthy and management you gotta you gotta fin it and you've got to be the wolf and I want to I want to try to live this entire year I want to I want to pick a time like after the first year and tried to live the entire year on game meat I think it's possible I think it's possible and if you're gonna be a meat-eater you know to know the exact source your meat I think it's probably the best the most ethical and sort of sane way to do it the disconnect between us and our food whether I love growing food in a garden and then cooking and eating the vegetables you grow I mean I think it's a beautiful thing it's an interesting connection that you have between where your food actually comes from I have chickens now and I get I get fresh eggs from the chickens and I'm trying to get closer and closer to my food if that makes any sense well we mainly organic are almost all organic but mainly vegetables we eat chicken maybe twice a month and we have a friend that slaughters his his pig once a year and and we know how it's grown and raised and everything but mainly vegetarians but all of our food most of it comes within 25 to 40 miles of our house you know that's great long one of CSA community-supported agriculture and and I do most of the cooking and so it's really fun you get this box each week then you got to figure out what you're gonna do with stuff and that's really good a lot of fun I would love that I think I've talked to my friends about that with everyone so god damn busy we'd never get anything done but the idea of getting together everybody buying in on a plot of land and then hiring someone to run that plot of land and produce food for this group of people like say get 20 people together and say well this is our grocery bill for the year if we can manage a plot of land and buy a plot of land together everybody pay for one twentieth of it or whatever and then hire someone to take care of everything and hire a few people there'd be some CSA's up here they must be I don't know there's several them in San Diego County and and we belong to this one for quite a few years now and they supply most of the local organic stores and so what we're getting is are the the tomatoes that are other heirloom they're not perfect they're in we're getting food from a farm likely to come and not everything's the same size and shape and all like that it's real it's real foods picked that day or maybe the afternoon before and it's real good fresh food but that way we don't have to get our own group together now we've gotten a bunch of people involved in this and some people don't like pomegranates or persimmons or whatever comes sometimes in the basket and so we swap around with each other there's nothing so we usually do everything so I get all the throw my idea had a bit of doomsday to it my idea right like if the shit hits the fan well you're in the survival stuff and you know you read all that - and when I was younger I was into that too but now that you know my dad my brother and my mentor all died at 63 so I'm eight years past my expiration date so you feel like it's all free time sure I'm just interested I exercise I eat well but you know I it's it's I'm not stressed about that I see the Google kids are working on longevity things now and and I just commented a friend yesterday I said you ever notice it all of this at longevity work is done by people in their 30s and 40s but but I'm here or seventies or eighties you say oh no I don't really need that I've had a lot of fun I want to have a little bit more fun but you know if you gave me you said here's a pill give you another hundred years I'd have to think long and hard about that really yeah oh yeah because you would worry about deterioration or no you're not having fun well because there's a lot of pain and watching your friends go through what they're going to have to go through everybody's going to go through love affairs that are broken and tragedies and stuff like that I just don't want to watch anymore that you know I love affairs that's the big one the best she over the edge no it's I'm thinking my grandkids now ah their hearts broken that's funny that's like we were talking about the radio lab thing earlier about the guy who went through this horrible circumcision process of becoming a runner wouldn't want his son to go through it yeah you don't want your fat your kids to go through heartbreak right my children have already gone through heartbreak now it's my grandkids and I poured and I told this one of my grandchildren I said you know if I'm not around when some young man breaks your heart I will come back and haunt him she remembers that time with the guys why is it his father doesn't want to be around her anymore well see I'm I I have four five grandchildren four girls mm-hmm if it wasn't for that I'd have a little problem with women but I have a new sensitivity to women oh I have a very good sensitivity to women too and I have three daughters but my point is that a lot of heartbreak comes from the fact that people just decide they don't want to be with you anymore it doesn't work out right and people think that when someone leaves them that they're taking something away from them they feel these deep sense of loss and they're connected to the idea par of growing as a person is realizing you're going to be okay and here's where MDMA would be really cool there's legal because when you and your partner gets the point say you know if it's bad for one person it's gonna be bad for both of them even if you're not talking about it so if you sat down got together one evening just the two of you did MDMA and talked it out now I know from personal experience that you know my marriage my previous marriage was really getting rocky when I found MDMA and we stayed together another six seven years I did yeah it really worked out because it died after that well the kids were growing with a lot of things happening but but it did extend our marriage and extend it in a really good way oh that's great and we were married 21 years and we're good friends now where there was a rocky period for a while but we've you know worked ourselves through that to where you know we both respect each other and we realized that it was not a one-way stream but you know I think that MDMA would be great for couples therapy of people when they hit that seven-year mark or whatever it is you know yeah well I think there's a lot of things that people hold in and they repress in relationships and don't communicate about and then sometimes a psychedelic journey together can open those ideas up and you start talking about things and you find out that this been a misunderstanding all along or that it could a bit of lack of communication that you could work things out much better much easier a long time ago or that you're both feeling the same way that you both want to move on you just don't know how to do it you know I've had one experience where I went on four months something was building up and finally you know got it out and she said no that's no big deal you know and it's something that had been a big deal to me for a long time and turned out if I'd just been talking about it I would have had a month of bliss instead of hell you know so communication is the key and and there are some things that help you communicate pod helps you communicate yeah and don't you think that those things and those heartaches and that's a part of what makes you a person information you have to get that information it's feedback now I wouldn't want to not have any of my heart breaks and stuff I just don't want I want to see it happen at somebody I understand and I I agree to a certain extent but I think it's very important that everybody goes through a certain amount of it just understand what it's about but it have a choice you can go through look I've had friends that have gone through it where I know they they became better people because of it right friend I went through a devastating breakup now he laughs about the idea of being stuck with that woman you know back then he thought there was no way you can live without her and I was like yeah it doesn't matter what happens to you how big the tragedy is that after some enough time passes eventually that becomes one of your funniest stories oh I doubt it oh no that's right some of these things your kid was eaten by a wolf no that's that's I'm thinking about fucking saw your family died in a plane crash and to me you know if you think about some things that happen seem to be a tragedy at the time and usually that between people you know carve I'm just talking about like breakups I'm talking about like getting fired I'm talking about things that are not really devastating getting fired is a good thing I've had that have sometimes that can turn into a good thing it can be a changing experience and change I think often times opens up the door for good yeah you know change open up the door for good because it gives you a newfound focus if you survive it you're gonna be stronger yeah every time I've liked had something happened to me where I had to rethink things that's always been a good thing oh yeah and when you get fired yeah all right what are we doing here and you all suddenly get this new motive and I realize objectively this would be a good thing for my grandkids when it happens to him I just don't want to go through with that's the part about being a grandpa I mean isn't that what they always say that the strictest parents were always like the most lenient grandparents I wasn't a strict paranoia even more so they're more lenient but yeah the idea especially when you're an older person and you've experienced so much pain and hardship and you see the innocence of children it's how beautiful it is there they don't know any racism yet they don't know any homophobia yet they don't know any blind an objective hate they don't know they don't know the disillusion of government they don't know all this right they don't know any of this yet they don't know like you know rebab you know the the rebellion against taxing and all the different aspects of society that you know bring people to this hysterical freakout point where you like this I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore I love that yeah they don't have that no they have you know you stepped on my toe they have that's my toy but relatively speaking these are big problems for them too I mean all of their little kid problems that we just have to learn how to work our way through my three-year-old has a way bigger problem with my five-year-old taking one of our toys than I have with anything in life my five-year-old takes her toy and she screams tears are flying out of her face that never happens to me so for her that's a devastating apocalypse a huge box of toys it's relative relatively speaking and you have to address it that way you have to sort of respect the fact that they actually are freaking out and although it doesn't seem normal to you you're a grown adult right but for a you've got it you got em I acknowledge that this is a real serious thing for them you know and so you gotta treat him like adults my parents didn't shut up you know this I grew up shut up shut your mouth I'll break both your legs that's a type of shit I heard I was I was really lucky I grew up like in an Aussie and Harriet family it was school it was my problem you know but my I couldn't have asked for better parents that's amazing yeah and we're look how he turned out ecstasy dealer that guy sends in the ecology deal hosting a drug podcast guys crazy what is this book that you wrote the spirit of the Internet that's that's I wrote that mm actually it's it's one of the first books that compares the Internet to a psychedelic drug speculations on the evolution of global consciousness yeah Wow look at you you fresh-faced little yeah that's a long time ago mm yeah when you wrote this in 2013 years ago I'd amazed I was the last nonfiction ever I've got a fiction book up now that's a first of a quartet I'm writing but I went to fiction because it's so much more fun do you remember sort of Graham Hancock did you do you remember when people thought that the world was gonna end in 2000 oh yeah y2k right that was a deal man see I got involved in y2k in about 1995 because we set aside millions of dollars to fix all those problems and most of the software industry did I mean there was a huge thing and the press only picked up in the you know nine months or something and we'd already spent millions of dollars and years and years of work there's specialized companies working on it and so I really didn't think anything bad was gonna happen I wouldn't want to be somewhere in an airplane right then because there were gonna be a few glitches well I didn't know I didn't think the airplane would crash I thought I could get stranded somewhere and they couldn't get my reservations oh right I wouldn't worry about the plane itself that was a fear though like air traffic controllers that their computer systems we're going to go down there was a potential for that but it was nothing like the Pressman what the fuck did they do for air traffic controllers before they were computers I ball I guess radio and I walk like in the 1960s how did they describe like how I guess it was like coming in at 30,000 feet you know 25 degrees north thing we talked them down I don't know I I'm a commercial pilot are you really but it's restricted to hot air balloons the commercial pilot misses restricted to lighter than air aircraft lighter than air I don't have a blown anymore but I used to fly balloons yeah whoa that's gotta be spooky oh they're great fun what is that like can you open a basket in your space it's it's just awesome because now it gets loud when you burn but then you when you're not burning you're just floating it's quiet and you can hear the sound you know there's no no obstruction so you can hear people talking on the ground and in Dallas there is just one track that we had taken Sunday morning because there was a woman who would lay out in her backyard but they like naked yeah and so we would come in we'd burn and then we we'd come up high so that we'd coast down in low and come over the lake and just and then we'd say good morning she jumped you know how rude yeah it was you could hear everything you know in Texas cars you'd fly over in Sunday morning you see pickup trucks with people passed out in the back of my stuff Wow would yell at them how dangerous is it though it seems like it's pretty dangerous the reason I quit is because I wasn't paying close enough attention I almost hit a power line and it scared me so much I was flying people for money and stuff you know at the time oh my god I got wrapped up in the conversation these guys were having that's my problem and I'm paying attention to them more than the flying and they didn't know we had a close call I knew we had close call how close not that close close enough I I was coming down and I didn't burn soon enough and so it takes a while to get your momentum back up and you know I cleared it by fifty feet but you know I should have cleared it by five hundred feet or something now it's coming in for a landing I guess anyhow it's scared the hell out of me and I said you know that's it how many people had died hitting power lines oh that's mainly that was happen to people in balloons not not all that many compared to the number of people flying you know it's safer than regular aircraft no are you harnessed in when you're up there oh no oh Jesus I used to sit on the edge of the basket you know and burn and really oh yeah man what if a crazy rebel wind came along and knocked you off well you wouldn't have launched if it's over ten miles an hour you wouldn't launch looks so spooky we'd go rolling my toes just sitting there looking at that video we'd go to these air shows where they bring in you know biplanes and stuff like that and for the balloons they would put up a pole in the middle of the airfield with a keys to a Cadillac or something on it and you had to go five miles away anywhere in the radius of five miles away and launch and whoever could grab the keys got the balloon well what if they collide into each other oh oh you kind of bounce off but if you're at the same altitude at least but you rules the road so you're not supposed to do that but nobody in the things I ever fluent ever got the keys but you have a bean bag too so you'd throw that whoever got closest would win money or something like that but wow it's great fun you know that my ex-wife took me on a balloon ride for my 40th birthday and on the way back I said well how much do these things cost how'd he get started and the next morning I was taking lessons yeah I had a lot of money then how much does it cost to get a balloon balloons about thirty five thousand it wasn't when I bought it yeah and how do you fold that bitch up once you're done flying well they pack into a basket that's uh no maybe a third of the size of this table why and but then you have your basket too so you have a trailer and do you have a parachute up there anything shit it's a fail no nothing nah dude I had balls I had one guy wanted to pay me to take him up in a parachute but and he want to jump out but I didn't want to do it cuz once once the guy jumps out you get so much lighter and if you're not care if you shoot up too fast you collapse the but that doesn't happen very often but they're really safe they're really saved a lot of fun and wow that sounds scary how do you lower yourself do you have to lower it naturally that the there's a hole in the top uh-huh and you have a line that goes through it and a rope pull it in bleed air out of the top and let it go and then when you're you're actually landing the top is held in by velcro and so except for the little flap that's open when you're just ready to land you rip that it called pull the top out you pull the top out and then it'll deflate and land down sometimes your landings are a little rough you know I've had landings are dragged for fifty or hundred yards or a bounce stuff no you know that that conditions sometimes make it tough and in in North Texas at the time you had to be really you know you can you're allowed to land anywhere when you're landing you know the FAA lets you because you if you if you out of fuel yeah and there was this one farm up in North Texas up by Cisco I think it was and and whenever the balloons would come in landing you can see dust coming on these gravel roads from two directions one would be this farmer with his pickup and his shotgun and the other be the sheriff to come to protect you because the farmer hated you landing on their lawn you know when ballooning started in France they they would carry a bottle of champagne to give to the farmer when they landed hey thank you for letting us land here here's the champagne when boom he started in the United States the balloonist never gave it to the landowners he drank it themselves you know champagne and propane breakfast the balloonist how rude that's why they ruined the whole thing look at this looks like Albuquerque yeah there's one in Colorado two in Colorado Springs we went to yeah the woman that taught me the balloon moved to Colorado Springs - yeah we went there to see it but there was bad weather so they never launched yeah it say you got to do it you know at sunrise and sunset you know a couple hours until after sunrise and a couple hours for sunset that's the only time the air is stable enough have you ever met anybody that was up in a balloon saw UFO no no I mean it's too early in the day plus you're looking at other things now convene what what most people like to do on their first balloon ride is pick leaves from the top of a tree Wow for some reason that's a big thrill you know so we go and skim the trees and they can pick leaves wow that's great fun it's weird that we figured out how to float float around in the sky yeah you know it's just a matter of time before we figure out how to do it with suits well you know that some jetpacks are coming around pretty good yeah well they've got guys that have those wingsuits that jump off cliffs I can I can hardly watch those videos so hard for me to watch oh there's one word guy crashes it's really hard to watch that one I haven't seen but it's just a matter of time before we figure out something with a like a wing yeah but those that technology's gonna grow I think everything's gonna grow you know I mean if they have a jetpack now and they do I watched one when I was in Denver there was my friend Willie has a klg but isn't klpga klpga the radio station had a guy come in that say that had a jetpack guy come in and he launched a jetpack in the parking lot and flew through the air for like 10 seconds you know he did it for like 10 seconds and it was like within you know X amount of years we're gonna be able to do five minutes and then you know X amount of years after that they think they're gonna figure out some sort of power source and be able to make it a viable mode of transportation but it was very complicated as far as like the control it's gotta be in the yaw and what is it called there's like two pitch pitch and yaw yeah apparently it's like it's not a simple thing to figure we didn't have to learn that to get a license for balloons because you know just up and down and he had what do they have to learn weather clouds you had we're learning about procedures with the FAA because you have to call the FAA in the morning to the weather report and all and you tell them where you're gonna launch and so they know some balloons are gonna be in the area how much different is that than a blimp can you can you target a blimp I've never been in a blimp buddy pilot one with your license oh no no it's lighter than air well hmm maybe I don't know anybody crazy enough to let me do it but I guess I guess that would be legal it's a lighter than aircraft yeah do you have to renew that license or is that once you get it you got it that's that's the crazy thing you you don't ever have to renew it but you have to have a check flight every year I think with somebody else who's a commercial pilot so all you have to do is get a friend go up take a ride with you in your current again I'm not current what was that one you just put up lady gaga and a dress that flies Lady Gaga the actual Lady Gaga yeah there's a guy it's like remote-controlled and oso is it Lady Gaga or is it a toy it's Lady Gaga I guess so Lady Gaga is in a jet pack ok here she is she's got a helmet on let me see this show us after it's over so she climbs into this fucking thing and flies around I didn't think jetpacks could be annoying there's Lady Gaga a jetpack humans we ruin everything this is so stupid she's connected by wires shut this off this is a fucking charade there's nothing really a jetpack she's all wired up and everything like that it's more like a little helicopter yeah that's for shit that's today's it's wired but you know there's been guys going to the stadium football stadiums in those jet packs yeah well there's that one guy that landed he was in the middle of a boxing match Evander Holyfield was fighting Riddick Bowe and the guy landed he had like a parachute connected to fans and he called himself like the fan I know what you remember that and they landed and it delayed the fight for like a half an hour why they had to arrest this guy bringing police and they beat the guy up and everything like that and then it sort of changed the the atmosphere of the fight because there was a big break and right all the fight nobody cool off and then had to go at it again but that was like so on as I used to walk in the bluffs down by Del Mar which her you know up maybe 30 feet or something and one day a guy came by and one of those he's a parachute had a big fan on the back and and he was hit I level with me and he said you know hello hello and he's moving very slowly yeah this is the video Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield fight and look they stop and they're like what the hell and they're looking at is boom the guy lands ringside in the crowd they should have turned Holyfield on it to him let him well they're in the middle right they has a big more important things to do they just beat the shit out of this guy though I can see why I think that guy's probably still in jail I'm surprised they didn't just reschedule the fight that's not really fair to do that it well I think people wanted a conclusion yeah it was all going on and all the money there yeah and all the money on pay-per-view as well poor fighters oh yeah you know what they should have just started it up immediately shouldn't wait a half an hour to give it a little five-minute break cut the cords just let's do this but as I think was quite a quite a break while they arrested this dummy the needy bitch that's it there's an example of a needy bitch that's they should have those fights indoors yeah I think they probably mostly do yeah very rarely hear about fights outdoor I know they do a few occasionally outside in Vegas yeah there's a big one waiting back in hordes in Africa or something I can't remember it they two more time ones they do um they do more time ones in Vegas outside well doesn't get quite as loud I think yeah but it's also your your the environment is different you're dealing with outside rain yeah weird you know I went to a king of the cage used to have these fights outside I went to a couple of them they used to have them in an Indian casino in California back when mixed martial arts was illegal in California they would hold them in this outside casino and one time they it started raining was pouring rain out and said they decided to let the fights continue in the pouring rain so these people are fighting they're slipping and they've tried to throw kicks they're falling on their ass and people are climbing on top difficult they're soaking wet it was like the crazy and they released it as a DVD I think it's called king of the cage wet and wild but it's a really insane series of fights where people are trying to fight in a torrential rainstorm people were just so nutty did you ever hear of an old long time ago wrestler named gorgeous George yes sure I saw a gorgeous George Russell my dad took me to see him in the Elgin High School gymnasium and the big deal he had long hair well it was maybe almost down to his shoulders but not quite but at that time I was huge and his and he come out in the ring in the beginning he his hair would be up and he'd take bobby pins out of his hair and throw em out to the audience I was so disappointed I didn't catch one that's so funny gorgeous jewel gorgeous George that's another thing that people would come if they came here for another plan really hitting each other like why are you watching that got to find out who's gonna win who's the champion of the world right it's this week yeah we were strange for strange floating around in balloons pretend to hit each other what a nutty race listen man it's been a lot of fun it's been great fun I'm really ours is enough really glad to get to to meet you I don't think you realize what you're doing but you you are you're filling in a role here for a lot of young people that you know you don't know how smart you are maybe you do but you're you're extremely well-read you know so much your time to Graham Hancock about stuff I read the headlines and you know all these terms about the skull and stuff like that but what you're doing is you're taking a really a high-level intellectual product to the masses into especially young people that maybe hadn't had the advantage to go to college or something and they find out hey they're as smart as anybody went to college and you're really doing a really good service with these podcasts well thank you but I'm not trying and I'm that's why it's working that's why that's why it's working I'm extremely uneducated no but you're very well-read well I read a lot of things but you know I mean what is education if not if reading but as far as like formal education and there's also as far as like I don't you know I just like what I like I'm interested in certain things and I find that there's a lot of things out there that are fascinating that people just aren't paying attention to and I think what what I see in what we talk about on the podcast is really reflected by what I see on Twitter and when I see on the internet when I see when I go to the various web sites that I visit for information I see just a massive new upsurge in curiosity right I think the people are way more curious and they ever have been before just by virtue of the fact they're getting more information they've ever done they can get it you know yeah not being held back so I think what this podcast is we came along in the right place at the right time and it was the right type of person in me that kind of can bridge a few different worlds exactly that that's what you're bridging quite a few different worlds and that's really important in the pot heads exactly I'm the bridge between media's and the pot heads we're not all that different you know it might look different but there's there's prejudice against people who you know engage in martial arts and exercise just like this prejudice against people who smoke pot and some of its justified and some of its not now there's assholes and every you know absolutely it's so it's so easy to define people because of that you know and i think that uh conversations like this and podcasts and it gives everybody a better sense you know you we're getting into people's heads because you're right in their ears you know they got the earphones on they're listening it's theater of the mind you know yeah and it's it's the old voice in them in the back of the mind that you hear yeah you know I've heard so many of your podcasts that you know I feel like I've known you all my life I feel like I've known you long time to man I'm listening on many a road trip give the introductions to all these different various psychedelic talks how many episodes do you have I just last night did 378 Wow you are on episode 419 you almost round 420 yeah yeah oh you know what we were gonna do a special 420 episode but now I'm like what that's so stupid I'm so tired of that whole 40 thing it's just like come on what is this a number the podcaster the part I mean and I'm kind of hypocritical because we always like make a big deal over each 100 that we hit but 422 seems stupid it seems like a tired thing 4:20 dude like come on I'm thinking about for 400 what I've been working on it's not too far along yet but I've I've cut out little sound bites of Makenna you know 30 to 60 second sound bites and I have about a hundred of them from a hundred different you know tocsy game and I'm going to try to spring string them together in a cut up and try to make it a single cohesive type thing it hasn't been working too well yet but it's worth a try he has one of the cool things that you do do that's kind of scary and dangerous and sacrilegious yeah you edit McKenna fucking freaking why'd you cut out the stuff about the stoned ape theory well because it's the 80th time yeah we've heard it you know I'm not a historian my job is
