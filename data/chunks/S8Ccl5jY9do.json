nice thank you thank you I want to show you a couple things on Joe and some of the things that I've been working on like I mentioned before Michael my main direction in jiu-jitsu has always been to make jiu-jitsu better in MMA in the UFC do UFC his work got me into jiu-jitsu when I thought he loved seals it that was the most amazing thing ever and then you know immediately I started doing jujitsu voices my favorite fighter anybody who did anything what you did said I was going to always been oh and then one is funny because you in one way some a lot of people that we're gonna see you as a bad boy you do see how the guys but I don't see I never saw that - I always felt like you trying to create your own routines and your own world published trying to help you Jitsu that's all it was is I I got tired of seeing like a UFC 13 15 17 times in jujitsu guys just you know I'm when Jerry Bohlander font Fabio show I was like oh no he was gonna meet up with Elena fuck Matt Hughes man that hurt so much because jiu-jitsu is my life and I thought we gotta do something to fix this especially at the bar let me let me let me show you a little bit one right you I saw him so I saw him so like just hold on like this for a second and that's what I thought oh that could be something there because generally you know people would be like you guys were doing like this with Noah's head buttons right and then the head butts came out so this became a good way to survive from the punishment so from there when I saw him so do this at home I decided to start running it all up and really can't use my legs now because with the II it's easy to control here's control the posture but harder to control the posture and your legs keep slipping down you want to go high guard so my holes my house system started becoming this kind of stuff like there's no way you can touch my there's no way and I see Chrome I can't Shinya Aoki and even my sullivan sometimes he comes here to hold you know the hold up man so the rubber guard i don't know if you heard that but it's all about just getting into this position if his arms up here but if his arms look here I'll attack this one I'll even go like this and there's no way he can hit me and there's no way he can pull out and stand up again so that became my obsession is to develop a guard where they can't get up and run away and being able to prevent him he can't elbow me right here so as I cross both these legs there's no way you can hit me is it possible so um that's that's what I develop this for jiu-jitsu and like you said the jiu-jitsu community a lot of them took that as oh he thinks he knows more than us look at him he's turning his back on Judaism the reason I dropped the key is cuz I felt that every second you grab the collar grab sleeve that's not the same fighting stance is MMA just like that you know let's loser I can't lock the game to say fuck you you Jitsu there was to hear what for MMA the gears not good yeah we have to the the fighting stance has to be the same when we track when we train grappling with no punches or with punches it has to be the same stance the same finest and so based on what again when I saw you and him so doing it had to come from that defensive posture and then Oprah so you don't get hit then the legs come up then you start attacking while you control them while you keep them from standing up and going to stand up again because that was a fight with Bobby on and day from a new UFC the UFC twenty-something we're v got a good arm under guard so if I stay for a night was a pretty good wrestler Fabiana yet could not take him down so they get it into the caves and Fabiana weekend which a full guard pull them into the start and then put the feet on the hips and to just set up for the armbar cuz that's how he does it and then date when I just stood up and just walk the let's do it again so they fought me honey hope gets up he did it five times in that fight he jumps guard and pulls him down but as soon as he opened up his legs and put his feet on the hips Dave my name intersection do it again and then David when I ended up winning so for me that's for him that's a problem because they don't have to be on top if you pull guard because you can't take the fire down he doesn't have to stay there as soon as you open the guard you're gonna get up just like Alistair Orion when he fought five thumpy Silverdome but we still pulled him in his guard but as soon as he opened it Alistair said come on I'm not gonna go down there so it became a movie okay that's a problem we're gonna have to have them in the guard if we can't wrestle oh we have to pull guard and then keep them from standing up so the clinch became in my opinion the most important thing is you got to be in the collection and not only clinch them so they don't stand up but clinch up so they don't hit you and then you have to pop offense from that clench so anytime someone will train the key and have to call it sleep that's not working on the country of course so that's like you're not working on so that's why we're seeing all these black notes they come in fire after fire all these guys American talking black the black and then when they're on their back they're not used to offense from the defense the best defensive position if they just don't ever work there they think okay I'm just gonna turn the key grab the collar grab the sleeve and then it's gonna somehow working stuff up somehow it's gonna work itself out one it doesn't work like that like if if you're practicing your fighting stance like but in a fight you have to go here it's gonna be different quote you should have been practicing like well that was my philosophy and everything I've ever done every every little tweak I've ever done did you Jitsu some people that you Jessica Nene got meaning else no one got he thinks that I'm doing it this to think that I'm the best guy and that I'm better than always yeah look he dropped the key he's betraying it's not about that keeper cause I'm talking said ball they prob what's he doing he taken off the key you gave my black Donnie because I said if I ever teach you Jitsu I'm gonna teach without the key just to do my part for MMA you can keep the game you need the training that you need to do the moon dance but so I need to focus and dedicate myself to trying to try I'm trying to improve jiu-jitsu in MMA that's all I was ever truck for jiu-jitsu not for Sambo not for wrestling I'm for striking I'm Jiu Jitsu pureblood pureblood and so that is the misconception that there is it around yeah and they're saying oh he's changing man he's he's taking moves and changing the names look that's a wrestling move the twister he calls it the twister it's actually the wrestlers guillotine oh my I be changed the move he can a judge all changed it because I would come in and say this is a guillotine I learned in wrestling and they were like there was a regular guillotine next up front headlock that's a deal so they started calling it twisting I don't know that's not the twister so then later people started saying look he changes a wrestling moving he's a fraud he's taking moves and changing them and he's making all these new purse or these positions and changing and the only names that I invent like the names that I came up with were moves or transitions that didn't have names so in my in my brain I can teach better and I could learn better with every transition every position not even if it's a submission every transition every setup has a name so that happy with my students I can get on the phone and we have a language we're talking about although otherwise if you're on the phone you're going you know that one move where you put your hand on the hip narrate what move to show a show I don't know so for me Americans like naming everything so that's what that's where the naming process came in I came up with all these crazy names these stupid names because I was not alone many sons until we came back and then my goal is to put my form over here now there's more pressure now right here very hard to do anything and I'm the next step is to come here and the hug right here and then if you're going to punch with this here I'm gonna be right here already and I'm already holding the foot and I can control right here very hard to do anything and then I'm right here yeah this is where I'm at you need flexibility and then if you try to stand up with this leg I'm gonna bigger fort here and then right here itself you'd be very hard you've got so that so that is a way to make it so that you're defensive and they can't punch you and I'm I'm actually going for the kill I'm not I'm not being defensive I'm going for the job and in my experience the bigger the got like 160 the bigger the guy is of these 185 190 Emmys a wrestler in my experience the only thing that works is to get here in time and hug sure that I'm right here this is a hold on me very hard for for anybody to do it you then once this what comes over here and then here very hard really to do in here that's the goal that's really not that hard I played this game against my top students on the day on a daily basis so the best thing for you to do is keep both your hands on the chest both of them and then yes that's that's because now you have an opportunity or maybe posture up you do it so what I want to do immediately span now you can't punch me and now you can't posture because you only can do it with one heart there chef yeah and then once I I'm at the other leg here and clear here very hard you can't punch and I can attack this arm right here I'm looking at this I can take this arm this way or I could just right here you can't defend with your right arm because I've already trapped it and then we're here this is my one online go to arm our setups we just end up here then we end the fighting from here like you survived everything and then now we're here and I'm looking to come back to hook here I'm looking to come back to here and take this or you roll and then it's a sweep because a lot of times you got that will get anything about that I'm just gonna roll and then it's a sweep and I go up and I roll with you and then I pass you guard at the same time with that roll I'm trying to drive to the neck or that our first connect the arm we'll get that out of the way papa for a moment next year I'm gonna go after that harm or bring my foot over and hold on here I'm gonna so I'm gonna try to get this hormone than that if I can't get off the or than that then there's a different things I can do here I can try to clear the neck anyways I didn't try to clue if I can't clear the neck then we could just stay here and then I could punch here until yeah he didn't keep simple yeah no he could stop people could last moose they always they want to see especially now they want to stay right here yes so here unless this comfortable to eat your spine yes yes listen this comes this is a patient a patient game so that's why I can still work from here and I can still when I would do another maze punch here until you block and then duel now we're here right so but the most important thing is to get that hat on the map before the legs come up so anytime you're here and I have the underhook that means whether I'm here or here that means all I gotta do this brings us up here and now that arm is already out of mix someone when I'm rolling I'm always looking for that overlook moly as soon as I get this Oprah hook here boom these legs that come here they're gonna be right here and then BAM right here and then because this arm so it's all comes from the over hook even from butterfly card here if I'm here butterfly card all I gotta do is release and now I'm here and then and then there's a stacking you have to be patient nothing's quick am I fail you might pull out of it but then we go back to the end I just you know sometimes pull out there sweaty just like you're trying to take him down you didn't take them down you set it up the camera try setting up dinner like Rogell it takes me four times to get him in a simple eye he's seen so much war on he'll pull out and then we not start again boom he's smashing and then he pulls out then we start again and then boom back on the fourth one boom I can't put Sun you know the bat so it's just like take down as you keep trying to take a guy down and meanwhile even though it's failing you can't get hit because the way to defend it it's the sac state type and not do anything the way to stop it it's don't punch because as soon as you punch unless it mocks me how about one put your hands already on the mat boom the best analogy that you've ever made about it is when you talk about head kicks like if you try to teach someone how to throw a head kick someone that I'm going to pick something that well you get a guy who's look like maurice smith and great kickboxer it's easy for them to kick some in there because they've done it so many times it becomes a part of their natural movement once you develop the type of guard that he has I tell everybody if you don't roll with him you don't understand what's possible once you roll with him his legs are like arms and they're moving in positions that you don't come to expect a normal training and until you experience it you don't know the possibilities I think that's the next level of MMA I think what he's doing right now is going to be you know we're seeing all these new like wheel kicks and new techniques and it's striking that's the next thing is his guard techniques I really believe it all started from watching hands out do this that's all go home that's because I was a high guard player with the key nogi the legs keep slipping the let's leave stuff so it's hard to attack so then we're like oh you just keep the leg up here all pets food is the necessity to keep the net closed yeah thinking in that manner is a really needing is a really effective but again if the guy tried to be defensive is hard for you I believe I believe you had to combine some kind of strike some kind of punishment you feel yes with our elbows maybe to create that kind of panic initially is the best objection dead it's a day out without strike so the powers here and then I love the showed here I'm holdin out okay yeah this position right here if you could make up do it on kill but if you could see this right here this all you're gonna keep it you're not going to let me have the armbar because as soon as you strengthen it's gonna be tight so all I'm gonna do is just throw elbows right the perfect angle giving him I'm keeping this tight see in this position right I call this muddy Watership you can't do anything and I have full weight on this elbow and then boom take the arm this arm is on the next this is tight so this is the position I work to get into this could take three minutes to get into but once I'm here it's over now and slowly bit by bit I have to move this elbow and it's how do you move that elbow in it's very hard I can't move it in here pop so hard he has good posture it's so wide so what I need to do is to get my fall on this side across my ankles look at how I squeeze the elbows see how it's easier and then I go back to this and then here this is my number one rule that I do all the time and then once I'm here I don't even need to bring the leg over the face I could just finish it right here if he has flexible let arms then we take that if I want to take a chance you're so interested that's stuff that I would love to show I would love to because he's already trying to it he's already flexible I think that would be very valuable in all my guys do this this is standard stuff that all I got some guys that are doing upended any time none declined the legs come up with guys are already in trouble Shinya Aoki he got he's the one who use it the most you watch any oh Jesus a very basic version of this I was in 2000 I was in Japan in 2005 and I showed a lot of stuff he'd never seen it before immediately starts using it in his fights he starts trying on everybody so just something that I would love to show Chrome I would love to I think my people this one case he's in a bad spot reflexes Lester that's on top Mike it might be an extra weapon that Nativity they were always good yes when we go to Bala thank you very much hits your patience and thanks for the boot [Music]
