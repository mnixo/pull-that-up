Pierre is our guest and he's the UFC welterweight champion the world just recently defended his title against Nick Diaz doesn't you cool it Nick now it seemed like you guys were complimentary after the fight I'm cool with him I don't know if he's cool with me I'm a guy I'm all right I'm cool with everybody that dude turns everything it's a personal affair yes he does does I never get to you when guys should talk to you because you're like if people didn't know you all right if the average person did not know what you do besides the look you know that you're physically strong they would never think you're a fighter you're a very friendly guy you're very like easy - I've seen you interact with a lot of different people over many years you're very easygoing very very nice to get along with yeah that I want to be I don't want to look like a fighter when you talk to me let's say on the phone I want to look like I know normal human being right of course yeah that's me a little bit the impression that people at some time well you're you're not just a nice guy you like you're honest about your own vulnerabilities which I've always found fascinating like you talk about what what makes you scared you talk about what you're worried about like you let you know like even this Nick dance for you like I'm scared because I don't want to lose to this guy like there's a lot of people who never admit that and yeah but it may make you think it make you stronger to admit that you're scare because you're not scared to say that you're scared right someone who's doesn't admit it because he's scared to admit that he's scary scared of himself scare of what people gonna think about him I'm not scared what people going to think they have to see me as as I am so I'm not scared to admit that I'm scared and it's almost like when you don't admit you're scared it's like you're protecting yourself from evolving because the only way you can ever be realistic about a situation get better at anything in life is you've got to accurately address what's happening true 100 by Seth you know and there's some people that don't do that and I think that cuts them off from a certain amount of progress in life I think there's a certain is there's like walls that you put up yourself because you're not willing to look at your own failures 100% you're not the you're not the honest with yourself yeah oh that's what it is I did a bit yeah so admitting your you're afraid is like so a bitch yeah you know what as much as I'm afraid I'm gonna make that walk the day of the day of the day of it and I'm gonna do it regardless with no sounds more crazy I would be more afraid of a guy that says I'm like who says like I'm afraid but you know I'm gonna still do it and I don't care if I'm afraid bring it I'll do it like this is sound crazy to me more than a guy said oh no no I'm not afraid because this guy is a lie is afraid to say these are phrases all right hangman you know what I mean to me like personally that's what it is yeah the posturing imposing its it's unnecessary exactly yeah but you are afraid of aliens though right yeah my friend does it true you have like a path mapped out in your house how to get out of the aliens show up now the room I heard you have a plan I know you like to use game plans so I feel I have I know I know karate and I know jiu-jitsu so the audience Wafaa I put a triangle troll on him and I also have a cat that have also a katana Japanese katana so if they come I can slice them apart Wow do you keep a sword in your house yes I have it's a it's a collection you know it's for me it's I have to - but not bring any crazy bitches home I've had it's a sword and crazy bitches yeah I have this knack saw on the side of my bed that I always forget is there and I was like almost got my finger off all the time and you should put it on the garage on fuck's wrong famous big sword slash meat cleaver that it's just so do you really have a fear of aliens or is this just a bullshit rumor cuz it what didn't you do a countdown show and you did a whole thing talking about how you're being scared of being abducted by aliens yeah I'm scared I'm scared of a lot of thing you know what aspect I guess I'll get I'll get into it okay I kept I can't talk about it right now idea I'm gonna talk about it now it's one thing I'm gonna come out and make a big thing about it but now I'm waiting right now yeah have you had an experience with aliens no no no no I don't believe you hahaha I don't believe you I don't know I don't know you don't know you might have had an exchange you by my manager gonna have a heart attack right now it is like my brother I would never do or lead you down any path that's bad for your career just as you said that it's good that to be afraid it's also good to be honest about everything even shit that sounds crazy no no I don't know it does the thing I'm honest and I got look I'm honest I'm afraid but I don't have to tell everything on the public it's true you don't but you know do you have an alien because you're a smart guy let me tell you you're a very smart guy you know you know dig dig into people's mind and as what I like you I hate that about you because if we have the spot right now but he's a very smart guy but now I got I got go too deep listen if I was on an alien spacecraft and I had sex with an alien like I'm assuming you did I feel like I would just come out and talk about it I don't know why you would hold that back no but I mean and I never something happened George I don't know it's either it's either I'm crazy or or or maybe it really happened but I hope that I'm crazy I don't think you're crazy I hope I am I could be pre crazy you know some people that's some great mind and you know they had they been Alison aiding stuff some people are out you say many iku depressed some people are OCD some people are there some people are dead and they're still great they've been able to achieve great stuff in their life you know so maybe I'm crazy when I was I don't know oh my open well these experiences I can help you in one way are these experiences happening at night I am not sure I'm not sure have any of these experiences happen while you've been in the dream state or were you just been dreaming or just asleep and you were woken up I am Not sure that I had expert I don't know I don't remember anything but it was there was night time type things was it nighttime when you think you might have had something happen to you I can't say something happened to me I have no proof I just don't know what I'm gonna tell you about is your brain produces a chemical while you're sleeping but I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna be honest about it sometime I'm looking at the clock and it's like I wake up and I look at the clock right after I sir and it's like the clock advanced like a four hour or two hours there is a time zone that I don't remember what happened it's called fall asleep I hope so what do you think you think you're getting snatched up and nothing going away for a couple hours no I think I'm maybe I fall asleep that's why I hope that's why I hope or I can drive I can drive my car I can drive my car and then already happen I drove I drove my car but you more often no no I drove my car in a normal day like going somewhere then I look and it's two hour pass I'm like two hour I just pass like this like maybe maybe I didn't see maybe I didn't I didn't I didn't and maybe I watched the in the wrong time like I watched my clock and I made a mistake myself right most likely right yes of course my hope I hope so what else very minor stuff that's very minor stuff yeah um but that could be you talk being tired because you push yourself and like address its exactly that's exactly what I hope so it's exactly what I hope so but you don't have any memories of great dudes putting fingers up your butt no I don't know that I've had a gel where you're driving down the street like on the highway and you're just like kind of dazed out you're like wait how long I've been I've been dazed after like a like 20 minutes whatever I've been doing for 20 minutes you can tell you autopilot yeah and then like you just realize like almost all set you're home yeah but the thing about being exhausted and sleep you know having these experiences at night they there's a chemical your brain makes that's one of the most powerful psychedelic drugs known to man so one of the things they're trying to connect it's called DMT one of the things they're trying to connect is people having near-death experiences and people that have had UFO alien abduction type experiences in this chemical and that they can introduce this chemical into the human body and these people have very similar experiences to what they had when they had a UFO encounter or when they had you know a white light near-death experience in counter it's most likely there's this chemical that's doing this so when people having these experiences they're very realistic and they do believe they're being taken aboard by you know a UFO somewhere they might not be wrong but this is not a UFO encounter this UFO it's under that the Firefly Nadja right object this the encounter you talk about that if they've been taking a board this is this difference a cake it could be a third type encounter it is there in many ways but this is different yeah but I they you talk about me I don't have any I don't have any memory of such thing but I think I neither like I have like you say sometimes I fall asleep then I wake up is the the time pass and I'm like well it's like a but that's just cuz you tired man that's not aliens yeah no no it's better you worried you like man how maybe it's aliens guys I would know no it's because I am I feel like I didn't fall dad I don't fall asleep and I'm not tired I'm wide awake awake hmm but I fell asleep like this and it's kind of I mean it's kind of these aren't hard sparring days no no just a normal day like it could happen every day we should get a GoPro like a camera and support yourself all the time everything that happens watch it I mean this thing's record for like eight hours at a time somehow yeah how long has this been going on since I'm a kid Wow Wow wouldn't it be crazy if the aliens like manufactured you to be uh lacks martial arts fighter don't let's see if we could just turn I'm sure I'm sure if it would have happened I would have been much better than this much better than this you're the fucking champion yeah but if I would be a lien manufacture I would be a Superman you know well they just want to get ridiculous with it has to be real it would be yeah that would be obvious I can't turn a guy into a goddamn superhero maybe they manufacture Anderson Silva John Jones maybe they did maybe zeldo maybe someone needs to talk to them about their sleep patterns maybe they've fallen asleep behind the wheel too and being sucked aboard spaceship for repairs maybe they don't want to talk about it maybe they don't say but maybe they are I don't know I've never presently I think it's funny though that that's maybe one subject that you you you have a you had a really hard time talking about that I do because it sounds crazy yes and I and I will talk about it one day I'm gonna talk about my fear my all that stuff and but no no I don't get deep into this yeah maybe but I promise one day I'll go oh I'll talk about stuff but it's not what you promised one day I promise one day that's that what is the difference no tomorrow didn't you see Rocky 3 when Apollo Creed says that the Rocky Balboa like you said maybe maybe I'll die one day maybe I'll night it tomorrow I hope a touch wouldn't up and people ho and I my god how did you say that it was a French touch would not die touch the the would like you say what you don't you don't want it happened you know yeah I just let it go just whatever information you got spill it nobody I don't know I'm doing my I'm doing my own research I'm researching on myself like you say that's a thing that you just told me is very interesting the chemical that body produce yes / that's / that I'm happy that I meet you today and you tell that about me because I make me make nap you know yeah it'll make you think like well I think a lot of people think they're going crazy yeah it's not it's just you brain make psychedelic drugs Israel your brain produces it in parts your liver and your lungs they don't know why this stuff is in the body but it's it's a super potent psychedelic your brain makes it and it happens when you're sleeping so if like this speculation is that it happens during REM sleep I don't think they have the most accurate way of measuring it but they know it's in the body and they believe it's that the theory is that it comes out during periods of heavy stress or when your body thinks it's going to die or in REM sleep those are the times that you have higher levels of the stuff in your neurochemical soup that's interesting that's crazy why would your brain why would your brain produce an incredibly potent psychedelic drug so a lot of people that are having these nighttime experiences it could be just varying levels of this chemical that's going around in your brain but that doesn't mean that these experiences aren't real we don't know what the fuck sleeping is anyway I mean what is sleeping you shut your eyes you shut off you don't exist in this plane and your consciousness goes somewhere else like literally you have no memory of a giant chunk of your day and we have no problem with it and yet we don't connect it to any other realm or the idea of there being other dimensions you go into another dimension when you go to sleep okay you do you just shut off you stop and for all intents and purposes you are in another dimension and if while you're in that other dimension your brain is being pumped with the psychedelic chemical that when you take it when you're sober makes you have these incredible experiences it only seems so it just seems like a normal thing to look into like people should be looking into that like what it what is what is happening when you're sleeping your sleep you go away and everybody's just so used to it they're like no big deal we just go away just go away for eight hours a day you know everybody's scared to die and no one's scared to fall asleep you're just shutting off man you know you're going to be back so you're not worried but you're shutting off whatever that is you know is just accepted if sleeping didn't exist it would be the craziest fucking thing if all of a sudden you told people they had to show for eight hours a night and just completely not be able to do it what are you talking about I got a shut off the bike yeah you're gonna shut out for eight hours a night and you're not gonna know what's happening people can touch your balls while you sleep in your no way of stopping them there's a lot of things that can happen that show it is like you said we don't know we don't know we don't know what the fuck that is I could I could like you don't like you say it so that I'm afraid to be crazy it's just I can say whatever the hell I want and we don't know baby you know what I mean we don't know we don't know the truth we'd have no idea yeah somebody might be stealing time from you in my ceilin time like this motherfuckers got time that the truth is I feel like ad experience but I don't know what it is so for me to say it's alien or say it's a the drug chemical you talk about I don't know I can't tell you right now I don't know what it is but I did I felt like it could have been an experience or not maybe I felt maybe I'm crazy and it's the normal thing that everybody would like maybe I had but right now I like I don't know it's too I'm making my own research to find out about that how are you researching and I research a lot of stuff they commit the reason things and go on the internet now it's another thing they just said to me I'm going to research at me by research on the wrong maybe I research things that people have tried because that lab lapse of time that you don't remember they've been some people been if not eyes on the other about the bad you know what I mean yeah I venture and I don't want be inept eyes well that's a very controversial you know the what's happening during hypnosis hypnotic regression it's very controversial because there's a lot of people that believe that you can introduce fake memories into a person while they're unconscious and then you could you know you you could steer the events in one way or another and introduce false memories it's not it's not very it's not very reliable I don't think so that's one of the big things about these people that have these crazy stories from hypnotic regression like what the fuck is really going on you know you don't know a lot of times people that are in therapy in the first place or a little wild art of course so it's that those are the type of people that you're dealing with you're hypnotizing them and then you're finding out about these nutty experiences with aliens who knows what the fuck your real but I'm gonna tell you as XO gratis just to save you I get fish in the water okay and the fish is live is in his environment let's say a fisherman he grab a fish in the water it pulls it off the water look at him look at make the fish look around and drop the fish back in the water the fish after is going to go back to his friend and he's going to tell the other fish man I will put out of the water in and it was people were breathing air it was another environment I saw a human being poop you know like and then grabbing me I saw trees I saw a bird in the sky I saw like like a Sun I'm like I see a different thing in different universe and then you put me back the other fish whole thing is completely insane you know it's normal so maybe in a way we're all like fish and and maybe there is something like you said that like when you save another universe or another well or something and we don't know and we're right next to it but we don't know and if that's why I'm doing research I want to see you know I wanna grow as a human being fine what was that food even though I probably will never found out the truth and I want to get closer closer and try my research see what's happening you know and we're all in the same pattern you know you know what I think the problem with fine people want to find the truth is there is no truth there are truths and there is no one truth and everyone is like somebody I hope to find the truth like what are you talking about it's not one thing these truths there's a lot of information there's a lot of stuff and to call it the truth like to figure out the whole big thing it's almost impossible for our brains to to grasp like an ant doesn't know what a cellphone tower is it's it's almost impossible for our brains to grasp the enormity of you know going from protons and cells and an animal and a planet and a galaxy and a universe in multiple universes and it's not it's too much but this is where's no way you're going to be able to take all the things that are going in all over the world and understand it all and understand the pieces that it falls into it's not possible so this whole thing where I'm going to you know hopefully I find the truth you will find truth is you will never find that you because you're a monkey we're not we're private nothing that we're not smart enough without it yeah I understand what you say where we are we're being birthed into a whole new universe of information that's never existed for any previous human beings and we're not designed for it we're not designed to process this we're designed to figure out where the D are going we're designed to figure out who do you want to fuck we're designed to think this guy he's probably going to take over my village this cunt and that's how we're designed and then within the last 10,000 years that has become you know watching like space documentaries getting on the internet and it's too much no there's no way there's no way you know exactly what's going on all over the world you'll go crazy yeah you know the time it will take a lot of time in and still have to acclimate under I agree on drew what's up with that have you heard of like a lot of these guys like Dan Hardy did this go into Peru and they take those ayahuasca ceremonies did you hear about that no you didn't hear about that Dan Hardy did it again way to get him on the podcast and talk to him about it but he said it changed his whole life and it's the same thing it's DMT it's these Amazon Indians they make it in a brew and the active ingredient is in his brew is DMT and they have these ceremonies and they all get together and they'll play music and this guy like blows tobacco smoke in your face and you drink this stuff in an hour and 20 minutes later they enter into the spirit world have life-changing visions or the wildest physical manifestations of your imagination you could ever possibly think of and dream of you can't even think about it you can't you can't even put into words and it's legal in Peru you know it's legal in parts of South America so people are going down there this Americans are going down there on a regular basis and having these shamanic rituals life-changing rituals hmm and it's all based on the same thing that comes out of your brain when you're dreaming yeah pretty nutty hey could I could make you realize things I like to say learn about yourself you know do you meditate mmm I wouldn't that say meditate I would say visualizing yes visualizing yeah so it's specific tasks in mind like like visualizing fight strata my fights visualizing what I want in my life what you know where I wanted to be in 20 years I've tried to visualize where I could be what I want you know could be about fight could be about anything it could be about my training and one hour where I what I'm gonna do and you know about everything be in business you know could be when I'm gonna meet someone when I'm gonna say or you know could be about everything do you have very specific like goals like for your life - yeah it's written down yes I do do you write them down yeah I've goals here sometime I wrote it down some I don't but the I do I do have a specific goal I have go for my career but I have bigger goal than this much bigger much bigger gold in your head I project for example you're gonna be present in the world none of it I want to be four for example one of my goals like like is to ever to be married have a wife with at least five kids four five kids minimum Wow whenever like okay that's one of my goal you know that's my goal and that's I'm not there yet it's one of my goal you know I don't think you're gonna have a problem fun in a nice lady final isolated I can get along with it as well I think you better have a lot of kids look up in Canada Japan that's weeny jack don't be trying to give these American chicks forgive mouthy especially after you retire you are retired and chick and uh that's a lady do you um do you have like a clear timeline as to when you're gonna discontinue your fighting career no I don't I don't I just I didn't I didn't blend this now I'm focusing on my camera right now and wanted to be the best at what I do and I want to make that be the guy that made the difference in the sport you know bring help the sport the UFC grow and be more mainstream everywhere well you've already done that just by being who you are you know by your your personality you know your your ability to just be a normal guy who just happens to be one of the baddest motherfuckers on the planet yeah but you know I still is a lot of a lot of thing to do you know and some country did it - giggle you know and when I write sure there's still a lot of work as far as the spread of MMA not just some countries or some states it's still illegal in New York State whatever when I first started yet and why I'm from my country it was illegal in Canada you know they did it was not sanction and everything so this I might be at least where I live now it's it's good and it's very popular yeah I watched your first fights man I watched you in a TKO organization yeah yeah i watch all those you know it's always been a big big fan of MMA and I think that it's it's so important that there's all these other organizations going on like you know like that that MFC up in Canada and it used to be Strikeforce and you know now this Bellator is doing really well it's like so important to have a bunch of different outlets for guys to pursue their careers but up in Canada was just like that TKO organization right and yeah one more yeah it was pretty much only TDK what you guys fought in the ring yeah it wasn't a ring back down yeah yeah what do you do some guys prefer the ring what do you prefer now on the cage the cage yeah the ring is it's not the environment the cage is better or I would rather do like yeah the cage is perfect a circular like octagon or circular cage or even better than a ring that would be like a platform where there is no walls there is a like a like a line a line no no you don't fall but there is a line and if you step across all right they put you they put you back but there is a line and then there is a bigger so you don't fall but it's a platform and it's a way I see we're saying yeah that's the Superleague a little bit like wrestling extremely yeah kind of sumo exactly yeah it would be good too yeah that's not a bad idea it's just a space consideration probably exactly and I'm for sure eggs I don't want some Brock Lesnar dude just steamrolling someone right into the crowd it's true now no that would be that would be back or but but something I think like that or you know I think they got you know that the cage is pretty good you know it's a good surface yeah the only objection that people have as fans is sometimes it makes the action a little harder see to you there you know watching it at home it's perfect I'm sure they could make a material which is like a though they could see through it like a plastic window which is enough Ricci and shit every time dudes would be like what about that Daniel crummy a Frank near fight happened true the whole thing would be just grease you wouldn't be able to see shit yeah because they those guys pressed up against every spot on that cage but it's also girl MMA now and it could get more water like a girl in a car thanks is true but they did I'm sure there is a there's a lot of thing I would have changed the score first of all the time is no time no around right I think is I think seriously I believe it's stupid the wrong wanna see was the best man let them fight you know yeah so 15 minute or maybe 25 minutes for the championship go around wide around why would try to be like boxing you know we're not boxers they did they did round to be like boxing to be accepted as a sport yeah there would probably be a lot more finishes yeah I was no no time of course hundred percent no round you know I got this is ridiculous I mean I like it me me me seriously I do you think it's possible that the UFC would you would you fight someone my town logical to arrange that like as a particular rule like maybe the UFC could do it in Russia or somewhere with their gangster above it yeah why would I would I would rather like I would rather fight in a rule like this I think would be more honest like it was that better a man let them fight it see that could have happened in Pride they did that in pride right with this is hoist Gracie have a 90-minute match with Sakuraba but I think that was like even then it was like that's that's when they used to be the real thing you know yeah I can add a that's why I so much respect for these guy high school Moondancer Verne oh yeah see I had a pioneer you know oh yeah the no no time limit pine eye roll our yeah with the steak tough does crazy grasses jousan oh yeah stay there Joe some became like Freddy dish and jail for gang rape oh my god really yeah Joe Sandow is a part of a gang rape are you serious yeah apparently they didn't know that arrested him for something else and got his DNA and connecting it to a gang rape oh your spa yeah I'm wondering what happened to be like somebody other guy okay how will our I think he got resonated when I was so much I was happy can even guy I was like yeah let's kick ass you know everybody through that crazy cartwheel kick yeah I'm Steve genom yeah yeah that was been fight you know yeah it was good bad how about that boxer Emerson with one gloves yeah yeah what was Jimerson art Jimmerson yes yeah what was that about maybe oh maybe he had a hurt Han or something no I think he was thinking more like he's gonna grab it one end and swing with that I don't know like I who knows go to the right but it was also like it was the real thing it was it was the time were I literally watched the fight back in the day and thought someone could die you you needed to have so much courage back in the day to step in the ad actor much more than nowadays nowadays in hockey before it's no weight class nothing you know as everyone known it was unknown I remember a fight like a Norris against a Pat Smith and a guy at the die you know like like a blood everywhere before they stop the fight that you see have a towel flying and he still didn't stop the fight I'm like this is one time you this is the guy's a pioneer you know these guys they were the real tough guy you know I mean yeah there was no referee stop yeah no referee no round no at like Commission no awake last no there's no that no way there were some fights where fights get stopped quickly disappear off well you know it's to protect the you know and the referee can make a mistake sometime and it is me off yet sad to see it when it's a mistake done I think that I try to to be the best they could be but like the I can't believe that around I don't I don't think ground is good idea that's my opinion just just round round it's an idea yeah what about gloves some people think there should be no gloves some people think we can knee a guy and elbow guy and kick a guy like why do you have covers on your knuckles yes true could be an option no glove but it would be a lot of broken ham but a problem they would fight differently like I mean I think by Croatian I root stuff that they used to hit a lot with the the smashed it then you know yeah well if you you know if you watch the old bas Rutten days in pancrase he figured out that he could throw punches with he pulls his hand way back so instead of like slapping and like karate chop style he was throwing punches what I was doing with his palm yeah but the thing is we wouldn't fight that same way we would fight now to preserve our buddy like like like it when I felt like this I wasn't it wasn't turtle person I was punching like if I would I be with Barry and I would hit with my palm you know I mean I wouldn't yet like the same way I would have probably broke my hand or yeah I never had my hand broken you know and I'm like you know but you know I would fight different different different way it would make it better also for the older grappling aspect yeah big fan of Brazil Jitsu and wrestling is I would be better it would be more realistic I mean I don't understand why they have a pad on the gloves I mean I think it's a hundred percent uh-huh if you don't have pads on your shins and you're kicking people in the face like come on that's crazy like you're gonna pad little knuckles and yeah you can cut people more but it also breaks your hand more it's just it's if you want if the sport you're trying to have it be realistic it's almost like bad to allow people to wear gloves because it allows them to tee off and punch as hard as they can without worry about breaking your hands 100 percent hundred percent is true it's true and that you know and you know you could break your hand but you know you hit that guy with a good function and that draw you know at bare knuckle I don't think it will break your hand you know just doing karate you know keV question lady you know what people are also you know it would punch much harder of course because that tape is I don't think is that the girl I think is that they that hold the wrist so there is no movement and there is and everything all the impact makes it harder is yeah definitely that's why I believe now yeah I think the hand wrap definitely aids the person is punching yes um but you also would be really cognitive only punching with the first two knuckles you know because in boxing you know you're totally taught to punch and concentrate on those knuckles but in real reality a lot of times when you're throwing combinations you're hitting them with all parts of your hand whereas you're taught in karate the idea of punching you know like a makiwara over and over and over again it's tough in these two nails Jack Dempsey says is that third knuckle third no yes used punch with that third knuckle anyone special power he could punch very hard yes I'm said he says is that Turner called because he said the alignment of the body is better with that turn Nicole hmm that's interesting so maybe I would never argue with Jack Dempsey but most people believe that it's the first no no I know the I can karate same thing they teach but Jack Dempsey is strangely says the third knuckle in the book he says that that guy was a fucking Savage huh yeah he was i watch those old old school fights and huge fighting dudes much bigger than him usually about a buck 90 I think he was like 196 or something like that when he was the heavyweight champion mm-hmm he was fucking up those you know what I might be wrong I think actually Jack Dempsey was even lighter than that I think Jack Dempsey hold on sorry let me pull it up I don't even think he was 196 Rocky Marciano which is really Marciano was 175 yeah what the fuck man there's certain dudes like that that chicks just can hit so fucking hard yeah but they're openers they're they're open it was not as big as well you know no no not our like monster like looked at Klitschko you know it's crazy you know yeah it doesn't say his weight on his wiki PD says his six-foot Matt Sano or Dempsey max Anna was like 1 7 1 175 1 then 180 Marciano yeah yeah what he was what 180 what 5 Maxie no I remember I read it was a 118 and then I don't think he was Dempsey was 192 that's crazy yeah it's like my size is my size fighting every way guy like Brock Lesnar only shoot potato they had those little tiny ass gloves back then to it just a little a little cover over the knuckles very little padding at all it was probably just like a little horse hair in there as well mild Wow do you pay attention to like old videos of like old fights do you ever watch like old boxing matches and see like what guys like Dempsey had to go through guys like Jack Johnson had I watch a lot of stuff you know like I would have been watching the internet reset recently is a lot of a lot of cavalry carry stuff I'm really intriguing really yeah like the the point get ready guys it's very underrated oh yeah like a lot of very good fighters they come from that and I think it translated to MMA very very well absolutely Marciano's 188 apparently um the the ability to move in and Alec really quickly doesn't that ever fought a if you fought in point tournaments before I did yeah very frustrating I'm from kyoko-chan karate it's not the same system but I did point get ready before yeah I found only a few point karate tournaments but I found them I fought some fought one really high level guy and it was like he wins a lot of those point tournaments it was so different from Taekwondo being like continuous fighting to this being like stop you know it's like it was really hard to fight that way if you're not used to it and I would just imagine that guy who's really good at lunging in and out like that if you could teach him all the other aspects of MMA that would be a big event that's what I use for my take it out the shoot that people saw is your wrestling it has nothing to do with my wrestling Maris thing is once I get that leg I finish a takedown but out to I get in and I was because of karate people like no way karate you know and I yes karate that allowed me to cut the distance and take take the people down have a very good single to the board very good the ball a very good penetration is because of my leg the way I do and this timing I get is from the karate wow it's a wrestling - but karate primary because before I start when I was karate guy pure and I I just likely made myself very well to wrestling and to wrestling for especially for that mixed martial art wow that's really interesting because I've always said that one you're the best things about you is the your ability to close the distance yeah it's karate does it make sense yeah it totally makes sense yeah my footwork pattern and everything is from karate this is this where I get it from springing in like that you know the ability to cover that distance that's a huge advantage cover this and to not get hit this very important right yeah and that is one of the cornerstones of those tournaments and in that style did you have a hard time when you made a transition to move and MMA style it today today with my kicks or lime or like karate guy you know I don't I do more Thai but I might kick you know it's like it printed right it's hard to say like you're a Taekwondo guy you'll can kick but you will stay Taekwondo you like and you know it's fine to you know said that the best like I believe Taekwondo is the best spinning back-kick you you have the best putting back kick I ever seen in my entire life you know you're from Taekwondo you know what I mean and it is your background and in you try to change your technique of your spinning back-kick it will be the worst thing you could do you know what I mean so I try to learn to have stuff to wear so no but I don't try to change my might thing you know right right yeah I am I still incorporate a lot of those techniques but I do more just regular muy Thai now than anything else because I think all those techniques like the spinning back kick and wheel kick for a guy like you that has like a strong karate background or guy who picks things up really quickly that's you know those are good techniques to learn but like for everyday use it's hard to pull those things off unless you're doing it on a regular basis like they become normal when you're fighting and talk about no tournaments and everybody's doing it you're doing it every day but at MMA there's so many other fucking things like to have the the type of leg dexterity that you see like the top level talk when no guys have its be so hard to have that along with wrestling along with boxing along with jiu-jitsu it how do you manage like all your different skill sets do you have like like 20 percent your time goes to this thirty percent goes to that like no no no they depend like for exact like I give you an example right now I'm last week I was doing for the the movie Captain America the filming then now I'm doing the interview but every day I find time I go to Freddie Roach work on my boxing and this part of my like this time I'm on my boxing pretty much and when I'm gonna go to New York for example because I have to go to New York for that bro the book promo and said I'm gonna do my digits with John then our I'm going to be doing jujitsu just when I go back and watch all I mixed up everything you know but when I go to different places I go you know I do my my like specific things and this is in between fights so you don't have a fight scheduled so now you're just in the skill development phase as though it is yeah and that's where my training is fun because I trained for myself to get better and I try stuff like now you see me if I go roll with my friend like it is Academy I roll I try stuff that I would maybe not have the guts to try a normal time because it's risky so so I try it oh I get up and you know I tap and I laugh who cares I tap I don't I don't care some time I tap him some time I get that but but when I train for a training camp now I train for performance so I have to perform I cannot be beaten and trainees always my confidence will be affect I try to perform so that's what my training is not as fun as it is now right yeah the ability to loosen up in training is very important when you're in the learning phase right yes yes that's how you develop new techniques and that's there is a ego issue too like with guys who are not that good at jujitsu like you see it a lot like maybe the but like strikers yes I don't want a role because it only can tapped that is stupid that's it it doesn't mean anything you tap it doesn't mean you're not as good as the other guy just mean you play that game and you just get cut and end of it so what you know so what I got tap all the time I don't get them you know it's a fascinating aspect of jujitsu but it doesn't exist in other martial arts you know like if you is kickboxing spar a guy it's not as you know yeah it's like it you don't want to be knocked out but I mean is it would be the same thing in a way let's say you your jujitsu guy and you do kick by somewhere that guy but that guy will not go he will well let's say we'll do a combo that you will be like you would know what I owe that right hand would have knocked me out if you know is something Jitsu oh I would tap otherwise he would have break my arm yes little bit same thing we don't hurt each other jiu-jitsu you can allow to go further without hurting children in kickboxing for example where it striking it can be brain damage yeah that's the hardest is it or I should ask you is that the hardest place to find guys that you're comfortable training with is in striking so you know that they're not trying to knock you out you know you like every day in the gym isn't a war a different I gotta tell you is have many times people try to hurt me and I try to hurt you know like I have no choice you know I mean you know when I first you know and now it's different because of the WTF i can find place how I can go and I mean training its training you know we still go hard there is a smart way to train of course I don't try to hurt myself when I train and try to hurt people you know but of course I'd say I'm training for a fight before I fight and spar hard if the guy you see you heard the guy you let them breed you don't go for the finish but the thing is for example kicked that would control the kick - they're things like that you know you don't do needs and today the hell both stuff like that we don't do that that and this is important have a good training partner like that you know because sometime you train with someone who's crazy is gonna you're getting ready for a fight it's a lot of money on the table he's gonna control - yeah cut you or slice things like that you don't need you know to make a name for himself so now when I'm people ask me what you go train in my gym because sometimes I because I go train in the gym they know who I am I'm Jordan I hear and they go oh I'm gonna try to order them to make a name for myself sucked you know this I don't like it so they're very careful with white rhino it's that's a bad side of it because they did a lot of people try to take em out they'd make the name you know and I don't like it you know I'm I like to try with different trade partner and you guys but now has to be careful to do it I cannot do it you know have to you know I have to know where I'm going with tell the guy to be oh this guy you can go with him is good you know I don't care that get tapped out or it be dominated that's not what I care it's care of being hurt you know orange or not be able to to work you know it's a lot of money when I have a fight after can sold it sucks yeah there's always accidental injuries but there's the injuries where you know a guys trying to hurt you because he's trying to that's gotta be really annoying yeah there is guys that how do you say they they always hurt people and so no I didn't mean it but I why it always happened to you man why I always happen to I've got in the gym and Mojo's I when I bring my training partner here for like I bring guys to train from like my last training camp bring guys to train a for my training camp to me mechanically as I tell these guys I listen there is this guy this guy you're not gonna train with him because he's I and and they're all like boy why it's like because when every time someone train with you is the Apennine injuries are yeah but I don't mean and that you don't mean it but it's still happening man it's like it's is that's how you are a man I've seen guys kicked out of gym for that of course of course but some guys it's intentional so guy it's not intentional but even if it's not intentional you don't want to take that chance you know with you know what I mean I don't hurt people with me when I try and find me I get that I hurt and training it could have happened accidentally once an hour very rare it's very rare hurt people you know very very rare I could if I wanted to I could but I don't hear I don't hurt I don't hurt hurt the people you know yeah you dare train you yes I Flores yeah there's uh there's a couple guys that I know that you just people just won't train with this okay just just walk away yeah they'll say get hurt no thanks because you know what the minute you're gonna turn with them is gonna be a fight you know it's gonna be like I really fight and I'm and you know I don't want a fight yeah and I'm paid to fight and then I don't want to hurt myself in real life you know and I don't want to have to hurt something I don't want to put myself in this situation you put together a great camp now though man you got you going to so many different great guys John Danaher who's one of the most underrated or underappreciated jujitsu coaches in MMA in the world really you know with you if you look at all the different guys that get famous for code in jujitsu talked a lot of people about John Donner and they all say the same thing like that guy's a bad motherfucker yeah super smart brilliant in the corner like I love the advice he gives he's always like on point direct accurate I spread the most I would say likes brilliant the educated men I ever met in my in my life yeah he's brilliant a lot of people don't know you know I believe he's a philosophy major yeah he's a that B is a PhD in a philosophy used to teach philosophy in Columbia University and it was a foreign Charlie before you drop everything and and dedicate as I've to jujitsu Eddie was bouncing at night in a hip-hop but oh my god in a hip-hop love get you believe it and apparently he was like big on like weightlifting back then yeah buddy bender people or and then he starts to in jujitsu and fell in love with it hey that's really yeah so you go to him for you jiu-jitsu and hens Oh as well right you go to hens oohs yes I go to the hands of that we travel a lot of gyms yeah by travel it's a good thing because I have places that no matter that I come to Elly often for business stuff but when I come to really have the place where I can train in LA you know I'm very happy I've placed why I can train in New York I go to New York a lot and and Montreal of course it sounds bad he frowns you know and it's it's important you know sigh after everywhere I go if I catch a good home where am i can go train there get better that was hilarious when you brought that a French dude with you on the Ultimate Fighter and showed up hammered what is his name again josh Josh Alice got bus key yeah he scores very good with a very famous Muay Thai kickboxer and he would but partying all night I'd show up to the gym with one of them club cups plastic cup and it was fucking alcohol in it like he's out of his mind he shows up he was drunk and high from the party like you haven't sleep for more than like TWiT 36 hours and over that is flight to Paris then I thought I made the training when he arrived I made on purpose I made organize a training for him to come teach the afternoon class the late afternoon not the morning class because I said I was thinking oh he's gonna sleep no we are from Paris the night before went out all night wet and then after party went Anna after after party and arrived straight to training didn't even go to his hotel room and train and kick everyone's ass and with I everybody was like what the hell is this and even when they when he left because he stay for like a week when he left the producer of the of The Ultimate Fighter came to see me doctor George we need to get this guy we need to keep this guy here we did it was good TV you know I was right no no he's leaving yes to go back it was making me look bad but it was I was like giving a noise and he's not an imposing looking guy was amazing when you look at him he's not like a scary looking but he doesn't know anything about them doesn't he has no idea was chocolatier was under so you had no idea he came in the room he saw those pictures I who's these guys are you know like he knows all those like famous Muay Thai guy but Emma doesn't know anything about it yeah he fights Thais like yes he fights in lumpini Stadium and a fuck blackout again he's like he cut blackout with a spinning elbow in the head you know like he lost that fight but you took that fight on a short notice like like a few days notice and he was underweight it was yet to gain weight for the the way the weight loss yoga weight class he doesn't care yes I guess I courage like crazy wow it's weird did you look at the guy you'd never think that guy's a fighter it's amazing this directory were surround by a lot of character kickboxing is much more famous in Europe than it is in America isn't it true I believe the level is is higher in Europe yeah apparently the glory though they're going to start to bring glory to someone I think they're going to bring it to Frank Shamrock said they're going to bring it to CBS Sports I don't know what channel that is you know which would you know I know I think CBS has like a bunch of different channels that they own but if they start airing those like high level you know like gokhan Saki and Daniel Ghita and all these like high level heavyweight guys that's some wild shit watch it's true it's true it's a it's going to be interesting you know bring that here yeah it's so funny how like the difference in just like a pure straight-up kickboxing match you know when guys have no worries about being taken down you know and when people say oh like the level of kick boxing and MMA is not as high as the level kickboxing it's a different distance yeah different you cannot compare it different stance okay I left over and got knocked out by a the what Tonio Bigfoot yes over these a k1 champion yeah you know it because it's not the same thing it's not the same thing I mean I mean it's easy to add that when you're a higher level k1 guy to adapt to MMA timing but this the timing is different I think I'll stir had some issues going so far I could it could be to like I don't know the inside of it but I'm just thinking it's got a testosterone issue it's got low testosterone yeah you know he'd he tested high for testosterone like he had taken something okay now he has low testosterone okay but I mean like it's just innate like an example I don't know did they being behind closed or what it just didn't look like he had a lot of energy and Bigfoot Silva waited until he got tired and just beat the shit out of them that was uh that was a brutal knockout - yeah I remember I was surprised to see that I was like oh my god I was not expecting this Bigfoot Silva looked awesome I was an amazing combination man I mean you know whether Alistair was hurt or not the combination he leveled them with was devastating you know just I mean he was key it was like it was a lot like like remember Phil Baroni and Dave MANET remember that knockout or Phil Baroni had David up against the cake ah that was violet yeah it was not quite as I think oh he hit him like four times before man a can even drop that was bad yeah and Baroni could fucking hit and he's teeing off on him it literally he's keeping them standing with his punches this Bigfoot one wasn't quite as devastating as that but it was number two yeah man it was like bouncing and they felt like bang bang bang bang bang bang around this is like the greatest punching highlight real knockout ever that brownie man a fight it's true it was bad it was bad some of the those knockout you watch it like ooh yeah when um when you first lost your title to Matt Serra that was the first time I met Matt Matthew no no that's all right yes yes sir when you lost your title to Matt Serra and you know and Matt Serra stopped you you know that was was that like that had to be like the most devastating loss of your career it was but I learned something valuable that allowed me to survive - Carlos Condit what was up when I got hit by Matt Serra the first punch heeyy yeah I make me very dizzy and I was so proud like Pride it's a good thing but it could be a bad thing I was so proud and I'm a very proud person so I get I got wimp when we Bowl is in English I mumble again I got wobble and instead of back up and say oh I'm gonna go back to my sense wait wait that I go back to my Caleb room before we attacking I got wobble and I got so angry sigh I can't believe this guy because back in the day was like 5:00 to attend to one the the odds I was like I can't believe I get wobble by a guy like this and I like back in the day like I was I was angry that I got wobble I was proud guy first time I ever happen in my life so I wanted to give it back to him as fast as I can but Masseria hit very hard so I was I was I didn't have an equilibrium I got a wobble with one shot then I tried to jump back into a war with him into a slugfest with him while I was wobble and he wasn't so I got punch like boom boom boom then he started to tee off on me and then I fall down and I thought I know it's completely out if I would have keep going I would be like you know what you know I stopped and thanks God the referee stopped but what happened with Carlos Condit the same situation I got kick in the head then then instead of telling oh I need to give it back to him I follow them around I said you know what yes I got caught then relax now it's time to read offense catch up your bread catch up your your senses bang bang bang I focus on my defense my shield close everything every opportunity has to hurt me and then I came back after so I step into my my my ego a little bit tried to accept the fight I got hit relax and then I came back like that's a little bit of that's the experience that I gained from that loss with my terror that allowed me to survive Carlos Condit Oh interesting because Carlos Condit we drop me with that that that kick huh Matt Serra the first time he cut me i wobble but I didn't drop like I was I was on my feet but I tried to get back right into a slugfest with him instead of backing up tried to use my footwork get back to my senses and that's what happened I got caught you know sometimes you learn doing a loss and that's what happened to me Matt Serra by beating me he helped me become a better martial artist you know the kick that would would had you in more trouble the punch by matter or the kick by Condit but that a kick I believe with Condit was like harder was a bigger kick the first punch if you look the punches of Sara finish me because it was many punches and I took many punch before I fall and I when I fall I was too late was completely decided easy you know but but I should have when I got punched and wobbled because that's already hit very hard and I never seen that Punch coming I should have stepped back and or all them or go for you know instead of trying to slugfest with him and can't-can't it when I got I got dropped I said to myself okay like don't go back into because I couldn't go back try to go a single go back up right away say okay use the guard up up up close close everything and and you know deep because I was this a little bit to Condit you know I didn't see the kick coming at all I follow his body and his kick come on the side and on the Temple Hebrew EEE damaged my temple artery by the way it was a hard kick man it was looked at hard at school to hospital after I get it fixed you know you have to go in ten minutes is what's going on here is that why you guys were having a fucking conversation what what is it what's going on you know but another young man what kind of other interview he got so boring as bullsháá is what you got what you gotta do I thought PRS stuff for the book I guess ah the book PR stuff um so everybody wants and I need to go train to joy yeah where you gonna train tonight Freddie will tell anybody man I'm gonna go watch you I they have the security that works um do you um like now that you you just beat Diaz there's a lot of people that are coming up in 170-pound division of course Johny Hendricks is the the big name and Jake Ellenberger and all these different guys do you at one point time there's been a lot of talk at one point time of you guys getting together and you and Anderson Silva meeting maybe at a catchweight or something like that and fighting in a suit a super fight yes is that question everybody asks me they ask me that even before I came back from my injury you know right they wanted me like I need to do stuff in my division before I think because it's new it has moved now so right I don't like I know Savoy is fighting a Chris Weidman what's understand sofa is very big you know is a1 is 230 pounds you know he's very big guy walking around very big and I'm 190 pound right and if he's a lot of weight different so you know if this fight happened and one day we're gonna have to decide what weight class and you know everything but this is you know and I try to see figure out what's gonna happen what weight class and everything he says he can make 170 now if you want make 170 I weighed 117 you can 170 is fine do you think that's possible he was fighting back in the day in Japan at 168 that was a long time ago but he was he was over 25 years old Wow so you think he if he just did it slowly over a long time yeah that's the biggest cut you've ever seen the biggest weight cut I did or anybody that you've ever seen anybody do I don't do much big a lot of cut it would be easier for me to go fight I 155 done fine and 185 I would be more at my weight gradually that I had a one fight this guy 155 they walk around 190 like me yes I've seen them because I think I'm big because I have a large frame but I I don't have a another big guy at very I'm not thick I'm not ticking right but they you know I will see this fight like I a now he's fighting women and like and ryx is freaking out you want to fight me a little bit you know we'll see you know what's gonna happen in the future what do you think is next is it gonna be the Hendricks fight that's not probably probably car and ryx you know yeah that's a big fight yeah but the thing is every like he's always gonna be a guy that because oh this guy gonna beat you after I'm just one it was gonna happen yeah no it's good fight it's it's a fight a lot of people want to see and you you have a very talents TAC division you know you at the top and look at how many great contenders are out 170 yeah no no it's a it's a tough it's a very tough division what's it like walking around with that kind of stress I mean you got like a whole line of trained killers that want to get to the champ you know is that a difficult thing to manage and that stress I tried to take one fight at a time you know and focus on one guy that I had no choice and I cannot split myself enough you know and for me the last two fight were close to each other and my second fight the training calendar it was brutal I can avoid that I didn't have mental break now I needed to take a little break mentally to come back Congress or because it other well I will get tired at what I do I will not be as good as I I could I could be no but you still train still counts all the time but I train for fun I don't train for performance which is different like I explained earlier right racing myself and having good time it's fun now why are you doing this do you keep up with you Jitsu it all gets to your boxing done and I do Jiu Jitsu - I do everything is very important how many hours a day do you train I depend like now I'm gonna have only maybe one hour and a half I'm going to enough ready and that's it you know depend my schedule normally I train twice a week twice twice a day two three three three hour maybe total like two training of an hour and a half the training itself is maybe 40 45 minutes for 30 minutes the training itself the talking that there's a dad changing they don't know or an F um now when you're used to doing gymnastics yes I do how often you do that once twice a week now and you think that's like really responsible for a lot of like and I like a little gymnastic and in track and field yeah I can feel I run track a tractor like sprints and jumps and 1660 hundred and four hundred and you feel like that's the best kind of exercise for MMA yeah if I would have start all over again because back in the day I used to Train like an idiot I was doing body builder and watching movies like you know Rocky you know this you know and talk about them or no I thought that was the thing by in my back in the 90s for my generation that was the thing back in the day where I'm from Canada a mix of martial art and bodybuilding was a best mix it could be you will you're like you say a badass you know I said that then after we discovered that but builder is not suited for you know mixed martial it's better like do like I was doing more like strength conditioning kind of side then I found out after the string conditioning it was better a non effective thing I think is better - amnestic do you think I had a few joints as well yes dragon fill in gymnastics I would have to do that's how would George yes I would have to go back in time I would have tell myself that George stop all that bodybuilding stuff that you're doing it's better to gymnastic and track and field is that because you're already a fairly physically strong guy and you're pretty strong from wrestling as well remember I'm very strong when I wrestle when I win oh when I grab someone like in that string but if I lift weight I'm not very strong I bench like well to play to play the knife maximum on a very strong bench press before like I go you're not very strong I get II I'm not strong at lifting weight when I was there when I was a kid I remember I was in school in secondary school and everybody the thing was to have a big chest you know every guy I wanted to have a big chest so I remember for years I used to do bench press flies dumbbell and man I never had a chest my life is I never had it I try so hard to train for it and never add volume here and and you know it's genetic man is that way it is so I say you know what you know I'm not gonna do
