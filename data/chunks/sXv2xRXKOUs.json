hello freak bitches probably have a following of Irish people too you know what I mean who cares who gives a fuck we taking of the Irish speaking [Music] oh man hey listen man this guy has balls this is why I respect the fuck out of Conor McGregor not just because he's an awesome fighter and yeah he lost the Nate Diaz who's also an awesome fighter but who the fuck will fight anybody who will just jump up the last guy was BJ BJ tried it yeah and you know what even though a BJ didn't he had success once at least at 170 he beat Matt he's but yeah at the end of the day there's a really good reason why all elite boxers wrestlers fighters weight cutting is so massively important virtually everybody there are some crazy people out there like Anthony Johnson that's the exception but generally there's a really good reason most people are torturing themselves to get as light as possible because at the elite level five pounds makes a big fucking difference it makes a big difference just five pounds 10 pounds 10 pound different elite level men even the best guys aren't going up away look at half a Mendez no doubt probably pound for pound the best guy in jiu-jitsu probably him and Marcelo jean-jacques they're all up there BAM pound for pound there's so many good guys now Jesus yeah incredible now you know what I mean you know even Marcelo no one's trying to go up in weight no one's trying to go let me this year I'm gonna try the weight category above me know everybody's on the craziest died they need three months they get serious about it they're on Instagram posting their fucking broccoli every day which and fucking selfies of their abs and sure you know they're killing themselves because not because it feels good it feels like shit they all like eating it me it's so important so everybody knows you just can't go up in goddamn white BJ was BJ was the one that said fuck he went up the light heavyweight shit Magina five foot I know it wasn't even light heavyweight bro it was heavy weight because lyoto machida was like 208 that okay I think I think that fight was like technically a heavyweight fight find that out but did you ever see when you used to fight yeah this first UFC fight that's not as real way because real weight is 205 100 180 yeah so but BJ did it and I always admired him I'd to me to me I looked I'll always look at BJ as a living legend yeah the guy didn't he's not undefeated he got his ass beat a few times who gives a fuck look what BJ did he had the balls to step up and really he was a 45 or just like honor there's no the whole time he was a four and in jujitsu he was a 45 he was always a 45 for fighting at 55 bottom 170 nobody else is doing it and you know Conor here he comes Connor this guy um he has so much power in his hands he had that courage to think he could finish what BJ started you know let me go up there and do that do what BJ did but you know he felt like he could fucking knock anybody out he really really believed he could fucking he would be Lance you're going down and you know what he was doing great against Nate Diaz I this is my look this is my this is how I found her I'm walking I'm at a I'm at this party Slammys house and well I didn't realize we were behind by a minute and a half oh we were alive I thought we're alive but we were behind by a mirror everyone's going nuts I'm watch it going oh shit Lizzie Borden is sitting next to my childhood idol he's one of my greatest of favorite lead singers of all time he's sitting next to the morgue watching everyone's going nuts it looks like Conners to me I was like Connors gonna win this thing man he was like Nate up cutting them all up he was connecting he looked really calm for like Carla that whole first round I was going it's it's it was over in the first or second second it was a second so in that round I get a call from Joey I told you I told you you never bet against Diaz I go what are you talking about I thought I was watching are you talking about the Misha fight he goes no motherfucker you got show cake who got choked up I call the home got choked out I'm watching the date me as no motherfucker what fight are you watching right now I'm watching the the Conor fight as it's going on he goes he choked I'm fucking out I'm like dude fuck and he goes by boom he realize he fucked up but I think I knew that Diaz was gonna win a minute you wanted to pee or something we're at a party and it was just behind someone rewound you didn't fast-forward it so we thought it was live Joey Joey called me hysterical and he gave it away and then once he realized he gave it away he hung up oh shit and I said oh shit bye you just fucked up the greatest fight ever but the fight was so crazy and so fucking insane even though I know better even though I knew I go okay somehow Nate is gonna take him down and choke him out but it doesn't look good right here I'm like how is he gonna take it Conor down that's not gonna be easy fuck he's gonna pull this off how was he gonna do it I had no idea that Nate I Nate hurts Conor Conor takes him down you know that's how it went down the place I was at was going fucking nuts everybody was screaming at the top of the fucking lungs everyone and then when he choked him out dude I've never been in a party where everyone was gone so crazy before everybody was fucking mine I was everybody was going crazy Oh jumped off it scream I never screamed so loud in my motherfucking life at any fight ever dude that was it looked like Carlo was just had his hands down because I got this motherfucker he was land and he was tagging him it looked like you heard him a couple times he generally tagged him you know what I mean look at he was I thought it was it was over for Nate I really did and when he turned it around and the way it finished and and when he put that fucking rear naked choke in he put that motherfucker in like a super ninja the wait first of all the way he mounted if you don't do jujitsu you would never knows the way she fucking mounted and his balance you could see the balance you could see the beauty in that mount and the way he was riding him like a professional fucking a champion rodeo fucking rider all his balance is all beautiful and then when he took his back the way he put that fucking hook in there was it was so efficient there wasn't no hiccup where he hit the you know this jaw and then mmm it was fucking insanity like no show Oh perfect and so fucking like that technique was about as flawless and as beautiful as you can get yeah that was two big points was that we had never seen Connor face adversity and we had never seen him on the ground with a real Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt like Nate Nate's got a nasty ground game man his ground you know what his fuck but people are talking a lot of shit on Connors jujitsu I know cars just as good he's come to my school that guy's good just cuz he got mounted oh yeah yeah he was already here but even if he wasn't her I get mounted by my purple belt sometimes when I get my back there's some shit going on and had punches and fucking all this high just cuz he got mounted and got his back taking does not mean Connors jujitsu sucks don't get it twisted he was a little hurt Nate Diaz is really really good you know what I mean like Nate Diaz could probably do that to me doesn't mean I suck yeah you know what I mean he could probably get my back doesn't mean I suck I might you know so well he got hurt and it's real simple when you get tagged the way he got tagged and what you're trying to take Nate Diaz down he got hurt he probably had no idea what the fuck he was doing you know I haven't had an MMA fight but Shaab was telling me about when Travis Brown hit him and that he was like dude I know how to get out of the mouth but when Travis hit me he's like I didn't know what I was doing he was I was out of it I think that we unless we get punched in the face you can't judge is jiu-jitsu it's like judging is walking get head kick Connors jujitsu is good Nate Diaz jiu-jitsu is just way better you know I'm saying if that's all it is Sonny punches you in the face and then you walk funny like man you need to work on your walking no they got names of Connor and I could like him in like a kid's jiu-jitsu class they put it that's one that's going around I think that hurt you know what he's heard he is good trust me Connors jiu-jitsu is very very rusty he's no joke especially in that first round was nasty Santa looked very good he just looked first of all he's name is Nate Diaz is not a real 170 although they did fight 170 twice he fought a stun gun Kim and he fought Rory Rory MacDonald remember that fought those guys at 170 so he did have two fights at 170 but he's a 155 these are big 155 oh he's big and long I don't know if he could ever make 145 I just don't think he could do it Conor barely can do it you know Connor barely can do it when you see Connor at the weigh-ins I mean those photos from the winds are pretty legendary I think it's insane that we do this that we let these guys dehydrate themselves like that I think whatever Nate walks around at that's what he should find out and I don't know if Connor really walks around at 168 which what he weighed in and they raid 169 they're only one pound different and Nate you know Nate had some body fat on him because he wasn't it wasn't prepared for this at all I think Connor I think Connor could make some noise at 155 shrinked out you can see the two of those together can we do that look at look at the difference between how he weighed in before and how he weighed in this time I mean my god he looks like he has some fucking crazy disease that like won't let food absorbing his body on the top one you know like he's got some crazy illness and then on the bottom he looks great full-faced but you know if he can make 145 he's gonna continue to do it do you think it's especially now that ring-card girls are like sitting right there is that an accident it's perfect for the picture that's why they stand there ultimate man it's to balance out they dude in underwear that's that's funny that's funny I think he could completely dominate continue to dominate the 145 division and I think he could make a lot of epic fights at 155 five went beat some big names but then loses to some other big names like he'll be one of the top guys at 55 I don't know if he'll just clean house like he did it 45 but I believe if he stayed a 55 he would do some serious damage he's a bad motherfucker and the shitty saying after the five perfect ship perfect shit I love what is you know what I love how he's handling it I think he handled it his loss better than anybody he said on the right chillin victory and I'm being humble in defeat no matter what happened in that fight his next fight whoever he's fighting he's gonna get fucked up you know what I mean I mean what if he fights dos Anjos you know he's gonna cut him up I bet he tags him a few times I bet you're right I bet he tags and I'm betting everything hit some people and just cuz he got knocked out a lot of people everyone perhaps people get knocked out and fights yeah he got out he got he got crotch and he got choked but I'm interested to see how he handles the physicality of dos Anjos who's a lot more physical than Nate you know dos Santos is a beast I wanna I want to know if he could do to Conor what he was able to do to Nate what he was able to do to a lot of guys like Pettis what he did to Pettis you know that guys strong shit but I was so bummed out when he broke his foot like god that's a crazy fight it's always gonna be there but fucking Nate all of a sudden named that little stoner is gonna be he's probably dude he's he's super famous now he's the greatest all-time post fight line I gotta say I'm not surprised motherfucker you know it's funny you know it's dude in the beginning Conor won the verbal that battles the first couple press conferences he kind of did Connor came full-blown and then Nate Nate one towards the end utro I felt that Nate was in Connors head I think it reversed a bait I think he was pissing Conor off that he kept soon fall COO he just went gangster on America my crew will fuck up your crew like say if you want to make this fucking serious week we're gonna pass by you guys somewhere in this motherfucking hotel we'll jump you will do that you guys want to do it will actually jump you guys and it'll be all over fucking Sherdog you're Dana white what do you do with Misha dude blow her up she's huge that I might be Aegis I don't know man but give her a world tour first she won one of the greatest victories in the history of MMA down down down on the scorecards in the fourth round with two minutes to go she hits a takedown takes her back almost gets shook over the top hangs on hangs on I was so dramatic dude that was like that she fought so smart she did everything that all the experts were saying she was going to need to do she did everything she would rush in and she had to pull it off and like the what was that a minute left just like somewhere around two minutes to go when she went for the takedown when she when she got a hold of her so you're down two laughs right last round and she wasn't winning the round nothing really had happened that was like big and significant she had a takedown probably losing on the cards crappy yeah I didn't look at the cards but you know she won that one round for sure when she took her down and that what made everybody go oh shit is that the second was it the second round that she took her nose was dominating her yeah I think was a second her Misha's wrestling surprisingly her wrestling is a lot better than before before she's possibly dude she hustled she keeps getting better Holly Holm ain't easy to take down so it works to take down the fence that's like her main shit she probably works on her takedown defense more than her jujitsu this is the cards yeah so what is it saying basically what do we got here we should take this heart to do these are confusing white blue pink there's a pink card I guess they are the different people it just says the referees names okay so round nine so ten nine well who's red and who's Misha's blue yeah me she's blue on the left okay so Holly yeah so it must have been that hmm that's interesting wait wait a minute all three at ten nine for the first right all three had ten eight for the second right that makes sense and all three at ten nine for the third and for the fourth so does that make it a draw no that means Holly was ahead well how do they judge the fourth and then the fifth as she was ahead in the fourth so Holly was ahead by one point right even though she'd won three rounds yes I mean physical Tenny if she would've won that round it would have been a draw I guess Wow but she was she wasn't really one around again I'm surprised that they all gave him a 10-8 that's good that's very good good good job you know their names Markos for solids good job yeah that was uh yeah that was a real ten eight that's how ten eight should look someone takes you down beats shit out of you but just what a what a finish that was what was amazing about it you know Holly fought smart she used that sidekick a lot she's so good with her movement she caught me sure with a lot of punches to men but she wasn't she wasn't going after her she would catch her with punches and stay on the outside she was fighting a smart fight and she got taken down she got dominated on the ground by Misha and that's when I was like wow Misha's fucking top game is solid as a rock like her control is excellent and she's fucking strong man she's strong cos Holly strong Holly Holm is strong I was really impressed with her ground-and-pound really impressed with her top game but then you know what man the next round Holly Holm got right back on a fucking bicycle and and and probably in everyone's eyes won that round right yeah all those judges eyes I was to me it was if that would I wanted a decision I would have given it to Holly yeah just based on you know depending upon how that no real damage she never knocked Misha down she never hurt me sure right I was her never hurt her she tagged her a couple times where you know she snapped her head back a little bit but it wasn't anything like what she was wrong yeah yeah legs giving out no so it was it was about to be semi boring decision overall like who would want to watch that fight again the second round was kind of cool it was gonna be one of those fights but like that Misha turned it into one of the greatest fights ever amazing yeah I come back that last a second that's like a Grand Slam and the bottom of the ninth in the scramble to get to the back her scramble the way she held on as Hollywood kept moving and changing and adjusting she kept holding on then finally the Hail Mary Holly tries to flip her over the top and she hangs on yeah hangs on to the choke and sinks it in and gets the hooks in and and when Holly goes to sleep punching in the air you know you know those old NFL films like when you watch those the Super Bowl from 1978 or something of that voice yeah they're doing the slo-mo and these all these old you know memorable plays an epic plays in 20 years when they look back at that and they have some old like Orson Welles type of narrator talking about yeah yeah about going through all that transition there was a lot of drama going on there man she didn't just take her back and choke her yeah there was a lot of shit there was a lot of shit to handle so much was going on and yet watch what's happening yeah is incredible soon we're naked chokes the scramble though the scramble was just so epic because the drama building up he's down on the cards most likely we can't watch that we're watched no we can never watch that she's down on the cards most likely she's about to she's about to lose a decision probably oh my god she's got a hold of her oh my god she's on her back oh my god oh my god oh my god it's going back and then when Holly went to sleep it was like she didn't even tap she just went out she went out punching yeah she was throwing punches when she went out y'all bad ass you have to be to go out throwing punches how badass that girl is she went out she went out like throwing punches she didn't want to tap fuck that was a good fight whoa yeah it's amazing that was the best fight of the night that was that the biggest UFC ever I mean Jesus yeah the biggest UFC ever I mean I would say that the fight of the night but it's not the fight of the night it's the same they're both equally insane there's no like one better finale or one better and I think I think I think the Connor fight was more exciting because all the way through there was a lot of damage going on there was a lot of fire going on with the Holly fight that was a lot of dancing around making shots it was a lot of definitely what it was there was a lot less action overall yeah but if you compress those if you take out a couple of those rounds and compress it all into one round then yeah I see I don't think you got to be pleased by it through the whole thing I think what's most important is that after it ends you have some like definitive conclusion and if it takes a while to get to that definitive conclusion I mean it's going to there were two fire fighters are tactical you're right but because because of that they made the end so good without that that wouldn't have been so juicy at the end exactly because she had gone through the full five when they were in the fifth round and it was like we've got to see she's trying things and not working she tries this it works really good okay now Holly's trying this that's working me she's trying that that's not working okay now she's gonna start to kick when she gotta do something differently get close to her how's she gonna figure it out down on the score shoots for the fucking takedown grabs ahold of her chokes her unconscious oh my god yeah saying cuz yeah you wouldn't have been that low from that stuff yeah the police went insane insane it was so epic yeah then tell me shit ape man goddamn she was so happy she's so nice you know she's such an like her and Holly they're both so nice it's so nice to see like nice people like that do really well in such a brutal savage sport you know she's really nice like one of you ever yes sir miesha tate is never like raised her voice at anybody she's nobody Yellin did anybody she's like real friendly she's like real sweet to see her the UFC bantamweight champ I was like wow this is crazy well performance I think Holly is a little bit nicer though she's super nice too she seems like there's a super entry like wife she's the preacher's daughter she was a caller yeah she really is oh yeah it really is Wow and she's tough as fuck dude she went out punching yeah cold she's like throwing punches she just wants to get in her post hide anything she just wanted to get back into it she's like she just wants to get back in I know what I loved about the pre-fight speech when she was talking about the fight itself she was like you know what Ron it's gonna be out for a while she was I'm not fighting for money I'm not fighting for fame I want the action I want to fight a wild let's see that's how you got to think if you want to be great right it's something to focus on yeah if you want to be a Holly Holm I guess you have to be like that there's gonna be a 19 time world's women boxing champion you gotta be like a crazy motivated person she's got to she's got to fall in love with jujitsu though cuz she's not the biggest fan of Jitsu she really needs that and use this before I know I know that's that's hard to swallow you know but you got to you can't be one of those fighters that and there's a bunch of them out there that they didn't really want to get offensively good at jujitsu they didn't really have they weren't attracted to passing the garden taking the backhand Chunkin ppi there's a lot of wrestlers out there that just wanted to keep it on the feet do a little takedown defense and if you have to take them down stay in half guard and pound them out and just keep it simple and keep it like that you know if um you there's a lot of wrestlers like that not that she's wrestling they're strikers they're strikers like that too there's been quite a few throughout the years champions that didn't really want to work on their jiu-jitsu the right way the right way which is sparring with everybody and not picking her sparring opponents and just jumping in into the fire that's how I know Connors good because Connor does that and he's gonna get way better he's actually good at Jiu Jitsu just Nate is a lot better but I think Holly needs to have somehow somehow it needs to happen I don't know how but she needs to fall in love a jujitsu and and because I think that's where people know I mean that that's the spot we were ready we haven't really seen her on her back we were we haven't seen her react to jujitsu now we have and Misha just exposed her and she needs to get take that she needs to take care of that and fall in love with Jiu Jitsu and start getting on Instagram taking pictures with her gay you know name and she's got a blue belt and be all happy she's got to be really happy about it because she needs a there there's a hole right there and that's where people gonna try to take her yeah it's not that hard to take down after all I thought she'd be harder to take down but you know me she took her down well Misha mixes up our take down time she goes up top and she goes down low where as Rhonda's like upper body clinch she's really an upper body clinch so all Holly had to do it all so Rhonda in that fight was so insanely aggressive her charging after made it so much easier for counters yeah Misha was super crafty yeah she liked variation very patient varied her movement varied their timing didn't do any like like she didn't continue any patterns like with this her stand up she moved around a lot she did a lot of juking and a lot of she did a lot of different stuff stayed on the outside made Holly come after her like if you if you were if you're a really good counter striker like Holly is for her the best thing is a Ronda like someone's gonna run at her the best thing is someone running at her she's she's so fleet like her footwork so excellent she's so light on her feet that she's so good at just sliding out of the way and cracking you while you're coming in it's like one of the things she's best at so if you fight that way against her that's the kind of fight that happens she looks like a master but if you look at her fight in the very first UFC fight with Raquel Pennington she want a split decision yeah you know and that was a fight where Raquel fought more cautious a little smarter new-new Holly's background coming in you know if you don't like if you don't engage with her it's like remember when Anderson was in his prime guys came after him he just Blizzard him but if guys hung back sometimes the fight was boring right like Tallis Latos remember toss latest like hung back and he kind of waited for Anderson same thing with Patrick Cote Patrick Cote hung back he just fought smart he's like I'm not charging and running in anything come come get me come get me and Cote like I always had a big right hand so everybody had to be real careful you always had to be careful because a guy if you're coming at him he could always catch you and if a guy like Cote catches you he just had that stupid power in his hand he could knock you knocked down Tito at 205 you remember that he knocked him out down knocked him down he doesn't take a shot but he knocked him down at 205 and he fights at 170 now you know I mean Patrick Oh taking crack so Anderson never won't remember at Patrick blew his knee out in that fight yeah he like went to throw a kick and his knee just gave out sorry I exploded yeah he fought a very smart fight too and that's that stain when you fight a killer counter striker like that the big thing is like let them lead they don't they don't want to lead make it a boring fight let it be boring move around be patient me she did everything right man amazing Ronda Mischa 3 would be nice right it's probably when it's gonna happen it's probably gonna happen next according to what I've led on the Internet's over here I wonder what Rhonda would want would she want Holly we met rematch with her after a loss or a title shot if I was her rather if I was her I'd be a boy tough choice right boy I can't be her if I was her honestly I would probably I would imagine if I was her I'd want to avenge the loss because holly was her first loss and she doesn't feel like she did her best in that fight and that fight was just she had too much going on if you hear or talk about it was like there was just overwhelmed with obligations and shed and just fought wrong just didn't didn't fight correctly I just had real problems going into that and then you have like her approach like getting in Ali's face the way in trying to make it real emotional you know you fake-ass bitch and all that stuff and then all that emotions when she fought in the rain just running after Holly and Holly just fought like a master that was one of the best performances you'll ever see of a striker and negating a person's aggression like she just did it so brilliantly cashner with elbows coming in catching her with straight left's and then that fucking set up for the head kick when Ronda is all stumbling and she just catches her with that head kick I mean just a spectacular mixed martial arts performance overall like one of the best like title winning efforts in any weight class as far as like a sheer domination it's right up there with TJ Dillashaw Edinburgh wanna but more probably more scary it's one of the most spectacular highlight clips ever she's getting clipped yep Wow amazing amazing he's a badass you know so what I think about Holly is you know Holly get back on track and I I really hope that she takes that advice that you just gave I think that'd be real smart you've gotta somehow phone and not fight it no more well I don't know if she fights it I don't know what the deal is who knows yeah you know she's just so good at kickboxing I think she just wants to stay sharp in that and that's what she wants to do to girls because she feels like she has this big advantage in them against them in that but obviously she needs a little work on it and I think she'll get better man she can she can still improve you know and I think maybe there's also the overwhelming pressure that must come from being a champ like that experience probably takes a while to learn to navigate I hope I'm wrong and she's already in love with that that would be awesome if I was wrong you know I'm rooting for Holly I like Holly I think Holly how could you not Holly with of course how could I not like it I'm just being real I'm sorry if it hurts anybody no no no I think what you're saying is important I hope and I hope that I'm wrong I hope like you have no idea she's totally into it she's been all she just hasn't worked on it that long or whatever or whatever but that's I would love to see Holly home with a recipe for back and dangerous off her back there's no reason why she couldn't be she's super athletic she has a crazy work I think [Music]
