hmm all right here we go how are you Zebulon good to see you good to see you how did you get involved with the cove what was the the history behind that when I give you the long version Shore there's a good friend of mine Jim Clark the guy that started Netscape Silicon Graphics WebMD I wanted a film I was doing a story for Geographic back in 1995 I think it came out I was on the information revolution and Jim Clark was sort of the you know the Steve Jobs of my generation right and he don't wanna be photographed he's just too busy and then I started working for Fortune magazine and he had built a boat at the world's tallest mast I think at that point and it was went over to Amsterdam to film him and we hit it off and it you know he said would you teach me how to be a good photographer and you know he made three companies from scratch worth over a billion dollars and I said well if you teach me how to be a billionaire I'll teach you how to be a great photographer and then we would travel all over the world taking pictures for about the next ten years and we did mostly underwater photography he built the best underwater camera ever made by an order of magnitude it was just a piece of work as Jim doesn't do anything half-ass and every time we would go to a dive site and come back to it you see this shifting baseline where there's less fish there's less coral in fact he took me to the place and pop into Guinea celui i'ma take it to the best place I've ever seen it's an infant Papa New Guinea we flew over there all day to get there a day and a half to sail we dive on the GPS coordinates and it's rubble is completely gone and this would happen not all the time but a lot we don't know what the you know the insults work had been dynamite fishing could have been it could have been anything who knows what it was but the I think it's the third time that we were in the Galapagos Jim turned to me and said something like you know somebody should do something about this we saw fishermen illegally fishing in a Marine Sanctuary and sort of empowered by the success that he's had in business and seeing how he could change the world and his business I said how about you and I he said what he mean it so we'll use your money and my eye and we'll make films and the first well then I you know so I'm jumping careers at this stage I'm going from a being fairly successful you know still photographer really busy to a career where I had really no business doing it I never really made a film before not even really a short film and so I'm you know nervous I'm feeling sort of full of myself like I'm I started this great career we're down the Caribbean on a boat and my kid starts with Jim on vacation with our families and my kid starts playing on the beach with another kid it happens to be Steven Spielberg's kid so Steven comes over onto the boat to meet Jim and I he he made Jurassic Park using Jim's computers with you know Silicon Graphics and after I had Steven alone for a few seconds I said do you have any advice for a first-time filmmaker he said you said yeah never make a movie involving boats or animals oh great and of course the first film we did was the cove but you're not you don't have actors and special effects and boats and animals it's just a part of the story it's not like you're like with him I think when he's meeting like jaws exactly and yeah because you know you have to match shots especially all that but it has its own set of you know trying to keep the horizon level on a boat you don't want to give the audience seasickness and but you know I would add to that like don't do a movie where people want to kill you because when we did the cove it was you know was exciting but dangerous work yes yeah look that movie changed a lot of people's minds and opened up a lot of people's eyes to the horrors of the way dolphins are slaughtered and and what you know we were just talking about this before the podcast I think they are as intelligent as human beings I just think the difference is they can't change their environment they don't affect their environment the way we do they don't build houses they don't have cars they don't send emails so we don't appreciate what they are but when we look at the complexity of their brains the fact that their cerebral cortex is 40% larger human beings they have this incredibly complex language that we don't even really totally understand we can Peck out to understand any of it yeah I mean we could pass out patterns mean the scientists have I mean you know I'm sure you're aware John lilies work sure John Lily mean for years and and didn't like really weird unconventional ways he tried to take acid and communicate with dolphins and it's one of the reasons why he keep he created the sensory deprivation tank we actually have one of those over here and Lily for they were forever trying to figure out some way to figure out some method of communication where they were trying to get the Dolphins to talk like people and we would try to make their noises and to no avail yeah I mean they're obviously extremely complex people you know of animals and if you you know judging by our value like people say all these you know they didn't invent you know the car and write computers but you know the intelligence can be seen as your ability to you know to live exist in your environment yes and by that standard you know I mean put us in the water right and you know have a go at it yeah how we do they don't eat anything in that world they travel through three-dimensional space I mean it's it's incredible what they can do yeah and you know they're like well I but you know it's not just dolphins - it's I mean they look at you know butterflies monarch butterflies they they it takes three generations for them to go - to migrate from Canada down to a six hectares in northern Mexico and they do that somehow they find it you know every every year and I could you know I couldn't find the studio without an iPhone right you know so I mean what's what's goin we don't even have a clue on how most the world works and you know were you know the second film I worked on a racing extinction you know that's about we're going through a mass extinction right now we're exterminating this stuff these animals before we have a chance to even know how they operate how about the the ecosystem how it even works right the friend of mine said it's like you know we're burning down the Library of Congress before we have a chance to know what the books are you know yeah well that's what they did with the Library of Alexandria that's why we don't really totally understand how they built the pyramids but what disturbs me is this egocentric approach that we have towards the towards marine life in particular because of the most intelligent versions of life that we know other than ourselves that we for some reason universally have accepted up until really recently because of your film and because of blackfish and you know more awareness and sea Shepherd and all these different organizations that trying to let people know like you got to pay attention to what this is because I think history I think when all said and done we're gonna look at this as some insane slaughter of like what's basically like water people they're like some form of super intelligent life that some cultures have just decided are just competitors in in the fishing market yeah well if you can't agree with you more I mean I think it's and I think that was the shock of the cove that you see our counterparts in the ocean and being treated like that and I think you know when you look at the way we made that film it was you know we pretty much told the story what's going on in the oceans by looking at that Cove and William Blake said to see the world in a grain of sand but we could look at you know in that film we talked about overfishing and you know listen to reason reason that they shouldn't be eaten besides that they're sentient intelligent is this also that they're toxic you know you know their meat is now their flesh is now them some of the most toxic you know waste in the world when you bury him you know there's I think six six thousand times more PCBs than you know was in the background in the ocean there was you know all all the the flesh that's been tested in in Japan in the last 20 years has between five and five thousand times more mercury than allowed by Japanese law if it was a fish but it's a mammal of course so Zane you know just hearing that is insane interesting story I was when we were making that film there was a point we went down to the IWC the International Whaling Commission meeting down in an in Chile and we were trying to get a an interview with some of the top people there from that run the organization because you know whales dolphins are and we had the footage at that point and we're just hoping to get an interview with somebody that worked for the International Whaling Commission and thus I think was going from Houston to Santa Santiago the plane was full I couldn't even sit next to the you know my partners on the my buddies and the on the film crew there's one empty seat next to me and you know they're waiting for somebody else to come from another flight and right before the plane door closes in come secure knock oh my he's the head of overseas fishing for Japan that the head bull glue Celine Looney and he sits down right next to me I'm looking at my buddies you know on the plane thinking oh my god if there is a God you know he has a good sense of humor so he says sit down next to me I didn't want you know him to like find out who I was and then move so I waited til dinner was served like an hour or two later and I said do you have an idea of who I am he said no he's I know who you are and I want to show you a film yeah so we had a we had a condensed version of it you know probably about 12 or 15 minutes of it at that point I showed it to him and I said how do you reconcile killing these sentient intelligent animals when you know that they're there their flesh is poisoned you know and you're there's recommendations for pregnant women to eat this you know this was flesh you know on on the Genesee apon ease Ministry of Health site and he said I'm not in charge of food safety I'm in charge of food security in other words he's he doesn't have to worry about the health consequences always he has to his job is just provide enough meat on the plate for the for Japanese people and it gives you an insight of how he's thinking you know he's in charge of I think there's 145 million people in Japan and an area about the size of our California and he said seventy percent of of the the land area and Japan is only you know good enough for growing crops on or living on or we have to live you know turn to the sea for food and at that point they were also caught skimming stealing about two hundred thousand tons of endangered bluefin tuna this is over about a twenty year period now the when you start talking about big numbers like that I can't imagine you know it's hard to imagine it but imagine like how are they stealing this tune well they're they have quotas and they're exceeding their quotas every year which means that they're taking away from other countries so it's not just like the the everybody every country has their allotment and once you've reached it you're supposed to go home but the Japanese kept on getting more so that the Australians actually caught them you know they figured out over this twenty year period that they went through the books and saw what they reported and was actually sold at the skeezy market found out they say it's Kim two hundred thousand tonnes that's five big train cars we like trains full of you know endangered to know like that cars but the whole trains like 110 car trains five of them folds weird to just reconcile the idea that tune is endangered you know you think of tuna as being something that you just get at the store like tuna tune is a weird one right because it's such a common food it's in cans you you see it at the sushi place you know what I'm saying like you hear that tune is endangered most people like its to an endangered like they're hearing this cone is tuna endangered but when you talk to people to work at the fish market they'll very clearly tell you that there's a radical difference between the amount of tuna that was available 30 40 years ago versus now ten years ago I mean we're down to the bluefin tunas particulars down to about ninety it's down to four percent of their historical levels that's incredible yeah and and there's no way to stop this there's no I mean it seems like it's everyone's waiting for someone else to do something and during the meantime everyone's just trying to make money a lot of money yeah unfortunately it's sort of what happens with endangered species the the more rare becomes more valuable it becomes and so there's very little incentive to do the right thing and you know but this is happening with all the fish stocks I mean I probably gave our buy run a little organization called the oceanic Preservation Society and I probably gave out more seafood guides than anybody on the planet this is a Monterey Steve seafood you know god watch is like even like what what fish are sustainable and I've seen them you know go through the fish docks and so less and less you know we started at the big animals and we start you know slowly go through all the fish docks until like we're you know like McDonald's used to do halibut now it's Pollock which is a very small you know white fish from Alaska and now that's been you know how to to extinction so we're going through these fish stocks it's you know that's shifting baseline where you're seeing you know each successive generation adapts to the diminishment of the the previous one that's what's going on so I just stopped you know handing out seafood guys and now I'm trying to sort of preempt it so I don't think you know the big question is there's seven and a half billion of us on this planet soon to be ten is there enough wild animals to defeat us all there isn't you know you look at the biomass of mammals on the planet you know between livestock and humans we we occupied 96% of the biomass of mammals on the planet four percent of wild mammals and then you know so we can't all be eating wild fish you know we think about that you know you never go out and say look let's get some land food they say you know we we commodified you know see how that is interesting right you know say land food that's a really good point you know they did at the turn of the century I mean during the late 1800s rather there was market hunting and North America and a lot of the soldiers were done with world with the civil war rather they were hunting and they hunted all the deer the bear the antelope the Buffalo and they got down to like incredibly low numbers you know elk to this day I think are only in 10% of their original range that that they were at in the 1700s and that was all from market hunting from people just going out buying you know meat from these market hunters that have shot these things and they didn't really have refrigeration back then so it wasn't like they could freeze it and store it and they got down to these incredibly low levels until Teddy Roosevelt and a lot of other people that were conservation minded realize like what was happening here and they put a stop to it all and then started enacting programs to reintroduce these animals to the the areas where their extirpated and now you see historic levels of especially white-tailed deer there's more whitetail deer in America now than were when Columbus landed so so but that's Ben's except but it's also that's a weird one too because white-tailed deer almost a farm animal because there's so many of them that exist in Iowa and Kansas and around farmlands like they literally exist in fields and a lot of them live off of GMO crops that's very strange so like I have a buddy mine my friend Doug doctorin who has this huge piece of land in Wisconsin and he's like the deer in my area are essentially eating these GMO corn they're eating Monsanto corn like this is so weird like the yeah they're wild but they're also kind of farm animals you know because they in they exist in record numbers because they've got so much food to eat and no predators yeah I mean the only predators they have there I mean they they have some wolves now very few in some some parts of the Driftless area in Wisconsin I think to have they have some bears too and coyotes a lot of coyotes it will kill a lot of the fawns I lived in Boulder Colorado for a while and we had a lot of bears and mountain lions come through our yard because we were right at the base of the foothills of the Rockies and a neighbor I woke up one morning the neighbors like looking at his minivan there's a big dent on the side and he's trying to figure out like how to get a dent because it was parked here all night and he found an antler in the bushes I thought well what the hell out it and then the question is how does a deer run into it and then in the paper the next day there was a picture of a mountain lion house down the block sitting on a hot tub cover this is in the winter holding a deer with one you know in his mouth with one antler oh so the attack didn't slammed it into oh Jesus Christ I lost a dog in Boulder to mountain lion Wow yeah I had a little dog who's part American Eskimo and part Pomeranian a mountain lion got it the mountain lion I think got our cat yeah they get everything up there man if it's not them it's a fox you know there's a lot of foxes up there to get things but god it's beautiful yeah boulders are just incredible incredible place and you'll be driving down the road and you see it's weird like the deer in Boulder know that they're safe so like we were we were looking at this house in Boulder and we opened up the door to the backyard and there was this enormous deer just standing there staring at us and my wife thought it was fake I go no that's a real deer she's like what and then it just turns his head and starts moving around because it wasn't even remotely freaked out that there were people stoned throw away from it they're just so used to being around people it's weird you know the neighborhood remembered neighborhood VARs planning rose bushes on the front of their property and you know all proud and then I remember it's driving home like later on that day and there's a deer coming this is snipping the tops of the Roses salad bar yeah many people have turned on deer because of the loss of their gardens the roses especially they love roses yeah it's um is there anybody that has ever come up with any sort of a plan to do what they did for wild animals in North America because it but you can't regulate it the way you can wild animals because in wild animals if they have a particular area you could make it so people can't go in that area but the ocean is so enormous like how is anybody come up with some sort of a repopulation plan sure sure there's a eel Wilson I'm on the board of the advisory board of his this group is called the you know the half of the half-life project you know who yell Wilson knows to know okay eel Wilson is a Harvard professor it has two pilasters for his work on in biology he's a wrote the book on biodiversity he's considered the father of modern biodiversity is about getting the right around 90 years old now but looking at he would do things like go to an island and pretty much exterminate everything on it and then try to figure out well you know at what rate did the animals come back and what's what's sustainable and he's figured out that to save 85% of the we had the wild animals on the planet you had to put aside half of it for them you know that's hassle of the plant have to plan it yeah so the ocean you would have to literally make half the ocean where people couldn't travel in it on the travel and it does not exploit it you know no fish yeah no fishing and so Sylvia Earle is working on hot spots you know these they're called I think what she calls it's like a like like Blue Zones where you know you have a lot of biodiversity you know try to keep those away from fishing exploitation how do they do that though like how I mean it's you would have to get everybody on board right yeah well the the high seas are you know that's that's tough right yeah though the Japanese we're fishing in a you know in an international Marine Sanctuary for decades you know so you have to you know this really tough when you have organizations that really don't have any teeth to it it's that the the attitude that he has that pragmatic attitude about feeding a population you almost can sympathize with him right mean a hundred plus million people in this tiny place the size of California and just pulling mostly fish out of the ocean I mean it's a it's a crazy place to be in terms of his position yeah I'm you know I don't envy it at all but you know what do you do don't slaughter dolphins that's what you do yeah well we're endangered species or I mean I don't know what's you know what's sustainable anymore is it it possible to I mean I know they've done this in in some places outside of Hawaii where they've they've bred animals fish rather like sushi fish like hamachi and they've had these pens set up and then a lot of times a storm will come by like a huge storm and they break these pens and then those fish get wild then people start catching them yeah well that's I mean like salmon like well you know I went they were trying to in Japan when we were doing the cove we went to a university where they were breeding the first bluefin tuna these are from eggs you know so this is one like like what they do it some places where they they catch them then they put him in these pens and they fatten him up these were their make making bluefin from scratch basically from eggs and really hard to do really skittish and when I went there they were shoveling this this back when I ate fish they were shoveling these mackerels like what I would feed my family with like a family of four they were shoveling it to the tuna and I said hold on a minute like how many how many how much you know mackerel does it take to make a pound of tuna I said oh about seven four up until about a hundred fifty pounds and after that it takes 14 pounds so seven pounds of wild fish to make one pound of farm-raised fish I mean this is like going to the bank and you know you know because you want to Chris five dollar bill and say let me give me this you know here's a couple couple 20s Wow but that's good you know if you look at you know what are they feeding you know a lot of these fish they're feeding him you know it's the farm animals yes wild fish and I was just reading this morning of Los Angeles magazine that and the cover it says you know fish fish are fucked and it has in it talks about like the fish that are raised and I don't know the data behind it that they're they have eight times more pollutants in it than wild fish I know if it's what they're feeding or maybe because they were sitting in a they're stationary I think that's a big part of the problem no yeah no apparently they don't taste as well when we were in Hawaii recently we went scuba diving and you know snorkeling so you jump off the boat yeah swimming around and you know what's really fuckin weird about that is how few fish there are like when you're under there you're like you expect you're gonna dunk your head underwater with those goggles on you're gonna see all this wildlife all these fish swimming around the snails not much yeah not see much yeah there was a about ten years ago I was down the Caribbean a friend was getting married and I took his daughter out you know I didn't know it at the time but is her first time snorkeling and we were in an area tide been to about 20 years before and there was nothing there was nothing there it was just like a desert yeah and then I heard her screaming through a snorkel I thought what what's what's wrong and she was screaming because she saw a single orange tang that was the only life-form we saw there where I used to see clouds of schools of these orange and blue tang now there was nothing my god she thinks that that's beautiful and it is it's just you know the single fish but you know again a shifting baseline the generation before when I was there is probably look like the Land Before Time right these places I went to with with Clark you know Raja on pot where you see you know if you go to the Caribbean you might see thirty fish on a different species of fish in a dive and Raja Ampat you see 300 and it was just miraculous and when you're taking pictures you actually see more detail with the picture than you can with your own you're I can't comprehend it also it's only when you get back and you see these reefs that we've you know we lit like jewel boxes you see how much life that there is there but there was just unbelievable stunning amounts of wildlife but that's going on all over the world in the Great Barrier Reef you know we lost over half the Great Barrier Reef in the last two years it was never that good anyway you know 15 years ago I you know after being to these some of the best preserved places in the world that had been to a Clark we looked at the Gary book Great Barrier Reef and we'd be like oh my god this is not that great now they've already then they've lost half again so I mean if you're just putting your head in the water for the first time and you come from you know Iowa Wisconsin or Boulder that looks pretty good but if you knew what came before that you're seeing this this you know salt against you know nature going on what is taking out the Great Barrier Reef it's we're heating the planet we're heating the water it's a it's it's bleaching so there's a couple things there's multiple insults you have runoff from fertilizer and pesticides from an agriculture you have the heating of the water these these events wouldn't when I say it it's dying it's dying it's not like oh it's gonna come back ones once the coral is dead that's it it's it's not going to come back this is a sunscreen play a part in that as well and probably not there it's pretty it's fairly remote like over in Hawaii it would or there was a Caribbean but it's pretty remote you have to get out several miles to at the Great Barrier Reef and it's if the further north you go the more isolated as we went the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef and it didn't look it got slightly better as you got north but there's only a couple boats there it's not like you have you know thousands and hundreds of thousands of tourists out and about on the beach you know the other thing is acidification the burning of fossil fuels is a Fitness acidifying the oceans is now about 30 percent more acidic than it was you know 50 years ago and when do you make you know there's more carbonic acid in the water it makes it harder for the the corals to survive and it's basically have these multiple insults going on at the same time it's probably not just one thing but there was a massive bleaching about two years in a row no Great Barrier Reef and so it's it's disappearing in our lifetime that's you know but if you look at we have a we have a the last coral berry reef in America is down in Florida and they have like semi treated sewage coming out of these off Falls that Lake if you swim through these you know I've been out there you know on these beaches you could literally talk to somebody on the beach or scream to them on the beach and they have the this green water coming out of sewer pipes 200 meters away 300 meters away and so they're dumping you know semi treated sewage on the last reef in America this is going on all around the world and you know what we do I don't know but we this is the last generation that we have that can actually do something about it because we're seeing it disappear in our watch and that's what I'm trying to do is try to not just create the awareness that something's going on that we have to do something but try to create action now when you say semi treated sewage what do you mean by that well that's that's what they reported so it's it it smells like sewage it smells like crap but if you if you go to the website it says it's just semi treated I don't know they they're not you know putting it through the aerators they're not going through the whole system but it smells like shit to me you know you come out of the water and it's like you know we all stink you so now I said you know this is this is at the but by the way this is a Hollywood Fort Lauderdale border this is not like legal I mean this is not a third-world country like how is the United States allowing them to pump semi treated sewage it's a very good question you know there's there's so many things to work on I know get the the activists down there working on the sirs trying to get people to see it to know that the is going on and if you know I think they close the beaches down when you know when the wind shifts and Hill starts to push it on shore but if you saw if you were on the beach and you saw what was going on there you wouldn't be sending your kids Sarah you wouldn't be going to Florida if you knew what was going on on that beach we can make arguments about whether or not you should go to Florida all day long and I'm with you a hundred percent but I just can't imagine that they would allow this and that I mean how much more would it cost to treat it versus semi treated how much more would it cost I don't know it's not let's do what they're doing so good question saying and then they that they close the beach when the when the water shifts and the wind shifts and heads towards the shore and people get sick and they probably don't even house Christ yeah I mean you know we'd be out that when we were out one out fall day that's what the calming out fall is basically a sewer pipe you know nothing's happening and all of a sudden a destroyer to hear this Rumble and then you see oh just this green Oh God and it's in it we're not talking like a little drain pipe to like literally you could swim through it not stand in it that it's big like four feet five feet tall now why I mean why are they allowing I mean does anybody have an argument for why that's money money matters cause because less it might cost money to treat sewage Jesus Christ though that's insane well there's a lot of things like that but it seems like someone someone should be held accountable for that like whatever it caught cost-benefit that they've decided is worth polluting the ocean by pumping sewage into it well you know that's a good question when we did - now that I recall this is like five years ago we tried to get an interview with the key people down there but try to like if you if you're gonna talk to somebody about this nobody wants to go on record to talk about it because it's it's really bad for tourism it's you know and it's not good for the political your video of it can we show video well this is yeah I need to see it race it or it's and racing extinction second film I did this oh look at that there we go oh that's so disgusting four months ago maybe Wow Wow it is just a gigantic pipe pumping green shit into the ocean was it green by the way quite sure it'll be the color under the water - you said there's a green when you saw it as well right yeah yeah yeah well treated as it's treated much better that way well everything everything everything in the spectrum there's a little bit of blue or green look at all the food coloring look at that that's fuck what is that fish yeah fish sandwich they can they can eat eat crowd Christ yeah and build theirs then the fishermen fish on a - oh Jesus Christ to catch fish that are eating shit look at that that is insane well looking at this pipe and it looks like like a cloud of poison is is being jettisoned out of this pipe and into the ocean then the important part is if you came up you would see people on the beach Oh God I mean and we're not talking about like you know miles out at sea we're talking about how we in America I mean I know Florida's barely America but how in America is that possible yeah it's a really good question we tried that you know we try to explore some of these issues but trying to get somebody to talk on the record about this is really difficult is there any other part of the country that has something like that not that I know fuck in Florida Jesus Christ of course it's Florida I mean is there a place that it's so worthy of all the stereotypes like Florida is it seems like every time you think you've had enough look at all these fish just swimming in the shit that surface looks like it's boiling when all over come Oh God shit boiled shit boil in Florida and look at the ground it's all just covered with algae well that's kind of a point like what I'm saying is like you know we always think somebody else should be doing something about this yeah you know that's why we do films is not just to create the awareness and you know to try to get something done about it when we do we know when we did the cove they were killing about 23,000 dolphins and porpoises every year for human consumption and I think the last time I think 17 was the last reports of how many to kill death he was 69 intent the sole vote total so like a 93 percent drop since we did that film because every time that Ric O'Barry he's the guy that captured and trained the five female dolphins that collectively played the part of flipper every time that we talked in the Japanese press we try to use the word mercury because that's their Achilles heel now we can say you know both if you talk to yeah if you talk to the Japanese the people from the IDC of course they're out of that now if they've quit the IWC they'd say well what about cows pigs and chickens you know they're pretty essentially intelligent too and we say well that's the mercury now how many people are eating dolphin meat less you know I think less because of the film when we were there they were feeding it to school kids and the school children it's the young mind like infants or you know prenatal that has the most dilatory effects of mercury you know because your neurons are just developing and they had hatched a scheme to to have for school lunch programs all over America and in Japan unlike an America you have to eat everything on your plate so it's almost like you were force-fed to poison because of the film that stopped so I mean films could be really powerful you know - yeah that's amazing the film is so disturbing man well you know that it is and you know it's a when Mark Monroe the writer he came up with the name The Cove I said it sounds like a horror film he goes well I mean look if we're right and these are water people I mean essentially as intelligent if not more what I mean you were saying that the complexity of their brains is more you know the more density for neurons like the the folds of the brains if you look at if you did a slice of a brain it looks like a fjord right and there's there's more convolutions with a with a dolphin there's more surface area for neurons and of course those neurons you know more neurons you have the more connections you're making and what their act and they have to actually have a god there's a spindle neurons that they have for that are for developing complex emotions you know if you look at orcas you know they're they're really tight net communities of a male Orca won't you know will spend most of us life not more than a body length away from its mother the entire time until it goes to do what it does these animals are really social and they're communicating at levels that like you said what we don't even know what they're saying yeah with like the average person can hear from you know 50 Hertz to 20,000 kilohertz and they can hear I think they can communicate communicate up to 200,000 so there's a whole band worth like an order of magnitude more bandwidth that they're actually communicating with and we hear like a little squeak up but if you slow it down and break it down there's actually you know there's there's there's more patterns in there then we can sense that what's interesting about about whales blue whales blue whales are really solitary creatures they're you know they're not gregarious like dolphins they don't usually hang out in big you know groups but down in the Southern Ocean it was confounding people like how do they find the krill bloom that happens in a different area you know hundreds of thousands of miles apart how did they you know they all find it and one of the researchers Roger Payne came up with this idea and it was through the work with the Navy that there's a something called the deep ocean channel it's basically between the surface of the water and the thermal layer that's it fluctuates depending on where you're at in the column let's say 500 feet they they basically use their voice which is the one of the loudest voices in the in the animal kingdom is so loud but it's infrasound you can't hear it and they'll use it it almost gets propagated like a like the Internet but Ruth that layered that the so it's bouncing up and imagine that it's bouncing up to the surface and down to this this cold layer and it can go for literally thousands of miles and that is so they it's called reciprocal altruism as the theory is that they won when one finds it they start singing and that notifies the rest of the group that this is where the krill bloom is and then they can all survive there's a friend of mine Chris Clark dr. Chris Clark from over in Cornell University he was he was there's a there's a string of pearl hydrophones that the Navy's is called SOSUS in a mid-atlantic ridge and it was a you know it was designed to listen for Russian submarines back in the Cold War but they opened it up to some researchers and Chris is one of the first ones to you know if you're a researcher listening to whales you you go out in your little boat and you drop a hydrophone in and you can usually think that's amazing looking at hear sounds everywhere there's you know everything is basically singing down there from crackling shrimp up to blue whales and you know so you have this impression that man I just you know dropped in on this this conversation I don't know what's being said but like that's it feels pretty special now he goes to SOSUS and they have like a back then it was like a like an underground bunker full of like people with three screens back before anybody had three screens and everybody's listening to you know for the for submarines and he can he sees that the out of board is lit up in the whole world he's seen wherever the the blue whales are singing or the you know that all these whales is this little it up like a Christmas tree and they're trying to what the Navy was trying to do is to filter through the voices of what they called the biologicals to to pinpoint the submarines but he was like oh my god this is like the holy grail for listening to whales because they have the they can tell what's going on on a ocean ecosystem level when he could just said you know you imagine one guy in a boat out there trying to listen no again all of a sudden has all this incredible data and he could track animals and these animals like blue whales that they'll ping and they can basically send out a wave and they can see thousands of miles away you know you know with with their you know with their other extra senses Wow Jesus that's incredible and we just met just imagine that ability to to pick up all those extra patterns that we don't even hear so we don't even understand exactly what kind of data they're getting from each other we don't know what it means either so we we know there's something right yeah there's a friend of mine I don't know if he would only talk to his name's Britt cell-cell Vitali he's working with this another friend of his ASA to try to use AI to figure out what animals are saying I know he's talked about it before so I think it's a with the press so I think it's okay if I mention it but I've been sending it to people like Roger Payne and Chris Clark these other researchers I know because they're these huge databases and he's we're trying to use AI to see if they can figure out you know using computers what these animals are saying and I think that's the holy grail for getting us get for letting us care about these animals if we can we know what they're saying I think that changes the game yes means what Roger Payne you know when it's just in the code but when you know he's the guy that well he and his wife found out that these animals are determined that these at the end was like humpback whales are singing you know these strange beautiful sounds I don't know do you want to Jimmy pull up like songs of the humpback whale yeah we'll find something to play that these animals were actually singing you know it was actually his wife Katie pain that figured it out and he wrote up the paper with it with another guy but like joyously singing yeah like it like you know she would have 100 humpback well we have an issue with playing I can't but yeah that sex had been sold so it's a copy written yeah yeah a lot of times we do that we'll get pulled off of youtube oh okay yeah because somebody owns that which is hilarious right they own the sound of nature which is like what you can probably if you know if you go on to the website of the Cornell ornithology lab I think I think they're probably some stuff that you could play with it's not copyrighted excuse me I think so now look it's tough it's gonna be real tough though because somebody may own it that may not know that somebody else owns it an agent for the world protecting it and trying to get an agent for well some CAA hey we want to get paid you fucks are you aware what's going on with the resident Orca pod outside of Seattle yeah yeah which it's a this very strange situation where the salmon have dwindled radically and this resident pod only eats salmon they only what is it Chinook so they only eat chinook salmon and so these the ones that migrate the migratory orcas are fine because the marine mammals the mostly seals and these poor resident ones do not want to eat anything other than salmon and so they're literally starving to death and they're trying to figure out ways to feed them ya know I was working on that story for the last year or so on a different aspect of it that was a co-directing on the film I was doing the Russia portion there was the Russians had illegally caught a hundred and one cetaceans about in 87 roughly belugas and about 11 orcas illegally for the Chinese market I was covering that part of the Chinese market of marine shows yeah yeah there's no well you know the cove and black fish in particular have been really effective about shutting down you know in a massive way that amount of people going to thank God Joe's but in China they haven't got the message so there I think there was 25 new dolphin parks opening up in China alone this year you know so it's you know it's like whack-a-mole and the Russians were providing but know that and that story when I was in Russia this is like one of those amazing situations Putin on a State of the Union addressed announced that they were going to release the whales back you know from the whale jail that were caught over him in eastern Russia so we ran over to Vladivostok and covered that portion of the story but to answer your question there's another co-director that was working on the northwest and the Lummi indians were going out to feed you know they from their stock of of a farm raised salmon they were feeding the animals but that's you can't that's not sustainable cuz their event there is so they move around yeah you can't find them sometimes that the solution seems to be to get rid of a lot of the dams yeah this it's a kind of an unpopular position with some people but they're not if anymore they're holding up the you know the the whole ecosystems are being together because that well you know the one of them that they initially want when they set it up they didn't even realize what they were doing this wasn't like the 1930s or something like that were they you know they had hundreds of thousands of salmon just coming to this wall and not understanding what the fuck's going on and dying there there's a friend of mine I'm a co-director in film about plastics with Josh Murphy did a film called artificial and it's about just this you know the the craziness of raising salmon for fishermen to fish you know because and it gets really expensive when you start looking at like what that what you know what you think is a wild salmon you know what it actually cost to raise it sometimes it's like thousands of dollars per fish you know because there's so few of them actually come through and get back but what is this Jamie this is pattern radio so this is a I did reset the website but it says that you can explore yourself to find humpback whale songs and make your own discoveries I use AI to explore thousands of hours of humpback whale songs and make your own discoveries so I'll play some of it yeah there's a lot to dig through here but it's a really cool looking site anybody wants go check it out [Music] [Applause] what's that heavy-duty pattern over to the left Jenny no to the left sorry yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] whoa really what about those long bars right next to it yeah no they were over through the right no no the long ones the long ones like just to the right of that image yeah if you if that was coming out of space you'd be like what yeah we'd be like we have to go immediately I've often said that about Bigfoot that we everyone carry shut off people are so interested in Finding Bigfoot but if you found Bigfoot what would it be it would be basically a big chimpanzee or something right another big primate we already know about primates are amazing we know about no but if you found if an orca wasn't real and someone said hey there's this thing it's as smartest people maybe smarter it lives in the ocean but it breathes air and it swims around these incredible pods and they're they're really tight communities and communicate with each other with this language that we have had our best linguists try to decipher we have no idea what the fuck they're saying you know you'd be like what kind of animal is that it would be a crazy mythical creature you know like The Creature from the Black Lagoon or the you know Loch Ness monster or something it would be like some incredible thing if you ever found one people would be freaking out we get so used to things being real and I think we're just used to them and unfortunately because of things like you know Free Willy and you know and it going to see SeaWorld shows where the doing flips are fish and everybody's clapping people have got it in their head that this is just the thing it's a normal thing but what they are is like one of the most fantastic creatures that the world has ever known and all of the billions of years of life on this planet there's two things that are mind blowers in terms of like their intelligence one of them is us the other one is them all the marine mammals whether it's whales dolphin I mean whales are amazing because of their size but whales dolphins and and and and orcas and obviously orcas are cousins of whales but they're those things are there's some of the most spectacular creatures that the the the the biodiversity of the earth has ever created I I agree I mean you know when you're watching a dolphin show you're what watching a spectacle of dominance you're watching slaves yeah I mean listen um you know this is a nice room you know we have plenty of water and that you know if we needed food and we had to do backflips for it after a couple weeks they've do you and I would be doing here exactly exactly and that's what it does yeah exactly we oh we you know on this this film I was working on we uncovered some some information between at Sea World and this is the the the trainer's talking to management about you know an animal that's not performing well and then they get the vets involved and the vets say have you tried caloric deprivation you know so there's actually emails in Nevada they'll never tell you that they're starving an animal to get it to do tricks but there's young enthusiasts now know that the dr. imagine that if you went to you know a university and like his grades are down what should we do starve them you imagine if that was your kid you dad they don't we don't want to give me any food because I'm doing well poorly in history like what yeah or you know to perform better with the sports I guess would be a better now yeah Jesus Christ I mean that's essentially what they do with the the Cuban Olympic wrestling program Yoel Romero who was one of the top UFC fighters came out of the Cuban wrestling program and he said that the elite athletes get to eat three times a day but the people that are under them get D twice a day yeah and they set up this insane competition so that they're they're hunted so that the elite athletes are hunted by the guys coming up they want to make sure that you know they only develop the best of the best you know and his is this crazy Cuban accent with his broken English she's like hit darn you ain't oh I'm a gene that's how he talks you know and he's just a he's an unbelievable freak athlete and of why he's so spectacular is because they came up through this ruthless program Wow yeah it's horrible but the results are pretty spectacular it's you know it's just to me I mean I have a very close relationship with a guy named Phil dimers who has been involved in a decades-long lawsuit with Marineland in Canada he was a walrus trainer and you know that story yes and he they the walrus bond with humans when they're babies and he bonded with this walrus named smooshy and I'm today I believe she's the only one that's alive Marineland has a horrible record of animal rights I mean it's it's a he mean the way Phil puts it he goes it makes SeaWorld look like paradise for dolphins and orcas and he was an orca trainer there too and a dolphin trainer and you know he worked with these these people that over there and just I mean horrific stories of what it's like and to see these animals just living in hell just tortured and then they have no chance to ever find their family again they were they were pulled from their mother when they're a baby now here there are you know 15 years old stuck in a swimming pool developing ulcers they're their dorsal fin the collapsing collapses and atrophies I mean it it's it's so crazy that it's still legal like that after blackfish SeaWorld didn't just shut get shut down by the government and that people didn't just boycott them in mass you know their stock was a TED talk I have I showed the stock price of what one thing I was at at Sundance for the premiere of a blackfish and I went down and talked to the you know the people that made the film afterwards and I said we're gonna be the best thing that ever happened to you because at that point I think we had like six hundred fifty thousand followers and then we helped to organize like you know getting musicians to you know to stop performing there and and we sent a copy of blackfish in the cove to all the ten major everybody has sat at the board of directors that it backed seaworld you know so we you know everybody that sat on the board got a copy of that that that film and then when their there's I can't remember because it was their earnings came out that that quarter it just their stock value just fell down from 32 to like 16 they lost like a you know a billion dollars in value almost overnight and you know but now it's back up it's back up and like the 20s I think really yeah so you know they're doing other things too they're they're trying to you know to you know do rides and you know do what the other theme parks are doing and try to get away from that business but it's still happening it should be illegal I mean it's it's it's really simple it should be illegal it's once you look at the data what we understand about their intelligence what we understand about the way they've captured these things and taking them from their families and with the understand a close-knit or just the nature of these orca pods the fact that it's not illegal it's just it's stunning yeah well if they've you know a lot of other you know they've read a lot of there's now in captivity which is even more fucker yeah and I mean they're not even from the you know the if you know the how they learn and now they're suddenly thrown into these disparate groups but you know you have some that are wild some come from different you know imagine these these populations of the transients and the residents they don't speak the same language now and then you pulled the mothers away so there's really no what do they do when they don't speak the same language do they try to communicate they just run into it they they beat up each other there's you know all sorts of you know evidence that we have had people go in there and and because there's a lawsuit going on right now with and so we've we've gone in and photographed for the people with a lawsuit and you look in their their raped you know they the dolphins chew on the iron bars on the side or the sides the pool there's a lot of their teeth are just sawed it off because they get infected it's yeah let's go on to something else what can you go onto I mean it's one of them I really think it's I mean it it's like a human rights issue but it's a human rights issue for water people you know and we just if we could really like you said we could decipher what they were saying and then break it down to a very clear language oh yeah that would that would certainly help with everything yeah if we knew what was being said because you know we did this film called racing extinction and with the working title was called the singing planet because just about everything is singing we just haven't been listening everything from a you know from a mouse up to a blue whale has a song I mean technically it's a song and but we don't see it as that we're looking at it only through our own eyes and you know that was part of the objective of that film was to try to get people to understand like hey there's all these other life-forms out there they're disappearing before we have a chance to even know what they're up to and were the last generation that can fix it so you know we're going through a mass extinction right now the six you know the the answer was seen and you know when I started you know I did four stories for National Geographic on on dinosaurs on the Mesozoic the midlife of the plan a lot of friends of mine were for paleontologists and Michael Novacek the the head Provost of the American Museum of Natural History I was in the Gobi Desert with them and you know you go around to these beautiful landscapes where you see dinosaurs laid out you know basically from the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail like you don't see anywhere else in the world like they almost got exterminated by something in one go and he had told me that well we're going through a mass extinction right now and I was like what he said oh yeah this is you know mankind is responsible for the the sixth mass extinction that's the first time I heard about it about 15 years ago and you know I said well you know what are the issues what he said well the drivers are habitat destruction for agriculture pollution invasive species and base of species and overconsumption but but the biggest one by far is habitat destruction the raising of of crops for animals that we in turn eat so you know if you look at what's going on in Africa you know poaching is a big huge problem but a bigger problem is there you know a lot of that land now is being and what's going on the Amazon as well it's being torn up for getting feed for for cattle for did they come did they find out what was causing those fires in the Amazon like what were those were they set do they know yeah those are those are all illegal fires for illegal crops for you know soybean corn to feed cattle so they burned down the jungle so that they could wipe everything out this has been proven oh yeah oh yeah they do it the same thing in Indonesia but for palm oil and the thing about Brazil is bolson are Oh apparently has approved this kind of behavior right is that what's going on down now yeah to prop up business right there was an image in the New York Times of South Paulo and people walking through during the day and the sky was like like it was dark out just from this from the clouds of smoke from the burning of the Amazon from the millions of acres yeah and these are one of the most biodiverse hotspots on the planet and we're burning him down for well not only that not just biodiverse but so unknown they're mean this is where a great majority of some of the greatest pharmaceutical drugs ever invented their origins have come from the rainforests people have found various compounds and things inside the rainforest that have been used for a variety of different methods there's all sorts of bugs in there that we don't understand and look at that there's the image how insane is that I mean it's if you've never been to Sao Paulo southpaw was a huge city I mean it was like New York City it's it's massive and the sky was literally black with smoke that's a daytime yep Wow yeah insane well have you ever experienced wildfires out here in California oh yeah yeah yeah home boy I mean gets pretty crazy last four or five well what was the last month weeks you live over here in Sausalito okay yeah the north of the bridge okay well then you guys the Northern Californian won that one what was that uh was the area that got hit I'll ask you hate fire just recently yeah that was enormous yes and then there was the one heard Eisler the paradise fire that was the one that was thinking was largest I think in California history I mean these goddamn fires when they happen it's it's a very stunning and sobering reminder of the the forces of nature and when you know you're in this situation like we're in right now or you have all this dry ground and all these dry leaves and one thing catches and then the wind brings it down so it's terrifying but my point was that I've been very very close to some of these fires you know we've been evacuated a few times and when it's hitting in the skies like just gray with smoke and the hills are on fire it's a very strange strange feeling yeah like climate change is real and it's happening now and it's close it's about as real as it can ever get I mean if the people are in denial of it at this point I mean how much longer can you hold this opinion and what's what is keeping you was keeping you on this it's a hoax trial track you know I travel all over the world we're the only country that doesn't get it you know we might have the illusion that it's half the world that doesn't get it but worth mean if the over in Europe and Asia they all understand it it's not not a mystery over there it's only here and I think you know it's self interest read you know I think people are you know there's also a right-wing ideology there's there's something that happens you know there's certain opinions that people adopt they adopt this conglomeration of opinions if you are in the right or if you're in the left and one of them in the right is to deny the impact of certain environmental factors and climate change and things along those lines and it's a it's just it's like to join this group you have to subscribe to a certain platform or a certain system of ideas and that's one of them one of them is that climate change is no big deal just a hoax or people are making out I mean I mean I see it on Twitter all the time where will someone to point something out how's that climate change working out for you but just because like it's really cold in some place one day like you know you don't you I don't think you understand what this is like that's actually part of it like have it being extraordinarily cold one of the whole things in chaos like all the systems are out of whack ya know whole ecosystems I mean like went out the beach this morning and I looked the way it did fifty thousand years ago out there but you go into the water it's a whole different story yeah well a couple degrees warmer fucks everything up yeah that's really hard for us to understand because some days it's 76 and the other days it's 52 and the next day it's 80 it seems normal for us there's variability but you don't look at the overall mean if you look at the overall mean you see that rise in just a couple degrees of temperature to change everything so I mean this is what keeps me up at night it's like you know if you know this is going on what do you do about it so that you know you can look at yourself when you're on your deathbed and say I did everything I could to make a difference well the fish one's a huge one right and the ocean the pollution of the ocean is a huge one because it seems like it's nobody's right it seems like it's everybody's but it's nobody's whereas like the land if someone is doing something on the leg could you imagine that Florida if they were just pumping that chin two West Palm Beach if there's just a big tube that goes into the sky and just sprays all over West Palm Beach people be like what the fuck is this and then they would have they would have to act that it's a you can't do that but because it's getting pumped into the ocean it seems like it's okay it's not ours it's just the ocean well it's unfortunate because I gotta go to work man all the time for this I've gotten behind on my car payments I'm doing overtime tonight you know most people are concerned with so many different things that they don't have time to think about the massive overfishing and pollution of the ocean well you know that's that's the trick you know like like as a filmmaker how do you make a story like that so that people actually want to see it so I don't feel like it's medicine they don't feel like okay gotta go watch right medicine that's a good way of putting it yeah and you know that The Cove for instance I mean that was a films like a thriller it doesn't feel like a right electron you know what we're doing to dolphins is sort of a setup like a mystery the first line of the film was me saying I just want to say we try to do the story legally I still can't go back to Japan but you know what happens if you go back um I won't come back out no arrests I'm told that there's a arrest warrants out for me a conspiracy what conspiracy to disrupt Commerce trespassing filming please disrupt Commerce all that dolphin commerce fucked you holy shit conspiracy to destruct commerce how did how you define disrupting Commerce however they want I guess did you have parameters that you were supposed to operate under when you were over there and you went outside of them yeah they they gave us a map it's in the film they gave us a map and it told us this is where we're not supposed to go and you know as my friend Charles Hambleton said that became our template of where we needed to go of course yeah have you seen some of the sea Shepherd work where they've caught these Japanese scientific research boats that are really just killing whales oh yeah you know they're out of the southern ocean now this is last year they announced that they were gonna get out of there now they're only killing whales around their own territorial waters so in a way it's a big victory you know Paul's a good friend Paul Watson he just wrote me right just took a couple hours before I came here yeah he wanted a like a big projector if we did you doesn't you ever saw racing extinction no we did you know to alert the world that we needed a you know to get on this week we lit up the Empire State Building with endangered species and it was like a huge event we had like I think 939 million media views in four days top trending story on Facebook and Twitter for like four days worldwide just to get you know would you do something really strange like that how'd you do that with a projector with 50 projectors 50 like IMAX size projectors all mounted on the building that was on like 31st Street and this is all sanction we had as we spent four years getting permission to do and we finally did it and you know I remember this right here Jamie's got a video of it oh you got to slow that down though oh oh on YouTube they speed it up how long did this last for oh we did it for three hours but there's like two 10 minute shows 15 minutes shows was there a crowd of people that won't my god it was it was like it was like it was like the Easter Parade on Fifth Avenue what was funny is like though the producer in the distributor said Oscar be too expensive nobody'll you know nobody'll be there in those in the summertime in New York they always say that there's fuckin a hundred million people in New York I go there in the summertime it's packed with people if you like this nothing happens in the summer in New York link like I was doing a show down there like wow this is really good I mean it's a summer New York how are you selling so many tickets like have you looked around they have this weird attitude that nothing happens in New York in this summer yeah it's like carried over from the 30s when there was no air conditioning yeah so we had you know we thought we couldn't get any more attention on that second crazy is that though the summer in New York everybody's out why what they said well the important people they said are gonna be at the Hamptons or they're gonna oh god oh my god the important really say that to you they said that the mail says that the press wouldn't show up because at 9:30 at night nobody could afford overtime oh but you know it looked like the Easter Parade on Fifth Avenue yeah everybody was wrong yeah and then we thought so we thought okay that's that's it we can't you know getting work the church than that than the Pope called the Pope want us to project on the Vatican during cop21 whoa and then we had I think four and a half billion media views you should have taken all of the extinct animal footage and replaced it with child abuse footage Oh imagine that all the cases of all the pedophile priests of all I mean well there's a lot of issues I'm only yeah there is I'm concerned with the with the I understand I understand one step at a time yeah yeah that dirty place Vatican's a strange place like yeah you walk around there you go where did you get all this money like what did you guys you guys won't even sell anything like what you know have fucking billions of dollars and art and spectacular architecture and everywhere you go the spoils of riches and you're like what he's good where you get this from it's amazing place to visit just historically just to see what it's like and in Venice right now if you go like the doge palace if you look at the columns on that those are all different you know what they did is a pilfered Persia for that yes it so was you know you had to bring it back when you were trading the 17 1600s you had to bring back stuff you stole yeah I was just there I was just in Venice and now do you know that what's going on right now they have the worst flooding they've had in 50 years yeah I saw the grid as I stayed there at the gritty palaces that's where we were and the lobby and I was like four feet of water and the lobby really yeah holy shit four feet of water in the fucking lobby so what is causing that well it's uh was a combination of the taught that this time of year the tides and the storms but also you know the seas are raising you know you have just a couple inches of of ocean raising you can imagine there's more water out yeah and it gets pushed so how do you stay in the greedy palace when the floor is water I don't think you do stay in hey I think that's the least of their problems right now Wow we had you know we had a I look when I lived in Boulder you know I wasn't in a flood zone I looked at you know forth and and juniper this is like it's a radius of foothills and it wasn't you know on the flood map but we had a two thousand year flood and there was furniture floating you know I had furniture floating up against the ceiling of my place I got you know brought out by climate change look at that Wow that's how bad the flooding is yeah that's where we stayed over the summer yeah gorgeous but weird but it's like it's like a really beautiful prostitute like do you do you have to do this because like look at all that shit floating by that's crazy how high the water level is that's a restaurant yeah Wow it's all underwater is that outside the greedy palace I around the corner yeah that's what it looks like yeah the the cruise ships would pull up and then you would see the amount of people to get out and then the the streets would be flooded and all the people that live there would be like this all just started happening like a decade ago or the cruise ships were allowed to pull right up and during the week they were there they said they had two accidents with cruise ships like hitting docks and we played a video of one of them it's fucking crazy you see this gigantic boat and it's just coming in II know it's gonna hit the dock and you know it's gonna hit this boat in front of it and everybody's running to get out of the way and you see this like that's a mountain some mountain that's floating a floating Mountain that has no ability maneuver correct look at the size of that cut date I mean that is so much bigger than any of the buildings there and that things floating in and banging into the walls and look at the size our God look at the size of that that is so insane and we wonder why we're screwed that thing has nine floors that is so crazy look at that yeah there's probably several thousand people right oh for sure for many thousand and you know and don't they just dump their waste right into the ocean they did in the past I don't know if they they do it now what do they do now put it in a baggie well this is one of the things they found in LA I'm sure you're aware this they did a satellite overview like an image of methane they're trying to find out where's the greenhouse gases where's the biggest you know polluters it turns out as landfills landfills a huge issue you know this idea that there is that the greenhouse gas thing the methane leak this idea that you're gonna just put it in the ground hey that doesn't work it comes out of the ground what yeah I told you we had a Tesla that we had retrofit a permit for a racing extinction I had a FLIR camera the same camera that you used to see methane mm-hmm it sees a spectrum it's not heat but it's just it can see methane you're gonna put another filter in so you can see carbon dioxide and so we had you know we went out on the streets of LA and we went to we got on to the tarmac and you know the the carbon dioxide's a little bit at the boogie man you can't see it but with this camera you can see it and it's pretty pretty astounding when you can you know just you know right now if you put it on us you look like we're smoking mmm when you show it on the streets of LA it's like everything's disgorging bright yeah and there's no not enough plants to absorb it yeah you can't absorb it that quickly but that's one of the beautiful things about when you go to the woods there's something about when you're in nature and you're in the forest where you know you like to persist specifically like the Pacific Northwest which has he's incredibly dense for us the air just has a different quality to it and this is rich oxygenated air cuz you know you're just around all these trees and plants it was a different feel to it that you just don't get here ya know I was here last week Rob fro it is Jamie and I been planning our escape we don't know what to do though we're trying to figure it out somewhere with the I think you can only stay here a little while longer I came here in 1994 and there was maybe 30 percent of the traffic that there is now and I'm not exaggerating maybe 40 percent let's get crazy but this like now it can be uh I can come home from the economy store at 11 o'clock at night and be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic just bumper-to-bumper I worked for the only times back in 1970s and I remember 3:00 in the morning they'd be like without an accident on the road there could be traffic backed up backed up yeah yeah without an accent and I don't you know back then I mean I'm probably I don't hold to you 52 yeah so I'm like I got a little bit 110 years on you but I remember that this valley was always for the first month I worked at the LA Times the valley was just I couldn't see anything and then one day cleared up and in a review mirror I said I was living north of town and North atomic Glendale and in a rear view mirror I saw white cap mountains and I thought why they come from right oh that scared me because yeah you can see that from Woodland Hills from Woodland Hills on a rainy day when the rain comes in and washes it all away like what the fuck is this there's mountains right there you don't see literally that the pollution so dense it hides mountains but still yes ok well that's because it today is a beautiful day it's really a beautiful day you get lucky what really helps us is when the wind blows when the wind blows it clears everything out and like you can get to a high P later there's an area where trail run and you get to this really high peak and you could look out at the top and pause and some days you don't see jack shit you just see gray and then some days after it rains you're like this fucking mountains out here like you don't like I want to take a picture of the stark contrast you know matter of fact I'm gonna run not tomorrow but the next day when I get out there I'm gonna take a photo and I'm gonna try to take a few photos and try to catch it when it rains cuz it's supposed to rain sometime this week and so get a difference between what it is normally versus what it is when it rains because the the difference is it's stunning and it's all being hid by pollution and we just have gotten accustomed to it mmm yeah well I mean catalytic converters helped a lot well it also is helping a lot is this conversion to electric cars and I really hope people continue down that path you know especially I mean it's they're getting better at figuring out how to charge them and better at battery capacity and better and they're they're better to drive I mean we were talking about Tesla's I mean I have that Model S I love that thing I mean it's amazing it's in a just an amazing car it's not you don't loot and I'm an automobile enthusiast I love cars you don't lose anything with that I mean it's more fun than any other automatic car I've ever driven yeah no I mean with I had one too for a while but it I told you I had that electroluminescent paint job and those was a like you know so it's a it was a nice one but I had to add one of the first electric cars in Colorado back in like 2007 I only do look like two other ones and I had 120 solar panels on my my roof so I didn't pay for electricity real the roof of your house you can have a look at my own yeah um did you see that documentary who killed the electric car yeah Chris Payne he's a good friend very interesting right yeah and and revenge the electric car it was this follow-up to it uh oh I didn't see that yeah it's a good one you know I think it's better than the first one actually but you know I would tell my neighbors like hey I don't pay for electricity my license plate said V us stood for a vehicle using Sun it was the opposite of an SUV and I mean I got checks from an electric electric company I didn't have bills I had checks because you're contributing to the grid yeah so we had you know net metering and I thought I just discovered something I was just incredible but you don't everybody said you know I was doing it just to prove that I could you know you could do it back then yeah and you know neighbors would say what but how much does it cost and it's like well it's you know we should all be you know you have to be a people have to be early adopters before you can get it to scale so I was an early adopter but I think even with everything that we know what's going on that people are still saying they're not gonna switch over till it's cheaper it's a little bit better and it's cheaper and you know Elon I think he's got the right idea make it a little make it a lot better and eventually it's gonna be cheaper I mean the the Model S's is a great car but the model 3 someone crazy yeah and it's a fantastic car as well and that model 3 it's preposterous you know I have a Porsche 911 gt3 and it's a pretty fast car this guy humiliated me today I wasn't trying to race him but I think he was trying to prove a point we're at a red light and the light turned green and he shot ahead of me and gone to the highway so fast I was like laughing I was like look I wasn't trying to race the guy but if I was it would have been a bloodbath you said you keep yours on ludicrous mode all the time oh mine yeah my Model S yeah I do I keep it on ludicrous mode but you don't have to drive it ludicrous that's on ludicrous mode you could drive it normal but anytime you want to just dump on the the accelerator it's just whoa it literally feels like it's violating some sort of laws of physics like it just it does something with time you know like you're not supposed to be able to get there that quick you have you have a thing in your mind when you're drivin a car well if I want to get in front of that car it's going to take X amount of seconds even if I really accelerate it'll take some time for and get up before I can change lanes with that thing's just shoot you just go and you people that have never been in one before I take him for a drive in the Tesla and they they grip the seat and like what the fuck everybody says the same thing like what the or holy shit those are the two things they say because it doesn't seem like it should be able to do that I think it looks like I said Dan that's like it's like a regular car and I talk you know I've got like a old muscle car I've got a couple cars that look fast and like that car that regular sedan Luton car five times faster than anything here and zero emissions but you know we're in this transitionary period and I think the future is pretty bright for that stuff Mustang just Ford just released the concept of this new vehicle that they're releasing very soon it's like a Mustang crossover ECAR it's it's all beautiful it's really cool-looking it looks like like a larger Mustang like a taller Mustang but it's all electric and Elon praised it today that Ford is going out on a limb and making something like that cool you know and then Porsche is releasing their their version it's called at I can and that's I think that's I say it it's a beautiful looking sleek looking electric car so we're moving in that direction yeah I mean there's a there's a great Tony Sabre the Futurist he shows a picture of the 1905 and the 1980 stir parade in New York City and it's all horses looking down from a building know if you find it Jamie 1905 the night tonight at Easter Parade and it's like there's one car and then 13 years later it's like find the horse and that these transitions they take you know about 10 12 years you know you know 12 years ago we were punching the number two key on our flip phone six times to text a capital C you know I think we're you know we're gonna be doing the same thing with you know with uh with you know the transition with food I think it's gonna be going that way you know you you think that they're gonna be do you have hope for all this lab-created meet woody what do you think about I mean I know there's there's some process that I don't totally understand where they're able to make actual biological like bison meat yeah me I'm doing a film series right now called food 2.0 and I had dinner on Saturday night two nights ago with Omaha the guy that founded Matt Memphis meats and you know I have the same sort of achiness about you know going that direction but he showed me these pictures on his flip on his phone of this chicken breast that he's making and you know I stopped eating meat about ten years ago but I thought it didn't look bad you know look at he had like it it chopped you know so that it was grilled and I thought you know I have this sort of rapport of revulsion against it myself because I've you know become myself off of it but I looked I looked at that and I thought you know what that that looks really edible it looks good to do somebody that that could eat meat you know that that would be appetizing yeah it seems like the science it once well whatever it is right it's tissue and whatever that tissue is it's composed of a bunch of different natural ingredients right whatever whatever creates a turkey breast it seems like it's just a matter of innovation and technology and proving to the point where they could recreate that ya know the question is you know is that you know is that better for you then you know the Whole Foods plant-based diet or that's the real question right cuz that's where things get convoluted what like what what is healthy versus what is ethical versus what makes you feel like you're doing the right thing morally yeah you know the way you know I stopped eating you know meat about 1986 I went to I was doing a story for Fortune magazine on the biggest independently owned cattle ranches in America and there's one that was so big in Oklahoma they had slaughterhouse and they supposed to you know they kill the animal with this captive bolt to the brain is supposed to happen instantly but there was one animal that came around and it was still alive and it was at that point it was hanging upside down and its flesh and its hide was stripped off and it's looking at me with this eye and it's following my eye as this hide was stripped off and it was still alive yep and it's in as its turning around it was during his head and it still held my eye and I thought the son of a bitch is alive and I'm part of part of this so I stopped eating meat shortly after that and so I thought well I have to eat something right but I have to eat an animal product because you know you're gonna shrivel up and die if you don't and then so I became a pescetarian that's all I ate for animal protein well you know did milk and dairy but I didn't eat any thing any limited my Satou myself two things out that didn't walk there that one that didn't walk so fish was like fair territory for me and then when we made the cove there's a scene in it where we take a sample of hair from the Deputy Minister of Fisheries there and we tested for mercury and when we were you know why it was out at the lab I thought I'll get mine tested too cuz I was I ate a lot of fish I loved it my son's still a professional fisherman and I had a freezer full of fish all the time stocked up of you know fresh ocean weather not fresh but frozen ocean fish and I had it for breakfast lunch and dinner all the time then when you know we got his labs back as sample back it was eight times higher than was high which is like you know you don't want any mercury in your body Mercury's most toxic non radioactive element in the world and my levels were forty four times how were you experiencing any physical yeah that's that I was having trouble with my short-term memory I had an ache in my shoulder that was there for probably decades and I you know I try to get a massage doubt and then if you start looking through the you know the problems with with mercury you notice that there's a whole litany of things that it causes depending on how bad you have it but my doctor said it's the worst he'd ever seen in Colorado so I had to get off of it and then I you know this is so we're here in LA for the Academy Awards and I met my first vegan and I said what do you eat and she goes everything else you know all protein originates with plants and that was how I got started it took you know I thought okay well mercury has a half-life in your body of about 70 to 90 days and so it took me about two years to get it down and I thought all just trials two years to get it down why'd it take so long because it has a half-life at your body of 70 to 90 days so 44 goes to 20 to 90 to 180 so yeah so I thought okay then I'll start eating a little bit of fish and then oh I know I had a tester right away in a jack back up I thought okay I can't be sauce all fish is poison all big fish is poisoned for sure no fish like tuna swordfish Marlin where's the recommendations they tell you not supposed to eat it more than a couple times a week or something like that but it seems like if it's got a half-life of I don't trust any of that I mean like like I mean I can't mess with it me if he's when I was in Japan I went to Minamata where they had they called Minamata disease but it's not a disease it's poisoned this was a company that was intentionally polluting the bay where there's a lot of fishermen and the kids of course got it well the cats got affected first because people give the the fish to the cats and the cats would have had called dancing cat disease you know you heard the expression mad as a hatter that's because they had the felt from a hundred year 150 years ago they used to cure the felt the beaver felt on top hats but they would use the mercury in the met the adders would go mad in Minamata the cats got affected than the kids and then you know the the people a couple hundred thousand people got affected and at least we remember this is 1950s or remote remote villages and an American researcher went there and saw that everybody looked weird and said something's going on here and he found out that they were dumping you know mercury into the bay and I saw visited a doctor there that study Minamata disease he was a guy that was in charge of figuring out compensation for out with what they owe people and he showed me these brains of you know they sliced open and it looked like Swiss cheese what we're talking about the convolutions of the brain and how dolphins have more of them same thing with people but you know and the ones with the slices that look like Swiss cheese or the this whole set of it's the mercury is heating up in the brain and so you don't want you know once you see that you said you don't want that your body so I had to get off fish and become a vegan not bike for ethical reasons but because of I just couldn't eat it just for health reasons but I'm doing just fine how fucking crazy is that that most fish is poison like that is that is such a crazy thing to think that the ocean is so fucked up that most of the food you pull out of the ocean is a mess well I mean most of the fish that we're eating I think 54% is farm-raised and whatever it but again I I just read it this morning and Los Angeles maggots worse right it's worse yeah and you know the ecological damage it's doing is it was crazy the the health consequences is crazy so the question is then what do we eat I know about mollusks so one of the things that someone told me that was actually someone who's a vegan told me about mollusks I said you can make an ethical argument that mouths are actually less complicated life-forms and even plants they don't have the same nerve endings they don't really move they open and shut and they're a viable form of animal protein that is just so primitive it's hurt that yeah that's did they're just not we think of them as life forms but so is broccoli that's a life form as well but there there's actually more evidence that plants are intelligent then there is that mollusks our mouths are an incredibly ancient life-form but then again don't you get some sort of mercury poisoning from them as well well they're on the bottom right usually and they're they're filtering so you're you're getting whatever poised would whatever toxins are I'm not gonna say that money no Malick's are poison I just wouldn't eat it I'm going a completely different direction but I've heard that before that mouth sir you can farm them too right mm-hmm you can I mean if we really can break that they're even more primitive but yet more nutritious you know the like you know I did a story in Polynesia and on stirs and they have the big oysters that they get no but do for pearls and they they don't they just eat the muscle that holds all the the organs and stuff on you know when I said oh in America we eat the whole Orchestra they're like what you know because the muscle tastes like like fish flesh it's actually pretty good but you know the idea that we're eating all those other filtered or organs and stuff I just don't know I don't but you don't know you know I don't know no has anybody come up with any sort of comprehensive plan or anything that makes sense where they can viably repopulate the ocean I mean the idea of stopping and slowing down fishing would be wonderful but it's I mean if we if it really gets to a point where we've got to somehow or another independently grow these fish and reintroduce them to the wild mean is there any talk of doing things like that or is it even impossible I think it's impossible the scale of what's going on right now you know when I was in Japan they were saying that all we used to go out all you know we could fill up a boat a day now it's you know eight days now we have to then we have to go out 30 and we're competing with the you know the Koreans the Chinese the Taiwanese you know it's it's and everybody's just going gangbusters and we have we're using military gear - you know sonar to catch things that this unprecedented rate it's not sustainable I personally don't believe that fishing - feeding this planet currently you can do it with fish I don't think you can do it with you know and we know what's you know that the unethical aside of raising you know farm animals for this is it's just I think we have to transition to another form I think it's gonna be you know 10 or 12 years but I think we're headed that direction and people I think what you're seeing now is that there's a direction towards trying to know people want to eat healthier that they want to eat sustainable and I know I know you're a hunter I mean I was 102 I hunted fish you know I understand like when you come back with the goods you come back with an animal and you're feeding your family you're feeding your friends you feel like the man you don't feel like you know you there's something you tap and that's really primitive in a you know in a really genuine way that makes us feel good about who we are that you're providing and I know that that happened when I when I was a fisherman you know you go hunt a fish with your friends and there's a group thing going on and you everybody's there they're enjoying themselves and it feels wonderful but we can't do it with wild fish and you know with four percent of the biomass P and while the animals now and the rest of it being we it's not sustainable and I wish it was because that that so there's something we lost with that but we have to transition we're at that period right now where we have to figure out how do you feed a planet that's the real problem right and not just how do you feed a planet how do you feed a planet that may double its population the next 50 years yeah well it's this to talking 10 billion by 2050 and we're already at a point where you know we're at the 20 years past that it might really be double it might be 15 million or excuse me billion people that's crazy so you know you can't have 18 and a half million people in the Greater Los Angeles area going out and hunting for their food or fishing from you know so what are we gonna eat you know and I I think we you know the the way to do it is you know drifting more towards plants getting you know I was last week I was in Loma Linda California you know where that's at you've heard about the Blue Zone yeah and you know so the people out there that don't might not know about it's Dan Buettner Geographic fellow popularized the idea that there's these five geographic regions the plan of where people live longer and without chronic disease than any other place on the planet so I was out there last week at the BRIT the brain health and Alzheimer clinic and there's two researchers that started when there wasn't one for miles around and they opened it with 1 out of 3 people in America and the next 10 years gonna be affected by Alzheimer's either they're gonna have it their mates gonna have it there would be taken care of somebody has it their parents so it's gonna overtake heart disease is our number one disease that we have they open up the brain health clinic there with an Alzheimer clinic and nobody came now about half the population of seventh-day adventists that are vegetarians by religion and you go to the grocery store they don't sell me you go to they have milk they have cow's milk but it's on the bottom shelf there yourself a few things of it I've and they to find people initially they had to go to San Bernardino across the across the highway there there's nothing different geologically different between San Bernardino's in Loma Linda it's the reticle they're you know drinking the same water breathing the same air but they have a different diet but they're living about 10 years longer than everybody have on San Bernardino is one of the unhealthiest populations in America and another side of highway 10 you have one of the healthiest populations in the entire world and they're living about ten years on average longer they're doing other things too it's not just diet it's well it's a big factors sleep I mean dr. Matthew Walker has been on this podcast who's so well renowned sleep scientist was discussing that it's one of the biggest corollary one of the biggest factors where they've determined that the less sleep you have the higher likelihood you have of Alzheimer's disease and it's really stark like that the numbers are they're they're they're pretty undisputable yeah well III agree there's they have four principles a you know the the shores eyes you know Dean and Isis sure aside sleep is one of them yeah Whole Foods plant-based diet support you know they the community support and an exercise those are those are the big ones yeah but they out of the 3,000 people that they have in the Alzheimer's clinic clinic now only 19 of them we're sorry only 13 of them are vegetarians and three vegans so I mean you look at you know if you look at if you break it down the population like how many of the 24,000 people there that are vegetarians about 15 percent you would expect you know several hundred of them to be you know with Alzheimer's to be vegetarians but there's so many of them are follow that seventh-day adventists diet which is vegetarian yeah but what you're talking about San Bernardino's a very poor community unfortunately and I think you know as well as I do a lot of people in poor communities heat terrible the stream eating junk food and sugar and all that crap I mean that that's one of the primary factors when it comes to poor health and education is related definitely to brain health unfortunately and it says does to do that there's they're stupid but it's just that they're you're right they're not that they're not eating as well they have to you know the first McDonald's was in San Bernardino you know was it really yeah there was we went to the museum there with McDonald's museum they have a McDonald's Museum cuz they have all the Ronald McDonald's from the beginning to the end everything you know yeah but it is so that they've been really good about keeping fast food out of out of Loma Linda for them it's in their giant concerns even with large scale agriculture when you're talking about mono crops and growing things for 15 billion people you're gonna need gigantic swaths of land it's going to displace a lot of wildlife you're gonna have a lot of different chemicals to get released into the ground unless you're doing regenerative farming in which case you're gonna have to use some animal products anyway because you have compost and fertilizer you need fish for fertilizer or something that creates nitrogen you know there's a lot of issues even with large-scale agriculture when you're growing crops you're doing something that's wholly unnatural if you have you know a thousand acres of corn or soybeans or anything that you're growing in large-scale that's not not how nature intends it nature intends everything to be combined together right but if you look at the amount of crops that are out there the most land is being used to grow crops to feed animals so you know well sort of a lot of its being used for feed animals a lot of it's being used for corn syrup and a lot of different methods and we could get rid of it you know I mean yeah I mean you've seen king corn right yeah that's that's pretty fucking crazy when they check your DNA and they find out how much of your DNA is corn-based you know like what like what is going on how much your your your cellular structure is corn-based it's like how much corn is in your diet and then you go through the supermarket go and pick up box after box and read how much corn is in there corn starch corn syrup different proteins that they've extracted from corn well let me ask you how do you think the you know if we have to feed 10-15 billion people in the future how do you think of a question you know we should be feeding the population it's a good question it's a very good question I have hope for this is fake meat shit not not the plant-based stuff where they're using oils and the but the actual physical meat that they can figure out some way to create meat without animals die like I am NOT a fan of factory farming it's the reason why I got into hunting in the first place I saw a lot of those PETA documentaries and I just didn't want to have any part of any of that shit and I know there are ethical ranchers that raise their animals grass-fed and they let them roam and you know there's a guy named Joel Salatin who has this some thing called Polyface farms where he he teaches people regenerative farming methods and teaches people how to let animals be animals and the polar opposite of factory farming when you see these and I'm sure you've seen some of these disgusting videos of these pig farms where they have lakes of sewage attached to these farms where these pigs are in these warehouses stacked in one on top of the other and then they're all their waste goes down through the floor and into these giant huge lakes of shit and piss they spray it on the crops stuff I don't know if they spray that on the cross but it lasts into the ground there's spray the pissed pig and shit oh no oh yeah well look all that stuff is wrong I mean all of its wrong I mean but there were chickens raising chickens like that or cows like that or pigs like that and there's a reason why they have these ag-gag laws and those are another thing that are it can in my eyes - the same thing that the way we feel about dolphins in captivity in a place like SeaWorld those ag-gag laws agricultural gag laws they keep people from divulging the horrors of these factory farms and there's there's got to be a way to stop those laws first of all the you you should these places should be transparent if there's something there do that's abhorrent and something they do with you you could see the lives of these animals then they're treated in these horrific ways it's not necessary that's nuts it's just they're doing that for profit and this is why you can get a chicken sandwich for a dollar ninety-nine or whatever the fuck it is yeah I mean if you know the saying if slaughterhouses had glass walls yes right yeah going back to it though I mean it was so how do you it so glad meat you think would be those I think lab Meade has real potential the same way cell phones used to cost you know a thousand dollars what not more than that like what was uh it was like none of those big mold a roll of bricks remember those things that like I do Gordon Gekko had and Wall Street they were really expensive like when he was walking down the beach with that thing like wow that guy's a baller he's got a phone he's just walking with no cord now everyone has a phone I mean I was in Brazil and you know these people are walking around and you know very little money but they all had phones if cell phones have made their way throughout and virtually all of the world how much order in for gratitude for so four grand in 82 is probably what today twenty probably like 20 right sure yeah lots a lot even if it's four grand if you imagine if a fucking iPhone was four grand people be going crazy the new ones almost 2 grand and everybody's going crazy so that's just I think that sort of technological innovation and improvement I think we were gonna see that in this sort of factory created meat because the original factory created burger that they made I believe it was a quarter of a million dollars that it costs to create one and people ate it and they're like this is beef this is like real beef I think with innovation there they could figure out a way to do that so we don't ever have to have these factory farming situations I mean I think that's possible ya know I think it is - when I've talked to some of the people that are working on that and we need to look at how fast cells can reproduce and we know it's just a matter of scale on getting the right texture taste yeah look I'm I know I'm not under no illusion that what I do is available to everybody I go hunting in the mountains most people don't want to do that you know and I do it with a bow and arrow no most people don't want to learn how to do that they don't have it in them they don't want it it's not interesting to me it is if I shoot one elk that is 400 pounds of meat one life feeds me for a year and I feed my friends I feed a lot of people I give elk meat out to a bunch of people I under no illusion that everyone can do that but this everyone can't do most of the things that I do I just do it because it makes me feel better than going and getting something that's factory farmed if I saw what they did to chickens and I knew that my chicken had come from these horrific environments and I ate that I feel sick yeah and so that's why I became a hunter in the first place yeah well that's how you know what we concern ourselves is like how can like yeah you and I can eat you probably better than me but I can eat how I want to eat doesn't that sound weird you say I eat better than you know what you can afford more is what I'm saying you're what I'm telling you I'm getting my meat from the woods well then I'm not saying better I'm saying that you did you could eat how you want Oh easy er than me and I say those I'm not financially I've seen the what you have around here there's no nice little nice little cozy Mandan you have down here but boys you should see what's out there it's like the ultimate it's a man cave man yeah knocking man but man cave man cave man would be a giant Neanderthal but yeah look this it's a the conversation between I mean I don't have a gang of friends that are vegan and vegetarian one of my best friends was Ian Edwards I love them to death I I don't I don't dispute that we're in a conundrum and then we're in a terrible situation as a civilization we've certainly overpopulated the planet in many ways and we've certainly allowed something to take root in society that I think is disgusting that's factory farming of animals there's there's something vile about it undeniably vile and there's a reason why people are prosecuted for exposing what makes everybody sick look if they exposed it and said look I'm gonna take a picture I'm gonna show you a video of how these cows are living and you take the video and cows just wandering around eating grass no one would give a shit right right it's when you see these people kicking these cows and when you see them alive when like kosher the way they do that where they have to slice their throat and they have to do it with one cut and this is why people want kosher meat like there's some ancient ridiculous idea of how to dispose of a life who mean all those things sicken people which is the reason why they have those laws keeping people who work there from videotaping exposing it in the first place yeah I think the King amendment and I didn't believe what it is he's from Iowa or at least he was I don't not sure if he's still even in in power there but yeah I made it better if people saw if people saw how they got there you know how milk is done and I know you're a proponent of milk but if you saw that not really I don't drink it no I if I drink four glasses of milk a year it's a lot oh yeah I don't think it's good for you I think raw milk is probably better for you but every time I drink a glass of milk I always feel gross I feel like the homogenous Asian and pasteurization of milk you're you're breaking down all the enzymes and boiling it and what you get is some weird protein that your body doesn't exactly know how to process correctly there's a reason why so many people get like horrible gas off of it you know there's a 65% of the population of the world's lactose intolerant a nine year old she's lactose intolerance kind of aiming with cheese or milk or anything I didn't figure that out Allah is like fifty that was lactose intolerant I mean really I mean you know I should have figured it out but I thought it was normal I think my daughter gets it from me I've never I mean I can eat our ice cream and I'm okay but I always feel like shit it never makes me feel good afterwards always feeling wolf-like like I'll have cookies and milk and oh it's just uh it's a weird it's like my body's like what is this but however I've had raw milk and I haven't had any problems with it and I just think it's and you know there's a big problem with the you know acquiring raw milk it's very hard it yet but I think if any if people are gonna drink milk at all that's how we're supposed to drink it I don't think we're supposed to be boiling that stuff and and then you know it comes out it's dead that's why look you're not supposed to have anything biological they can sit in your fucking refrigerator for two weeks and not stink like how is that and you look at the date the date is like a month like how the fuck is this gonna stay good for a month because they boil the shit out of it and look if you want to if you want to serve milk to 300 million people that's how you have to do it if you want to get it in containers and travel across the country in these trucks and get it to supermarkets and have it sit in the self and have it be sit on the shelf and have it be financially viable for them to be able to hold on to it long enough for them to sell it and turn a profit and then have no one gets sick from it because like raw milk is good for like a couple of days and that's it and it used to be that people got their milk delivered on their doorstop you know the milkman that was the thing milk managed to come to your house and you didn't even really have a lid it had like that little remember yeah a little paper thing that you'd pull off so we had as a kid and it was fresh and the cream would sit on the top of it it just tasted different no I've had raw milk I haven't had in years but the last time I had raw milk goes like this it's just taste better it tastes like when you drink it it feels like your body is like oh I know what this is whereas like a regular glass of milk my body's like what in the fuck and then you got to think about how they get it right like how they keep these cows pregnant and the the process of acquiring billions of gallons of milk for millions and millions of people it's kind of gross you know not even kind of agree yeah but however almond milks disgusting you don't drink that shit do you how do you say this this is a surprise it's just not milk man almonds don't have tits we're not doing to that water you know just have a glass of water drink some juice or something I mean it mean it's just got to be some benefit the hell I mean almonds are good for you right but almonds are a real problem in California ecologically because they're not a water they totally agree yeah now I'm soiled sort of my milk is choice or don't yeah yeah just drink water man I agree plastic okay I know do something about that we've been talking forever we're gonna we're gonna develop some sort of a system here what do you recommend for us laughs right go where - wish we'd get our water from so we get filtered water especially we get spring water I think filtered water is probably good bike and/or box water that's the thing though yeah but I use a paper yeah just a big yeah yeah we're working a film on plastic pollution right now and we're trying to think like how do you how do you it's a big problem like you look at the oceans we've had boy onslaught on and we're gonna hit him on again these the guy has created that yeah he came to visit me too or where I work he's got ones for the rivers have you seen the new ones that he's I saw that yeah a couple weeks ago I think they're yeah something he's already got them working but the here's the issue I bet that I'm learning from this is guy Andrew Forrest uh one of the wealthiest guys and in Australia told me that it's this isn't the problem it's that you haven't cheap plastic made and you know Saudi Arabia and America and it's being exported to there's ten eleven rivers are where the majority of the plastic in the ocean are coming from and they it's it's not recyclable the rivers is where the plastics coming from what do you mean there's there's about ten to twelve rivers over in Southeast Asia where that generate a lot of most of the plastic that you see how in the river what is what is all people okay so like in Indonesia for instance you have 17,000 islands but only ten recycling plants right places to do it so there's you know there's no way that there's nowhere to throw it so they throw it in in the you know out in the ocean oh you're saying the garbage is in these rivers the creation of the plastic the creation of the plastic comes from American I come from Europe and it comes from Saudi Arabia right right I see what you're saying so and but the the the volume most the volume is coming from these ten to twelve rivers in Southeast Asia you have to make plastic cost enough so that the first of all that they can make it recyclable so that you know there's different ways to make polymers so that they can recycle it they just do the cheapest way possible because they know it's not coming back right so you have to put it either you have to put a tax on virgin plastic to make it valuable for people to be able to recycle it otherwise great solution is hemp plastic it's biodegradable and comes from this plant meaning you can make hemp plastic and we can grow it and it's an easy crop is that scalable yes hemp is so weird it doesn't even seem like it should be real I mean it really doesn't it's it's an it's an insane plant I mean you can make hempcrete out of it which is far better than any building material we currently use it's far more resistant to flame there's there's just so many positive benefits of it in terms of insulation the insulation factors better than wood or plywood it's really lightweight but incredibly strong if you were like grabbed a thick hemp stalk if you ever held onto one no it doesn't seem real it's hard like this oak but yet it's light like balsa wood it's so strange it feels like it comes from another planet Wow hemp is an extraordinary planet it's a most extraordinary plant we have first of all it has all the essential amino acids I love hemp protein it's one of my favorite proteins for we salad it on it we sell hemp protein it's one of the very best proteins in terms of being able to mix it and like a protein shake and on the go your body digests it super easily and it's like filled with amino acids it's very easy for your body digestive process you can make oil out of it that they used to use for fucking for heating lamps you can cook your food in it it I mean there's so many different things you can do with hemp you can make clothing you can far more durable cloth far more durable the paper is far superior in fact the whole reason why William Randolph Hearst demonized marijuana in the first place was to protect his business because he had paper mills and he was trying to protect it from hemp because on the cover of popular science magazine they had come out with a décor Decatur decore Decatur was a way in the 1930s they devised to effectively process hemp fiber because for years they used to use slaves to process hemp then when they figured out the cotton gen cotton became easier to use and then slavery became outlawed and so people who shied away from hemp well they came up with this decor Decatur in the 1930s it was on the cover of popular science magazine hemp the new billion-dollar crop well William Randolph Hearst didn't just own Hearst publications and newspapers he also are owned these huge forests that they were making paper with so he along with Harry Anslinger and using his newspapers demonized marijuana to stop the commodity of hemp yes no idea he funded all those fucking crazy marijuana movies reefer madness all that shit that was all him they came up with these stories that these Mexicans and black men were taking this new drug called marijuana marijuana wasn't even a term for cannabis marijuana was a term for a wild tobacco so they came up with his new name they called it this drug everybody freaked out because they didn't have the internet back then no one had access to real information other than Hearst Newspapers Hearst publications so he's just fucking out now lied and made up these crazy stories and funded these documentaries and then marijuana became illegal and still is to this day and he still have knuckleheads like Joe Biden literally yesterday saying that he thinks marijuana is a gateway drug well we're still in this band but forget about marijuana imagine if it wasn't psychoactive at all the idea that hemp should be illegal until really recently in this country is a fucking travesty it's horrific its food its clothes it's paper it doesn't even make sense that it could be so many it's literally like one of the most positive plants the Earth's ever known okay I'll vote for it man dude you should do a national documentary on that I think you got the Joe Biden easy ah Joe fuck you too late there's a lot to talk on here where I stand a one hour ago I put my fucking Instagram post out this morning it's got they did this was basically it a well worded thing saying that anyone who thinks that marijuana should be legal is basically saying you should be locked in a cage for experimenting with your consciousness and the freedom to to to do whatever you want with your body that is especially with marijuana that's not poisonous no one's died of it everyone ever and they history the human race is never a single overdose for marijuana and this knucklehead saying that it's a gateway drug no pain is a gateway drug Strama is a gateway drug abuse is a gateway to drugs it's not marijuana marijuana is just a time-honored psychedelic substance that people have been enjoying for thousands and thousands of years they should run for Congress fuck that I'm not running for anything I'm not even running for my neighborhood it's whatever the hell it is I just saw a poster over there did he run for mayor it was that a joke what post don't know I thought that supposed to oh it's a hundred percent a joke look I'm not ever running for anything ever well it was for those right next to Hunter Thompson for mayor and I thought well maybe there was some truth to it no Hunter Thompson for sheriff but there's nothing Jeremy or anything for me right I don't think notice Hunter Thompson That's not me look I'm not running for anything ever I have three jobs and three kids I'm busy and I have a lot of hobbies too many hobbies I'm trying to chip away at hobbies but if I can get Joe Biden to shut the fuck up I'm very happy crazy asshole there's so many people that smoke pot in this country he's so crazy for him to come out against that is so goddamn dumb how do you smoke pot on the show and still hold a conversation though I say we doing for yourself I'm a STONER I know how to do it I've been doing it forever look one of the things that I said in my Instagram post today marijuana is not for everybody and I think it should be used carefully because look I've said a lot of dumb shit when I've been high I've thought a lot of dumb shit I've been paranoid it's not for everybody I think it should be treated cautiously but there's a lot of benefits to it I really firmly believe that it's made me a more sensitive person it's made me more interested in community it's made me more aware of how important it is that we're all connected and that we all converse with each other in a calm way it's made me feel better about about a happy communication with people it's made me more affectionate it's made me more compassionate more kind as it makes me more aware you know that the feeling of paranoia one of the things that that paranoia is it's just an overall expanding of your awareness of your vulnerability of all the things you've done it because you had a lot of hats and a career do you find this the most satisfying to you with the podcast yeah mom made this and stand up I mean this is the standup is more complicated right because there's got to be an end result it has to be funny or is this the beautiful thing about this is I've been able to expose a lot of people to things like The Cove like you and your work like means so many different doctors and scientists and astrophysicists and and dr. dr. Matthew Walker that we talked about earlier we're explaining sleep and how important this really is this isn't just something that you feel better if you get more sleep no it's like long-term for your life these are all little bits of information that I think it's very difficult for people to absorb just by going out and reading studies right so the next best thing is reading a book well the next best thing is me having a person who wrote that book on on a podcast to talk about it and maybe not even the next best thing it might be the best best thing because it it's absorbable it's it's a conversation with people and it's to me I've gotten a fantastic education from it to being able to talk to thousands of brilliant people or or hundreds at least so brilliant people and pick their brain and and just with genuine curiosity just ask them and you know and read their book and then try to have like like try to have an understanding of it like and try to when they come on the show try to get them to fill in my blanks and in turn educate the audience on things that may be a little bit complicated for them to comprehend and it's just to me it's it's something that was completely unexpected I didn't ever plan on doing this I just started doing it and then it just kind of became what it is now so it's very satisfying that people like it you know when I talked to people and they say I mean I can't tell you how many people have run into it said it's like changed their life it's changed their perspective so many people said you know once I started I was gonna be on the edge was gonna be in the show they said we got to see this podcast this but I spent two weeks just that was my day job is like listening to you know interviews that you've done I just felt totally captivated and envious of the position that you're on to be able to have people and talk about a wide range of stuff when I do a film it's it's so targeted that I'm needing them to fill in a blank it's just a I need two or three minutes so I might I might talk as long but as it's just you know I've got this list of a shopping list of things I need to cover and here you you you just have a conversation now that's a lot it's a lot different and it seems like a lot more fun it's a lot more fun like when you said the beginning of this like what kind of research have you done to prepare for this I'm like fortunately I get to pick who I talk to and for you I mean I knew that you had directed the cove and that the subject of dolphins has been I mean was a huge bit on my 2016 Netflix special about an experience that I had when I was in Hawaii high as fuck on edibles and we ran into this patch of wild dolphins and they were playing with us they're playing with us and we were yelling like yeah and they would jump how they want to do flips for you they were putting on a show and I remember having this thought like holy shit they're playing with us these are these wild creatures and they're having fun with us and then I started doing all this research on dolphins and dolphin communication assess with dolphins because this one I mean I had I had been fascinated by them before but I became truly obsessed and this was this experience was more than ten years ago and since then I've just I've been overwhelmed and and also massively disheartened by just you know by films like yours and by seeing SeaWorld and by seeing what was going on in marine land with my friend Phil and I've had him on a bunch of times to talk about his lawsuits I mean they have done everything they can to try to silence that guy and stop him from revealing all the horrors to that place but slowly but surely he's had a massive impact on that places business to the point where they're trying to just get him to shut up and he won't he won't meaning he was I mean he was on the inside he was a trainer and all that stuff so for me to be able to talk to someone like you it's it's you know it's I love the fact that we can get that out there well I appreciate it you know I mean it's you know swimming with dolphins in the wild there was a trigger to memory over in ranga rao's with with our team and there was three groups a resident dolphins that so they were there hanging out there all the time you get to recognize them and we were playing with them and the more you play with them the more you can spin around the more you can you know the more excited they get yeah and they could only do it for so long and I remember once that we were doing it we finally we were we had scooters and we thought well the more if so a dolphin looks at you and you can you look like you're like in a wheelchair but you know in the water we just look like ya know we're just pitiful yeah then so they can only be entertained so Long's but the scooters we figured we could engage them a lot longer and then all of a sudden this group just took off and there was sort of that you're let down because you have this you're high from the experience of being with them in the wild and they took off then we saw that there were it was about an 18 foot long hammerhead and they were taking turns ramming it away from us yeah so it was like not only were they playing with us they were protecting us wow that must been wild though seeing an 18 foot long hammerhead hole yeah because they disappeared into the blue and then we could see them ramming the same the dolphins were big I mean they're you know not quite as long as this table but they're you know they're probably three to five hundred pounds and they're maybe seven feet long and they look tiny next to this short wow that's wild that is wild yeah occasionally you see they'll do drone footage off of the coast of Malibu and you see like a great white swimming around they're just a few hundred yards away from surfers and my son does that with drones he goes out of his kayak and foot in films them my friend Peter Peter tia he say he's done a bunch of like crazy endurance things and one of the things he did he swam he swam to all the islands in Hawaii and what to prepare for this he had to do a lot of swimming he lives in San Diego and swimming in the coast out there and he was swimming literally what do you say like a couple days after that guy got bit in half oh my god yeah I think was just different you know he wasn't scared ever I think my freaked out but it was it was within a few days of one of the one of the guys who got bit in half down in San Diego what did this happen the San Diego incident I want to say it was 10 years ago somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years ago and then there was in one in Santa Barbara that happened about four years ago four or five years ago you know occasionally they slip up I think a person's a seal or something you know most what's the time when I've been and I've dealt with a lot of sharks before it is that you could only usually only get them around you if you're feeding them and that feels so or horrible it's just so unnatural I won't do it anymore but weird right yeah it's just just it's just not I couldn't be around it there's some friends of mine that were feeding it you know feet they're on a feed and I was I was about and 50 yards away and I thought I just don't want to be part of it and I was just filming on the reef and these silver tips came over and I don't know if they're excited by I was had a camera with the strobes on it but they just came and they were like attacking me and I had a rebreather I died with a rebreather so you can scream so I started screaming as long as I could through this thing but I was pushing pushing them off and they were like working together you could see it was like packed you know like when we go this way so he had a like I had these these lights with these like an octopus with four lights on it and I could push him away but then one of the the guys that we had brought over a tuna head and lured him away but they were just it was because of that is because they were excited by you know the the feeding over there so I don't even want to be in the water these days when people are feeding sharks because there's no joke when you're under the water that's not your you saw they could just run to run up a tree no place to go no where to go you feel helpless and that's their natural environment and that's what they're there for they're there to clean up you know anything this week anything that's fucked up and then you know any seal it get caught slipping there they're there for population control I mean there's a really powerful video off of the I'm sure you probably seen and off of Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco we're a bunch of tourists are there a boom this great white snatches a seal right in front of everybody just just thunderous explosion of blood and foam in the water and like whoa you know a couple miles from where I live yeah yeah I mean they're they're magic that's a that's a sheep's beast I'm supposed to have something just invited me today to go out and be with great way it's not diving just just to watch just to watch there's a crazy video from I think it was the Cape somewhere around the Cape Cod where there's like a 20-foot one next to a boat and these guys were in this boat and this this great white just swims right up next to them and they start fucking screaming and freaking out and it's enormous it's like 20 feet long the only point I like if you don't feed them they're usually fairly if you have if you're feeding them or if you're a spear hunting then they'll come near you they're dangerous for severe hunters right yeah what is this record-breaking year for ARC's off cape cod yeah apparently there's a lot of them out there now what do you think that is that because of a large number of marine mammals or or drones we could actually see him now yeah right yeah that's true yeah so listen man I want to thank you for coming here this is a very cool and if people want to see the cove it's available on boy that's a good question now I think you'd still see it on on iTunes you can buy it the reason on Netflix not Netflix no but iTunes it's available there Amazon can you get it on Amazon yep erasing extinction is a little bit harder I'm not sure where you can get that one but that's I think that's better than the cove in a lot of ways okay I'll check it out Oh watch it the code was pretty powerful man yeah well thanks please thank you my pleasure thanks for being here thanks for having me hi everybody [Music] [Music]
