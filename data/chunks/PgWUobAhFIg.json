hello freak bitches uncomfortable for short bursts don't eat so much exercises so everything you just said you know there was a really interesting study that just came out a couple weeks ago where they looked at the rates of Aging in young adults so they looked at different time points so they looked they took that there's a whole I think it was like over a thousand people and the study started when they were like 26 years old and they measured like 18 different biomarkers of aging so they looked at like DNA health they looked at telomere length so telomeres had those caps on the end of your chromosomes that protecting damage they're a marker for aging they looked at HDL cholesterol they looked at c-reactive protein which is a inflammatory mediator they looked at 18 different things and they looked at these people that were 26 years old and then it did it again when they were 32 and then they did it again when they were 38 and what they found was that even though these people were all the same chronological age their cells looked very very very different people age at different rates some people if you looked on the cellular level they look 10 years older and some people look 10 years younger than their chronological age and I was looking at some of these graphs of people and you can see some people started out like they started out bad where they looked old and then they started getting better you know they probably started changing their diet their lifestyle other people started going worse some people stayed the same you know so there are lots of different variables going on here but I think what's really interesting oh and by the way that their physical appearance also correlated with not their chronological age but their biological age but is what it's called so if they showed their picture to people random people and said guess what age they are they would guess their biological age not their chronological age so if a person was 38 but they look 28 the person would say oh they're probably 28 and if the person was 38 but they looked 48 they just looked worn and you know rough then the person would guess that they were much much older than they were so there was a correlation between physical appearance and the biological age and this is I found this really really interesting because I think it is strong evidence for the fact that your diet and your lifestyle play a major role in the way you age you know if I was in the movie world I would call somebody but Melissa McCarthy will be the whale oh how dare you she's the funniest woman around uh she's very funny she's very physically funny for sure she's very talented yeah it's funny cuz Billy Gardell is a funny comic you know Billy yeah yeah they don't like on the show he's like almost like a straight guy Epicor wouldn't want the husband getting one over on the wife would you Joe they don't allow that Nick not why is that what so what's up with that fuckers jerk-offs run Hollywood people want to see do people want to see they don't want to see that you know fuckin Holly's been hijacked by fucking feminists really think am I wrong if you guys can't relate that I'm fucking leaving I think you never noticed they have emasculation and movies in fucked the last 20 years I think there's people that are seriously concerned with coming off as progressive and even if they think differently than what would be the progressive choice they will make the progressive choice because they get like social brownie points I definitely think that's true but I don't think that pertains to sitcoms I think like it's not as funny if the dude gets over on the chick for the last time I was here I had a deal with this was years ago at Dennis Larry's company oh yeah and we come out here and take a bunch of meetings and forget for like you know there's a sitcom idea and at first of all every meeting 75% of the room was female executives hmm and of course the first question and every meeting was what's the wife's role every fucking one so by the time we got to NBC which was the last one and I had fucking had it and they're like so what's the wife I go and again I was just kidding but I go I don't I see like in the pilot she's pregnant I push her down the cellar stairs and I'm expecting like Dennis does not laughing and in Serpico Jimmy Serpico's and they all just look at me you could have fucking her in a pen so the next day next day Jimmy surberg had to send a dozen roses to the lady from NBC oh my wonder why I can't get a gig thank God you threw me a Newsradio no place on the fires
