hello freak bitches did you see the Philadelphia conference that I that I sent you would about about white people's guilt I'm guilty I'm guilty there was a there was a white privilege conference love that article that because we did this I'm sure yeah you did I was like why is my Twitter blowing up Oh Joe retweeted me so there was this white privilege conference which was a kind of politically correct talk fast right and it basically ended up consuming itself entirely because the people who were attending it decided that the conference itself had become too white so they were forget if they were all there so they had this hashtag white privilege conference so white WPC so white and it started after one of the speakers there who was a white historian went over time and what an asian-american attendee a woman tweeted out great keynote but going over time allotted is another example of white supremacy white privilege conference so white ah and he also made the mistake of using the n-word in his speech I mean he obviously was using it in a historical context because he was talking about race in America but once that happened I mean what could possibly go wrong using the n-word at a conference about white guilt right then everyone starts tweeting n-word never acceptable from hashtag white folks lips deeply offensive and traumatizing hashtag white privilege conference so white and that was from a white tweeter so then it's it's like a snake eating its fucking tail right always white people just accusing one another of being too white you're all white we get it we get it it's what Michael Shermer calls virtue signaling right yeah right it's they're they're letting em know it's perfect yeah term they're they're trying to find someone who's made some sort of an error yeah they're attacking them with full force yep and it's also like they're ignoring context on purpose mm-hmm it's like by saying that the word is it's never acceptable to say the n-word by saying that and putting that in a tweet that's not true it's just not true like if a reason to say it if you were explaining something that happened what someone said how they said it you are allowed to repeat the word the idea that you're not allowed to repeat the word around grown adults is to pretend that word is magic yeah to pretend that words gonna conjure demon well it also empowers the word in fact I feel stupid for even having used the phrase the N word cuz ordinarily I just say nigger if I'm talking about understand context right but I mean I was talking about this on my podcast about I do think that we we've gotten away from like where is the other person's heart and what is their intention yeah there's there is see you could think of it like an amoeba around your physical body in the loud of pulsating thought-forms hmm and as you're imagining you know a the beautiful elements of life and things it's it seems to be in a kind of order and and maybe kind of wafting upward it these are like the the spiritual positive kind of frameworks sometimes that you're seeing life through when you're tripping you know and seeing the connections between things lines forming and things like that the the more kind of organic geometries that that show up you see this intelligence of life and the the the light of divine intelligence that came through for Allison like in this language it it seems to be weaving things together and when you're in touch with that infinite light that seems to be the source then that is you can keep it upwardly moving and very evolutionarily cosmically consciously moving forward and when then you're thinking regretful thoughts are thinking negative thoughts and anger and things like that there's a constriction that goes on in your heart and kind of shuts things down and that kind of like you were saying twisting in and curling in and and darkening and and things are all things that when you're journeying you see them manifest literally and you're the flow of your the theatre of your imagination and so I think you really beautifully described that just in that I was totally there I think it's a disease of consciousness I think it's very similar to catching a cold that you know you don't see the cold you don't see a disease you don't see it but it affects you and I think that there's an analogy to be made about diseases of consciousness that you can get locked into these terrible ways of looking at the world I found for a while I enjoyed living within very strict guidelines it was just easier when we go to a restaurant because I used to joke that I would like to be buried in a bread basket with a fuck ton of butter like bread and butter is my thing and when we go to a restaurant and they bring the bread like I just I don't even touch it it's not mine I did it was so it was nice to not even have to think about all these things um but then I don't know a few months ago I just thought I don't feel like this is really doing anything for me anymore and I miss my Lean Cuisine dinners which is what I used to eat all the things you can miss I know well healthy choice dinners as well fucking processed bullshit I know I had stopped eating the process but I missed all shit I missed the bullshit I missed I missed the wood pulp what is wood pulp it's probably there's some kind of filler in there I'm just saying there's like wood pulp in your food in Parmesan cheese I think why didn't that come out recently what right Jamie knows Jamie what are you talking about what kind of Parmesan cheese in just the the you know the bottle of Kraft Parmesan cheese it came out a certain percentage of it is like wood shavings or some parts mm-hmm Jesus Christ why are they putting wood in your cheese so that there's a it's day was just plants though that's a cheese you sprinkle could what cellulose okay hotly-contested but perhaps not for reasons might think FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company Castle cheese incorporated had doctored its so-called parmesan with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose also known as wood pulp oh well if you say cellulose that doesn't sound yeah cellulose just sounds like like fiber Frank plants plant material yeah hmm well there shouldn't be plant material and fucking cheese you cunts asshole just go to jail for that putting fucking wood cheese you can't just do that and you can't mix cheddar cheese with wood and call it parmesan no it should have its own new variety new wood pulp cheesy thing right just call it that yeah I would buy it my mouth is watering you're eating Lean Cuisine you saying I don't know what it is in the processed frozen dinners that I like but that's what I like sort of like when I smoked I was like yeah I think it's the fiberglass in the cigarettes that I like [Music]
