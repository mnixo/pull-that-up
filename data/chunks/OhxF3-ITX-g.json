the girag and experience yeah I always assumed we would be hanging out all the time from now on from from that point on but it really didn't work out that way no no it ever does you know no I asked triggers everybody goes in such different directions yeah yeah I ran into Maura a once or twice I know a manager once we had a good time at one of those NBC functions yeah and I was on Newsradio or Fear Factor and she was on ER and we we got drunk together it was a great time yeah Oh like the old days yeah mind of yours always fun to get drunk oh yeah she's not the best ever you know she was the one who convinced me to kick in the craft service door is real hungry uh yeah we had some good times on that set after the set after filming we would basically just drink all night you know yeah she said filming would be done at whatever and they all have our mini fridges stocked in our experiment colors we just get hammered and just shoot the shit and have fun and laugh and go over Dave's room and Lissa's some weird music Dave always had some weird chicks that made you want to cry play a few of them they dated yeah yeah just is you know strange somber women voices mm-hmm and and then we had something to be there till till it was time to go to Denny's Yeah right or we would go to down the street when we were at sunset Gower we would go down to that bar what was the call there was like a like an industry bar like really cater to people that we're leaving the set well right next to the next all right yes peanut was that what it was yeah it has to be the tenth Ibarra grill yeah yeah yeah be like all the people from Fraser and that was weird would be there ya go and it wouldn't be stiff as fuck we would be hammered and they would be all still like doing their actor thing you know I thought it was a marvelous performance I think he was quite lovely did you know that it's on Broadway now I'll be amazing yeah I've got to see it you know they were just all completely full of shit and he would come in trying to grab everybody's dick and you know Dave and I would be hammered more get hammered yeah Julie being extremely vain yeah we'd all be laughing and joking around yeah it was a great great group of humans and most I was one of the most fun times of my entire life those those years it was amazing there was one time I remember we were about to go and do it there was a live audience there never do getting written getting ready and we were standing in that little back hallway where they would introduce us and I said you know that this is going to be one of those days we're going to look back when we're older and we're going to go I can't believe I didn't enjoy this more I can't believe I didn't appreciate how crazy this is more yeah you know and you don't realize what a random stroke of luck it is to get so many cool people all together in one group yeah the fact that yeah we all wanted to spend time together like out like when work was done nobody yeah go everyone wanted to stay we'd also get the feeds from other other metal yeah the other shows other sets we get to watch other horrible sitcoms that's a greg Giraldo had a - yeah that was a good one actually yeah and so did Joey Lawrence do you remember that oh I only mostly just remember him sitting in his convertible playing his own CDs really loud he always had badass cars like Joey Lawrence always had like the newest Ferrari or the newest Bentley or whatever the hell it was but he sit there playing his own music loud super loud with a bandana on yeah okay where is he now man intentionally ripped jeans he was just in Dancing with the Stars recently and well I think Dave said it best even back then was that someone needs to tell that young man that he's gay that's exactly how you said it - we stopped that we were looking there and there was a couple of them and you you just you just stopped and paused and said someone needs to tell that young man he's gay that's we went into work I mean he would be right you don't know where these cars were parked and right directly in front of the building so you'd open up the door and you know you basically be on set and right behind that is this fucking guy in his car blaring his own music from yeah some insane stereo system that's like and if your music is that is great it's wrong to sit there and listen to your music in the car yeah Robert Plant is in his car fucking beating you know the drums to his steering wheel yeah they'll be like what the fuck Lowry really yeah you don't get an ever tension yeah yeah but you and your Joey Lawrence yeah now your you've just started to stand up Riesling yes uh of a fascinating thing to me because I always thought you'd be a brilliant stand up because you're a great writer and when we used to do those little things in the audience remember we're not we would talk to the audience before yeah you would fuck around with them every now and then and yeah you wouldn't like do it like Phil had a routine that he was doing it Phil actually started doing stand-up because of you know wanting to entertain the audience so he had a bunch of bits that he would do oh yeah Clinton impressions and were really good and it was like I was like holy shit dude you know like a real comic like you're a stand-up guy kind of thinking about - it feels like this really unusual human being very very fascinating guy yeah you know he was the world he was like a great hobbyist yeah he would go so deep he would got into flying yeah and which is actually how I found out about this neighborhood you know Phil was taking me out into the valley looking for you know different places where he could you know go and have a nice view you know we went up in his little single-engine plane but I remember when he first started getting into the the flying boy he was reading book after book in between rehearsals he'd be studying his pilot's book like the dude with the little fake broadcast booth yeah very he was very very disciplined Wow well I said Phil was like a big league version of mark McKinney from kids in the hall because the BART bikini was really into his flight simulator I know where he'll learn to fly a plane yeah it's like you know loved it he had to fly a plane learn to sail a boat no he was one of those guys you know yeah he's only had learned to duck yeah well not even if you had learned to just separate from fucking crazy people I now had some we you know we all did I think had talks with him many times about divorce you know like you got to get out of that man yeah it was one of those things where we would we would have these parties I mean Paul had one party once and I remember we were all at this bar somewhere and Phil showed up with the wife and she just saying the creepiest shit and insulting him and you know talking about how she likes pickup trucks cuz they remind her of you know boys that she used to bang back when she was younger and just just just torturing him just torture talking about oh well you're not fail you know feels too old and he's just like didn't he have like women thrown on him all the time it seems like if he was that miserable that you would have just doesn't matter man when you have children with somebody you're here in horribly attached forever bill was yeah the thought of being separated from his kids watch and I understand because at the time I was separated from my kids yeah yeah I know you know I completely see where he was coming from he didn't want a divorce he thought his wife is with all her flaws was still very good to the kids and you know and he felt felt like he could work it out and then he really got into pot you know that was his thing he would just get he's a waiter yeah I was loved yeah he'd be sitting in his Mercedes in this parking space with his one-hitter yeah big big to the gills stone and you weren't smoking weed imagine smoking weed with phil heartman we barely you yeah yeah didn't do any any drugs I would just get drunk yes I would do yeah people don't know a lot of people that don't even realize Newsradio wasn't a hit but while we were on the air we were on the air we moved nine times nine times over the course of five seasons and the guy had the head of programming it of scheduling at NBC hated us why was that I don't know remember there was that whole thing with the Rolling Stone article yes uh but that was when we were already floundering yeah but it was also but the guy this guy but we should tell people what that means yeah what's wrong the rolling star Dinoco Paul Stanley or Paul Stanley yeah kiss Paul Simms was the creator of the show called NBC's Thursday night lineup which was their big friend's lineup they called it a shit sandwich he called it was really it should have been shit was the bun because the real sandwich was friends and then you would have friends on and then you would have this terrible show you know that was always on after friends yeah and you know obviously NBC was very upset that Paul was calling sex in the city or the single guy two pieces of shit but you know they were they were terrible shows and then friends was his brilliant show that everybody tuned into so they sort of watched those other shows just because they were on but I guess it got a chance to get impressed and Beckman hated our show even when we did the pilot he didn't want it picked up really because we were originally supposed to get a Thursday slot ourselves but this guy who was in charge of the NBC schedule wouldn't let us have a Thursday slot so then he basically kept trying to find a slot that would kill us so that's why they put us on uh what we were the leading we were we were on with wings and Fraser yeah Fraser and those shows are both doing poorly when we came along and he put us on with those shows and we are showed we boosted the ratings of both shows well all sudden became like a decent lineup for for comedies but it was a different time than man there was no DVRs and we had shows couldn't exist in a non popular spot it had to be a spot where people already looking well the ratings we were getting in those you're getting like 10 million people tuning in yeah and those ratings in those days were considered a ratings failure like today if you got those ratings you're the number one show on TV yeah it's weird and then these are so many channels now at one point in time Lou Morton used to show up at our writers meetings at the rather at the run other yeah the table read was a tea with a shirt shirt on with the number of whatever we were in what place we're in and he showed up and it was 84 yes you're an 84 theme plays and we were like what up was at 84 88 it might was that that's when they finally when they they put us up against true carry yeah and we had Warren Littlefield actually came down to a table read to let us know that they still loved us yeah they serve his turkey dinner oh you ever learn born like there was there carving Turkey and certain Warren Littlefield whatever had yeah he was a nice guy but James got a network head yeah he was very nice this I was remember a 95 Warren Littlefield dancing on the bar in New York at the we would for the up France and it was like Jay Leno head with head just hit number was the number one late night show why and when Warren was standing on this bar doing shots and shouting 1995 oh wow again that's hilarious was that the one we which one did you guys get drunk at I didn't go and you guys get it's like mess every event but we got kicked out where we weren't allowed to go was the SAG Awards yeah these motherfuckers got so hammered they caused so much damage at the SAG Awards we couldn't go anymore we weren't allowed to go I've still never been back here's a great one we were at the Emmys and this is after Phil had been murdered and we're sitting there and you know Phil was nominated for something and the the nominations go and I think the guy from Frasier god david Hyde Pierce yeah Len and Dave turns me and goes what does Phil have to do to win like oh no you know who's so do I already was in David David I pierced look so embarrassed to be winning yeah he was literally up there like his all the blood drained out of his face he was just going um well obviously uh Phil Hartman um you know he didn't even like put a sentence together he was ya wonder what the choice behind that was I was weird I know don't don't kill someone and then expect them to win so the message setting out to be reading it's cheating being murdered is a cheat oh what a strange strange times yeah what did you guys do at the SAG Awards that got us kicked out forever yeah I think most you're just uh at the time I guess cuz we all thought what a stupid Awards Show and you know this is the first year of the SAG Awards we said this is ridiculous white actors voting about each other and getting award shows saying who's best oh that's the you know our union is deciding who is best and it creates this weird that this like culture of ass-kissing and yeah bakery yeah they're all like what a wonderful project you know amazing and I think what we do I think more and I found where the the service bar was and you know they had like the big industrial corkscrew and everything so we found that so we're going back there just opening up bottles of wine and bringing them out to the table and I think you know and then you know we had Andy with us too yeah which was so who did what uh we do anything notable that got us kicked out I don't really I think we were just noisy and rude and I'm stealing we were applauding inappropriately and he's really it was a cast where you regularly hear people say you know what my joke doesn't work we should cut my joke that his house is the better joke yes all the time you know it was really an amazing environment and you would also hear don't put that pencil in my cunt yeah like that I mean yeah just say the most fucked up shit ever I mean we remember the time we had the we actually had to sit down and we played that presentation for us oh the UH the sexual harassment oh I felt so badly for that person but it was that good you don't know you don't know the group of people you've just walked in front of who's so ridiculous they have to go over this whole thing of what's appropriate and what's not appropriate and yeah it would have meant basically would cut down about 98% of all conversation on our sex I mean we all just sort of you know just made an agreement that we wouldn't see each other yeah like okay this doesn't this doesn't apply right but if anybody wanted to I mean there's been many times on sets where you know especially women actresses feel like there's too much of that shit going on and they just fucking fuck this I'm getting a lawyer and then there's payouts man it becomes like a big issue yeah you make a lot of money I know so I'm like you'd have Andy Murray and you'd be sitting there to think ego they got us want to stuff your pussy food leaves twigs mud you know Vicky with him be Bob's Vicky with me laughing I had a very first time I met Andy and again I've been acting for a fucking month right I dunno a new no one like that I grew up with fighters and pool hustlers the those are the two worlds that I was most entrenched in and crazy stand-up comedians they're all nuts right and then I'll set them in this this dressing room with Andy and Andy is sitting cross-legged and he has clogs on okay and he's got these weird brown corduroy pants and he's like flipping his foot back and forth go do you think you're gonna be famous and I was like I don't know what do you think oh yes I know I'm gonna be right now I'm gonna be I've already decided I'm gonna be so famous I can't wait I can't wait to be really really famous do you think this is gonna be the show for you or maybe not I don't know man I don't know you're gonna be famous obsolete so much yeah I think you think it's already happening yeah I think the arc of your friendship with Andy was the most interesting of the whole cast I only wish I had marijuana back then yeah yeah I would have found him so much more fascinating because I had testosterone and adrenaline and that was just every day was just keep don't kill Andy I can't win don't fucking kill him because he was just so out of control and never met someone so out of control but onset nobody enjoyed Andy more than you did I loved him like doing scenes so he's like Joe had so show getting through scenes of an chief because I would laugh you'd bust you up constantly I can't even that's just saying that I guess but my emotional attachment though to Newsradio is that as fucked up as he is he'll always I'll always consider him to be family yes you know like everyone from Newsradio I was considered to me everyone from these radios you know is family to me yeah you know yeah no doubt it's it's it's a very unusual bond that we all have you know Stephen Roode called me a while back for some party that he was thrown and I couldn't make it I was going out of town I was like wow how good is it to talk to this guy again yeah I feel like sometimes we won't see each other for years you know but it's like but it never feels like but whenever I see anyone from Newsradio it doesn't feel like any time has passed
