hello freak bitches look at this fucking photograph there is a lion that is hugging a bear and the lion has a tear rolling down his face and the bear has a tear rolling down his face and says damn ban the bear hunt they are all Cecil save New Jersey bears calm oh my god first makes me want to punch somebody in the face what kind of fucking crazy person living living some weird bubble made this billboard and spent actual human money on it yeah I don't know this fantasy land if they haven't seen ok they have a giant problem with bears in New Jersey and this is this is this facts behind this first of all a student from Rutgers was fuckin killed by a bear right outside of Rutgers see that photograph student took this photo of a bear just before it killed them I was talking to a guy who is who knows Rangers out there and they're telling people not to hike mm-hmm they have so many goddamn bear in New Jersey and why do they have so many bear because they didn't have a hunt for them so these goddamn things they got overpopulated and they have now they're entering into residential neighborhoods and these are hungry look at this fucking video bear fight Far Rockaway New Jersey August 14th of 2014 these bears are duking it out these are big black bears like 7-foot bears 400-plus pounds bears and they are going to war in this guy's front lawn these are huge I mean if you were in Alberta and you saw one of these bears coming in you'd be like oh boy that's a trophy bear that's a giant bear that's hundreds of pounds of meat for the grill yeah and these bears are in this guy's lawn I mean this isn't a this isn't some crazy rural you know and like sue Aikens living in the middle of the nowhere notes in this Jersey this thing just knocked over a lamp post and now it's colliding with these garbage pails watch this they come they're fighting over territory by the way that's created by garbage that's what the territory is they attack people's garbage and these two bears they bite each other and then they Duke it out look at the size of these bears I know these are huge right well that's that's why okay so maybe there was before there's houses that was perfect bear habitat but guess what there's houses now that means bear we have to control the bear numbers that's hunting well here's another part of the problem these bears weren't here 30 years ago these bears are over populating and moving into these neighborhoods and they're doing it because they know that people live there and it's a steady supply of food so the cancer thinking that and I get then you know I mean that stuff probably is linked to cancer but they've pulled back on the red meat in general they're not sure about it but the thing is and I think the study is skewed because if you talk about cancer and pH okay you know grass-fed beef has a neutral pH corn-fed grain fed beef that pH goes up and and we know that cancer thrives in a acidic environment environment you know and you know there's other things the the cows that have high acid guts basically is what it is they're more prone to acidosis which which needs more medication you need antibiotics and it's also a prime harbor for e.coli the I'll find a stat for you but the Accola it's I think it was six million three hundred thousand milligrams per I'll look that up I'll check you guys talk that's an attorney yeah yeah go ahead look that up but it's a very important point I think you're making about about how these animals that are unhealthy it's kind of unhealthy to eat an unhealthy animal that seems logical ah so obviously now we're talking cells per gram of meat okay okay so in your grain fed the count of e.coli the grain fed and the count of e.coli six million three hundred thousand cells per gram in the grass fed twenty thousand holy shit yeah nobody doing this is nobody just leave it here hit him a little bit do it look away because most time when you look away they think and then book you know it's flat hand on the center of the chest and just shove it shove it over the chest yeah that sense that doesn't make sense but wouldn't that work with a punch as well with the yeah but you have more space with a palm right like on this distance mm-hmm this is much shorter than this this is like an extra 15% which will make a lot of difference that wasn't that distance that's a very good point yeah that's another five or six inches at least yeah that's why I never understood nobody strong palm strikes now the left hook right straight combination right in boxing right it's a dumb combination if you really think about it if there's a short left hook I'm Way too close for my straight punch it has no power I can't stretch my arm but if I do a palm strike and then a straight punch now I got space for my straight punch it's much harder so why is nobody doing that now I do clotheslines and I posted a thing on Facebook like a year ago when I hit a bag with a clothesline yeah I don't think people can imitate me my weight with a kick like that they can kick and then I said okay now I show clothesline they see the back folding around my whole arm is the craziest thing you can block with taking it try to block whatever you want if I clothesline you if you stand still it goes straight through everything I guarantee you knock yard why is that why is a clothesline so powerful it is so powerful because you can really lock it up don't stretch your arm nitin because if you miss time and you hit you you go to hyperextend but you can drag your whole body weight in there because your legs are planted on the ground for strike and also with the clinch when even when they stand like this if I do this it loops around to defense in the neck of the head still the legal part Brian because it's outside the mohawk well even the back of the head standing never seems to get like in boxing they get penalized for punching the back of the head like people say no rabbit punches but when you think about a head kick a lot of head kicks they want to go over the shoulder there there the back of the head yeah and it's and it's legal and that's why they're effective and that's why it was so effective with me with a with with pancreas I hid behind the ear if you look at Mike Tyson's fights you know I don't know how he did it but he did it he was always the shorter guy but if you see him hooking somebody he hits almost the back of the head he's got very short hooks now the body it's ready for impact from the front or from the side because you're used to it well if you can see the punch coming the behind I always tell people just do with the palms just do this to the back of your head and see what happens like just me doing this it's already go you're not ready for that so you know what you imagine if you go hit as hard as you can behind it here it's a sweet it's a sweet punch I can't understand nobody's doing it right ahead that much more dangerous Oh do this do this but I mean is it that much more dangerous I just behind it here just do that oh yeah all right you got yeah and I was down here doing something like I would do platform work where I would like demonstrate how to do stuff for other hairdressers and people and I went to not the Viper Room one of those clubs and this pretty woman comes up to me and says are you a musician and I'm like yeah but and I'm kind of about to say but I live in Canada and that you know and she goes well my husband's putting together a band and you got to meet him his name's Andy McCoy and Andy McCoy wouldn't mean much to a lot of people but to somebody who's really into like Motley Crue and stuff like that he was in a band called Hanoi Rocks that was kind of started that movement oh shit I'm gonna be famous rich and famous not knowing that although metal edge told me that this one guy was a big deal he was just to get a musician but I had to a 20 year old from Winnipeg suck oh my god I'm gonna be in a huge fuckin band so I go and I meet him we go to his house in Woodland Hills and I actually I've been here four times there was that time that I flew home to Winnipeg and they flew me back down because they were gonna get me singing in their band I'm like 20 years old this guy's like famous to me right so I get down there and shit is not all that organized you know what I mean like something's not making a lot of sense and then around day two I figure out okay because everyone's on heroin and it started we had smoked some pot which in Winnipeg in Manitoba we called that dope you wanna smoke some dope it's like sure it was like so it goes do you do dope I'm like yeah I just smoked it with you like 20 minutes ago cuz no like and then before I knew it he didn't ejected me with heroin like a conversation sort of happened I was trying to be not super uncool but like not saying yes I want to do heroin and then four days went by like literally just shooting up for four days and then I just about missed my plane called miss Wright a girl and a home and a job and all those kinds of things that I'm kind of looking at like the plane ticket and I know it's like okay if I get a cab in the next two hours I'll get to play and I'll get home or whatever and he's like what just you know and you're not even thinking it's like you're barely even there and somewhere along the line I was just like don't worry about it just fine you don't have to go get on the plane II I probably got a hundred dollars to my name and if I didn't get on that plane I'd have no job no girl I'd be a heroin addict with no money in Woodland Hills with a guy who doesn't have his shit together I think in the years since he's got his shit together I haven't seen him since then and I've made myself go and I was sick for two or three days and I realized like literally that second in time if I don't convince myself to get on that plane my whole life is fucking ruined [Music]
