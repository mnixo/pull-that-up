hello bitches I feel like if you created a situation where Iran saw that there was much more to be gained from joining the economic community and playing ball in accordance with its laws is then in getting weapons of mass destructions they're all scared that those chicks are gonna find out they don't have to wear burqas in America votes run boats and then I seek out black dick like a magnet like a magnet to steel filings perhaps they're tired of being suppressed they want to work on some dude in a club maybe no crazy funky religious outfit on and they can escape you know why cuz no one knows the fuck they look like they could just blend right in good luck in the passport photo when it's looking through a fucking lid of a garbage can like Oscar the Grouch that's what you're that's what your fucking Passport looks like you see your eyeballs they have to take this shit out for their passport right don't think I'm allowed to it's like stealing their soul or something right well the minute that a lot of Saudi women go to places like London and Kuwait guess what comes off immediately their headdress the whole bouquet and shopping and they dress in sexy outfits and they're just like yeah because depression that it's it's amazing that you've got countries that in 2015 still make women dress like they're in Star Wars there's no reason for it another reason for it there was another very logical reason for it logical well I'm just saying if you're if you're if you really if you're if you're I'm just saying if you're a religious man and if you are trying to create a productive Society the logic went if you have women walking around looking all sexy and naked which was a lot of the Middle East if you have that what happens is we're thinking about fucking and not producing yeah so you got to cover your chicks up jamming if you want to get any work done that's not true though I guess America produces like a mother fuck about that how we got hot freaks over hill it's so true freedom freedom that's is that what you look like Princess Leia is that a real body yeah damn shit a bangin body she did was real to those pre pretty suck and tuck god bless her you know she only have no lipo couldn't look more bored she was beautiful at the time very exotic Bensley oh what a steal bro I made out with her brother remember that shit I love it she kissed her brother on lipstick is that true I had to he didn't know that it was his sister that's rude your sister comes along gives you a real kiss she doesn't even bother telling you that she's did she know at the time but she no she was no no one knew I don't know if you've experienced this yet but for me you know I've done it a lot and so I almost like to punish myself and some I like it to be hard I like to be a challenge so I will actually create it to be it I just did this hunt in New Zealand where I was hunting these these fallow deer and at any given time for the first few days I could have shot a deer well if hunt it a lot of people don't realize as hunters it's not always the goal to just go shoot something it's part of the experience and so for me I just kept passing up animals because the experience wasn't right until the last day when I was supposed to leave early and I end up I'm just gonna be hunting for two hours and I don't bring any water and I end up hunting all day and going I don't even know how far eighteen miles maybe and I didn't bring any food bring any water and I'm hurtin and I ended up shooting a deer at last light and and now as to me there's awesome experience it made the trip it made that memory the hardship made the memory and something that I as a hunter that non hunters don't really maybe understand is like having these antlers around and when the meats long gone I can look at that and remember the hardship and the journey and the adventure and these other things about the experience and the meat was a bright product but these are the memories that I like you look at that moose and you think of something completely different than I do you remember how it went down you remember you know maybe the struggle or carrying the meat back or whatever so I may have a rack in my house that's sitting up on the mantel why is that one on the mantel and that one that when I had to work real hard for so I look at it and I think it reminds me constantly of what I went through when you say that the experience wasn't right what do you mean by that like I feel sometimes it just wasn't a challenge I it was I would have been shooting an animal not it the adventure wasn't there the challenge wasn't there it just wasn't the right time I wanted to keep going hmm until it and so it happened I don't know it's a weird but for me hunting is about the adventure and everything behind it and so as well as obviously getting meat but there comes a point where you know if okay if I didn't get a deer this week well maybe I'll get one next week I'm not gonna starve to death I've got a freezer with meat but I also want to keep that freezer full but so it comes to a point for me where it's about other things as well the experience the adventure the meat all combining into this if it's too easy I just don't like it that's fat I don't know it okay it'll happen you know for me it happened I started I would when I was younger I never wanted to stop hunting because I liked the experience of being out there so much so I would do it a lot of people called trophy hunting and I'm here quoting that because it means something different to me where I would look for a bigger deer because I wanted to keep hunting and make it more of a challenge for myself I find it quite remarkable that people worry about this simply because it's not the way that people actually think about anything else let's remember that the longevity aspect of all of this work is a side effect I don't work on longevity I don't I certainly don't work on immortality the way you might think if you read the papers I just work on health I'm just interested in stopping people from getting sick when they get older now if you think about it all medicine is like that all medicine involves stopping people from getting sick or fixing them other thing I think and all medicine has a side effect that people live longer than they otherwise would have done so the only real difference between the work that sense Research Foundation does and the work that everything everyone else in medical research does is a difference of degree the fact that the longevity side effect of our work may be substantially greater than the longevity side effect that we're familiar with it's still a side effect so if we come to the question of how one might want to live you know does that any it's not even a meaningful question to me it's like saying what time would you like to go to the toilet next Sunday you know we know that that's a dumb thing to have an opinion about it's a dumb thing to have an opinion about because we know we're going to have more information on the topic near at the time we were going to be able to act on the information and it's the same deal you know nobody makes decisions on the basis of how long ago they were born people increasingly make decisions as they get older on the basis of how long they think they've got to live but that's because the amount of time they think they've got to live is going down which it won't be going down anymore if you've got an arbitrary amount of time behind you and rather arbitrary amount of time ahead of you your decision-making is going to be based on more short-term considerations you know like peer pressure and so on you know I sometimes point out when people ask me these things I'll sometimes say okay take yourself back to the first time you got laid oh yeah all right think about what you were thinking at the time what are you thinking oh my god oh my god I have to get this person into bed right now because I've only got another 60 years to live I mean it's just ridiculous [Music]
