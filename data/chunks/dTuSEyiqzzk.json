lot of shit I've covered you're not gonna you know you're not gonna surprise it's a Larry's take on you can have that water I've never had security in my life you know because I'm a man I still take the teachers for shits and giggles but I mean you know Wow crazy yeah well cuz I'm thinking punch him in his throat and he'll just drop to his knees and don't even know what happened I'll say we need a medic you know get and then I'm just gonna whispers why don't you meet me outside ten minutes I'm gone I can't do that man yeah I was all dressed nice and oh if you're gonna punch some of the throat though the promise sometimes you Nick the chin the real way to do it is this this with your hand yeah just slam that fucking thing in the throat right in there that's how you do it if you punch someone in the throat yeah first first of all you could say I pushed him away from me right right I fucked that up now someone's gonna say but that's how you if you want to hit someone in the throat yeah and you don't want to really hurt him you want to get him the fuck away from you yeah just use your open hand like that your open hand just like that it's amazing how much force you can generate with your head like that just slam it and you don't have to wind up but no this is a tender area it's very vulnerable that's what's going through my mind well this guy is screaming at me right like I couldn't believe it I said Jesus you know yeah it's unfortunate but there's there's always gonna be fucking people that are unhinged oh he's always gonna be people that can't hang but what's really amazing Lenny is the amount of shows that we do how many people keep it together yes live show ladies and gentlemen Lenny Clarke it's all live it's happening you know this is not some program thing I don't know where I'm going frankly all right oh you treat me good I'll treat you better you me I'll follow you home me burn your house tada yeah I just want to make you laugh I'm money if I have no hidden agenda about paying the bills you know I mean yeah yeah because to do stand-up now is is so much different than before because the reward you can't say words you know like you can but know what's not hey not me I can't know you're looking at an old white man couple more years down the road I'll be able to say whatever I want it's just elderly right I started paper the other day some kids beat up this 63 year old guy and it's a big like federal case against him because he's elderly I'm 66 you know and I'm not going down like that guy you know this kid's gonna be surprised now I go look I'm elderly you know yeah Jesus Christ yeah it's I just I I hope Joe I really do that this is all a cycle yes yeah yes either way it's coming around already yeah yeah I do yeah I think people are tired of political correctness and they also realized that it looked there's there's good aspects to political correctness right it's good to be kind to people it's good to be nice it's not good to shit on the down truck Oh knowledge down on people that knows my great eyes I'd rather I'd rather I'd rather have you as a friend than I really would because a lot of times you forget your enemies you you're at a party gonna oh shit I forgot I fucking hate you I'd rather I'd rather you know and people say well you don't worry what people think well people think is usually watch your eyes if you're a dick the people think you're a dick well I gotta be a nice guy I've gotten way way better just lending should go I don't care I mean holding grudges and wanting to get back at someone that's nonsense it's for fools yeah there's people that they fucking that they'll they grind on it all day like they'll hate someone and they just want to talk about that person all fucking day and they're all it's always a waste of time it's a waste of time doesn't do you any good no no let it go let it go as as you get older I've got quite a few years I'm I'm in that thing now because someone told me holding a grudge is like drinking poison and want the other person to die yeah yep I don't have time for that I got I got other problems with that quotas for jealousy but they but it applies with both things yeah it's the bold things it's foolish it's like look I want people to get if you and me have a dispute I'd like you to get over it I'd like to get over it too I'm not into like having enemies for life those people that want enemies for life they don't know what a real enemy is I know you don't know what a real enemy is you just you've your paper tiger you're making you're just talking this is nonsense like real enemies they want to kill you yeah you don't want to kill me I don't want to kill you so let's just stop yeah like it's a push that's a push it's most most disputes look we're all different at different points in the day at different times in our life you know you catch me and I just gotten some sort of a fucking dispute with somebody and then I'm in my car I'm gonna behave very differently then if I just got a hug from my kids and then I get in my car you know I mean yes everybody's different at different points and I like you might have just got fired you might have just come out some yeah someone's having a bad day you met them on a bed yeah yeah and I usually am more than willing to give people have been fed up shy people are often misunderstood yep and and I've learned that I learned that thirty years ago if someone's shy it's not that they're they just they're shy they're afraid they'd be from it yeah and give them the benefit of doubt you know don't hate so much because they're afraid to say ah yeah yeah yeah it's uh you know people deal with all kinds of different social issues you know and a lot of people that hold grudges and they're angry what they're really doing is they're distracting themselves from their own failures you know that's really what they're doing instead of this is I've said that I said this one of the last podcast but I'll repeat it because it's very important the way I look at life is I have bandwidth I have like a hunts say I got a hundred points I don't have any points for anybody I don't care about I don't have any time for that I don't have time for things that I care and the people care about the people that I love that's what I have time for and those other things if I have to deal with them I deal with them and then as soon as I can get them out of my head I'm gone I have a hundred points of bandwidth and that those 100 points I'd like to use 100 of them on things that I love and things that I care about and that's it positive and that's how you get by in life and that's how you become successful because if you spend your time you know thirty percent of your time wondering and pondering shit you don't like that unless you're making comedy out of it that is going to fail you it's going to cost you because you're 70 percent now you only have 70 percent for the good stuff it's not going to be as good as a hundred percent you're not gonna do as good with your comedy you're not gonna do as good as whatever the fuck you do if you're a sculptor or a painter you're making music you know a certain amount art requires a certain amount I think some art requires a certain amount of angst and and an uncomfortable feeling and just something that allows you to dig deep into your emotions and create something and sometimes out of anger and hate you can get some fucking amazing comedy my best FF oh yes but you gotta treat it like that like I don't don't bring it home with you I don't carry it around I mean like a bad show when I first started I upset for a weekend now it's like you know by the time it's acog oh I love this song oh it still bothers me that's my number one problem really if I fuck up on state even if I fuck up one bit and get a standing ovation right that one bit will fucking haunt me I will go home by myself sitting in front of the TV and just go fuck just fucking shit and then I'll just write it out again I'll practice it again oh um you know all of you know long will you stick with a bit that to you is very funny but it's not working for the crowd oh that's a problem that's a problem I had a bit that I was doing for a while about the Second Coming project mm-hmm the Second Coming project was a group of people back in the day when genetics when they first started you know applying genetic research and their what they were gonna do is these people wanted to take samples of tissue from what they the Shroud of Turin they thought it came off the face of Jesus they found out later through carbon testing that it was really only a couple hundred years old but when these people before they lose face come off the demo that's me I'm really proud of Jeff I didn't notice right Jenna was fair yeah Google that Google the Shroud of Turin they did a test on it I think I think it turned out to just only be a few hundred years old anyway what they were gonna try to do is they were gonna try to take DNA from that and then clone Jesus and so the bid I had was that you know with Dolly the sheep right they they tried to clone Dolly the sheep launched at times right like it wasn't like as simple as the first time they did it it worked out I'm like what if they cloned Jesus and he comes back with some birth defects like what do they do they kill him then start from scratch do they do it again like what if Jesus like what if they cloned Jesus neons Down syndrome so I had this whole bit about Jesus with Down syndrome and then instead of a cross he had a hockey helmet and then like like but the power or like he would turn dog shit in the cookies like he had like he instead of turning water into wine right it was a terrible bit but I thought it was so funny for a few months I hope a few months yeah I'm just trying to figure out a way I'm down to like three shots I tried three shots it's not working and yet when you would friends funny friends people you hang out with you'll say oh my god you should use a cousin that doesn't work well sometimes you just gotta let it go and put it aside and then come back to it later and then come back to it fresh eyes yeah sometimes but you know Chris Rock you know that bit that he had for years he had this bit there's black people then there's the n-word right you know that bit he said he bombed with that bit for like a fucking year he couldn't get it to work right people get mad at him he would buy and then it became one of the greatest bits of all time yeah yeah because he stuck with it and he figured it out and he worked at it but you know he's a craftsman yeah yeah he's a guy go over his material and it running it by other comics right and they'll work on it I mean that's one of the greatest bits of all time and it he stuck through it because he just knew there was something there right I mean there's those two it's like it's hard it's hard to I knew that the second coming project was never gonna be one of those though it was just too fucked up but I remember I did a one tight at the Comedy Store and some lady goes next subject oh my god yelled out oh god I hate you she was screaming at me not subject I'll never forget that lady and I started laughing when she said it was which was not and worse I got I got an old lady story but we lived at the barracks there's 14 comedians living in that place in how it's cry don't know if you ever came by because that was pretty nice my barracks the barracks was an apartment that Mike and I had and we always uh God was a tease you know in the beginning you know when one stands a little probably before my day oh yeah eighty-eight dog sorry if I like you saying my Clark yeah yeah yeah right so we had this house and it was like three or four bedrooms and Kenny Rogers his room which was like a closet with his sheet over when you're first it's the sperm room and Kenny look we had the rent was one hundred sixty five dollars a month the man's name was wing-wang and we were working at the dingo for Shirley so 165 bucks between sometimes ten guys we didn't have it blowing it all right so now every comedian who came in from out of town they don't have to get a hotel you just go by the back so it was a key under the mat at the end it was like eleven keys under the mat but there was this old lady next door in the third floor problem we would rage all night I would break windows I just love the sound of breaking glass we have a window guy on call people say it's freezing money I'll call the window guy here I just love the SPRO thing i'm sweeney duck and i put a paw through the window and he's laying in a floor that I go sweet what's wrong with you I'm just having fun II just don't talk down to me I go when you're lying on the floor get up you know this woman she told him she goes I say hey I hate you letting like I ain't I said unless I'm going through the store you want me to get you anything and she'd yell at the top letti o'clock I only live to see you dead Oh Joey it's worse so now you know I said the flowers every now and it and she'd throw them off the balcony I don't want you up like I want you dead so she ends up getting murdered Oh No like cut up and like the capitate oh yeah yeah so so the cops come to the house one day and I'm laying in my bed puking in a bucket and Rogerson comes in anyway said did you murder the lazy and so I sent ago no yes okay you can come in we don't think we're gonna ask you questions but where were you last second ago I don't remember I go but I but I know I got here later they worked out I was at the thing and then when hung out with after hours and I don't know where was but then I get home but you know that woman get yeah I don't think they ever saw the case but it definitely was me because I was too lazy to watch Kings three flights of stairs we stuff we just had police cars parked in her her pockets but she'd have a cop but we'd have the paddy wagon parked down below being always crazy so you have the cops come and party we yeah yeah yeah yeah most of them got let thrown off some forty never solved they never saw that case as far as I know you know there was a guy that I used to train with who got arrested I don't know if you remember this case but they they were they took this guy and they were breaking his bones with a hammer and then injecting with cocaine to keep him awake cuz he was he was blacking out from the pain oh and they cut his hands off they cut his head off they cut everything off and this dude that I knew got arrested for it and when I asked him about it he knew something like it was one of those things where like you know you ask someone like I go they arrested you I go why would they arrest you and it was like this I don't know I don't know nothing I was like oh you know something holy shit I was like oh my god I might know a fucking serious murderer oh yeah yeah he went to jail for something else I forget what he went to jail I knew him when I was 16 and he went to jail and then he came out and when he came out like all his tattoos he had scars all over all of his tattoos like apparently tried to burn it's to add twos off in the joint he was like just a different person like his time in jail I guess he was in jail for like maybe at five years from when I knew him Wow came out five years later and started training again before he got arrested and just super spooky to be around somebody that you think might have done that no I I know of a few murderous that yeah yeah I

my first time here you're full of shit he goes well nice to meet you too walked away and we and I was very jealous that a guy would just step up to say and be that good and then we would hang around together and hope that people would freak out like member Joe Lasky how could he won't he sometimes I can't go on and he leave and me and Gavin were the NHANES if someone panicked they would be at the back so Gavin goes let's get fucked up and see if he cracks under the pressure well he was so smart that's why Gavin was so good it's so many things to talk about and his way of looking at things was so intelligent because any you so so did he just he legitimately didn't give a fuck so everything was casual like all of his best punch lines were casual it's a story that I've never ever told and I try to be heard maybe 20 million people I don't give a shit we we went to a show what one of his buddies was a bartender at the 99 and one of the guys who worked there was sick so they asked us to do a show from a benefit the race of money so we did and he says jeez I wish I had money to pay and gamma goes who that credit card yes well that's someone left in us we'll take that as payment he goes

love elk it's like it's the healthiest food you can eat and I eat it almost every day what's the biggest animal you think you've killed I killed a moose once I'm yeah that was enormous that was a thousand pounds that I saw one up in Maine you they're unbelievable they're so big doesn't even make sense when you see when walk across the road for the first time that first time I saw it was like what the fuck well that first time I ever saw moves in the wild actually it was we pulled over I was hunting with my friend Mike Hawking's in NBC in British Columbia and we pulled over the side of the road and we look out at this field and these it was just cows it wasn't even bulls and they were walking across the field they look it was like Jurassic Park I couldn't believe how big they were I was like look at those fucking yes yeah like Jesus Christ they're so bent when they're angry oh my god very very things well Mike got chased by one he was he was riding on a horse and a fucking cow moose started chasing him and he say barely got away they've died you guys oh my god so fast they're so big yeah they're yours are so long and they look gangly but when I'm in motion well they left gangly so that they can walk through swamps and they spend a lot of time like my buddy John Dudley is actually in British Columbia right now hunting moose he actually shot one yesterday if you go to knock on TV on Instagram he shot a moose yesterday and his buddy shot one a couple of days ago that is one of the biggest moves I've ever seen in my life but it's all swamps yeah so these things are in the swamp so those long legs aid them because they could walk through that swamp water you know I mean they're they're literally like we're their body start it's the bottom of their body starts it might be five and a half feet off the ground wow that's how big the cheese and I mean then the rest of them in the head and the fucking antlers everything is enormous they're huge you mentioned you wish you were shooting pheasant would Bourdain yeah I never met him I always wanted me to I love you yeah now did you you obviously ate the pheasant yeah what you got it I didn't get one but he got one right I

of life yeah but not just one but for many well it's also important to too for a dummy like me to have someone like that explained like I have this guy Sean Carroll was just here a couple days ago and he's trying to explain to me quantum physics and quantum mechanics it's like I've read that book I've listened to that book on tape I listened to him talk and I might've got like 1% of what he was trying to convey because it's really complicated shit no dummy but I I so happy that guys like him around exams try to explain it to people like us well I tell you you know you have all that gym equipment and I thought about this and you could do me a favor I bought a Gravitron you know what that why I didn't buy I was given with the graviton as a height now you have you know I have the the

invented it Lanny Potts is his name and I went on I had little millenials everybody try to find this guy - Trek because I'll pay the guy I think he wants it yeah I think the guy would want me to have it he's the guy who invented the Stairmaster from the Stairmaster the gravit will up a picture that thing bald yeah Gravitron your finals making service the right thing no no easy just make sure the the image he's pulling oh yeah but the Gravitron is a propulsion assist oh yeah this guy could tell us what yeah it's it's just it's gives you a little assist so I'm pulling up 200 pounds you're doing

Pokemon trip I used to run the Riviera yeah oh yeah he scared the fuck out of me a couple of pounds we dealt with hecklers Oh oh yeah saw some guy take a cigarette and throw it on the ground and step on it in the showroom and he fucking screamed at my back got in his face but it was like eh you're gonna die scream you know yeah strippers old school vague oh yeah people don't know oh he's an actor oh no you know he got into acting I think because of Drew Carey I gave him it's one of his first act that's boy on the cut on Sunday comics I was in a electric chair and he was the guy you know and he never forgot that he said mad at you she gave me a break always bring me I fucking love that day I worked for him in like 97 back in 97 that was like the first time I ever worked for him but uh he was then that was when Drew Carey had the Drew Carey Show right and Drew Carey had got him apart on The Drew Carey Show and he was like a god for the fucking for a goof now now the fuckin acting yeah and he wasn't being like a real actor and then all of a sudden I see him on the fucking Sopranos I was like holy shit you're on the greatest show in the history of the universe yeah yeah and he was really good oh yeah but it's substantiate of my feelings about acting but it's just pretending yeah it's not that hard I mean there's acting like did you see the Joker yet no holy shit I saw the other night Jam you were right holy shit Joaquin Phoenix is a fucking master oh yeah it's a masterpiece I love the money Johnny Cash why I'm like you're tough maybe I am I mean it's a fucked up sick movie yeah but it's that's what they were trying to do right it's the greatest fucked up sick movie I think I've ever seen I mean you might not be into it if you're not into the I'm sure yeah listen to me I enjoy anything that's done well yes you know I mean even if it's not my cup of tea yeah you know I mean I'll I'll go and I'll watch it and I'll try to figure out what what the message you were trying to get a point and maybe I can connect with your vision I'll give you that and if it sucks I'll just come yeah it's not for me but some master yeah it's a masterpiece I mean Todd Phillips nailed it and walking free Todd Phillips as a master of comedy does this it's one of the dark movies is not a funny fucking moment in that movie that it's not a happy moment in that movie but it's a masterpiece but the point is like that kind of acting like what Joaquin Phoenix does in that movie what Daniel day-lewis doesn't his movies like that's on another level but like regular acting like look at what Steve did they gave him a fat suit right they put a fat suit on him and he played Bobby on The Sopranos and he fucking nailed it you knocked out of the park you would think that that guy had been acting his whole life right you really would it was when you would do it fear factor you would do a lot of those things that you had the stunts yeah oh no no no they wouldn't let me do any of them oh no because like you wanted to write yeah for sure yes I are one yeah I did a couple of I did a couple of stop when I was doing meet Wallace Boxford Rodney Dangerfield he said to me okay in this scene you're sword-fighting coming down these marble stairs and you're gonna get stabbed you're gonna roll down Oh hold on Kemosabe I said I'm shooting a network TV show during the day I'm here at night for you because I love you I go I can't get hurt right I was really fat at the time like 370 I go I'll get hurt he goes what what do you want me I don't get a stuntman he goes I'll kid you're gonna make

Clark thank you for the job I look at the guy and I go dog this is what I look like you know any look leaves my side so the guy gets up a action and I go I cut and then they put him in my spot and then he gets stabbed but the sword goes tumbling down the mob Wilson pastas am i bleeding from his ear I don't know what do you think I think he could do one better than that it was I would've got screwed and then we do a car scene they said alright missing money you break Rodney out of the house you get in the car and you drive as fast as you can up the road and you see the the lights up there there's a bunch of cameras with sandbags we want you to hit the brakes and slide into the sandbags but don't go any farther in the sandbags okay let's go and I turn around hey Rodney I'm a great driver I said but I don't know if I can I like I like a test run to see where the brakes are gonna watch it come on just don't fucking kill anybody so I try I Drive like a bass right if I could do a better move to later I Drive and I hit the brakes and I saw six inches from the sandbag total luck but I mean it was like I'm thinking and I'm flying it right and it goes we got it and I go yeah hey Ronnie go stab see I told you you would be crazy lucky but the reason I said if I could do if you could change anything in your life would you change anything no of course I knew you'd say that now ask me would you change anything everything well if you change everything you might not be where you are they go yeah I'm I'll roll the dice I could be fucking better off you never know you know I mean well I learned from all my mistakes Oliver I've hated every fucking one of them I felt terrible every fucking mistake I've ever made but it's made me a better person I'm still making mistakes brother mistakes you know it's just part of being a person man I already makes mistakes I try to be a good person I always tried to be a good person and and something I'm so how do you try the more fucking people miss i misunderstand that that's what makes me one of do bad things to people yeah well your neighbor the guy who lost the brain oh yeah or the Gravitron oh I mean I wouldn't encourage you to say his name on the show no I know I know that I know it but you know you did you see how I feel and I and I'm a good I told this guy he could cut down trees to improve his view stuff like that I was nice his parents loved me his parents said oh that lindy's the nicest guy you won't believe it's a little crazy but for I used to learn Krypton eat the food off the trees everything no yeah he's very wealthy and he's very you know it is born wealthy yeah I mean if I had a son I'd fucking kick him out of the house make him fend for himself I really would not maybe if I did that to my kidding and the blowin sale is a flea you mentioned a pepper oh yeah how many how many peppers did you have for you oh my god hundreds yeah yeah on my route I had three routes yeah a couple hundred apiece I had the herald for a while my main staple was the globe right did the herald on I did in New York Times I did the hello globe New York Times in the Cambridge Chronicle no and every now and then my father feel bad for me go ski yeah you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to you you better up more than you can chew get in the car and read be flipping him out the window he showed me because he worked for the Herald as a loner type operator and he was proud of me for working with us for bit 3/4 but what are you nuts - one paper like know something I can make real money if you did that like I did that state that saved me while I was doing stand-up mmm because it gave me money like I didn't have to have a regular job like I could get up in the morning and I could deliver newspapers from you know 5:00 a.m. to like 7:30 a.m. worst job you ever had worst job you ever had construction for sure some of those construction gigs were rug really rough yes and it depends on the company he worked for I work with my buddy Jimmy lawless and we we built a wheelchair ramp for a Knights of Columbus Hall right and a tall fucking something I mean wasn't even all summer I mean I think I quit after like three weeks but all that's about some weary yeah carry cement and pressure-treated lumber all I did every day cement and pressure-treated lumber out in the Sun and by the time five o'clock would roll around or whatever wasn't we quit I I didn't have anything left I'll just eat and fall asleep and then I get up in the morning and do it again in it but it taught me something like if you if you want to be a labourer yeah for life this is what life is and this is this a fucking tire you're gonna be you better figure out what you want to do with your life and get after it you know because this is at the time I was probably like 18 or 19 and I'll never forget how hard it was at 21 I went to the National Labor's training center in Hopkinton mash but when they teach you how to belay teach you teach you how to be a laborer and the same thing we're just met in the pressure-treated lumber that if you got on your skin it made you always yes and from there I'd leave and I go to be a lifeguard and then after life got it was Jannah in a couple bones there's all at one at one time when my dad gets second I was dead carefully but then that I was a sewer truck operator which was a great job you know they used to have a claw on the back of a big big giant pickup truck you know I mean bullet stuck and you'd swing it out and you'd pick up the the top of the the sewer and then you put the clam in and you open it up and you pick up and I went to every bottom in Cambridge said got a lot of complaints about this thing comin at you saw out there really yeah I can take it really why don't you have a beer close the clinic Eddie sickness I walk people down again okay got a cover for me they need a drink to would be shit-faced the porter up what I was conveying a massive oh my god the shine people did you do the shy Jones like we just do with the whole but until you fixed it we put well we get it we'd get one of those removable shitters and we put that on one side but yeah right and then

good sex know what happens they they had eight people from Cambridge who were against the let me second bridge being because it cast a shadow on the Chou's River preventing the fish from being in the river to go out to the ocean and spawn really yeah first of all anything in that River should not be allowed to recreate but secondly all a shadow is stopping a fish what the fuck do you think fish do at night oh come on who said that it was doing that the was there a real-life biologist for saying no some big ugly woman you can walk across it really has it has gotten better but you can still you can still see so when people are rowing Monello that's bad you know they've well I used to live in Newton I used to live in Newton upper falls across the street from like a section of the river and we see carp in it yeah yeah yeah and then one day I was out there walking around and I saw some bubbling in the water and I watched a condom bubble up to the surface and I realized it was a sewer pipe that was broken yeah it was leaking raw sewage right into the fucking River that's where it goes yeah do you know in family-pack when you were a kid the groundskeeper was Joe Mooney and Joe Mooney was famous because nobody but nobody stepped on that grass no one even yaki get up Mike it was like a crazed man and since then my friend David Mel he's one of my dearest friends because I I wanted to learn all about grass cuz I smoked it and smoking is easier than growing and growing it Sisera but he when he took over when the sewers were back up in Boston they would flood Fenway Park and when the water receded he'd be actually fish flappin in the infield and we have pictures of it that's what you can Blatch it up and how did they come from from from the river from the Charles River and then back up and whatever's in those shores would come out but through what port how did it get into the grass area oh the water would rise from where the water would drain out of the ballpark it would come back in and fish would and fish there's pictures of fish flapping under failed if my pocket and I yes yeah you can google google at the final time sharika well david everything david miller has written like eight books on lon and what i went to him John Henry invited me to come up and sit with him on my birthday one night at Fenway Park this is years ago about 10-12 years ago and he said to me says uh Lenny oh you want to go sit in my seats I said yeah so when he bought Fenway he extended the infant seats out to more rows so it's TV summary it's right next to him so I'm sitting there with my guys if you could meet anybody in the ball park in the organization who would you like to meet the groundskeeper he was what you want to meet Manny or Big Poppa yeah no I want to meet the groundskeeper why I said you just had Jimmy Buffett out here two nights in a row there's not a blade out of grass look at that good suppose beautiful glass beautiful island or he gets on the phone Dave would you come down it's a guy mister clocking oh you know me man I've been dying to meet you so we got was off the shy leave should be right right so then I invited him and his wife and kids

paper you know cuz I'm a land baron yeah and I go holy shit mo what's wrong there's a stone wall back in my house is surrounded by stone walls that you couldn't even see because the tickets and the

election specific yeah dad daddy's not good with a lot more I'm not gonna let me use power tools even Oh absorber no father to us for lightening fish make good fertilizer so if they did die you guys that's not a good reference photo but this is a photo of it on Fenway you work the Red Sox January 2001 at Fenway Park I set down with previous thirty-year heads ground keeper mr. Joe Mooney to discuss the nuances of Fenway Joe said David if it rained it really rains hard the dugouts flood because the crown in the old field I wasn't surprised because I had seen that before Milwaukee County Stadium he then say if it really really rains hard the antiquated City storm drains will back up and water will come out of the Marine manhole covers and Fenway's concourse and then flood the concourse if it really really really rains hard the first base camera pit will fill up with water and the fish from the Charles River a mile away will swim through the city drain pipes and swim into the camera pit and then swim out onto the field I said wow mr. Mooney that's wild thinking he was pulling my leg I went home and told my wife you won't believe the stories that mr. Mooney tells fast-forward to April Friday night before the Red Sox home opener on Monday the overnight forecast was for two to three inches of rain so we put the tarp on the infield when the rain stopped early Saturday morning we would receive almost three inches of rain I walked behind the home plate towards a Red Sox dugout to check the conditions of the warning warning track and I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked I saw a fish laying on the grass I looked around for Joe thinking it put a great prank on me pulled a great prank on me but I didn't see him anywhere I walked over to the camera pit and sure enough it was full of water I turned around to look towards the infield I saw seven more fish between the camera pit and second base in my rush to get the tarp off now sunny skies and get ready for my first Red Sox opener I unfortunately threw all the fish away I have wished since then I could have saved the fish and had them display for my office my home and for Joe but at least I made time to take this photo and since then I've had it hanging on my office wall Joe one of my favorite words is vindication that's meditation that answered every question that you asked me which I couldn't you know Alice put my foot it's not Joe you know that's why you laugh when people say oh that's it makes the shit how could I make this shit up if that makes sense it makes sense so it's so close to the Charles River make sense yeah like a mile away right Oh unbelievable Fenway Park is about a mile away from the river yeah I'd say you're absolutely right yeah cuz there's because it comes around down by the old Sears Roebuck stood is a part of it that goes through there too amazing right that's crazy that is crazy Wow covered a lot of shit so we end there yeah might as well vindications all the best I love you brother thank you so much always a pleasure oh it's bicep laughs my pleasure again die time you're an Aries maybe we'll get my machine please Jillian maybe I'll look as good a show guitar that fucking Gravitron dad everybody mind me asking about that [Music]
