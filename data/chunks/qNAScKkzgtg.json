before we even start the podcast rest in peace John Anthony West he died yesterday one of the coolest guys ever one of my favorite people that ever got on the podcast the first and only full guest that I've ever done Skype the only reason why I did it on skype is because he wasn't feeling well and he couldn't fly to California so I said this guy's so important I generally like to have conversations with people when they're in the room I think they go more friendly and they're smoother that way you can work through any bumps easier that way you feel better it feels like it's real I mean but he was so important to me I would have fucking taken a raven note you know I mean he's just if you've never seen the DVD series magical Egypt it's truly an amazing piece of work it's I think six DVDs all about the history of Egypt and the immense complexity of the structures that are built there the appreciation this guy had for what the Egyptians did was just off the charts he was just so deeply engaged with it it was such a giant part of his life and the passion and the curiosity that he had and the knowledge that he had and these DVDs would come through and you would just be like holding your face watched him going oh my god these are amazing just uh what a crazy time in human history this weird blip in the middle of North Africa yeah where these people just went way past everybody else just way past and they did it for a long time man they did in this one spot for who knows how long that's been was thousands and thousands of years and graham hancock and john anthony west are the the people that are really at the front of the line in terms of the public eye of pushing the timeline and there's real evidence for it yeah sure I mean Hancock is getting super vindicated yes he is and you know John Anthony Wescott vindicated as well by a Robert Schoch who's a geologist from Boston University he went to Egypt and he studied the enclosure that the Sphinx was in and he's the guy that determined that you were looking at fissures that were created by thousands of years of rainfall right which would push back because what we know about the the what the climate was like in that area apparently it pushes it back to somewhere around 9,000 years ago which is crazy yeah because look however old it was it's real the pyramids are a real thing sure I mean everybody gets real weird about pushing the date back like when it happened there's no way it happened 30,000 years ago it definitely happened 2500 BC but maybe maybe but even if it did let's just say it all was it just came out of nowhere somewhere around that aro what a crazy spot man me forget about the confusion and the conflict around the time line just what it is those people were on another level but what is the main reason people get so pissed off in Hancock and West for trying to push the timeline back because they've been teaching one timeline for a long time they don't want to admit that they were wrong if somebody publishes a book about the timeline and it just definitively says we know now that Egypt was a you know hunter-gatherer culture that somewhere around 3000 BC erupted into this incredible civilization they just been teaching that for so long I mean they've been teaching it not that version of it but there was their version is more accurate than what I just saw just making up numbers but I'm the point is what they've been teaching is probably not right and if they wrote books about it they've taught classes about it all these people it's ego it's just the ego of scientists there is 100% some ego involved because there was a conversation that John Anthony West and dr. Robert Schoch had with an Egyptologist in the Egyptologist this was on a television show that was actually on TV was on like NBC was called the mystery of the Sphinx actually narrated by Charlton Heston and it was all about John Anthony West work and about Graham Hancock's work and Robert shocks work and when they brought this geological evidence to these Egyptologists they were openly mocking it like laughing right in this weird way what what evidence is there for this civilization back then like how much evidence do you think would be there you have to realize how long ago he's talking about he's talking about maybe 10,500 BC right maybe earlier they think it might have all started somewhere around 30,000 years ago which is just fucking bananas oh there it is mystery the sphinx powerful Jamie finds it online there they are John Anthony West that he literally dedicated his life to absorbing as much information as possible about the nature of the construction the time periods the hieroglyphs I mean it's just an amazing amazing body of work that that guy put together powerful Charlton Heston look at that I can handsome I would hang out with him I don't care even if you lose wacky we wanted to talk about guns all day Billy come on Charlie oh yeah you'd hang out with Charlie never win Charlton has another gun on TV news like they'll take my rifle away when they pry my cold dead did he hold up a rifle what he said that or am i imagining I I don't know man I think he probably did so why not symbol for your cock you're Harry Potter you will never take my cock from me it's even better because it's a musket why not just hold up a rock just like a rock thank you any grunt kills with rock huh yeah people get fucking really passionate about that that guns circumcision I am I am all for responsible people being able to own guns but I'm also completely in agreement with people who say that there's too many people out there committing crimes with guns so how do you how do you how do you clean all that up I do not know well it's worth thinking about it is worth thinking about it's worth talking about and people get upset when you start talking about it because they want it to be just no we have a right to have any kind of gun that we want but there I think they're missing one of the real big problems when you were just weirdly seeing the very beginning of it dude and this ties in you know like Elon Musk just blasted a fucking car in his face he bless the Tesla this way there's a Tesla floating around the planet now and like the way that connects with guns is this is an example of technology falling into the hands of like a private company this isn't the government this is like Elon fucking bad-ass I go to Burning Man musk a do to goes to Burning Man yeah shot a fucking Tesla into space which is now I guess gonna rotate around the planet for some certain I don't know how long it's gonna be up there well I think it's going to Mars oh that fucking thing's going to be put in an orbit around Mars it missed it's going past Mars oh you fucked up you on well guess what man that a bit my mom my mom can feel on that plane fucking asshole you fucked up Elon you could have done better dum-dum with your Rockets they can land and shooting a car into space okay what that is what happens when you take it out of the government's hands and put it in a geniuses hands but he's got a very unique ability to get things done sure I mean that boring project that he's doing under la flamethrowers there's certain guys that are so smart that everybody goes cuz okay sure everybody steps back you wanna dig holes through the bottom meth when you went to the LA City Council meeting it's like look guys I can fix this traffic thing what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drill holes underneath the ground I'm gonna put your car on a high-speed sled right startup like this it's like okay guys so you've been remember the old like the how it used to be at the banks with the suction tubes well you take the tube and your mom puts the check in and it gets sucked in I'm gonna do that with fucking buses under the city what do you think right the jack they're not gonna let you do it but the thing where it connects to guns is it's like we're looking at the very very very beginning of private individuals having access to technology that normally was in the hands of the state or governments and this is the very crazy beginning of it I didn't know he was shooting it at Mars for some reason I thought that fucking thing was gonna like rotate around the earth which made me worried that like we're gonna end up with like a ring billionaire cars great way to dispose of bodies because like there's that astronaut in there and I keep thinking like I bet that's one of a LAN Musk's enemies I bet he that could be a body in there no one would ever fuck you imagine if it is magic some asshole who robbed Elon Musk in a business deal yeah just shot the guy and have one of his flunkies stuff him into a car just disappeared could be fucking anybody man control to Major Tom and then also what's really badass about this is the flat earthers are now like really having problems because of the somebody sent me a video today showing me that it's fake them on Twitter so me that this is fake its fake breath its fake what is that what's fake up like what everything the moon the sky the guy the car your mom your mom's flat is fuck man your mom's flatter than the planet Earth bro and the Earth's flat but is it this like what's crazy about the John Anthony West stuff and the Graham Hancock stuff is like in the way that Flat Earth and delusional insane way sort of forces you to imagine yourself existing in a universe that's completely different than what you thought and I think that's why it's really appealing like it's an appealing cool beautiful hilarious mythology she's like whoa how cool would that be if we really were on a flat earth and like if I just keep going in one direction hit the ice wall hit the ice wall but over the fucking ice wall now we're in the land of the greys you know I'm no longer tram there I'm not it's like it's a freeing feeling because like even though it's not like I trap enough to feel stuck in fucking California which is an insane thing there's a little piece of us that knows we're never gonna go into space we're never gonna get past we're never gonna how do you get off the map you know what I mean like there's something in a human that wants to get off the fucking map where you end up in a place that hasn't been charted yet and that's an experience that's gone basically like that I mean I imagine swaths of the Amazon perhaps or like someplace deep deep in the Arctic maybe in a cave or something but it used to be people just didn't fucking know you could go off the map and you had no idea I think that must have been the biggest rush to be on a ship and looking at the maps that you guys have and you're like fuck dude this is we don't know where we're at here man like this is unknown uncharted terrain so Flat Earth is a really I'm not I don't believe the earth is flat I think it's more like a triangle shape but it's a big dick it's a giant cosmic dick that would be looking at the head of the dick and they just don't want us to know that because it's kind of embarrassing spinning dick it's all CGI bro shaped like a dick it's just a big blue and white fucking dick green yeah why do people want that we want we always want things to be weird right we want like the flat earth one is my favorite one because it's just what could you imagine if they're right you imagine if they were right imagine if the whole planet thought the world was round and there's yeah all this information that shows the world is round four thousands years ago people were doing calculations or sticking sticks into the ground an equal distance and measuring them and trying to see if this curvature and there's always been people that suspected the earth was round way before they could ever figure it out they were trying to look cool the moon is round the Sun is right yeah this is wrong huh yeah probably this is round yeah you know but she would kind of think well how big is this fucking thing and then if you get up high enough you can kind of see like well if it says really big I see a very slight curvature like maybe I do my my mind fucking myself right and you just sat around and mine fucked yourself into thinking that it was all a scam yeah and that the world is actually flat and then gravity isn't real either everybody's wrong yeah except a guy on YouTube it's exciting it's magnets that pull people into the your life gets so exciting at that point oh yes now you're you're you feel danger yes you're risking your fucking ass by getting out there cuz the NASS holes are gonna take you out dude the clinton find out and clinton foundation finds out about your your theories yeah earth being flat your fuck come get you they're gonna get you so now you live now you get to live in maybe a not very happy world but an exciting world because you're seeing vans you're seeing fucking like create now this is by the way this is not say that there isn't some massive huge unknown swath of reality that's sitting right in front of us at all times that's actively being hidden by the united states government the military who has the technology that they've finally detected the thing and they don't want us to know because they know if we know who the fuck knows what the reason is but they don't want us to know just yet i'm not saying that's not the case I'm just saying with Flat Earth in particular and freaking me the fuck out man what do you know what do I know what do you know man the fucking problem is I can't talk about it yet oh my I stopped getting the check they're like you can't like we will tell you but you can't you can't completely reveal it seems like one of the videos that would play before you like first loading up half-life 10 is the new new half-life the government's hiding a dimension what you have access did just come out what that they picked up some kind of UFO like the government did release UFO video I always assume this is Captain skeptical over here I always assume if the government is ever saying that there's UFOs or something really crazy like that it's to hide some shit they're doing in like Guatemala it's like they don't want anybody to be paying attention to something weird they're doing well just oh they'll just start talking about UFOs everybody's like for real like a real spaceship you got a video man I mean it's a really huge question mark which is and there are people out there who like think who is it answers to why there to say this idea is there's a gradual dissemination of information that's happening because they're they're priming the pump and then it splits into two versions one of the versions of the stories is fuck if you want to dominate a planet get them kind of like subconsciously subliminally primed for the idea that you know I think there's some really advanced technology out there and there's there's aliens riding around in it and we've and we make contact we've made contact with the they call themselves the Galactic Council of celestial elders and they've been making contact with us for the last 50 years and they've been instructing us and how to not only reveal themselves to you but to to let the technology come out in a way that it's not going to be completely catastrophic for our society they're peace-loving wonderful beings but we've decided to follow their instructions to the T and so now they're ready to introduce themselves and then suddenly an alien is on TV and suddenly the government is using a completely made-up thing to try to dominate the planet by saying no it's aliens we found them when in fact it's Project Blue Beam right that's that's one of the ideas the other idea is all that shit's true they there's a thing that happens when a planet reaches a certain level of technological sophistication that it gets contacted by some kind of order council federation of sentient technological civilizations and they sort of begin to like walk the planet through phases of getting that shit out into the world in a way that isn't going to fuck up their planet and they know how to do it they have a system in place they don't come from the stars they're not something detectable by telescopes they're like in the DMT realm or they're like existing in some alternate dimension and technology is just one of the things that they use to communicate with us I've been toying around with this idea for a long time most of the time when I'm really high that ideas are a life form that they're not it's not as simple as your creativity putting together some pieces that weren't there before I I think it's that but I think it's also you're tuning into something you're tuning into some weird like some of the ideas almost seem to write themselves and it could be because the subconscious process of your mind but it also could because the because that these what what ideas are and what just a concept of thinking is it's it's essentially the seeds of creation right everything that's ever existed on earth that humans have invented and built came from a mind it came from thinking how do I put together this house how do I put together this skyscraper how do I make a plane how do I make a TV how do I make of this how to make of that like we're vessels for ideas we're like sitting there with all these neurons firing electricity going left and right and all these areas of our brains lighting up it's catching ideas yeah and when I'm super gone especially on edibles sometimes I feel like I'm in a river of ideas and I'm naked and I can't hold the fish they're just flying by me I'm like Jesus just trying to get these ideas that's right it almost feels like these are not my ideas these are ideas that I'm working on I've put in the effort to go out and fish for these ideas well it's kind of like imagine if there was a technology they could like we send out these signals into space satellites with or with with fucking records in them but perhaps other civilizations are blasting the planet with ideas that are designed to be picked up by the scope of the human mind yeah and so what you're doing is you're actually like popping into an alien frequency which is filled with all these various ideas that are part of the cultivation of a planet to like try to get it to the point of like being able to make contact and they're just seeding seeding us with with I don't fuck when you read like John Lilly and read about Tesla and read about a lot of the great inventions that have happened the people who had epiphanies moment it wasn't like they were scrunching their fucking forehead it was like the idea came to them in a vision how many times do you hear over and over again it came to me in a vision a dream do you know that the very notion of science itself came to supposedly like the birth of science came from a dream that day cards had really yeah he had a dream that I forget exactly the term that he'd the way they used that I'm sure it was deciphered too right like what did he originally speak what language the card a card speak fuck I don't know man like I think it was like classic nerd he was he was out like at war who's like campaigning is French he's friendship he was uh I believe it was like he was on a military campaign in the army or something along those lines and he signed up for adventure to go off into the military and during that time period he had a dream that something about to be able to harness nature it would be done in weights and measurements hmm I forget exactly the term see if you could find the term the that was essentially what people say this is really when you when you talk about the very birth of like the earliest you could trace back the idea of modern science like the ethics and the idea is the concepts of modern science well don't you from a dream it goes I mean before decart we're dealing with like it gets really interesting because you're dealing with the alchemists like John Dee who were who were I mean John Dee was someone who is who's John Dee John Dee is this it like you know Jason Louvre you know that is no he's an author he just wrote this fuckin badass book on John to use this one of those people kind of like Crowley who had this huge impact on society but we don't really know a lot we most people don't know the fuck he was right but you've heard of like the Enochian tablets or like the Enochian angels basically John Dee was like an alchemist who was working with Queen Elizabeth to try to turn lead into gold which was a you know a big fuckin pursuit back then like shit if we could turn if we can transmute metals into gold it's like I mean yeah they all tried to do that right was that when they first started recognizing elements like when do they first start recognizing elements I don't I don't know probably that it's must be through alchemy because they were like trying to break things down to their fundamental they're trying to break the it sounded like their fundamental components any movies are about that someone trying to make gold well I mean it's the it's one of the great pursuits yeah and it's actually that's that there's a it's what we're still doing only we're not trying to turn wet into gold we're trying to turn lead into a thinking machine that's what we're doing that because better than turning matter into gold if you can turn matter into a fucking thing that is thinking and sentient then it can figure out how to turn lead into gold by its advanced ability to process data and if you were an alien race you would be concerned about nuclear weapons for sure but you would really be concerned about artificial life sure what do you what do you assholes about just hit the switch on yeah have you thought this this through we're like those minions in Despicable Me we're just wreck and shit and eating nails yeah we just trying things stick in electrical sockets in our heads fuck yeah dude can you imagine if beings in the DMT realm decided to start setting off nuclear explosions I mean maybe that's what an earthquake is maybe when we have an earthquake it's like a nuclear test and another dimension shaking our planet yeah I said it no I don't fucking believe it I can already hear the like people being like what the fuck are you talking about man June 8th 16:37 Descartes codifies scientific method Wow interesting he outlines his rules for understanding the natural world through reason his skepticism forming the foundation of the scientific method still in use today there's a term that he had that he came up with like in a dream see if you could find that because there was like a phrase that he said obviously translated from French III there's the reason I it's the decart fucking bugs me on that one no it's not I think therefore I am but that was obviously an inch one he liked to do shit like and I could be wrong about this but I clearly remember reading about this he was like what do you call it a mechanist or like he believed that animals were just machines basically and so so like he would like and I if you could look this up so I don't get a swage with people being like that's a different person but apparently he would do shit like hold a dog's beating heart and it's his hand while it died and he said things like people who are afraid to kick dogs aren't really my students because they look that up Jimmy you sure that's not like propaganda if there was like an info wars.com back then what's going on here this is why I'm covering it with like I'm not saying he's out there chicken dogs I think he was kicking dogs I think the car like I just found this pretty rough maybe they all kicked dogs back then in a nutshell Frank philosopher rené de cartes didn't believe animals had souls to test his theory he nailed his wives dog to a board and chopped it open while the poor thing was still alive guy come on guy creator of science was nailing dogs the monkey board where'd you read this how do we know this is right son fuck dick are calm knowledge nuts knowledge nuts I hope that you really are knowledge nuts know that guy definitely looks like he fucking nailed dogs to boards look at that fucking face hmm look at it look at it squirm the greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues that's what he said after cut open a cat dude he died so that that's like it's the father of science is also like that's Jeffrey Dahmer level shit too like he was nothing I think people did a lot of that back then Nayland dogs divorce I just think the I think the value of life was severely diminished I think back then the 1600s people were dying left and right of everything yeah you got a cold dead break your leg dead get gored by a bull dead everything dead says oh you got an infection dead well you get the flu probably dead but that's definitely in Europe like in India I'm not saying in India it was like utopian everyone's sweet to animals but in Buddhism it was still it was like there was it was a lot more compassionate like that that's true why do you that happened why does like like Thailand and places that are Buddhist places generally I mean obviously there's violence everywhere but generally more of a peaceful vibe right like Buddhist nations and food is kind of a little bit more obviously flaws with everything yes anything involving people you're gonna have outliers but over at all like one of the things that my friend was telling me about Thailand he was like dude there's no crime over there he's like you just go over there he's like everybody it's like real easy real easy to get along with everybody it's like it's super safe nobody gets robbed yeah it's really rare yeah I don't mean I don't know it's I don't understand why that way of thinking emerged in the East and that connection with the self emerged in the East first what happened in the West which was basically a decimation of a previous religion broom paganism whatever you want to call it earth based religion connection with life in nature what's really interesting to me about that is that the DNA of paganism is still in the system it's almost like we absorbed it yeah like or I say we I mean Christians you know Christian nation well look at your Christian nation this is I'm so I'm sure we've talked about this in the podcast but it's something I marvel over all the time I think about it a lot which is the Catholic Mass it's when you look at the Catholic Mass and you look at the New Testament the Last Supper and you look at you realize like in the fucking synoptic Gospels and then any of the Gospels there is nowhere that Jesus is saying what you do is take a piece of bread and utter these prayers over it to create to create my flesh that then you eat it's not there the ritual isn't there and but but the interpretation of that has turned into what is called high magic it's called like it's a ceremonial magic where you are transforming bread into the flesh of a sacrificed God and people do that every fucking Sunday and are like this totally normal magic what are you talking about I'm not in the fucking magic what I do as I eat the flesh of a god that was sacrificed by a father God so that my sins could be purified that's not magic when did that originate the sacrament well I've read that it has something to do with it goes back to Egypt that it's some kind of high magic Egyptian ritual or is a mushroom they probably had a big bag of mushrooms and everybody came up and they put it on your tongue and they said good luck yeah I know on the other side well I mean they said yeah they said you know this is the flesh of God eat this too and you'll remember who you truly are and they gave you this the psychedelic and you took it and you merged back into the divine and realized your true identity so that for the rest of the week you were able to hang out with people and not be a complete asshole because you know you share the same soul and that you're basically made of love as opposed to thinking that you and I are separate and that were mostly sinful evil things whose flesh is impure I mean that's another fucking sweet gift that came from fundamentalist Christianity is the concept that our bodies are evil we can't be naked around each other even now like you can't take your clothes off around people without seeming completely insane you will get a rat if you go outside in your fundamental body that you were born into the universe with you will get arrested like you can't walk around as you are you have to cover it in clothes or if you're considered to be a fucking pervert pervert nudist you're psycho so yeah the the fundamental vehicle that we are soul rides around in is considered profane to it to dude and like you see a fucking dick when you're like walking down the street some dudes you're like well you can see a dick accidentally at the bathroom doesn't bother you doesn't bother you cuz in the bathroom it's okay for a moment to profane the world with your fucking dick so it's like that's the when you start really looking at all the the the traces of not just pagan culture but just insanity from a fundamentalist perspective of the universe that has its roots and what appears to be a misunderstanding of a really beautiful story then it's like mind-boggling you're not just a misunderstanding but probably a conscious misrepresentation of the original story that's molded the suit whoever's needs is in charge at the moment that's right you know and people do I'll tell you man Catholics they feel guilty like they shoot I'm Catholic you're Phil you still probably feel a little bit of probably a little bit dude I was I mean I'm not Catholic really but I was when when I was in first grade I have this Aleister Crowley poster I was gonna bring to uterus 7 oh wow 1079 yeah yeah that was the year the year 1000 a m-- a year rather 1079 it feels like I'm saying something wrong yeah yeah wow that's amazing man yeah 1079 so this is way after Jesus yeah almost a thousand years yeah they started doing the magical ritual and and so it's like to say that this is connected to Christianity is really it's like actually no it's Christianity is a song and this is a dance people decided to do to it but to say you know what I mean to say that it's like that it has anything to do with Jesus is is not true unless you're going to say that Jesus transmitted the data after his death into some kind of mystic or seer who had the vision of this now I'm not knocking the fucking Catholic Mass I think it's beautiful but let's just admit what it is magic its ritual magic you're doing ritual magic and you're doing something that's been going on for a very long time probably before 1079 that dude wasn't just like sitting around like hey I got an idea let's start saying prayer for the bread and the bread is gonna turn into flesh it was more like hey you know we've been meeting doing these rituals secretly why don't we just incorporate the story of Christianity into this ritual that we've been doing for a very long time to sort of pure purify ourselves by connecting to the universe and knowledge in the fact that existence itself is predicated on devouring the flesh of some other being not you know like we're always in the process of inhaling the universe exhaling the universe eating each other the universe is eating itself and so the mass is this ritualized version of like behold we're eating the flesh of God and everything we do and there's something really beautiful about that I mean there's no getting around life eats life even the various factions of people on the left and the right and people that are animal rights activists versus people that are butchers you you're all eating something that's live I mean you can make the distinction that the plants aren't suffering like the animals do and that's why it's okay I agree with you too for the most part it's probably a less extreme form of suffering but it also might just be a completely misunderstood life-form yeah like they're well they're finding out so much about plant communication and I've read so many things about that I hesitate to talk about it because I really want to have all my teas sliced and you know eyes dotted because it's such a complex issue but it appears that they communicating it appears that there's almost like that they're using the soil and the fungus and the soil and the mycelium they all have this weird ecosystem it's not just like one plant by itself in the dirt you know there's a network that they're connected to Jamie there's this thing I've just this guy gave me this thing called a MIDI sprout which is it picks up I guess the bioelectricity of plants or anything for that matter but plants I've got it you stick it on your plant and it goes into like your whatever your music system is and it translates it into MIDI so you can Tranter n-- turn the electricity of your plant into music what yeah it's fucking cool yeah what yeah that sound is the sound that's coming from a tree well it's the electricity of the tree being translated into MIDI which is then being translated into sound so it's it's a way to convert the data into music it's like you're converting the bioelectricity into it's not like that's the sound of a plant it's not making celestial noises that's just sending energy and creating MIDI which is then being translated into the sound so it's a way to observe the data instead of looking at it I guess on an oscilloscope or whatever you would look at that with it's turning it into audio so you can hear the pulsating kind of like rhythmic flow so that that's measuring electrical current yeah that's it so there's that much of a variation that it's like going up and down all the time like that yeah yeah idiot I mean I don't know that the total math behind it but I've got one on my on a plan in my studio here's my take on it the most potent psychedelic experience is DMT DMT exists in so many different plants it's in thousands of plants they they have no idea why yeah but it's in them and if it wasn't for mono a me some ah no Ami's oxidase yeah right mono a mean oxidase Mao which is what mao inhibitors were are if it wasn't for that that we have this in our body we would be tripping on salad you'd be tripping on grass you need certain grasses you'd be blasted off to the center of the universe you know for some sheep DMT is poison like they get ahold of plants that of DMT even they fall over stairs and legs and the legs start bucking up in the air that's like a canary in the coal mine you take sheep out in the nature and when they start dying that's what you eat I think it's phalaris grass in particular I think there's a type of grass jamee see if you could find that grass that kills sheep but it's a grass a particularly rich yeah phalaris damn how goes the memory of the kid it was high phalaris yeah that flare induced phalaris daggers in chief portions of the lower brain as seen to be damaged and oddly enough tinted blue they're responsible agents are the alkaloids contained in the various failing species they're whispered rumors can you there are whispered fucking nose that's a DMT website to that whispered rumors he's looking for wispier whispers whispered rumors fucking hippies the divine moment of truth is that the one that I'm in there's one of those Shpongle made one where they used a rant of me with Jim Breuer that's cool I was barbecued I barely remember what I said but as me and Breuer were high on pot lollipops Jesus and they took that and took part of it and made it this really dope music end with a video to it I don't know if that's their video if they made that video that's great does it looks oddly similar like I'll tone down like a pencil drawing of what you see when you do DMT yeah man yeah it's a sound that's beautiful yeah I the good old days honcho weren't those the good old days now we don't do it anymore though cuz it's a leak yeah why would we well it's illegal there's no need well and also once you've been there it's not like you have to keep going back these fucking what I need to do right now get a better accountant fucking great accountants in the DMT realm that's when I'll start doing it again their accountants of your consciousness they look at you going it's the best yeah did you get a finger waggle it yeah yeah yeah I don't know and it was like when I had a wacky thought look I had a bad thought I thought when a rag that was on the wrong page yeah I love that I love the in different psychedelic states I love how you witness how your consciousness is forming your reality in the most extreme way yeah not as though like you're producing matter with your thoughts or anything like that but you can watch this undulation or this flow going from when you're getting negative and dark and it's interesting how different psychedelics portray this phenomena but so like on acid you I might see depending if I'm taking our enough dose you start seeing like the faces and this in the stucco of your ceiling you know and it's like when you start getting really depressive or scared then the phases start doing like Oh like hissing at you and they seek in and they or even when you're looking at yourself in the mirror you the similar things happens is you're just watching the way that your projection that's coming from the incessant flow of thoughts in your mind is reflecting onto reality itself and it's a constant like shifting of light that sometimes is like looking into the deepest layers of hell but then sometimes you see the most beautiful sweet incredible things because you're not being freaked out by the flow of thoughts in your mind that's the number one trick you know this is why now in my old age I really do understand why I'm a good practice meditation chanting whatever it may be pairs so nicely with psychedelics because if you have one without the other well you're missing out but also you're you can really like go into some pretty terrifying places that you don't resolve in the way that they could potentially if you are doing the work putting in the time before you take the psychedelic you know not to sound like an old fucking guy like guy you gotta you do you know meditating in time but it does help a lot well it's there's a weird way that we want to dismiss it because it seems almost like a pompous thing to ever say you meditate or you encourage people to manage yeah it's the same as I always have a cringy thing when I tell people to do yoga I can say this again but I really mean it like I feel like Yoga is one of the very best things that will pair with cannabis use and with psychedelic because I think it it alleviates a lot you know another things really good is running and I think both those things they alleviate a certain amount of anxiety and they create there's a blood flow through that when you're like pumping hard up a hill yeah and you're running huffing and puffing and you make it and you check your pulse and you recover quick and you go and do another hill run there's a there's a stimulation of your body because it's being forced to work hard that's euphoric and after it's over your brain's flooded with all these wonderful chemicals you feel good you feel friendly and like I think that paired with psychedelic experiences I think exercise is one of the most overlooked it's so important and it doesn't matter what style like what you enjoy doing but just got to get that blood going you got to do something let's take a spin class or a yoga class or go for a good hike do something where you're fucking huffing and puffing and you're really getting in some work you're really sweating and your body will just feel better well this is what you just said exactly applies to meditation and also you're fucking right the problem we've been talking about it is you sound virtue signally and pompous and but but it's true and when you hear Ramdas talk about meditation he will say I don't meditate when you want to meditate like don't don't even like if it seems like something that appeals to you give it a shot but the the the the definition of it it's at what's funny is when you think about meditation your mind will summon up something that you think meditation looks like so you think means like sitting down on a cushion with some fucking candles or it means like whatever it is that your mind summons up and usually it's pretty austere and usually it's pretty it requires like a temple or a space in your house or it's in snout enough you need a robe exactly you need some kind of like shit that you're wearing so there's right because your mind is trying to push it off it's trying to like your mind it was is one of its functions it seems to like not want you to sit still for a moment and watch but what you just said about exercising is true for meditation it's like there's so many different versions of it and I would argue running is a meditation working out is a meditation and that to think that it's there's a separation there there really isn't no I don't think there is either I always just said that about martial arts so that I believe that martial arts were a moving form of meditation but that doesn't mean like stationary meditation isn't different and give you another very valuable thing and a different valuable that's right yeah well it gives you the ability to I was just reading there's a great book I'm reading by Pema Chodron called the wisdom of no escape and she talks about how when people start meditating they think I'm I'm doing this because I want to be a better person and she said that's actually an aggression against the self that you are right now to be like yeah yeah yeah that you're actually being like aggressive to your own self she said meditation is not so that we become a better person it's so that we're able to be who we are in the moment fully and to begin to experience fully what it is that's happening inside of us because for a lot of people what's going down is that there is a dude this reminds what I just watched the Texas fucking Chainsaw Massacre it's probably like the 16th time I've seen it but like I watched it and like man I had some a very strong mint tea and like I was watching it and was like oh my god this is fucking unbearable like I can't deal with it I'm gonna go crazy watching this fucking thing like the woman who by the end is all bug-eyed and covered in blood and like she's lost her mind because these Texas fucking cannibals if like driven are insane I'm feeling like that but then I realize like oh my god that woman running from Leatherface and the whole family freaking out and screaming how many people are secretly that woman inside of themselves constantly running in terror from parts of themselves that they can't deal with or acknowledge or look at so so meditation is kind of like going into yourself to that creepy fucking ranch house in the middle of nowhere in your heart and then exploring the places that you don't want to go into you know what man it's as it's feeling them it's instead of cleaning or fixing or repairing it's going in there and feeling that whatever it is for a lot of people it's just grief pain sorrow regret regret you know and it's going in there not being like I'm gonna fix what I fucked up seven years ago because this is not time travel but what I'm gonna do is for ten minutes five minutes I'm gonna let myself feel this thing that I've been trying not to feel by distracting myself with an incessant flow of thoughts right and that that is that is when you start lightening up a little bit because really all you got to do is feel is that I think the maps people say feeling is healing have you ever heard that no but I think I have but the thing was like a kids show that's a great kid show yeah they do man some of them are on the ball yeah yeah you know there's some kids movies that are oddly psychedelic dude or you can't like kids are psychedelic wait til to appeal to a child it's like you do have to create some crazy shit you know like what kids show isn't find me a kid show that isn't the most psychedelic thing including mr. Rogers like mr. Rogers is like that's some trippy shit going down there man trippy it's funny that you bring up mr. Rogers cuz here's what one of the things that I was going to say we're talking about gun control and violence and all the different issues in this world what one thing that we don't concentrate on is promoting being nicer ya know no government official does that presidents don't do that they don't get on TV they sort of say it we need to work together but they don't they don't ever say folks we just got to figure out how to be nice to each other that's right like we're not in conflict anymore but we're designed for conflict and here's how you get rid of that go get a fucking heavy bag go run hills go to yoga class eat better stop drinking so much coffee or alcohol or sugar whatever your your vices that's fucking with your body yeah yeah you get your body in order and get your mind in order and just be nicer to each other yeah that would fix almost everything if people just overall decided you know what male female whatever the fuck whoever you're talking to just just let's just be nicer to each other yeah let's just everybody do this can we all just work on this no one's saying work on this like there's no government officials there's no big State of the Union address and go ladies and gentlemen our problems that we have with each other ridiculous we're family here yeah we're brothers and sisters yes we're all immigrants every single one of us is an immigrant I'm not saying we should let everybody in but whoever's here you made a bitch you made it as long as you're not a goddamn criminal you made it whoa for tax dollars and get taxes from them I also don't forget we're all immigrants coming from Indiana t2 exactly we're all immigrants you've come into this dimension and have complete amnesia as to what was going on for the last third point yeah also in your American yeah yeah that's it so we're all immigrants and and and I hear about this guy I'm starting to run out I have to tell you this do you hear about this Canadian couple there's a gay couple that had twins and they did it through a surrogate and they they mixed up their jizz so that no one knew which you know whose jizz was whose well one guy's an American citizen and one guy's not yeah so the kids were born and they did a DNA test on the kids because they wanted to find out whether or not one of those kids was a dirty Canadian yeah turns out one of them is yeah trying to sneak over our borders and one day old fucker laughs so they set that little fucking terrorist back to camp yeah gay couple married in Canada sues US government for denying citizen to the child hey assholes let these fucking people come back gee but you'd understand man like people like Jeff Sessions see a picture like that yeah they feel like they're looking at somebody taking a dump on a crucifix like for a lot of these people they can't handle the idea of gay people having kids it's not like they're worried about citizenship it's like a lot of these gnarled fucks who are running things they're terrified of gay people yeah you know that's it's I'm sure that whoever made that decision it wasn't anything to do with like oh this is citizenship laws it was like hey man we're not gonna have this futuristic shit where we're doing some kind of jizz cock combos here we're not doing jizz combos and my country just used like one of those little those things you stir with you know like if you want to make a butter coffee hit a little blender that's what they do they jizz into like a mixing jug they use a fuckin they use like smoothie machines man they just say sure positive a buddy of mine was telling me today about he was in Berlin and when he went to this there's his club and they had three different floors this club like one floor was like hardcore like punk yeah seeing or you know electronic scene or something like that and then below it was a hardcore gay club heard of this class hardcore gay club they would have shit night where they would shit into Tupperware and seal it up and bring it in there they would jizz all over the stage and they would dive on the jizz like a slip and slide and slide around on each other's jizz they'd piss on each other and this is just oh wait I get the jizz in the piss do you but help me understand the shit the Tupperware shit thing like the problem is I opened up with the Tupperware shit I went too hard off the gate I should have I should have dialed I should was I should have started with jizz on the deck yeah and then they slip and slide then work their way up to piss lunch on there and these crazy motherfuckers started bringing in shit that's what I shouldn't but what I don't understand is like they're like the the slip inside slide it's like yeah you know it's like it looks fucking fun night you're like enjoying like some physical fun with your pals but like why are you bringing in like shit in Tupperware like what's the like smell and shit they like smelling each other shit so you just like hey take a whiff of this great shit I had the other day well do you know how some guys like the smell of their woman's vagina they want to get in there and smell it yeah you know I wonder how much that's connected because that's where you put your dick I wonder if you put your dick in butts all the time be like come on know your shit hmm oh like it's associated with likes you know it reminds you fucking something Mike this is what I want you to do I want you to shit a Tupperware and bring it over are you serious don't want you to shit nothing bring it over and don't wipe your ass Tupperware like why not soil mmm who knows man I mean you'd have to be really fucked up to want to smell someone shit that bad yeah well each other's shit maybe it's just like a naughty thing that would be a naughty smell my shit yeah and I'm transporting shit like you're like I'm bringing shit somewhere like I'm bringing a lunch to this place by the way I've heard of this club man my friend was telling me about this clown I don't know if it's the same club I think it is so I've been hearing all this shit about how badass Berlin is man that it's just like crazy over there and that this one club my friend was telling me she went to everyone stands in line there's no VIPs everyone stands in line like part of the experience of things you stand in line for like a long time and there's one bouncer he's giant he's like this giant scary German guy I think he's got like a glass eye or some Jesus and he scans you so you stand in front of him and he he looks at you and like does some kind of soul scan and if he decides you're ready to experience the psychic effects of witnessing dudes sliding through come because you know for some people because it's not as though he's trying to like he's obviously trying to keep it cool in there but he's also trying to keep people from losing their minds because like the one wrong person goes into the sub-basement and sees a bunch of people huffing Tupperware's shit and doing like you know and sliding through jizz you know that could be that could push you over the line that could lead you straight to fucking mail bomb land you could just end up in a cabin building devices of destruction it's probably happened to Kaczynski if you took any of the people from the Trumpy bear commercial and put them in that gay club while those guys are smelling each other's shit and Tupperware's and jizzing on the floor and piss on each other cuz they just wandered into there accidentally they'd all start fucking probably have you seen that video the Trumpy bear yeah I put it on my Instagram last night I was watching TV and this fucking thing came on and it's like a Tim and Eric sketch what is it it's like it's a real commercial for a real stuffed animal look at this the Trumpy bear no no you got to see the video though can you play the video oh just go to my Instagram Wow I put the video up on my ass oh that's it in the upper corner make that larger and give me some volume payments lessness the Great American grizzly introducing the original Trump eBay this is real fearless super plush American now tell me this doesn't seem like a Tim and Eric sketch watch watch how this goes on like they just find the secret zipper and pull out the emergently watching Flag Day and on any American holiday god Bless America god bless Trumpy there Trumpy bear suits probably the cyclic an all-boy to see and loves to cruise with his brother I'm a former Marine and I'm proud to have Trumpy Bear ride by my side fuck yeah once a marine always a Marine every goddamn Tim and Eric sketch look at this when I ride with Trumpy Bear he makes my golf game great again plumpie bear can pop up anywhere absently style this trademark and place him in his favorite chair I love those guys well Trumpy being a tough battle of lanky bear business is great business is great I'm great I love you Trumpy bear I'm I am proud to own the Trumpy bear and I will always be proud to be an American boo boo stick wait hold on hold on this is fake did you see that guy's name is war a holic that's Frank up that's Frank war holic like an alcoholic for war go back corporal Frank war holic that's a gag this thing's a gag dude that's but it's on the radio or it's on TV rather it's kind of a gag I looked it up after last night it is for sale doesn't real promise of real product but so this is it's a comedy sketch yeah I kind of knew it had to be there's no way it could be that bad oh my god I know what it is they've made a comedy sketch that's comedy for people like anybody who's paying attention but for people so dumb that they don't realize it's a comedy sketch and they they think the way the people in the video thing yeah it's like a honey pot for dum-dums yeah it's brilliant cuz on one level it's like a really funny sketch on the other level it's just like people like goddamn I've always wanted a Trumpy bear so they make this bear they sell this bear they pretend that they're all patriotic and they just made the dump of course it is what's wrong with me I am the storm of course it's fake that's pretty sad but this is the world we're living in right now I believed it was real because it is a real product but when the lady pulled out her flag I got a little suspicious and then the other guy says once a marine always a marine I'm like this is a Tim and Eric sketch it's pretty subtle man like I like it definitely I've seen commercials that shitty for sure Trumpy beneficial there he is once marine always a marine look at my boot it's dirty cuz it work what are you eight what do you think you know work we work we make really shitty predictions whenever I come on your show but what's gonna happen usually but what do you think is gonna happen with Mueller and Trump I have zero idea I'm fascinated by the whole process I'm fascinated by his disdain for the intelligent elegent community that to me seems to be like him all the craziest things that presidents ever done it's like literally have beef with the FBI to the point where the FBI foils a terrorist attack in San Francisco and the president doesn't even mention it on TV doesn't praise them doesn't make a big deal about how good our government is that we've been able to stop these terrorists and this is one of the reasons why I wanted to build this wall in the first place and tighten up illegal immigration this is an opportunity to prove his point and he doesn't talk about it because he's he's got a beef it's got beef with the FBI dude do you remember when that FBI agent came to your show do you remember that when that happen yeah that was one of the weirdest that was like really weird why was it weird because the dude liked the way he did it was perfect cuz he got like it made my heart weep because he's like he like he like he had his hand on my arm and like a cop style you know what I mean and then he like lifted his shirt up to show his FBI badge and I'm like well I don't know exactly what it was but I mean I could probably imagine a few things you might be he was really cool and he's like listen to your podcast he's like you know he's like he was just being really awesome listen man you need those people and everybody doesn't think they need those people you have an unrealistic view of the world you need sheepdog you need them you need people to watch the criminals you need two people to be able to solve crimes you need people to be able to stop terrorist attacks like they did in San Francisco you need them right everybody thinks it they don't need them look I wish we didn't need him I wish we had a perfect relationship with all the other nations and everybody just decided to work together for the survival of the species as a whole and we weren't so concentrating on owning resources taking over governments and controlling parts of the world that have you know things that we're trying to steal or get or buy but it is so as long as it is you're gonna need the FBI you're gonna need intelligence community you're gonna need the army gonna need the Navy canoe the marines gonna need the airforce but don't the FBI think they police the police like the FBI are the police has to release and that's and there's a checks and balance system that's been proven to now I don't agree with this because I think this is a crazy reason to fire especially a guy who's a war hero but General Petraeus he his whole thing he got busted because the FBI was looking into something the FBI was looking into something and got the head of the CIA in trouble so they go after each other Wow so there's kind of a competitive thing apparently aired yeah sometimes they don't get along sometimes the CIA and the FBI they don't see eye to eye on certain things but this one was a weird one because it was about an affair it's like of all the shit that he did bad like he had an affair like this guy's out there right smashing worlds with these yes a mother of all bombs without the fucking baton lunch that one that was after his time but they launched all kinds of crazy bombs over there right I mean they're just shooting drone totally muscles that's all good I already put your penis inside the wrong person dude now she's luxury it's crazy oh we're gonna investigate where your penis has been you dirty dirty boy in between killing strangers you're out there put this in the wrong person we can take all the accidental drug deaths you got for us can't take as you shoot dirty dirty semen inside another woman you will only express love for one woman in this world that's it you can only feel up for one person at a time and you're definitely not gonna put that general cock in anyone else but Lydia Petraeus you're why oh it's so sad it's so stupid it's scary like what the guy didn't want to fuck his wife anymore that's a problem between them yeah this has nothing to do with us nothing still a good general nothing yeah it's terrified I mean that's really where we enter into the land of absurdity but this is where it got really observed like you know people that think that there's some grand scheme to protect people and protect generals dude there's video of him while he was walking from City College in New York where he's teaching and he'd have to walk down the street where he was going and the students were surrounding him screaming at him calling him a war criminal and they did a concept he was teaching there Wow I would follow him from there filming him so the cash to the were filming him and then people run like fuck you fuck you and he's he's on his own dude he's helpless if somebody just if they just jump them they just jump him no one's stopping them I thought people like that ad like it's her no guards or something turns out nope turns out nope no shit they cast that guy aside I mean I don't know if they've rectified the situation after that day but that day he's by himself look at this turn it up give me some volume on this it's crazy this is crazy hey hyperbole is not necessary holy shit it's crazy to imagine that guy sexting sexting out of some lady oh yeah home here's a bunker-buster I thought when he comes he whispers in her ear curls up let her see yeah what do you think but they left that guy alone that's what's interesting then you would think that the amount of influence that guy had the the I mean that guy was one of the top generals if not the top General in the country right wasn't he yeah I mean he was a huge war hero there's been two instances of shit like that happening where the other one was the michael hastings one do remember that one vaguely this is a fascinating one if you really want to fire up your conspiracy yeah yeah i really want to turn that bitch to now yeah michael hastings was a journalist who was embedded i believe it was in iraq it might have been in afghanistan but he was embedded in the Middle East somewhere and something happened oh that volcano erupted remember when that volcano erupted and they canceled all air flight yes for a long time he was trapped over there with that and they got way too comfortable with him and so they started talking around this journalist the way they always talk and he was joking around about Obama and making fun of Obama and they said a bunch of shit they probably shouldn't have said but that just what fucking soldiers say when they're over there risking their goddamn lights for something they probably don't even understand you would want them to believe this is all for a good cause right you would want them to believe everything that their general tells them if they got a fucking crack some jokes the president's expense to alleviate a little stress we're out there killing strangers yeah no I'm intolerable intolerable you mocking the leader of the free world while you're out there killing strangers you can't do that so he made this guy resigned so here's where it gets crazy michael hastings starts telling everybody look my life is in danger he's like people are threatening my life on a daily basis if anything happens to me I did not commit suicide cut to him driving down I think it was sunset yeah car going uncontrollably fast slamming into a tree the car exploding the engine flying from the car yeah he's dead as fuck they find an feta means in a system but that's adderall because that's what all drivers are on they're all on adderall right so they try to all plug our was on meth hands thought it means when he drove into a tree good job yeah let's just forget about we connected the dots to is quite easy meanwhile there's people that have said with absolute certainty that with today's cars it is incredibly possible absolutely credibly possible to control the car from a remote place and make the car do what you want it dude definitely definitely definitely but we I mean this is I love this line of this direction we're going in here man because you you it's great because it's like this to me where it gets really remember that thing that people would always say the government is always what is it five years ahead seven years ahead to remember it I have it tattooed in my ass did you get it clever man you got to know the government's ahead bro but it's true all that money that they have so where it gets really interesting is when you start thinking about what that means in relation to like computer intelligence and AI and you start realizing like men whatever the shit is that they have access to at this point compared to what we think they have access to is so powerful right and so dangerous that anybody who they want to take out anybody they want to take out they can take out that's a problem it's a problem it's a problem having anybody to have that much power well especially over the rest of us it's bad for them you know and Kennedy talked about this when he was in office he talked about secret societies and and keeping secrets from people and this is generally it's a bad idea across the board for humans it's just bad for our human nature and for groups to have ultimate power of surveillance so just look into your life it's ah between Edward Snowden proved it it's it's obviously it's too easy it's too easy for people that work there to check on their ex-girlfriends with the fuck up you know do you think there's secret societies out there that we're not really aware of well if they're secret societies that we're aware of that's because someone along the line opened their fucking trap sure and they let us know about a secret society that's how we got out about skullenbones right one of those pussies told their mom yeah the order isn't it like a glass coffin like last dick you suck a glass sunglass day I thought no way I thought you way in a glass colleges on you and they jizz on the glass like you're laying down and you're looking up through a glass coffin and it's raining jizz what if you did that to a guy and it becomes uncontrolled be hard and just shoot in his pants well I think you're naked in the glass coffin oh okay I don't know if they like put you in funeral garb or whatever but my guess is like I mean it was me I'd be like you know I'm gonna I prefer to be naked let's go for it man yeah I'm gonna lay down face first just stare my hair yeah I'll try to come on the coffin from inside while singing ABBA songs but but do you ever like I love thinking about this stuff because I do think that there is probably and this is kind of what we're talking about a little bit before where the maps don't work anymore right I think a lot of people like to live in a place where there's maps and they imagine that's all there is but I'm pretty sure that there are sectors of society that you just never see and you never will see because they have around them this impermeable wall of wealth like you're not going to get in there like places that have membership fees that are like six hundred thousand dollars a year like yeah I know a guy who lives in one of those gated communities that has a golf course and the Golf Course costs a quarter million dollars a year dad because that creates this wall where most people can't get into and then also that's crazy people are living in compounds people are living in massive compounds that have entire teams of servants like dude there's people who have eight nannies for their baby did you know that there's people who have that's because they're poor and they can't afford 15 like a normal family you got all the different languages covered the different styles you could have gained any straight any city kid likes but that's when you think about that that there are these enclaves of wealth right that are compounds surrounded by not just like financial walls but literal walls with armed guards standing around the walls and inside these compounds are communities of as a servant class there are communities of servants that are having to serve these wealth hyper wealthy people that's a king and a queen it's a feudal compound that's being separated from the rest of the world and where at least a Duke and the Duchess said Duke and a Duchess but I mean that but it's basically the different it's it's the same fucking thing because a lot of the people working in there are illegals so they don't even have recourse to normal laws and stuff like that and so what ends up happening in these compounds is there's people who are untraceable who live in there and that is when you end up in a fucking spacesuit sitting in a goddamn Tesla going on fucking Mars you could put a disgrace nanny in that fucking thing you know in there really gangster when they have white nannies right pretty white nanny pretty white nanny the wife has to sit around like there's someone who's always at check always it checked me a husband not quite checked me always a check yeah we went around check yeah oh she conveniently dropped her keys in front of Luther yeah look at her pick him up that dirty bitch God fucking history that's up in the air why she picks up the keys monogamy's so done and believe I left these keys here well at Luther fucking nanny would just lift the nanny wait let the wife join it she knows about the offshore accounts we have to offer she knows about the taxes dude she knows more than that she knows more than that because what ends up happening in these compounds is you do start knowing things and you start knowing real thing yeah you start getting the real downloads about like what's actually happening because these little fucking compounds they're all those people are connected to each other they send each other Christmas cards and and and they go to each other's parties and stuff and like they talk and they uh and they know stuff man the way Luther looked at the nanny yeah bro well everyone come on bro she dropped her keys you really think she dropped her keys did you see that I did see it I heard I heard yeah I was there she dropped the keys on purpose she stuck her house right up in the air he's getting divorced we got to be careful here folks yeah I gotta keep this family together well these people sign like like huge non-disclosure agreements so like there's like they're wrapped up in a veil of secrecy anyway but that's not what you have to worry about what you have to worry about it's harvey keitel from pulp fiction that's you have to worry about worry about someone making a phone call there's some guy who works some fucking ray Donovan in real life guy who works for rich people yeah who can make a lot of money some imagine if you're friends with a billionaire and this billionaire is he's in a situation yeah no this is fucking guy he's just you know he's got pictures of my wife and yeah you know he's trying he's trying to get some money out of me man I don't know what to do well sir we can make this disappear for a tidy sum of $200,000 dun dun dun and then all sudden that guy just isn't around anymore yeah the guy just gets picked off and you ever like would investigate it gets paid off and then it's like nothing happens that worry just disappears you just take him into the middle of the ocean well didn't wasn't there just this billionaire Canadian couple that got executed executed in the house yeah it's like shit like that they're a part of some some sketchy deal what were they connected to it was the Clinton Foundation was it jesus fucking christ jesus fucking christ Oh Joe with you and your conspiracy theories about the claim yes it's all coincidence after coincidence after coincidence yeah would you bring up Seth rich again let it go let it go no suspects shot in the back in front of his house 4:00 in the morning no robbery while it remains phone remains watch remains private investigator and he's the guy who gave up all the DNC leaked emails he gave them up to WikiLeaks nope just coincidence yeah most another thing coincident the linked emails that show that the Clinton campaign absolutely worked they're fucking black magic to get Bernie Sanders knocked up dude how about hunting man murdered Canadian billionaire couple Barry and honey Sherman several people murdered them it says several Wow Wow crazy that's crazy they got whacked Hey they fucked up it fucked up today what do they did didn't have a big enough army around them they didn't have any army like a Duke and a duchess and you're gonna hang out with assassins tried to save money on security you know if I was running a security team I'd show them I'd be like take a look at these guys they tried to save money on their security team yeah right okay it says angling to discover their bodies dangling from a railing near their basement swimming pool I like that it says suspicious like oh yeah this seems a little suspicious these billionaires are just hanging here looks like they were strangled and died they died from a form of strangulation called ligature neck compression that means somebody wrapped a rope around their neck and choked them to go rot that is that is a personal way to kill someone yeah very personal yeah that's intense shit man and these are old people 70 75 years old if you google that it is not pretty pictures that you get back I don't want people's face not that whatever you don't want that don't want that to happen to you see this is that this is why I think it would be scary like to be friends with a billionaire it's like it would be scary to be friends with someone way up at the upper ups because like you almost don't want that level of access like it's almost like look man you guys fucking do whatever you're doing up in your compounds drink from the iron skull come on open the portals pull out the squids I'm enjoying my life down here I really don't want to know like I I would prefer to like to just speculate well here's the thing that I'm sorry - no please go ahead there's levels to everything right there's there's levels to the weirdness that's involved in immigrant communities that all keep the same language they all stay together they huddle up together there are there signs in their same language and then becomes like a Koreatown or a Chinatown they all just huddle in that area and stay in that area there's weirdness - that there's weirdness the billionaires doing getting together we're all just gonna go billionaire shit together yeah we're gonna hang out together any special clubs at those leather chairs those with the buttons on them you know those leather chairs they're like smushy they have

Oats box scary scary that's him coming looks like it's like one of these water bottles that's what it's like it's fat like that terrifying yeah and the end of it it Quivers terrahawks aids like the demo Gorgons mouth on stranger things the end of it it doesn't have a slot it has like a little flower thing every time we do an episode together we end up describing some form of alien cock every single time like I know that I know the last when we had a description of it yeah that's scary very immature how dare you I think it's important to like speculate on the different types of potential alien cocks I think it I think cocks go away I think cocks are this is a temporary situation 100% yep yeah I think that's what aliens are that's when you see the aliens they have no cocks no cocks no mouths we're gonna get rid of this mouth communication we're gonna get rid of this cock and pussy fuck your sounds horrible no no we're gonna mind meld it's gonna be like DMT every time you're not even gonna want to have regular sex if you could if I could give you the gift of being to travel through space wherever you wanted to go but you had a nub down there your cocks gone no I'd be like dr. Manhattan just sitting on Mars by myself all bored fuck that yeah fuck that I like it here you'd rather hump I like America I like being right here yes Angeles like it but you wouldn't want to see like flow to the edge no tiny little dick I have like a dick like remember what they shrank dr. Ken's dick and the hangover they made it like so smarty candy would see it remember that would be what it was like I know so sad yeah and you live forever with no dick no Stan through space just a nub bored listen man I'm not into deals I like what's going on right now I don't want to hear your heaven deal I don't want to hear your space deal yeah good I'm good right here well I mean don't you ever I mean this we are and there's another thing we tell we've done these so many times we're gonna repeat of course but like dude wonder I do worry about you sometimes because it's like I think you're gonna get I think it's finally gonna happen I think one of your fucking guests is gonna come in here with a briefcase and he's gonna show you something and I don't know what it is like an alien piece of it was gonna be Tom DeLonge was hoping he had something no I think you're gonna you're you're accidentally gonna get access for some reason I think somebody's gonna give you something or show you something and you're in like I worry about you man because it's like yeah cuz you've got like you now have a platform that is unlike any platform that's happened you know because you're doing like a comedy podcast radio show style thing but you're also interviewing people about really heavy-duty shit and sure you like pepper it up with freaks like me from time to time just R it up yeah but like you have you have you make it sound like the the other people are there on the main agenda and my patches pepper and up a little Duncan Trussell well no I'm just saying like what the fuck do I know like you're having people I'm talking about you and I have had my all-time favorite podcast I have my all-time favorite group of people if I had like a handful of ten people to pick forever just do podcast them forever you are 100% honest I appreciate that it's you and Diaz and Ari there's a few other people Cowen but there's just a list of people that are just forever yeah man but I love doing podcast don't you ever say that it's between you and some fucking scientists want to prove to me that telekinesis is real I'm going with you please take the scientist and we'll do a podcast after but dude I'm telling you don't like knowing all this shit and there's so many times and we've done this podcast where you and I have started talking and like the hair stands up on my arm and I'm like dude like we we shouldn't be talking about some of this shit like like like it gives me the real heebie-jeebies and then sometimes I'll admit this to you sometimes when I'm super stunned I'm thinking about all the podcast we've done sometimes I think to myself fuck maybe Joe does know something like maybe you did end up getting some kind of little like shoulder of with them where they're like not literally your shoulder up you just brushed shoulders and they were like hey we love your show we love your show man they didn't even say anything they just showed themselves to you a little bit to be like hey look don't fuck around man don't fuck around like you could talk we don't look we are funny we like the way you talk but don't fuck around man don't you ever think that hmm no because I'm not like you god damn it plus I don't keep those commie ideas floating around inside my head I got a goddamn American flag behind me Duncan Trussell I don't the fuck you're talking about I'm friends with a ton of cops you got an American flag with a fucking cows skull above it it's actually an Asian Buffalo from Australia that was arrowed by my great friend Adam green tree one of the best bow hunters on the face of the planet Earth Wow he shot that thing yeah but I mean it's like he brought it to me remember my friend remember when we did that show remember we did that show but it was kind of a show progressed we became increasingly sort of despondent upon realizing because we're both secretly thought it became very frustrating because you saw the same thing in everybody you saw this delusional belief in illogical things that they would argue yeah but they would argue it illogically they weren't objective about the actual evidence versus what they wanted to perceive the evidence to point to yeah they were all biased in which I've been biased before everybody's been biased but it was just delusional everything everyone was delusional everyone from the first UFO guy to the first chemtrail guy to the first Bigfoot guy they were all either liars or delusional or they had errors in their thinking and then occasionally we would talk to a guy like that one dude that we met that was in the trailer that told us about the balls that would fly through the air yes well after that I heard a podcast with a physicist who a guy was a lightning expert who was talking about ball lightning they don't know what causes it they don't know why it exists even and this guy was at it was on radio lab and it was fairly recently and this guy was actually saying that lightning itself doesn't make any sense like it's not supposed to exist if you're measuring all of the energy in the sky there's something that we don't know about what the formation of lightning is that it shouldn't even exist shouldn't be possible right but this ball lightning is not only possible it's been observed many many times and it's even happened inside of an airplane it floated down the aisle inside of an airplane and multiple people witnessed right people have seen ball lightning they've gotten video of bald lightening what it looks like is that exactly what that guy was describing to us that this thing came through his house and and then just disappeared yeah remember he's talking about totally remember and he did not seem like a liar to me no I think he saw a ball lightning and I think with that area near that skinwalker ranch place in particular is for whatever whatever causes that phenomenon it happens more frequently in that area it's very possible so a lot of people over there it saw some shit sure man I mean but but this that was disappointing but that was the most revealed I was revealing in the guy that was a weird area yeah that was a fucking weird area but don't you like imagine that do you ever do this game this is a fun game or you start thinking about who the smartest person on the planet must be like the continuum of intelligence game where you start thinking like okay I know I land somewhere on the continuum of intelligence I know there's people that are probably not quite as smart as I am and I know there's people who are way fucking smarter than I am and then you start thinking to yourself who are the who are those people and what and what are they up to and then you start thinking see this is what I think about if I were you then you start thinking like fuck man I've got this podcast that lots of people listen to has it ever happened where maybe some really intelligent person has manipulated me in an attempt to get me to disseminate some kind of information out into the world good luck manipulating me Duncan Trussell I'm an American okay these flags don't run or something what happens his colors but you wouldn't even know that's the thing you wouldn't even know I wouldn't know how would I not know these people are people what I'm gonna be like if they're if someone is super so good at manipulating people that they can manipulate me you change the way I think about them yeah well then good luck right I mean but that's like the thing is like it this is again I'm not trying to make you paranoid or anything it's just but it's fun to think is it's like this like okay like let's imagine for the sake of just fun we establish they're these fucking billionaires and they live in these compounds but are they and we've also established that certainly people like my sting michael hastings and other people they get killed all the time might have but i think he got killed because he got a fucking major-general fired well they what do we establish their league general there's some powerful people who will use technology to kill people to have their own way so that means that there is some group or series of groups of people that are doing like highly nefarious actions for ways of power or I'm just paranoid or you don't connect the dots here maybe he was on speed and drove into a tree honestly I do not know but he's very fun yeah think that it's a conspiracy and they killed them very fun but if you look at Occam's razor you know if you applied Occam's razor the most likely scenario is that he just drove into the tree that's not that's not very sexy here is a to kind of help out with Occam's razor with these kinds of things just think okay I have $100,000 and I'm gonna put bet in this awesome casino where the truth is revealed so are you gonna put the money down on him being assassinated are you gonna put the money down on him being on speed and driving into a tree after he said if I commit suicide it's not a suicide I gotta meet the guy he might that might have been thrown people maybe he wanted to leave a fucking story maybe this guy's like you know what I'm just gonna have these people think did I guys I know where you'd put your money I know where I put my money cuz it was like 50 bucks yeah I'm gonna bet on conspiracy because this is exciting right if I lose 50 bucks I won't feel that fuck what Holmes hoping to win but you're like I'm just saying man how do you deal with being on the fucking radar man because like the thing is like if there if there is an interest in controlling the pair and the reality tunnel like we know that there is a what like truly a a ward to control the paradigm because if I can control the paradigm just actually think this is I agree with you but I don't think it's United Front this war to control the paradigm is most tightly fought between left and right it's most tightly fought in government right in the real things what we're doing is commentating on the sidelines yeah you know if I'm influencing anybody I'm influencing people by pointing them to information that I see that's already out there right there's a big difference between these people are in power against each other right this there's got to be some people that are influencers that get access or get shit upon especially the age of Trump like if you're an anti try me if he finds out you're against him he's got like he's very vindictive yeah calls Don Lemon a moron and right you know he shits all over those CNN host and cuz CNN fake news puts Sean Hannity and Fox and Friends he'll praise them in his tweet so there's an information war going on right these people but they're paying attention to right and left right assholes like me that are like who wouldn't want what am i I'm a fence sitter you know mean--if fucking ron paul was running for president i probably like I'm in right see how this works right I like what he's saying I like his ideas he he was he was a guy that when he was running for president I was like okay well this is this guy's clearly a very honorable person he's clearly a very honest person I mean by all accounts let's see what he do is what we do let's see what he does what happens yeah see what it's got to be better than just knowing you're being bullshitted right so many of them are just so obviously bullshitting you that you're listening to these can fucking speeches and you're like god damn it I don't resonate with you at all right this is that presidential type of address yes where I talk in a way that you've never heard a normal person talk in your presence before you might say to yourself that's weird man but I gotta talk like that there's a lot of people now you don't you don't that's not real and I don't understand you're you put a shield up and the shield is a an act you have a presidential action or you have a strip club DJ act well you have a morning DJ app all right five o'clock past the hour here we go Led Zeppelin houses are the holy the ocean damn Canada yeah I mean that's the fucking voice I've heard that voice a thousand times it's a goddamn costume that people wear you also have a fuck voice don't forget that I don't have a fuck boys you don't oh come on let me put it in you you um you don't have a fuck boys come on so you might hear my voice yeah there's so much shame and what the fuck chief Regina yeah China needs to get scratched ah yeah man it's one of the definitely one of the like tragic part society is that people feel shame about that I love the scene in Game of Thrones when cease what's-her-name says the Busey Cersei thank you when Circe's walking naked down the street they're going shame the shame bail shame the shame bail app on my phone I used to you get the shame but lap woo yeah I don't have anymore why was it too much I was too much power we're addicted to the shame people delete their facebook off the phone I know people that like regularly delete their Facebook their fuck this they just take it off their phone you can't do this anymore man too much power with the shame Batman but people there's a lot of dudes who ring that fucking shame ballot girls all the fucking time man that's the worst yeah you're ruining the whole vibe yeah we don't is because guys feel terrible when a girl leaves them and fucked somebody else they want to make it like very difficult right new man right one man you dirty little bitch yeah see ya or if you're like not if you're polyamorous then like that they call you a cock because you don't care that other people are fucking you're saying if that hippie talk for when you move to Cuba or wherever the fuck you go I don't think I'm in America you get a fucking wife and that's it there's an even number of people here this ain't China son you want to go live in China it's like fuckin ten guys everybody I'm going ten guys everyone check you're gonna want that but fucking other dudes well fuck it yeah you say Come coffins all day baby that's what happens in prison people get crazy they start having sex with men you just gotta you gotta figure out a way out of prison or having sex I'm and you figure out a way I gotta get rid of you come comes got to figure out a way out what's the best way you're hanging out I'm gonna have to fuck guys or something shit yeah this is bullshit that's that's what happens if you live in China that's what happens if I don't have a real lesson here to learn but what if there's more than ten to one many women have some crazy problem over there I'm not making this up they have a prick joking folks obviously I'm joking but there's a crazy problem over there with the ratio of men to women that's the ratio let's take a guess what is the ratio of men to women China I've been defending like 60/40 it might be bad news it might be higher that's danger meta made that up that's a dangerous ratio it's a spooky ratio I've read the ratio it's not a good ratio spooky fucked up ratio well you know for a long time they have limitations on how many children you can have right which is just fucking tension eggs they messed up the whole thing it's not just that man people were killing their baby if they found their baby was a girl I mean this is a real thing it didn't happen everywhere it didn't happen all the time but there absolutely were girls that were drowned because there were girls cuz the family wanted a boy and if you don't think that that's the case you're delusional I think you're delusional I think if you put those kind of restrictions on intensely poor people yeah in in in some of them in some parts of the country you're in terrible poverty and you tell them they can only have one kid yeah gonna have a boy because the boys gonna help them work right I don't know if these stories of them drowning baby girls were true because I wasn't there all right those stories persist should never stoped them but I don't think they know either if you weren't there while it happened over it all it's a horrible thing I have a baby and then just drown it he doesn't have a dick but do people have done that people have left babies and garbage cans I mean people have done a lot of terrible things to babies yeah when I was a kid I worked at a place called Newport Creamery and it was right next to a bank and a girl that worked in the bank was pregnant she never told anybody she was pregnant she gave birth in the toilet and left the baby in the garbage they found the baby in the fucking garbage dead and she got arrested and this was a girl I used to go to I used to go she was a bank teller I would go to the teller she like she was she seemed awkward you know she was John Native dates or anything no I did not she wasn't attractive and she was a large woman which is why nobody could tell that she was pregnant she was big and she apparently had been pregnant and didn't tell anybody and nine months pregnant at work and just had the baby in the in the toilet and threw it in the trash can and I don't know if she didn't take the trash out I don't know how she got busted he imagined going into the bathroom and you taking a shit and you're like why is it smell like baby in here walk is that smell and then you look in the wastepaper basket you see an eye that is so fucked up so fucked up that was a real person that I knew the country with the highest gender disparity of birth isn't China what is it Liechtenstein Oh where's that terrible sad place okay but let's find out what the ratio of men to women does it say about 33 million more men than women so it's like 733 million men and 688 or something like that okay so it's it's like 90s that's like in the 90s Jesus Christ man that's crazy it's still a large number thank God for sex robots there that's better though that's better than I thought it was within 115 males everyone glad brother 115 males to every 100 females China is in the country at the most story that's crazy imagine if you're in a room is 115 dudes 100 girls it's like a crazy musical chair thing shit I find a gal this one's worse we're in Liechtenstein it's 126 miles to every hundred but there's only a thousand forty thousand people in the whole country so it's even worse so that because the because there's less last possibility fuck man imagine there's a country that that's a crazy country 37,000 people that's a crazy country that's that countries like Burbank no it's not even Burbank yeah no it's like what's 37 that let's take a guess a part of LA has Christ 37,000 that ain't that's nothing out here like Boulder is a hundred thousand and Boulder seems so quaint that town is one-third the size of Boulder I mean that country is one-third the size of Boulder that's amazing Wow when you think of it that way that's amazing as many people as in Culver City imagine if Oliver City was a country what everything else less 34,000 that's amazing so it's Beverly Hills yeah it's Beverly Hills as a country with aw dudes that's amazing with all dudes just like Beverly Hills that gay couple thing is sad it's fuck imagine people have a real hard time with the idea of gay people raising kids they get real angry I just can't think that all gay people are the same like why would you not think that some gay people would be good at all kinds of things there's gonna be gay people that are great carpenters there's gonna be gay but like gay people just like straight people is gonna be awesome ones and it's getting me ones that are fucked-up the idea that they wouldn't be good parents wouldn't you rather have two gay parents that loved you then a mother that's a fucking crackhead and a dad that's a piece of shit and beats you to gay people that let you be yourself you know just there they're cool and conscientious they just happen to be homosexual they love each other they hug in front of you you realize like we're all wrapped up in this bullshit of you know men and women should be together heterosexual people like ourselves we get weird when you think of someone that's homosexual like I'm fully in support of it but when if they started fucking right in front of you for like hey I got a go whereas like if Duncan started banging his girlfriend right in front of me I'd be like even you want me to cheer you on hey just watch okay don't look at me when you come though that last time was weird but it's like I I've seen guys kiss in public and part of me is happy for them part of me is like that's awesome that they're so comfortable in 2018 now 17 at the time yeah even 16 I've seen a couple of times what happened one time I was driving and I was going from the comedy store I took right and then I went down is it Doheny which street is it one of the streets that goes right to Santa Monica Boulevard which is like full rage gay Central is it just dudes in the streets partying there's this big gay club with guys on poles and shit and there's just two dudes and they were hanging out and they they were belt lupine where like they each had their hands on the others belt loops like like anchoring in and they were just grinding on each other and kissing and I was just I was in my car was like oh Jesus Jesus keep moving don't stop here I was like terrified too I think the car was stopped and they were right there like belt looping and making out okay simulator you have access to any experience you want uh-huh and you're in it for I don't know a hundred thousand years you're like some year I'm an immortal being how long before you simulate fucking a dude Joe well you know what happened Marlon Brando yeah eh fuck Pryor he also fucked Marvin Gaye what a roster Wow he's just really into talented black guys yeah Wow but you're not answering the question oh I'm sorry in the simulator how long how long before you start huh before you decide to have sex with a guy like in a simulator it's like for the for like thousands of years you're having you know any kind of you can you you can literally fuck anybody that you want in this simulation and you're in there for a long time so you go through fucking every single possible iteration of woman ever you just fucking fuck it three ways six ways thousands of ways you're you're like you're just laying in a rainforest of beautiful pussy squirting on you and fucking and everything that your mind could think of sexually you're just doing it how long before you start adding cock into the equation well I think if we did an experiment where we both took a journey like that where I'll see you will be just like we are now it would be a hundred thousand years of whatever you want later yeah okay we'll show up a hundred thousand years now you will have dick on your breath and I won't I would have gone through the whole hundred thousand years with you know gay sex cuz I could do whatever I want why would I fuck dudes I would have sex meet girls and then when I was done having sex with girls I would take a nap or I'd do some other shit but meanwhile you'd like I gotta stick it somewhere me it's true man yeah I would I would get to the finish line and I'd be like no do finish line I would be like yeah I made in two hundred thousand years a hundred thousand years us the race no dick for a hundred thousand years I've made it worth it because you're eternal you just have girlfriends man well it's about that time you look at your watch but after a couple of years you're like go for this pussy couple of months come on man why is a hundred thousand years any different than 20 years did 20 years ago you feel less likely to suck a dick than you feel today no you're the exact same goddamn human being other than you've learned and gotten better at left your desire you'd still like the same shit first of all I wanted I just want to go back over it cuz you said at the end of the hundred thousand years I don't my brother okay well here's the thing in my simulator and my simulator cocks are gonna like have different flavors it's not gonna just be cock it'll be like an Altoid that's how they get you the Gamecocks I hate to say this to you but you dicks you dick tastes terrible and you need to get it you need to get it minty there's way is away and then guys are gonna suck it and then they're gonna get mint in their mouth just like if I if you suck my dick you get met in your mouth do you want to kill it just let you just try it I don't know it seems weird we don't get you minty I will fully admit at the end of the hundred thousand years I have suck dicks in the sex emulator but the fact that you think you haven't I would like to do a poll like I'm gonna get to the end I'll be wearing a cowboy hat bare chested that's riding a horse Fighting's off with every fiber of my being but I make it bare chested with a bandanna like I'm close I'm close I'm shaving my chest with a straight razor in the front front mirror at the barbershop I'm super close to going gay but I don't I make it to a hundred thousand years clean I'm to have cowboy boots on with no sin you lose you lose they're not wrong I fuckin win I've taken my breath at the end of the race and I'll have those dirty memories either you have dirty dirty has idea of butts and shit in Tupperware and slip-n-slide thank you stopping with I'm sucking dinosaurs that's right you can have anything you want you can you can but fuck the unicorn in the sky yeah yeah why not if you could do whatever you want if you do whatever you want you'd like full char like if your life was a virtual experience that you can control with your mind as if you have a control panel yeah you would just start sucking dicks not me I'd be robbing things I'd be fighting vampires I'd make a whole world oh do a bunch of shit I'd fly you fly all over the place I wouldn't land it suck a dick yes yeah you know if you ever heard the Alan Watts thing about this you heard Alan Watts talk about this I'm going to talk about no he talks about he does this great thought experiment which is like okay if you were able to do anything you wanted you've definitely heard this but you if you were able to do anything you wanted if you were an infinite being omnipotent you could do whatever you want you would experiment with making everything and you would try everything and you would do everything we're talking about infinity your ear literally in the state of creative flow for infinity and you're gonna be he has a great lecture that I'm gonna butcher you should look it up because he's so such a articulate genius but like the essence of the thing is eventually eventually upon doing everything and creating a universe in creating planets and creating a planet where there's life on it and being a god that communicates with the beings on the planet you're gonna start thinking to yourself I wonder what would happen if I made myself one of the beings on the planet and couldn't remember that I was God and that's what you are that's what we are is we are one of the experiments of the divine seeing shit I wonder what happens if I forget when I'm capable of creating anything that I want whenever I want that I've made the entire universe let me turn myself into this hyper limited version of myself with no memory of what I was and play that game at that level because it's a lot more fun it's amusing it's exciting hmm right and that's and that's when Alan Watts starts talking about which cocks he would simulate inside that machine no no but yeah it is if you ever heard Marshall McLuhan speak now his there's some interesting YouTube videos on with you could watch McLuhan talk and he doesn't look anything like you'd expect it's really interesting but his Calculon on one side calculated his scientific dissection of like what's happening with media and what's happening with technology and where the future lies is so fascinating because it's from the 1960 yeah and you know he's talking about the media is the message I think is the end of the lecture in the book and that was the same book where he wrote one of my all-time favorite quotes that human beings are the sex organs of the machine yelled like this guy had no internet he had I mean nothing was like anything - in the bet most electronics they had us goddamn calculator yeah it had nothing the computers they had were giant rooms filled with shit you know like yeah but somehow another he saw where it was on Cohen he was seeing things and pointing things out just with the very nature of our ability to communicate in our ability to innovate and where it was all headed yeah fucking fascinating because you think about how did play out and no one saw this comment man but no one saw coming was what we're on right now or Internet this fucking new thing yeah where people can just find out the answer to like we've done so far today about scientific questions about Descartes yeah fuckin periods that these this was constructed and when did this happen and a thousand 79 what and that you know you're you're getting a download unlike anybody that's ever lived yeah it's amazing everybody can do it that this is the thing that's that's making the boundaries between us and the leaders of the world this is why there's such a problem it's because we have all the information - all right everybody has all the information yeah and the only thing that's keeping it all glued together is tradition the only thing that's keeping the hierarchies into the position of power they're out right now without being completely abandoned and restructured from the bottom up the only thing that's keeping them together is tradition that's it what do you mean the that's keeping government and just borders yeah and Nations and the whole concept that we're existing that there are a bunch of different countries and there's a bunch of different leaders and this coalition the only thing that's keeping that together is tradition the only thing if if we eventually can communicate with each other in a way that forgoes all of the current limitations and all the past limitations something that bypasses all that stuff and takes one of the first things is going to go is the illogical traditions but but it seems like it's traditions being guarded by dudes with guns they are but those dudes with guns are gonna die and new young dudes with guns are gonna take their place this is just a I mean it might take generations but this is what happens with ideas it's just happening so fast now yeah and some of the people with the old idea they were born and raised with the older guys they're still around they're still stuck in this old systems right but then this new system is blossomed around they're trapped and they're shitting bricks or shitting bricks and they're trying to stop it exactly and they're actively trying to start it did you hear that shit Jeff session said I don't mean to keep harping on that guy he he he said that like he just came out again saying that he thinks that the opioid epidemic as they call it is being partially fueled by marijuana as a gateway drug that marijuana is getting people onto painkillers which is a completely well it's not I mean not only is it is it wrong it's like they can show statistics that seem to indicate that the opposite the opposite yeah but that crazy fuck is saying it publicly like it's real and it's not and just the fact that like that man is allowed to continue having his job which theoretically somebody who's in his position should be so hyper aware of the data on all drugs because a person in that position we need a person just like you're saying we need Shepherds like this fucking fentanyl shit man yes one of my friends he lost his his his wife to this if so many people are dying because of this like I know a couple people that are done from it it's terrible it's Tom Petty it's so sad Prince it's terrible but we need so we need to have some regulatory force it's making sure that these poisons but they're not regulating that they're going after the stuff that's the most not he was the safest the most beneficial medicinal could you imagine having a podcast with Jeff Sessions just you sitting across from Jeff Sessions for three hours and talking to him about things dude I've heard and this is like I hate to he smells like soul no I hate to say this I don't want to say this I've heard he's like funny and he's like likes to argue and he's cool thing how I say that but if you had him on a podcast I bet you chip away through all that all those that party personality know these people that's a problem man these people they're not lizards they're not lizards that's a problem if there were fucking lizards if only Jeff Sessions was a fucking lizard before the problem is it's like they're not like that they're just kept they're confused again yes master sessions your podcast is wonderful thank you Father thank you thank you thank you no the problem is we have to have compassion for these people because they're not bad they're misguided it's informed yes and and they can be turned around with the proper experiences right and if they're willing to abandon their previous notions but the problem is so many people are so invested in their identity that it's impossible for them to give up their notions just like the Egyptologists that don't want to look at the possibility that maybe they're been doing these fantastic constructions in Egypt a lot longer than we think which is entirely possible that doesn't mean that the great pit mean take it back to Egypt one last time like no one's doubting that the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed at somewhere around 2500 BC according to the previous or all the data that we have right now because they've been able to carbon date stuff that they finally came between the stones yeah they're pretty sure that it's somewhere in that range you know they're off here there a little bit but there's some other construction that John Anthony West pointed out that's buried under sand they find that's like wait it might have been buried for who knows how fucking long and it's a different style of construction and it looks really old like one of the things about the styles of construction and the things that they find in in Egypt is a lot of it is buried in sand after when the Sphinx itself you know when they found the Sphinx and one of the things that one of the people that is in some of the ancient hieroglyphs that's attributed to being alive dat the same time as a scroll I forget which Pharaoh but he heard in a dream that if he uncovered the Sphinx that he would become Pharaoh of Egypt because it was covered in sand like he had written down at that time and this was like 2,000 BC or something crazy like that it was covered in sand yeah then Wow they don't even know I mean there's so little they know here's they didn't walk back you know they answer this how and this part dumb question I'm sorry but how deep is the sand out there like how far down is that fucking good question that's a very good question what distance and here's the other thing isn't sand from oceans beating down rocks yeah I mean that's what sand is yeah this that's what's the most fucked-up thing about the desert there's there's no goddamn ocean but you've got so much sand yeah that is mostly from what isn't it I think sands mostly created it's probably created a few different ways but I think it's mostly created by oceans beating down rocks right so that's just time you're just looking at time looking at the craziest fucking stamp of time we can look at yeah how long does it take for an ocean to turn rocks into a goddamn desert holy shit dude what is under this is a mega Lake Oh beneath the sands of the Sahara Desert scientists have discovered evidence of a prehistoric mega lake there's a monster down there using images of windblown sediments sediments produced by running water and bedrock seen by radar beneath the desert sands the geologists pieced together the profile of an ancient so it goes the sand goes 69 to 141 feet in the Sahara and three feet in the simpson desert don't know where that is the depths of sand varies wise throughout the world 141 feet Wow 141 feet of just sand so am i right that sand is created by the ocean beating down rocks I think that's true most of the time of maybe it's not true all the time it's so nice to be so stupid you just ask questions on to figure it out you get to know like it's great no idea yeah I was talking to Neil deGrasse Tyson the other day and he was trying to explain to me escape velocity like then he takes my shoe he goes let me see your shoe he takes my shoe and he goes now if I throw this up in there it's going to come down but if I throw it hard enough it will escape the pull of the gravity of the earth and once it's free we'll go on forever yeah that's fucking cool what yeah like you try to like put that in your head like wait a minute what goes on forever isn't that the problem now this sky this is great to just dummies talking isn't this the problem with the moon is that not the problem with the moon but if you jump on the moon you can escape the it's easier to get out of the escape velocity of the moon no it's 1/6 Earth's gravity oh really yeah I thought oh he's not in the mood you can you can theoretically you can jump higher and if you believe in NASA bro there's some videos of guys jumping around on the moon yeah the problem with the videos of people on the moon is that there are videos that look 100% fake what guys fall forward and looks like they get yanked up by wires there's a lot of video that looks fake as fuck I don't know if it's fake I don't know if it just looked fake because it's 1/6 the Earth's gravity and we don't know what that really looks like until you see it play out but there's some videos of guys falling down face-first and getting yanked by cords have you seen that picture the thing that was well after we talked about this last time mm-hmm some people send in videos of NFL players doing the exact same thing in the endzone yeah super athletes there's three or four guys doing throw their body but they don't have a giant pack on their back and we're wearing helmets they're wearing helmets that shit's light compared to what the astronauts are wearing dude everyone's have like uh well they have a suit that keeps them not concept is the suit if there the concept is there not even on the fucking moon and then that suit is could just be paper mache but some of the ones where they're pitched completely full and we just go finally what it is I'm seeing the right yeah come and see I would love to see it what's interesting so you you're still wavering on whether we went down there I'm more weight numb I'm too dumb and uneducated to really know but I am wavering more on the possibility that some of the footage was faked this is super quick it's a final video so it's okay boom that is not the same thing Jamie I can do that super similar bullshit I can do that that guy goes - I'll do that right now the guy goes to his knees and then uses his momentum to pop up from his knees I've seen some that look pretty crazy though man dude that's ridiculous the moon ones are way more papaya I've seen better examples than that there's seven that super athletes yeah what they're doing is springing up and you can see the kinetic energy from their legs and forcing them up there's super athlete right they show off those guys do backflips and shit all the time they're they're physically capable of doing things that a normal person can't do but they're not physically capable of defying physics what you're seeing in a lot of those moon videos looks like someone's defying physically they pitch forward and they bounce back up I think they shot a bunch of shit and I think some of the video if you're going into space and you're experiencing deep radiation the Van Allen radiation belts and from the Sun dude you can't even go through the fucking x-ray machine at the airport the old x-ray machines with film they wouldn't let you yeah because if you went through with fill and would kill your fucking film so how are they getting these perfect videos and photos and none of them are fucked up by radiation it's entirely possible that they did go to the moon but they faked a bunch of the film footage because they wanted to have something and they couldn't really bring anything back it's entirely possible there's faked footage from the Russians 100% is a precedent the footage of Yuri Gagarin when he's circling earth for the first time and he was in a rocket in the first guy in space it's fake is fucked in Italy he's inside this tiny little compartment and also there's they got room in there for a camera get the fuck out of here bitch you see a light source this way and a light source that way he's got dueling shadows behind him because they got lights up in there because they're filming him inside this rap song no he shot up in the space he really did do it but they couldn't fit it by damn Cameron this tiny little capsule right it's there's no room so they just faked it after the fact makes sense of course it makes a lot of money there was no internet back then there was no VHS tapes back then right they broadcast something on TV as far as their eyes and their mind goes that was the only time people are gonna see it right all they have to do is show it to you once pull it off nobody ever imagined you'd be able to pull it up on your phone or to stoners like you and me would be watching on a podcast right so you can find the video of Yuri Gagarin from inside his uh what would you call those things pods hides would you call it Yuri Gagarin in space you watch it you go get the fuck out of here you watching you go what that is fake right that is not him it's not him in space rather series and blast off here he is he's getting in the bus he's heading through space I can't believe it Yuri show me where are you right sees in this that was it that's it what's this are we good we're good have a go and look at the lights you see hold on back up back up back up stop pause it Luther shadows shadow to the left shadow to the right there's fucking lights in front of him there lights in there he's in this tiny little cat this tiny little pod how's it lit up no maybe they just have what I mean oh no windows why couldn't they have lights in there Joe cuz I got no room it seems like there's enough candles I saw a few breakdowns of the moon landing too that said it would be way way way harder to fake it back then than it would have been to actually just I heard that too yeah I heard that too but I don't think we're talking about faking going to the moon you're not understanding what I'm saying we're talking about faking footage we're not talking about faking going to the moon like I think they probably did go to the moon but I would imagine that at least some of the footage you're seeing horseshit was a hot from what I wasn't obviously alive them is like a 140 minute livestream right so that's I've seen no no it's not no if you if you just have people in orbit it wouldn't be hard to fake look I think it'd be harder to go there there would be to fake it I think going there if they did go to there and I think they probably did was an unbelievably difficult thing to do but like faking that they were there how hard would that be like like after the fact like filming footage we're filming footage of them in orbit is the part you can't that would have been a mile of film sure it's really interesting really you don't right do you know that all that shit's missing you know all the original footage is missing yeah what's the weirdest fucking thing c'mon man yeah I know you do and you're being skeptical guy I looked it up it's missing that no one else is missing lemma tree data all the ones and zeros that show the location of the capsule whatever the fuck I thought from what I read they still have that data they're just the original like paper it was on earth original magnetic tapes got reused because they needed to okay well why would you say that unless you just want just google it and find out that's what I read I read when once time unit what did you read would you read I read that that the original tapes got written over because I needed the magnetic tape because there was a shortage at some point right so but still but they gate is still somewhere else there was a show they recorded over the original tapes of the fucking moon landing how much of a shortage of magnetic tape do you have were you going to record over all of the video from the motherfucking moon landing hanket we got a presidential parade from 76 you want to keep that yeah keep that keep that's a good one it's like if you're going through like your family's VHS tapes like what do want picnic from 82 yeah that was when Mikey threw up save it save it they're saving everything but they record over the fucking moon leaves it let's just fucking record over the first time his human history literally the craziest thing in human history to ever record oh right it is the dumbest thing in human I'm not saying they didn't do it they might have that might though it's the official story might be legit casino but it might not where do you put your money on the moon landing because you know what I'm detect yo when we first got to be friends as I recall mmm you didn't really believe in the moon land didn't believe it at all and then you went through a phase because of the podcast and having a lot of conversations with different people or something happen where you started shifting your ideas and thinking we did go to the moon but no I started shifting my ideas about everything the moon landing is just an example that's an extreme example of a position I took that I think represents their eyes there is mystery to that story yeah there's a lot of mystery to that story still to this day there's a bunch of weird shit connected to the moon landing a lot of it so when I and people are dealers not shut up ya know there is there is there's a bunch of weird shit connected to it how about the fact that they gave a fucking moon rock to was it the Prime Minister of Holland Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins signed on this plaque and they gave this moon rock to this guy in Holland and it turned out to be petrified wood it was fake but it's on there's so much weird shit connected to the moon landing that it makes you go like wow like creepy speeches that Neil Armstrong gave 25 years after the moon landing yeah talking about uncovering hidden truths the truth protective layers that are you know oh great deeds that could be done to those who can remove one of truth' protective layers this is a speech he gave there's so much weird shit some people say there is alien Rell except there's people ridiculous there's no evidence of that but there is evidence that these people are talking really weird about the moon land Jamie can you peel a clean set well I know what Clinton said in his book he wrote a book called my life and in one of the chapters in my life he talks about a conversation that he had with a carpenter when people landed on the moon he was working in a construction site yeah and the guy said I don't believe it for a second those television fellers they could fake anything he says back then I thought the guy was a crank but after eight years in the White House I was starting to think that maybe he was ahead of his time now this is what Bill fucking Clinton wrote in the his book my life Wow why would the fuck would you ever write that if you were the goddamn present in the United States for eight years and you're saying hey maybe the guy who thought we didn't go to the moon was right right might not be right it might be that they faked some footage they did fake some photos there's a photo of micro Collins who's on a moon walk from like Gemini 15 and it's not a real photo it's a photo of him from the test runs that they did it's in a warehouse and they blacked out all the background it's been proven they reversed the image and blacked out the background you could see the two of them if you overlay them I line up perfectly it's the exact same image so someone whether it is a you know an overzealous PR agent for NASA or a journalist at the time we actually made that photograph but somebody did and tried to pass that photo office space so there's some deception we know that one is a hundred percent error so then you look at the other ones you look at the videos of guys falling down getting yanked back up and bouncing around like they're on trampolines in some videos where they're hiding behind the lunar rover like what the fuck are you doing if you guys tear your suits you're dead sure you guys are jumping around on the moon like you're having a party up there right is that real right how come I can't get a fucking regular camera through the radar machine the extra mission at the airport but you guys can fly through the radiation of space and that shit comes out but what will those cameras were insulated there were a different kind of camera the cameras be dead and not true hasil bad said it they were the same goddamn cameras all right it's a regular camera there was no specific protection there's nothing unusual about the protection that those cameras had it's interesting man you've like gone back no I haven't I think this is the thing man I'm not taking any position you're agnostic 100% because I don't know anything about yes I don't know anything about the physics of space travel I don't know anything about the requirements of technological requirements but I do know it's one of the only things that happened between 1969 and 1972 and it's not cheaper easier and faster to reproduce today it's weird so I hired Sven here it's a weird there's the only time in history people have been more than 400 miles from the Earth's surface was those moon missions all the Apollo missions man everything since then all the space shuttle stuff inside 400 miles satellites you know I think you talk to people about that part and I'll say like we just don't need to go there anymore they don't maybe they're right maybe the right it might be right we don't know but it's juicy to think they're not right but it's interesting how rapidly people fight off the notion here's the other weird shit about the Nazis were running our space program that's a fact Operation Paperclip Verne upon promise of fucking Nazi right they brought all the scientists over like legit Nazis who would hang Jews in front of their fucking rocket factories in Berlin legit guys who were wear tattoos from the Holocaust identified Wernher von Braun talked about him being on there that was the head of NASA that was the guy who's trying to get us to the moon yeah dude there's a lot of weird shit and see now you're getting deep into it it's the Nazis doing some kind of thing where they're like trying to fake the moon landing like it somehow get too attached to the Nazis I think the Nazis were the best rocket scientists available right or one of them other than the ones that we had here and then the ones the Russians have there was a lot of competition to get the best rocket scientists but some of the best rocket scientists were in Nazi Germany so when Nazi Germany fell Operation Paperclip took place and in operation Operation Paperclip they brought a number of Nazi scientists from Germany secretly to America and one of them they put as ahead of fuckin NASA yeah this is where the this is where it gets really cool someone's explaining all this to me about how basically it's that the thing is like okay you think in World War two that we just rounded up all the Nazis and they just disappeared and it's like what do you think all the Nazis went and their lot the ones who were really good at making cool shit yeah well Bayer Aspirin you know like that the idea is that the NAR aspirin yeah well look I'm so sorry to ask you me but do you mind looking up Bayer Aspirin and cyclone be like and and and and the Jewish slaves what I think working for Bayer Aspirin but when you look at like a lot of the core idea is that the Nazis didn't really go anywhere they just started corporations and some of the biggest corporations we have right now are do you know why zyklon-b is i clumb b-because zyklon-b took the smell out of it Zyklon a was the stuff that had a agent in it that made it smell terrible so you could smell so when they used it the gas the people in the concentration camps they changed it so that it was undetectable yet did you know what it say what does it say Jamie's quick with a trigger here today Lian frustrated with us changes the camera so if you guys know the Bayer Aspirin company has finally apologized for the inhumane acts of its parent firm including using Jewish slave laborers during the Holocaust holy shit yeah yeah and there's all kinds of examples of this and where it gets really weird is like this is what this is one of the great conspiracy theories is I think the Bush family is somehow wrapped up in it that's where it gets weird is like the it ends up getting wrapped into American politics it's like oh do you think that the Nazis just became rocket scientists do you think they just like no they became pharmacists pharmacists and they started REMIC companies and corporations and then like they and they're still here and their descendants have lots of money and like to think that they went anywhere is nuts the Nazis didn't really go anywhere they just went deep into hiding they just sink back into the immune system of society like you know like the way aids hides in different parts of your body they just hid in the shadows and this is one of the reasons people are freaking out about the kind of like friendly emergence of some people who are like clearly white nationalists who are just kind of like being like interestingly accepted and embraced for you know what's at least I have a rational conversation about how you want to start a white ethnos state you know that kind of stuff because who's doing that well I mean isn't this something Richard Spencer talks about but who's taking that guy in and talking to him rationally well there's these a lot of these people are getting like a lot of airtime right but I think this is a bit of an exaggeration you like maybe we talked about Steve Bannon like Steve ban and got into the White House a lot of people stayed at handy's but as he had been proven I mean it's really easy to call a guy a white nationalist has it been proven I don't know much about Steve banning I don't know what honestly I think a lot of I think I think some of these people it's I think it's like God I mean you're gonna I'm gonna get like a fucking I'm gonna get like an avalanche of like you're a fucking guy you cut commie but I think like for example when you look at Trump's reaction when they were saying asking about the KKK and he's like I'm not gonna talk shit about this group I don't really know him remember that like or the fact that a lot of like I think you're paraphrasing he I think what he said was a little more susceptible but still weird can we look at it it's like a little tiptoeing it's like if someone's like hey KKK what do you think well this also said something about there was people bad behavior on all sides on all sides and that's one of the one of the white nationalist groups picked up on that and said specifically the Trump didn't criticize them specifically so this was a good thing the whole thing was very good for them I was like a white nationalist group said that but that could have been just him just not doing a good job preparing what he's gonna say about something and talking off the cuff which I think he does with most things I think that guy does most of his shit off-the-cuff yeah you know he said that and one of the things that he said like in the wrote that book the art of the deal he doesn't make plans he just goes it just goes to work and gets things done and just work off instinct I don't know that the thing is like it's generally like when you think of certain people right are they a white nationalist mm-hmm like when I think of you Joe are you a white nationalist no right it's just I don't simple it's simple it's like there's no like well you're not even a nationalist I love America but I'm not a nationalist exactly yeah so the problem is with some wait what you don't want this is one thing I don't want I don't want there to be a blurry thing when people think of me about whether or not I'm a white nationalist right you know what I mean like I don't want there to be a like well maybe he does have some kind of ideas that are based around the importance of upholding European culture and making sure that we do everything we can to prevent people from having sex with people from other races I don't want there to be any question but like I have zero problem with everyone humping everybody whenever they want mixing the paints and doing whatever there's no question I don't care like I think it's fine whereas some sounds like what a racist would say what do you mean trying to like divert attention away from your racism I see what the fuck you do actually what you're doing man this is virtual signaling but race you don't you give me a favor I hate to dwell on this one more time but you please go I want to make sure I'm right about this that the Hasselblad cameras from the moon landing weren't insulated in any bizarre way so you boys met up there are cept they were different cameras that were made specially well they were made for this chassis and they also had a special film belt developed by Kodak special film is that true because I've read that it was the exact same film but who says it who says it is a big breakdown don't look at it okay I had a pixel which is a big there's too many fucking there's too many different people commenting on it that like me like I'm muddying the waters myself by not exactly knowing what the fuck I'm talking about well dude I mean that's right that's historic what is this who wrote this had a pixel of the pretty pod but this is fucking shell to shell site this is CIA front look at the shadows the lighting the lighting why is it so well lit it's in the shadows god dammit there's a guy behind it with one of those big reflector booms this is on in Nevada there's a tarp back there and if you look real close you could see gum wrappers films look at all that gum wrapper that fake ground we got fake that ground looks super likely that just landed on the moon it's just more fun this is why I abandoned the idea that we didn't go to the moon it's more fun to think that we didn't go to the moon it's more exciting so I have to be careful going that way that's why I changed my opinion on it because then I started really looking at I'm like what the fuck do you know about space travel almost zero but what do you know about bullshit I know I'm good at bullshit I know about bullshit and I'm gonna watch that press conference the post Apollo 11 press conference I'm like someone's bullshit yeah it was weird here and I think it's entirely possible that they were forced into accepting some stuff that wasn't real and they kind of knew it but that they probably did go to the moon I just don't understand how your this is like you're back and forth in your head but when I say alien artifacts on the moon right away like no I don't think they leave shit behind I think if they're smart they they clean up have you not seen there's a division of aliens no evidence look the face on Mars we've looked at women really well get that picture of the spaceship that crashed on the moon oh yeah that shit looks crazy over real I do you think these spaceships I think they get to a certain point they just travel through dimensions I really do but making that more and more I don't think spaceships exist out other than like the really crude civilizations like are relatively oh that's super real which was drawn with crayon Star Trek bro that looks like a ship look at the eyes of a mountain line behind it come on this is a fucking vault can't look that's it look insulating look that's a fucking topographical map that's you're isolating a tiny little area now and you're choosing to look at it you a ship how dare you you could look at anything in Moab Utah and decide that that's a spaceship this is why they don't want to go to the ground there's a hole in the ground that's a ship it's not a ship and look at that trail it's like a bobsled trail you know what's interesting we look for shit on the moon or in space in general and a normal thing in space is fucking amazing like if we find a microbe yeah on the desert floor no one gives a shit oh she's in the Sun it's incredible nobody's gonna pay attention yeah if you find something in space and you can prove that this thing exists it was a living organism a primitive organism that's on Mars so we know that some life existed on Mars right and then taking another step further if you ran into some dude who was jerking off in your apartment building you just opened the open the wrong door and some dudes in there jerking off ray screaming out and he's an old man's got a tank top on yeah Oh what the fuck can you tell your friends we'd laugh at it but if you found that guy in the moon just some old dude jerking off on the moon imagine if that's what we found anyway realize you realize live like that we literally are in a simulation and this is how we find out there's a guy on the moon jacking off and he's got boxer shorts on and socks with Crocs and he's just sitting there he's probably knuckles upright yes sitting there a hunchback knuckle enough on the moon and he got hurt but he's got mouthfuls of dirt that's so he gets by that's the creator of the universe he's just gone crazy the Creator the universe went insane now he just jerks off on the moon no it's an old man he looks just like an old man it's just like the universe is so infinite that there's an infinite number of possibilities that life's can exist like someone's explained this to other day that the infinite is so vast that literally it's entirely possible there is a Darth Vader somewhere like a real legit Darth Vader who runs the vampire like it's a real thing right somewhere that's how many possibilities exist so if that's the case why can't there be a possibility on the moon of an old dude who eats dirt he's got a tank top and spaghetti stains on it he's knuckling up on the moon we find them we have to film them front page the New York Times they found an old manager and off on the moon do you think they'd tell us if they found an old man jerking off in the moon it's like that's what they find like the space probe lands and then right in front of it's like look at this guy's great ball here I'd love we just see that I'd like to see the press conference spaghetti stains on his shirt no one knows no knows he's eating dirt on the moon jerking off on the probes now what now what are you gonna do now what is our civilization do how do we deal with this well it's the same thing as like this Elon Musk car in space it's like you see the image of that car flying through you like wait a minute wait a minute wait is this real yeah is this really going on or am i on a goddamn movie right what's happening here is this guy really spend a hundred million dollars to shoot a car and a space what the fuck is this sure he's got a camera on it it's broadcasting images right of a mannequin fire what the fuck is going on man cascading levels of absurdity that's what's happening we're seeing cascading levels of absurdity and like the more that it the more that absurdity happens the more normal it seems and that's kind of this is what I've been thinking is like what what the apocalypse really looks like because everybody thinks when you think about the apocalypse when I think about the apocalypse I think of meteors volcanoes the classics you know the ocean dying like just cataclysms right right but really it's like more like absurdity starts avalanching into time to the point where things start happening so quickly that we can't even catch up like now we got a deal with the fact there's a fucking Tesla infinitely flying through space life it slams into a spaceship that's coming to visit us can you imagine it was like the alien overlords like they're finally ready let us visit and they come in at Lightspeed and then the moment they read merge from Lightspeed boom Tesla comes through the windshield hits him right in the face takes the head off the Emperor yeah it's just fucked just explosions just like in Star Wars boom boom boom Laura Dern is at the wheel holding on turn around that's what happened that this new Star Wars movie spoiler alert remember when they hit warp speed they went right through that one jet or that one space yeah that's that's probably gonna happen dude or it hits a meteor or it hits a meteor that wasn't going to hit yeah there's there is now on must kills us all with his stupid fucking car flying through space just his fucking car out just grazes an asteroid clink yeah right towards LA yeah we don't know man right hits the Laugh Factory that's the center that's the fucking main place it smashes make God laugh yeah it's just a side of 18 semis and it hits the Laugh Factory mm-hmm no one can hear no one can hear it says it's so loud everyone's ears explode you know if you're nowhere near it your ears explode if you have in Kansas ears explode from the impact and you're never hearing ever again ever no one within a 5,000 mile radius ever hears again people in the Bahamas like what what what was that yeah yeah that's crazy the earth rings for a million years that's fuckin crazy they said when the earth got hit by that one that hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago it rang for a million years just a drone just like it got cracked like a gong for a million years yeah dude that's fucking crazy you ever heard the descriptions of how deep they think that thing was in the earth within the first second of impact no it's something bananas like a miles deep into the earth within the first second of impact that's how big that thing was a Manhattan sized chunk yeah man I love that because that's reality isn't that funny that's the funny thing about existing on the planet is because everybody walks around imagining that the world that we're living in is permanent permanent and stable and not just our world not just society but your own life yeah like people walk around through their own fucking life this is the thing I was thinking about that that terrible lie that keeps happening with the Amtrak train crash because it's like when you think about that you're just going to work what to here so here's the thing that disturbed me the most and it's disturbing me a lot lately this is a real issue people that were on the Left were saying that they were happy that it happened that God had done something to kill these politicians because there was a lot of right-wing oh yeah GOP people that were on this anti thing like could you imagine just saying that not not not only thinking it but saying it on Twitter like you're so confident say you're righteous with your desire to have strangers dead and a horrible fucking train accident yeah somebody died in that accident and they're like great going to heaven someone's dad's dead yeah all right someone's mom wife was a male or female it died but someone's mom dead someone's sister dead you like good good riddance Kulka God had a plan for them fuck them yeah because they're on the other team yeah dude that shit's that's terrifying that shit's really sad but it never used to be the left that's what's the scariest thing to me the left was never like advocating violence they were the exact opposite during the Vietnam War they were the hippies they're the people that wanted to bring the troops home they're the people that didn't want war they didn't want violence they didn't want hate they denounced hate now they're like they're like talking about violence being the answer Isis certain certain political movements a bunch of Nazi I saw a term on reddit that I liked a lot called liberal Baptist have you heard of this no so basically the idea is like you know like in fundamentalism of any sort really like the idea is when you're saying that you're religious it's you you're not really interested in another person's soul or saving another person what you're interested in doing is creating an ethical hierarchy that you can dominate by being at the top of the ethical hierarchy right so what you're running into with this shit that you're talking about is people who don't really seem so concerned with how society is supposed to be as much as using their refined system that they've come up with which there is like they call being woke or you know what I mean it's like this is sort of crazy it's hard to even keep up with it right but they use it to try to dominate the people around them by making you scared to speak your mind because the ideas it's like you know one of the eye I want to mic the guest of my podcast that I get fucking yelled at more than anybody else for having on Jordan Peterson that really pissed a lot of people after I had him on my podcast why because they feel they misunderstand him and they think that Jordan Peterson hates transgendered people I think or they need the ease a I think that he's they think that he's like all right they think that he's like some kind of outright spokesman and the truth of the matter is I don't I don't fully know all of jort the spectrum of Jordan Peterson's views on things because it would take me a very long time to do that I know he's fucking smart I know it was really cool for him to come on my podcast and I know we had a really great conversation they didn't really talk about that stuff right but it didn't fit the narrative that they want there the narrative that they want is that he's a hateful person and that he hates transgender people and that he's a bigot and he's just right-wing all right poster boy but it's not real the problem is people aren't willing to adjust that once they stand on that stance once they have that position that this is I'm left-wing this guy's right-wing he's a pig yeah he's ruining things like that's they just make up their mind but get it can we throw let me add one thing to this okay imagine this imagine Jordan Peterson and I don't honestly I don't know but just imagine there is a piece of him that doesn't for whatever reason like I don't know I'm again I'm not saying this isn't I have no I I'm not implying it either I'm just saying imagine fucking Jordan Peterson I don't know I'm trying to think of some offensive thing that he just imagined he adds some piece of him right it was definitely politically not correct right okay that doesn't mean that all the other shit he's saying is invalidated by some piece of him because people are made up of lots of different pieces well that's basically in a way I'm not categorizing Jordan Peterson the way you categorize Descartes but that's what he was saying right that with great people they also have what was the word he used not great sin but great was the word he used to remember the word the expression he got shit they've got shit got shit yeah great flaws and this is different vices this would be said this is to me where the big fucking problem is is that people have lost the ability to be nuanced and people have and that to me is where things are really fucked up right now which is like you were throwing the baby out with the bathwater yes and I'm not saying like oh let's give a platform to people who have like hate speech yeah but I vote to the idea that we have gotten to the point now we're just like free balling and throwing around ideas just like we've done yeah all over the place here I guarantee you when I look at Twitter there's going to be at least like five people being like you fucking cut piece of shit only because like I'm throwing around ideas because my hope is through that process I'm gonna get closer to the truce and I'm gonna be able to look at myself like what you said about the cock the Koch boy you know what I mean I liked it because you're right and I liked what you did even though his comedic is funny you're right dude why am i giving that guy a hard fucking times he gonna do he can't not be born a coke son right he's like he can't change his birth yes who is that meanwhile what's he doing is he taking over countries in Africa no he's making cute shirts and he's banging a hot woman yeah so that's so that but I like I like that having these kinds of interactions with friends because it helps me adjust even though I don't have any real animosity for the coke brother from that kind of thing I can look at my own fucking pattern and be like whoa shit yeah that's like a that's something to think about because I like I could be more compassionate there yeah so my point is what what what ends up happening and what leads to someone who started off being you know he who's a who considers themselves part of a group that was that's trying to stop war that spawned the hippie movement and now they're like thankful that a train accident happened that is a result of gradually shutting down their ability to understand that a human is much more than just one fucking thing Jeff Sessions is not just an anti marijuana person Jeff Sessions is probably an elf in a sweet outfit that and a person who's got a lot of love in him it has done a lot of good things for a lot of people but also he's got the worst fucking concept of what marijuana is and that sucks but that doesn't invalidate any of the love he's expressed throughout his life and this is unbearable for some people to deal with because we want a Darth Vader well it's because we are inclined to gravitate towards tribalism it is a part of being human being it's always gonna be a part it's the same reason why those egyptologist we're rejecting these ideas from John Anthony West and Robert Schoch cuz they weren't a part of the tribe yes and these new people coming in with some shit that they didn't figure out on their own there's a thing that people do on whether it's male versus female you're seeing a lot of this when it comes to this me to stuff one of the weirdest things that happens is that you start getting this divide where the men are mad at the women and the women of the matter that men even people that are non offenders and non victims yeah well they sure up on teams yeah yes it's good that people being exposed for doing bad things to people but it's also very dangerous for us to just men and women be on opposite teens were humans right we're supposed to be nice to each other it goes back to what we were talking about earlier we we don't say that enough I really don't think we say that enough I really think we need to it needs it should be reinforced and it sounds like oh it's a fucking great thing that's your advice bro be nice to each other yeah yes it is my advice it's not my only advice right I think you should also get your shit together I think you should have some fucking discipline yeah I think you should eat right I think she do a lot of things yeah sure read books I think you should pay attention things try to educate yourself I think you should try to be aware about objectivity and tribalism more aware of the influence but I also think it would be really nice if we all just agreed to be nicer to each other but and just have it as a conversation that the country has and then ultimately the world has but that list of things you just gave before that yeah I think that all fits into the category of being kind to yourself and I think that the way you're gonna learn to be nice to other people is by learning how to be kinder to yourself and being kind to yourself means treating your body better yeah you know that's that's loving yourself and like this is actually one of the things this guy jack Kornfield taught me which I like a lot cuz I was talking to him about man you know I want to fucking get in shape and like I feel bad cuz I want to be more in shape and he's like okay but the way you're talking about it you're hating yourself right now yeah don't get in shape because you hate who you are right get in shape cuz you love yourself enough to want to feel better and to win it so saying that it changes the way I'm looking at it yeah yeah I'm saying like you just saying that like yeah right yeah don't hate your body love is by getting it healthy and then my loving your that's loving your said changes the intention around from like I'm gonna destroy my former self and replace it with a better self it's like I'm gonna love this being I am right now and the way I'm gonna do that is by you know what I don't need to have five beers a night you know I know I don't need to pour the booze into the thing every night as much as I have been or I don't need to smoke cigarettes or I don't need whatever the thing is and that attitude of like I'm not doing this because I I'm not doing this because I hate myself it's just this is up different ways of meat hooks for me love into my own world and then from that it radiates out that's what you did I mean that's what you do is like part of what appeals I think and in you that appeals to people is that you're sort of radiating this like way of being that offers a lot of people a sense of like oh shit I could probably do that I could probably do that and it draws people in so this kindness that you're talking about it's contagious yes it is contagious yeah and and it should be and it's our culture's operate on the momentum of the people that are in them right Nazi Germany is a good example so is Denmark so is Norway I mean it's really interesting cultures that are very different from other cultures China is very different from Ethiopia I mean yeah they we vary widely in the way we behave yeah and I think there's a bunch of different styles of being a person and I think the problem is and this is a problem that I had as a young man I had an ultra competitive issue I was competitive with my friends I was competitive with other men I was competitive but I would shit on people that I didn't know look at this fucking loser you know it's a natural thing that young men go through and it took me until I was probably in my early 20s till I realized how toxic that was and I moved myself out of it and instead started celebrating people around me I changed my vow that's a because I was very flawed as a young man but also super hyper self-critical so my hyper self-critical I always wanted to be a better version of myself but and I would I wouldn't do it the right way like was Jack cornfields idea who's jack Kornfield jack cornfields idea I didn't do it the right way I didn't do it his way I did it the way that a barely educated 21 year old man who's mostly just read books on combat sports yeah and fighting philosophy and psychology I did a very limited amount of information in my head but I realized there was some flaws in the way I was thinking and I realized I was spending all this energy getting mad at people that I didn't know hating people that had things that I didn't have and I realize I was sitting around thinking about this once and it was as I was becoming more successful as a martial artist I was realizing that one of the things that was holding me back before was my mind and it wasn't just my physical talent my skills which also got better but it was also that I had a better way of approaching competition that I had when I was younger I didn't carry as much anxiety I was I was still anxious but less anxiety because I was more at peace with being around all these different people's fuck this guy who's this fucking I changed my strategy and I changed who I am and then as I got into comedy I was alleviated by the actual real threat of competition which greatly relaxed me right it was a giant weight lifted off my back that carried a little bit of that in the early days of stand-up I would look at other comedians like fuck this guy right I get jealous of guys that were doing successful I that were doing well rather that were successful I got jealous of guys who were funnier than me like why is he fucking funnier than me it was it was a stupid thought process and it took me till I was like you know like 22 23 I started realizing like I gotta snap out of this this is unhealthy like I'm wasting this energy where I should be concentrating on positive things yeah so I started supporting my friends I started being like a more complementary person I started I just I went out of my way and just be nicer to people be nicer to people not because they could do something for me just to be nice like I think it to be nice and I just slowly cultivated a better philosophy and it took me a while man it took me until I was in my 20s so I really like as I was like getting closer to 30 is when I started really getting good at it with comedy you know like bringing comedians on the road helping people yeah that's no doubt fostering other career telling kids that were like seven years before you know behind me like they were they started out seven years after me I'm as seven years ahead of you you could do this anybody could do this just do it just do it and if you fuck up learn from that fuck up get better this is this is the thing that you can do you're a funny person right you just all you have to do is just keep doing this yeah and you're gonna be already made it ya know this is the so this thing that you're talking about the thing that I've that the ramdas people teach me which is invaluable and it to me and it really inspires you is like they talk about rhombuses guru neem Karoli Baba and how when he was teaching he never said here's what this is going to do for you Brian he was never like this is why this is how it's gonna help you he was always saying here's how this is gonna help the people in your life and so the moment you make that little shift we're working on yourself as it's called is not about doing something so that you can fucking have a fucking six-pack is laid but the moment you start doing or fun yeah in a cowboy horse shaving your stomach but but the moment you start fucking doing this stuff because you know that it's going to directly help the people around you in ways you can't even imagine like you don't even know yet because there's gonna be a moment in every single person's life where someone comes up to you who's in a lot of trouble and they need help and it might not be money it might not it might just be something you could say to them it might just be something you need to be lucid in that moment and because you've been like you know not paying attention and you're blurry and you're angry and you're fucking shutdown that you're not even going to see that person that person is going to just be another face in the crowd that you don't even see but that's the whole point is like this practice your practice it ends up helping so many fucking people and if you want to get excited about something at least for me what makes it's really well look kind of difficult for me to get super excited over like I don't know some kind of like thing that's like gonna give me an extra thing it's way less exciting than to think that like shit man if I can be more calm and more connected then the next time I'm around somebody I love and get angry I'm not gonna hurt them because I'm learning how to not react to my own bullshit right you know getting better at life yeah yeah and it's through trial and error I mean that is a trial error honesty and you also have to realize that we're not all coming from the same starting block you know right some people came from abusive childhood some people came from super supportive and loving childhoods some people were spoiled as children and that's what they're that they're the people that struggle the most sometimes you've seen kids that grow up in really rich families where the parents weren't hands-on they're so disconnected I'm feeling really weird entitled and they have a very distorted version of the future and those people it's very hard it's very hard to adjust from a place of bounty to a place of struggle and success and in in you know self-realization yeah almost more difficult for some of those people's compassion look me growing up as a person who didn't have money you know and thinking as when I was a child my family was on welfare and in thinking I still can remember at least I have an idea of a memory of us drinking powdered milk I remember that I remember being really embarrassed if people would come over our house we'd heard milk we were poor you know and that memory of being a young man of being a struggling young comedian doing a bunch of odd jobs trying to make it like this this real hunger and worry I met one of the most embarrassing moments of my young life I had this thing fall out it was like some management company was interested in me and they were like a music management company and they were thinking about branching off into comedians this guy was talking to me about it and it was falling apart and I was driving with my girlfriend and I was 21 and the whole thing was so frustrating to me that I start crying Wow tears rolling and I remember she looked over me like are you crying I was like yeah fuck yeah and she's like oh like she was like mocking the fact that I was crying she couldn't help herself you know she was same age we were both like 21 right we're both kids you know and she thought it was a bitch move yeah just be crying about being frustrated about your career and I remember being so embarrassed like why did I why don't I let that out to her like why did I let that out in public yeah this frustration of not knowing where the future lies but that frustration and that hunger of like wanting to figure out a way to get out of this cycle of working shitty jobs and figure out how to do something that I actually love doing like be a comic like that that burning hunger because you don't have shit that's where it all comes from but you don't know where the fuck you're gonna pay your rent right you do you do not have an escape route there's no net you got to figure this fucking thing out me and you're not figuring it out right right now it's falling apart and nobody nobody thinks you're any good you can't get booked like fuck you're trying to figure out what's the next job you're gonna get feed yourself while I try to figure out this weird thing that nobody could really tell you how to do yeah you know but that going through that struggle that is everything but people need to hear that you went through it too they need to hear that that during the dark days where it doesn't seem like it's ever gonna work out are you alive can you see can you talk and you think and get better get better get better or whatever you're doing yeah let's get better so you suck at it now everybody sucks at everything when they first start that's the whole thing about getting good at something but if you love it and you're really honest don't lie to yourself don't lie to yourself look at it for what it is look at it for what it is and work on it whatever the fuck it is whether it's writing books or make music or composing computer code whatever the fuck you want to do if you suck at it get better but look at it for what it is look at it for really what it is and that's one of our biggest problems one of our biggest problems is that people have a really hard time looking at things what they are if they're not flattering that's right yeah they want to think I'm fucked who's God fuck this guy's a pussy yeah that guy shot a fucking rocket into space with a car on it okay and he did it with his mind and figured out how to make these calculations he figured out how to make enough money so he could shoot a car in a space if you don't respect that he's digging tunnels under la they'll let him dig tunnels there's an earthquake ridden area and this motherfuckers digging holes in the ground we're worried about fracking but we're like you know I must have got it he said it's not gonna cause an earthquake it's not gonna cause an earthquake yeah we're worried about people fracking we're not worried about Elon Musk's turning our fucking city into Swiss cheese yeah but you know man the thing is is that the guy you're making you're like creating an image of the guys like fuck you arm us could that guy is real that's real that's me that's 21 right and you felt like you queer and you felt like shit that's the important thing is like that that's all coming from feeling like shit and when you get around somebody who's acting like that if you've looked into yourself enough to see where you feel like shit and then you get around somebody and you realize like oh this person he's like being a complete fucking cunt to me right now feels like shit yeah and this is the I want to see the Dalai Lama and Anaheim and who you're partying with Ram Dass the Dalai Lama this is like not partying with it I would love to party with a fucking Dalai Lama I would love that I really might nullify my cock if I got a chance to party with the Dalai Lama space forever it's another thing to talk about do any I'd love to be around that guy man just cuz like when he was like so far down in this massive place this little guy you could feel his the energy rushing off of this guy into the room at least tripping maybe but anyway but anyway the thing that he said that that has stuck with me is he's like one of the things he says it's so simple and it reminds me what you're saying now as he said you can always be kinder and then the other thing he said and it sounds so simple but really people don't realize that you could always be kinder in any moment and then the other thing you said is if someone's being unkind to you it's not them being unkind to you it's an echo is what he said like it's literally an echo of the unkindness people being cruel to them throughout their lives and that shit is bouncing off of them like sound it's bouncing onto you and so when you get around someone who's like being a shit what you're really experiencing is that it's there you're a lot of sorrow from a lot of places you don't know and that doesn't mean you're supposed to lay back and let them like spit on you or be a shithead to you or whatever but it also it helps you find a little bit of compassion that's all just just so you can be with that person and let them be what they are without adding more suffering to it right yeah which only compounds the situation well you have to learn how people are responding to that behavior to and adjust accordingly get and do the hard work and look at yourself and when people get super self indulgent one of the things they do is they don't think about how other people are experiencing them like if you're around people like fucking the fucking worst look what happens to me same thing every day Network fucking boss knows it I wasn't mic did put in the world I put fucking 65 70 percent of the world she leave yeah those people are gross like I gotta go man I can't want people staring who would should or do what is the worst thing people do to you well they would should I do what do you think I should do man I need some advice I need some ice hey hey hey no you no you dust time what's going on you want me to talk about you you're making me focus on you 100% you're not asking me for help for yourself you're not helping yourself at all what you're doing is making me concentrate on you bro fucking really feeling depressed right now well do something about it I'm not saying don't reach out to your friends but I'm saying you got to do something to man you can't just always talk about your problems Merrill I could talk about my problems you didn't want to hear him cuz that's all you talk about yeah what's your whole life a problem right Jesus Christ maybe that's the way you're thinking maybe that's the way you're behaving to be mapped out your life all right I'm saying that you shouldn't be there for your friends when issues arise and certainly all of our friends are super supportive we've all gone through some weird shit in our lives we've all been super supportive but if I'm super supportive to you I know you're super supportive to yourself yeah I know you're working on yourself to not just relying on me hey tonight what should i do tomorrow what do you think if you could sit down here with me for a few hours and map out my future I would really appreciate a hand cuz it's just fucking hard out there for me bro you got it easy Duncan yeah bullshit dude you're fuckin you know man fuck you you're a good head start you're a white guy from North Carolina fuck you dude it's what it is man that come up these toxic excuses for why their life is shit without ever looking inward and they want you to admit your privilege and admit your fucking advantages bro how about you Duncan yeah well you fucking admit it was easier for you the truth for me alright let those whole whoo but the question is like because I know exactly what you're talking about and I know that person and I know everybody does but the quest when I run into with that is there's a part of me that and I like what I know sometimes you just have to put someone you have to like avoid their presence I thought you gonna put them on blast I thought you were going can I put them on blast no because it doesn't work that doesn't work but maybe it does for you I don't know but it does what there's a I just get mad at you but right so but there is a thing of like I this is where I might just be fucking naive or crazy or one toke over the line sweet I believe that with any body that you're around if you've cultivated love like if you can really love them even in the midst of that cyclone of bullshit that you're talking about if you could look through the cyclone right into their soul like into what they are that's love and see that and love it then the cyclone will start calming down a little bit right in front of you I think it's possible yeah I think it's possible that if and this is why I think it's fucking worth figuring out a way to cultivate this shit that you're talking about so that when you get around a third cyclone like that you know that you actually you become potentially the person who like not by giving them money or giving them advice but just by giving them love and letting them be this cyclone of shit for a second and loving it for real you might be the thing that that just like Musk's fucking Tesla hits the meteor and sends it into earth you might be the thing that dings the meteor of their life and prevents the catastrophe that they were spinning towards it's entirely possible but it's also entirely possible that like most things in life you need a lot of various elements you don't just need one person that you cling to you mean to look at humanity as a whole you need to seek inspiration in the great work of others and you need to look at yourself in a way that you think maybe perhaps other people look at you and that is something that a lot of people don't do in that lack of introspection and self critical thinking is one of the reasons why people don't change right cuz they don't adjust right like you're not the guy you were 10 years ago I've known you for a long time you're a better version thanks because you've adjusted yeah not that you were bad then I loved you back then you were awesome but you're you're more together more philosophical more at ease with the yourself person anywhere of 10-15 years ago yeah like when we were living together and I we lived together when you were in a bit down spot yeah you're a totally different human now yeah that's cool yeah and you were beginning and that's a thing man because you were like in those moments when you were like when we're riding in my fucking Mini Cooper and I'm trying to listen to Elliott Smith and you know I'm depressed and you're like dude what are you listening to what the fuck you listening to I'll never forget that and I'll tell you man in my head I'm like what a dick I was definitely being the day yeah but but but that what what that was was like though it was what you were doing is helping me like get out of that vibration that I was wallowing in it yes and I needed in it and I didn't it in those moments when you were doing that shit I was like in my head or resisting and I'm like you know but and that's the other thing when you decide to help somebody in that way you can't expect it's gonna happen their shift or change it's gonna happen instantaneously but because of that I still to this day when I put on Elliott Smith I think of that moment man going ducking what are you doing because you don't because because and I'll tell you why man because sometimes you can listen to Elliott Smith and not be wallowing and it's just really pretty and sweet yeah but don't listen to that shit if you're wallowing because it's like it's don't feed the wallow don't feed the hole yeah don't feed that wallowing spirit inside of you you know you don't need to feel that like everybody experiences loss and everybody experiences bad moments you're just going through you you're never gonna get life perfect right so during these bad moments what you got to realize is just accept it feel it get through it realize it's a journey that you're gonna get through but yeah realize that there's better ways to navigate it than some in some ways are really bad the heroin is a really bad way to navigate it and start doing heroin and start fucking listening to Elliott Samantha go holding a knife over your stomach in the middle of your fucking bedroom going fuck it man fuck it man I can't do that you can't do that well you can look in but it's not it's not the healthiest way to it's gonna give people around you and you yourself the most joy it's not necessarily selfish its self-indulgent for sure I don't necessarily think it's selfish I think it's just it's it's a pattern of behavior that you can get trapped in yeah and I think we've all been in bad situations where you just feel like shit like you get in a pattern of behavior and you feel trapped yes but you got a you got to learn from other people have been through those patterns and learn from your own experiences getting through Patty's yeah because you get you will that's the thing man it's like when you get around someone he's like a teacher figure like you early get around someone who's know that he's like really doing it from love and not trying to fucking like fuck with you because that's that can happen to the worst or be superior to your right like pull you down and yeah yeah when you get around somebody who's like doing it out of love there is such a massive difference in the way that feels and in what they do quite often or what a lot of my teachers do which is really fucking cool because like in the same way you've seen me kind of goes shift you know a lot of my teachers from the ramdas camp like in the beginning when I was actively trying to offend them because that was what I would to try to do it's like just be funny not be funny cuz I was thinking if I can offend these people about the practice they're teaching me and they're like hey you can't say that or that's blasphemy or anything like that then I know to get the fuck out of there cuz it's like you know what I mean but you say you were you were calculated fuck you always calculated was one of my teachers Raghu I would like his name's Raghu like the spaghetti sauce well it means it means a different thing and the fuck it does change your name bro my name SpaghettiOs but listen bro don't think about it like that my master SpaghettiOs taught me words fuck did you say he's amazing he's amazing and like in the same way you're doing that with him garlic the same way you're doing that with him I would try to do that with like their teachers and and and and I would try to do that too because I was like fuck it if they get mad at me right then I know then who can if there's a thing where I don't like blasphemy I don't like the idea I can blaspheme man that freaks me the fuck out but it was like when named curly baba you they tell me these stories and I'd be like you know I just don't I just don't really believe that man like I don't know that it's I don't know if I believe that shit and Raghu I still remember saying that walking in this at the retreat with him in Hawaii and he gets a big smile on his face he's like yeah yeah I don't blame you for not believin it this is fuckin cool yeah they're like it's that that's the so when you get around a real teacher what I'm saying is the place that you're at they let you be there but they're not like in the sense that they're letting you do the pattern that you're in but by allowing that to happen in its own way and then adding to it the intention of like I think I'm gonna help you grow here that's when you really start changing not when someone's like you when you were in the car and was in Elliot Smith and you were fuckin recognizing in me a lot of sadness and a lot of fucked-up-ness you weren't scolding me dude you were giving me love but the way you were giving me love was by making fun of me in this really sweet way and then it worked you know what I mean it was it was so that's the thing that's what a real teacher does and that's why it's like you know it to learn how to get to that spot is one of the most important things you could do well it's also from a selfish standpoint when you have a good friend that is all a sudden looking for a place to live and then they could live with you it's cool it's all right but it also feels really good to help somebody it will help somebody that you love and you really care about so I mean I don't even think I thought about it for three seconds when you called me up and you were in a hotel room I go dude come live with me yeah it was like inside Duncan's living with me oh yeah instantly I was you got a place to live dude you never have to worry about having a place to live I wanted you to you know and also you were I've had a lot of people that have offered the tank - any time you want come on by yeah I'm Stang you were the only guy who used it on a regular basis I hate live with me he didn't touch that fucking crazy thing he's like fuck this he might have got in there once I don't know but that was not his style at the you know but you were in there all the time and you were writing journals and shit when you get out of there we would talk about it you talk about your inner voyage when you'd go in that tank and just think about your life and how you you're you know what you're doing and what happened what went wrong and where were you headed to and just look ma'am the fucking stress of trying to be a professional comic it fucks you know how I know it fucks you because it fucks me every two years every two years when I abandon my act and put out a special I'm gonna have to write a whole new one and a goddamn sweat and just thinking about it right now like Tom Segura's going through that right now Ari's going through that right now yeah that's that's the shedding of all you've got yeah and then you got to start from scratch it's fucking terrifying you again and it's that thing that makes you keep growing yeah thing that makes keep growing but when you're when you haven't had any success like when you were in the beginning of your career and it just hadn't happened yet you like you don't really believe it can happen but once you do have it happen then you go oh I see just got to get through that but dude that the thing you're talking about with the comedy it applies to everybody and it's like the it's because what you're talking about someone's was telling me like if a snake doesn't successfully shed its skin it dies and and and that so a person is the same way in the sense that many of us cling to ways that we were thinking that's who we still are when we're not yeah and and and and you have to learn what parts of yourself you to let go of like and you have to have the guts to fucking let go of it and dude that is one of the craziest things when you really have a thing that you've become attached to for a lot of people it's a relationship that sucks you end up in a bad relationship bad job you end up just come attached to some version of yourself that you just aren't anymore that's not who you are right you gotta let go of that you gotta let go of it and letting go of it is death it's a form of death it could feels like death and so people want to avoid it and what ends up happening is you run into people who are just fuckin don't even realize that they're valets covered in bags from all these preview their hoarders and they won't let go of all these things all these ways they used to be so that's the the the what I've learned is that through this act of like scanning the stuff or looking into the self you'll find places where you're stuck where you're stuck like for example you were saying I get jealous I was getting jealous if these people are jealous well you were stuck there that was the place it wasn't just Joe's worse than that it was a toxic it goes I didn't like them yeah it's mad at them yeah you were stuck yeah and you were attached and you were like in that attachment was making you unhappy misery heavy that feeling is literally not just that week we we a week well for those would really bother because all the energy that's being put in Oh week and my judgment of myself yeah not not week like tired like didn't have the energy week like are you bitch you bitch you just jealous that's you that's you now yeah I know man and these are like you know like when I'm fuck do you when you get a really bad muscle spasm yeah and then you go to a masseuse and that that moment when the thing finally gives way and you're like oh my place in your back that hurts so bad suddenly just feels like you're back again and you're like well the the the same thing happens with suffering so it is suffering in a lot of people's lives they're repeating suffering that's a karmic muscle spasm and and it's like until you literally push into it and the same way you get rid of a muscle spasm it fucking hurts man right until you like get the blood flow going back into that place and really fucking go deep into why do I get jealous you know for me the thing I just figured out that's haunted me is just jealousy in relationships it's like why do I do this what is the this is just like you're saying it's week it's not a good look I don't like it and it's indulgent like while you're doing it you realize it's gross yes and you keep doing it yes you like oh my god I'm being a bitch I'm gonna keep going yeah yeah you fucking texted him first yes that Joe that it's so humiliating and so embarrassing and so fucked up and so brutal to the person you're with yeah so like that thing I figured I figured out what I want to say let it go it's the illusion I'm not putting out there that you can conquer you know eternally parts of your identity or whatever but I've been able to let that go and that feeling of really being able to let it go wow man that's to me that's one of those monumental things when you can start dropping these things yeah and it's different for everybody everybody's got their own fuckin muscle spasm but you'll know what it is you know what any people listening to it right now you know what it fucking is we are incredibly so we are incredibly susceptible to patterns incredibly self yeah and if you have a pattern of weakness and you accept it over and over again yeah it can define you yeah and you have to be really careful that you got it well yeah and but in what's the beauty of it though is the very fucking thing that's hurting you like that it's also simultaneously the thing that's like your that it's your fuel for improvement yeah it's like you're turning your trap this is such a cheesy thing that I thought I said I'm that I'm never gonna like make it a blog post or anything so forgive me if I did think about this it's turning your trap into a trampoline it's like you find this fucking you have a self-help speaker right now in a theater that's like a big screen behind you I deserve to be made fun of for it and I'm not gonna ever use that in a book or in a blog post or anything but I really do like the concept of like finding the place you're stuck and realizing that that's not a place you should avert your eyes from but in fact more than likely that's a door right that's a fucking door and you can go through that door into a whole new existence where you're no longer horrified by yourself and that that is really exciting it's a really fucking wonderful moment you know not just in comedy but I think in anything it's always a powerful thing to improve it's it that's one of the things that's good about doing things that you're not good at is that you get the opportunity to see what happens when you work at something and then you improve and I think that applies to everything and I think if you learn how to play a game and get really good at a game I think that figuring things out in your mind how to get good at this game applies to life it's there's you could get caught up in a game where like chess or whatever it is becomes your whole life and then it's almost too much right but you can also use things like chess or a lot of different things like we have people have a heavy prejudice against video games but this it's been absolutely proven that video games can enhance many aspects of the way people think and problem solve it's been proven I mean their studies don't doing that people are doing on it but we associate video games with wasting time slacking off you know loser meanwhile Jamie with the fuck we just telling me the other day about how much money these guys make when they're playing twitch thousands of dollars a day if not so hundreds of thousands a month hundreds of thousand dollars a month playing fucking video games how is being a lawyer better than that you fucking asshole is it about making money what is it about cuz these twitch guys got you beat fuckface yeah you're out there just making people get divorced and raking in the cash this guy's shooting aliens on Twitch and he's making way more yeah you're a loser yeah he's flying private he's got shoes he's got a dime encrusted Rolex and he plays video games do you understand how crazy that is you're over there working on family law do you watch twitch no see that's the thing man you know man I think so different oh my god crazy plate I play a lot of games man I only have so much time I play I play pool I shoot archery dude first of all you gotta watch twitch just for just for the sake of it definitely don't of the fancy you know for the podcast you don't have to but you need to look so that you could see the how one how it sounds when you hear about it every when I first heard about I'm like there's no seen Mighty Mouse do it it's really entertaining yeah and it's really funny and it's like when you're looking at like the the community that forms around these people and like then you realize like man there really is something really soothing and addictive about watching this dude have you seen that twitch guy who trolls people and what's it called MySpace that what's that world where what no no it's like yo Chuck not vr chat there's a Z this dude goes into different video games playing a character and trolls people inside the games and it's some of the funniest fucking shit you've ever seen like he goes into what second life he goes in a semi somehow makes it into a like a enclave of people playing the part of bikers in there and he goes in there and they're like they're acting like bikers so they're like how'd you get in here and he's like I don't know I'm just you know I'm here he's like this very calm voice like you need to get out of here and he's like I you know I'll come I'm gonna go but I'll be back tomorrow and they're like no you will not be back here tomorrow you are not coming back this is our place or you had to show that can you show that on I was looking up Second Life isn't allowed on Twitch for some reason but this it's a strainer look up Second Life our this is our place I don't know if you can if you'll even be able to find suit it is the funniest shit say there's a video that he recorded then you put it online so if you couldn't watch any trolls shit tons of people this way man if you find it deal of it videos extreme angry extreme angry rager for a hilarious trolling is that probably a second life three fingers what can I see it I think it's probably him but go back and look up this is our place biker second wife troll and maybe someone on Twitter can help us find it cuz it's like a pretty famous troll video but it's like the funniest fucking shit man like I've watched it a million times I'm looking on Twitter right now to see was there ever trolling before the Internet is this it dude I think I think that's it man second life labs and they will shut her down and they will IP ban it's one of them what what's the one so she's talking yeah but a different one what's the one in that yet as a second wife hold on what's that one are you gonna come to a fucking MC motorcycle club yeah yeah abbreviation you can go anywhere and you can mention my name I am I am famous you know why because haters make me famous and people that can't be like not him that's amazing though what's the one in the lower in the the first suggestion right there I was hooked already now that anyway the point is gonna make sure watching video games is a fucking bonus I wish I could it's weird look watching games is a blast I like watching that's that guy the doctor yeah there's like there's a lot of things that's interesting I like watching people play pool I do all right I don't even play golf and I like watching people play golf because they talk and what should i do what should I do like you think is gonna make it yeah I think he's gonna fuck up look at me sweating yes it's fun yeah and the thing about video games is you do it from the first-person yeah look at it from their perspective yeah and it's fucking crazy to watch me I went to I went to the Blizzcon you know blizzard has the Blizzcon like in like I was lucky enough to get in there man I got to watch like eSports I got to watch people playing Starcraft in an auditorium and it was awesome and the energy and there was so fucking intense before there I don't know hundreds hundreds it was like shit tons man these were like famous players dude these are like world-renowned Korean fucking Starcraft masters and like when they're the if you know anything about Starcraft and you see what they're doing it's incredible and it's just like you know the applause the fuckin like people are like yes what's super complex so fun to watch that's what I'm talking about with his people that have these prejudices about video games they're super like video games especially like Starcraft they are super complex they really require multi-level thinking oh yeah oh yeah you can't fuck you can't just play Starcraft not against those guys I mean I've seen you play it before too and I'm like what are you doing and moving shit around like what are you doing like I'm setting this up and this is for later like what I know like what is this I tried to return to it talk about like feeling old go back to try to play Starcraft after a couple of expansions have come out and you're just like I can't what the fuck man I have to learn you don't have that kind of time I don't have that kind of time to like learn how to do fucking Zerg rushes again I can see I liked oh my god this is that like the o2 arena looks like opening ceremonies in Seoul for 2014 League of Legends it's a football stadium yeah it's like a giant soccer stadium so bad oh my god it's filled with people that's like 50,000 people there yeah that's cool man that's insane it's so big in Korea huh holy shit dude look at those people look at the size of the place - why isn't that caught on like that here sir cause there's a overwatch League they just started this week or this month that's in them in Burbank I like the old Johnny Carson theater oh shit yeah that's that's cool dude when I was addicted to quake I would watch demos all the time from this guy named Thresh see if he could find Thresh quake there was this kid god I wish I remember his name I think his last name was farm Dennis Fung there it is Dennis Fong he was the best and while he was playing before he retired he was the best like he was so good that people would watch his demos and try to emulate his moves and what he would do is he would figure out a map like absolutely perfectly so he'd have these one-on-one duels and this is another thing that's surprisingly complex is playing duels in this is quake one that we're looking at here oh no it's not it looks like quick three hold on quick one tournament this it goes it a new version of it oh no it's definitely quick one okay so because you see the shotgun shells and shit like that there's all different stuff it's rocket launchers and this didn't have a railgun the rail changed a lot of shit and quick too but the point being that you would have these strategies because you had a map and it would all be about controlling the respawns so all the items well it's a rocket launcher or shotgun or whatever the fuck it is that you're picking up and the ammo all of it would respawn as well as the health so it was all about controlling where the respawn is keeping your health up really high and then making sure your opponent never gets any good weapons right and so they would it was really strategic and they chase each other around the map but this one dude just fucked everybody up I mean and he lost a couple times to when he was you know start now but he eventually got to a point where he was like the Michael like right there boom he sees that guy boom Jackson he knows where you're going he's firing rockets down hallways he anticipates you're gonna be going down and when you would watch these guys play you see like right there that guy was there and he's just waiting for him boom boom and yeah I would just kill that dude and I would watch these guys in these demos and try to learn from like how they were a manouvering there's another guy called fatality and he was really good at it and there was different games that guys would play too there was this game and some guys went over to unreal and they played unreal Pepsi he's got the armour scene every time it responds he's gonna be running back there to get that armor running back there to get the shotgun shells making sure that his opponent doesn't have a rocket and just keep killing them and then when he respawns you chase him down kill him again or weaken them and then these are fucking really complex multi-level games you have to think in advance and you have to plan things out and guys would even have timed things that they would put in a program so that it would show on their screen rocket launcher respawning in ten seconds nine yeah it's crazy how when this came out it was so badass and now it looks so ancient it looks weird but but go to quake what is the quake for one what is the new quake one quake tournament what is it quake champions I think it's called quake champions there's one you could play online now I think it's called quake champions Oh came out last year now watch this shit Arena that's what it is quake champions arena is that it but look at the fucking graphics now but it's the same kind of concept right say you know this this guy is playing a one-on-one against someone and there's these crazy maps bad at me it was the last time you played quake forever dude I'm terrible you gotta get back in like you're like why I'm crazy dude I'm telling you I can't do this I used to play this shit for 810 hours of dead I told you I got a team I'm starting my fucking house yeah I was problem so I prefer archery and a bunch of other things that I get addicted to but I could easily get addicted to this again yeah it's so fun look super five shooters what Oh you but you don't you just don't plan right and if we decided to do that would you come and play it here yeah of course okay well what we're thinking about doing is we have a conference room that I'm thinking about turn into a LAN party room oh cool and have it set up we'll set up quake games and then we'll maybe we host a server and let a certain amount of people online yeah and then we could have what you call deathmatch how come with daily matches like you have 10 people on a map and I'll just going crazy and you respawn with all your shit dude do that that's - but what about why don't we pick up a new one like this this fucking game useful in this game it's called battlegrounds or yeah man this is bad I don't want real physics I don't want to move around like I move around in real life that's the thing about quake is you move way quicker than you do in real right it's like you're bouncing and jumping you're hitting trampolines and flying through the air oh man this game looks pretty cool if you people that's oh I think you'd like fun people you're hiding someone false and I'm not even having people brother I mean aliens that can move faster than people with rocket launch dude and by those who quake what about hearthstone Joe why don't you start playing hearthstone you want me to cast spells like you yeah naked overwatch things that's a little bit more that's game yeah over watches that's a third-person thing this is the what I was explaining the overwatch League this is the viewing of it yeah but I like watching things through someone's eyes that's there you go yeah first place this is great this looks great yeah this is team base you should do we should have an overwatch League I suck at it you know it's good at it as Pemberton you can get pepper garlic just look at them so is this something that you play with a PC or is this a net okay I know you can't play xbox games once you play with a mouse and a keyboard that controller is just so wide they're supposed to be making an update soon so you can do that actually mouse and keyboard on the next box oh well that's what they should to do that Blizzard is set they're so badass years ago there's still a thing like Xbox has said recently they would allow people to play against people on Playstations Network yeah Sony doesn't want to play friends with them that's well see the thing about computers is when you have a mouse and a keyboard you just have so much more precision guys get really good and they also have like auto aiming yeah it keeps you in the box when you're using those theta vics they've made it a little bit better so those little hand controllers are more accurate than they used to be but man it ain't the same when you're when you have a mouse and keyboard like if you watch that guy google fatality and the the I and fatality was a number one this guy would hit people with a rail gun in the middle of the air so often it was almost like he was psychic crazy and you would watch him playing you watched through his eyes and you realized how bad you are at the game and that was part of the reason why I got so addictive made it to number one on that new game I was talking about he did yeah that's what sort of twitch channel says right here it's not stream listen play yeah that's him he's a savage I met that kid in Vegas very nice car it's not kid anymore I'm sure he's in his defense 30s now I think this is a long last time ago that he was running quake unless he was six there he is his dad got dad bought got a fucking golf shirt on just drop his kids off this is like such a better future than I predicted when I was a kid like I never imagined that we would be able to watch people play video games with it that you could make career out of playing not just a career but make more in a month than lawyers making it yeah yeah some are out these people are all painting and playing music and stuff alright we're gonna do it and we're gonna also do pool on it right I'm gonna set that shit on hey we got plans technolon we did this techno hunt thing have you seen the techno hunt game yet only are you you like posting on an Enzo yeah I want to I want to check it out there we have thing live there's 40,000 people watching and we're shooting arrows at this screen and then it's been downloaded like 300,000 times in the first 24 hours what's the ETA on this man like when are you gonna fully turn this into like a video gaming compound because it's really exposing on it we're closing in on but the tech don't thing what's fascinating about that is you use a regular bow so it's real product it's like real-world practicum though yeah like a real compound bow yeah you're not supposed to use a powerful one supposed to keep it down to 70 pounds you can't jack it up like mine is jacked up to 84 pounds but I tried to 84 pound one that didn't break it so we'll see I'm excited man I love this compound it's crazy yeah I can't wait to see what you do with it it's like you're just barely growing it right now yeah like well any suggestions you have man and if you want to do something here we could do anything you want this if you have an idea hey I like the video game idea man let's do it the idea of having some kind of like twitch laboratory here is pretty cool yeah that's exciting let's do it so you heard it folks Duncan Trussell Zinn for the twitch League Dondon I suck at these
