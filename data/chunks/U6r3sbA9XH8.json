drunk gonna fight Tony Perkis why not it's nip just bro it's too much height and Tony Ferguson don't give a fuck he's a monster back stage again fucking farted there's a horrible telling me it's only just a message it's a tremendous Ferrell sikozu oh look at this they are go ahead fuck please guys get some volume on that we get volume on that what back there I hear this go all the way back way back here we go crank it up he's setting it up she's setting up for one Sharpie belt Oh see there's eight guys that guys yourselves like a woman with that phone whoa the helix crazy is gone about missed ten guys my right look how drain Tyron looks yeah it's here let's ever wondered again what we wanna we wanna shh shh what's up we need your assistance you hear that lady - I said what's up any staircar i said what's up he said not much but meanwhile you look at tyrunt tyrunt looks so drain there when he made that wait it's like right after you made the way I'll do it's crazy I was an officer in that fight he's only go for three fucking god damn only nobody ever saw this shit he doesn't want he's not gonna fight Ferguson because it's a fucking it's a Aerosmith Guns & Roses was Aerosmith on steroids and Tony Ferguson is little Diaz with fucking out blood in them you understand me he don't wanna you don't want Tony Ferguson and Dana it's not a job in Jungle John Uncle Bobby Dana is not gonna let isn't his nephew fight I'll be okay getting Conor versus Tony is not a draw it's not a job for Conor I know he's your guy that's a big fucking fight make totally all right that's it even Soul Reaper this could be a fucking fun I don't why didn't you think they're making it Eddie you tell me why do you think they make it it's not gonna sell and I love these guys don't give me I'm not I'm not clowning your guy but as far as the average consumer buying a pay-per-view that's not a sell it's just not hell yeah it is I just gotta fighting any money sale deciding a top challenger is always a sale until comment but Tony Fergus is most certainly a top challenger when Nate Diaz fought Conor for the first time was a giant fight because Nate Diaz had a name and he's a bit he's a bigger name than Tony arguably for sure not even close much bigger now after he beat afford the Diaz brothers and Tony wasn't the same as it is rather it's a different news whether it's a different thing now but but he had it because of Nick and Nick had had all the Strikeforce success Elite XC success you know all that is a lot of TV time there's the Ultimate Fighter winner Nate and then on top of that Nick had just got done beating Anderson or fighting Anderson rather and you know Nick Nick is like a pretty well-known figure right these brother they're both the Diaz brothers are like so that's a different level but having them take that fight on short notice to but Connor was the main draws my point congressman Donovan idea but this isn't because I agree it's he's the main draw if you're calling you're his manager he going let's fight Tony who's a tough fucking matchup but he's not as big as the name as a guy like Nate Diaz at 55 who we're gonna make more money maybe not as tough as a fight bigger name so they're doing it from a business point and he's not fighting you I'm not fighting could be you also have to fight in a normal fight for they're gonna do a Russia card and when they do a Russia card they want to do a rush card with Conor or with heavy rather so when they do a Russia card with Habib it's most likely gonna be for a title I would imagine so no time it all depends if Connor accepts it remember another house on all the Pete Tony and in my current interim and apparently they offered it to Tony and Tony said that you want to make the same amount of money that Habib makes which is perfectly funds first fine but you know they said nope you got a contract you gotta honor your contract that's at least how it's been explained yes that's that's being explaining to go no well you sign these contracts you gotta honor the contract yeah but that that that only works one way the only works for the UFC because they don't honor all the contracts do they write me if it works but they can cut them digging you have a six like contract right lost too but that seems gonna cut it's in the contract that you can get cut if it wasn't in the contract there's guys who fought and they fought out their entire contract for sure right I'm just saying Pedro hit once remember in the early days and Pedro his I had this giant contract because they thought the Pedro is gonna be the heavyweight champ and so they were giving him like undercard fight so he's making quarter of a million dollars yeah yeah it's tricky man because I get the idea that they would want to protect Conor um you know and really set up the big-money fights especially now cuz he's the biggest guy but then you got Connor who's kind of fuckin crazy and like what the way he does of John down Tyrone I don't think it's Connor doing I think it's from from a business standpoint they're going what's the biggest fight pot let's say you have three fights left who are the three biggest names we can fight and to make this happen so I stay on the field big and make the most money he might not be on defeat and he's definitely not undefeated now right but the biggest thing is the Woodley fight because that's a 17.7 that's a third bout guys that's a fight and you didn't say your shave on much control Eamon you mother as if you didn't see it number two listen I'm not saying the khabib is gonna be Connor especially after I don't like to take the punch on Michael Connor I'm not saying Michaels Michael Johnson but the fight is could be and then the next fight has to be Ferguson if he beats him that's the way it is when I cook Ferguson to me can't wait they can't wait like Ferguson needs a fight like in the next four or five months Kabhi needs a fight in the next fucking two three months I don't fight in Brooklyn and don't you forgot my daughter from now - he said Kenya when you went to view them yeah he put the hat on you understand he said you'll fight and Brooke put a hat on my head every time and every time right now it's great I fucking love wearing that and you don't say no you say he looks again shows me that I give him the knife yeah put that on like that hat any news me as a fan all I see is Tony verse could be that's that's the fight there's not a better matchup I can be made anew I don't know about that I like Tony versus Connor I even like a B versus Connor yeah I like it I like Connor versus Woodley I like that fight too that's why thank you that's the next money fight but he's gonna eventually I don't think yes he gives us enough power to do that I dig you bragging you ever get that much control power yeah he's got a little power well here's the thing about you window yourself Howard Lee loses two Bisping if he loses catchweight fight he still keeps that $170 drop that's if that catch wait I doubt that that's just beautiful mighty right what no you can't hold on to division I run against my boy I gotta go Joey I'm telling you this plan was that going after Tyler they planted the seed right there good when you can't tie it to divisions backstage of you lose all the guys exactly what happen I do don't go away from the Russian and horses as long as they can mean but specifically do what we have each other no they'll do the NASA thing when they go to interview him they die in car accidents and shit but that's the fight guys that's the fight right there that everybody wants to see right off the bat I'd love to see Connor and could be my love to see Ferguson and khabib but then I'm gonna do that they're gonna hope that they fall off a cliff from a plane goes down let's give him the money fine which is 170 can he get the third belt here's nothing can you lose if he does lose if he goes up to nothing he's tiring nothing happens yeah that's risk-free same thing with that Nate first Nate Diaz okay remember who runs this shit right you do it what you do what do you do a toning could be they go to Bellator hell no they can hit this off god they're gonna say fuck you UFC we can't take this no more hiding it from us [Music]
