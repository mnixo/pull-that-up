[Applause] no headphones I'd rather not have anything crazy no because I learned that I learned that hearing my own voice in my head makes makes me focus on it and I don't want to focus on the sound of my voice I'm pissing on oh it's it's like blowing out in my head and all this shit's going on that's smart tell me one what's up oh we're talking about whether or not you should have headphones on or not I've headphones on don't are we up no if you hearing the audio recording this what's happening is we switched to a new TriCaster we were having problems with our old one the TriCaster is the machine that allows Jamie to switch cameras and put everything up on the Internet and hopefully include Skype so we could get some people from like it in signal but there's no videos feeling hmm are we gonna restart that's okay we might have to restart folks we try and live while we're going live with some new shit but I want I want people on YouTube is it audio but no video ladies and gentlemen if you're just staring at a blank screen would you have to shut this show down to get the video back - it should work but alright just do a double camera a two-shot so you're both gonna be okay now is it live now for tech motherfucking it would suck it would suck if like we did back in half an hour it turns out none of it got picked up early we did a whole short what's going on YouTube right now for sure it just they don't see us right now he's trying to fix that ten motherfuckin dollars we were having problems with our old TriCaster crashing a lot so we got a new TriCaster but it turns out that what is it that doesn't match up what part is wrong the control panel yeah okay oh shit oh shit um what were we just talking about we're talking about material headphones headphones oh let's see yourself in the headphones I think of as though it makes me like I close out the outside world totally and I just lock in on the conversation yeah yes but if you will watch if he puts up a video would be nice to hear it you then you write then you have to put the headphones yeah I just feel like when that's on it's a cigar I pay more attention to not talking over people to can't stand the sound of my voice so here anymore thank you thank you but I can't stand the sound and I hear enough I don't need it blasting in my ears as I talk then I focus on it and then I think that's a good get depressed it's a good quality listening to it all time you know hard it is to listen to my stand-up that's very hard for everybody it's it's dead it kills me but I can but I always hear your voice you gotta listen to your shit you got to go back and edit you got to edit your shit and I'm like I don't want to listen to my self I just I want to put every every time I go up on stage behind me I don't want to go back but I know that's not the right thing to do you you get a you take a lot of time out of the development of a joke process if you just listen to ya the previous versions of it yeah because like I have this new bit that I'm doing right now and I have like three different versions of it and it's not right now it's very shaky it's very shaky it goes one way it goes the other way sometimes it gets big laughs sometimes it's just it's just clunky and I've got to figure out which one is the right formula so the only way to do that really is to listen to how I did it right and then play it back and then write it out I'll listen to how I said it then I'll write it out and then I'll think about like what would I would be thinking if I was sitting there listening to this or someone was saying this you know what I anticipate what they're saying what the punchlines are gonna be beforehand because if you do that takes a lot out of it you know it's got to find a way to sneak it in you got to find a way to make it where it really relates reportage there ever have an old bit that you like an old one from like 10-15 years ago that you think like damn I should have added that you know you're having shit to it today oh yeah man if you kept going that's like the argument like already had a good point about that he was like if you just keep adding to your bits and making them better and that's why you don't want to release this special you could have used that same creativity to come up with new bits instead of doing the same old bits for ten years yeah I could have used that you know because there's some guys that think that like if you got those old old old bits there's samurai swords man they've just been handed down and polished tight yeah yes they have this rhythm to me like Jesus Christ like I remember I did I did a special once and I ran I didn't have like hardly any new material and so there's like 2009 inch or something like that so I did some of my old old shit from like 1999 tiger bit no no it was some other stuff what I didn't I didn't do that bit when I retired that bit I retired that but it's over but uh but I remember thinking damn these are these old ten-year old bits and I had for like literally ten years before I did my first recording yeah I started in 88 and I recorded in like 99 so almost 11 years for actually recording anything they're so tight cuz I had been I'd never done them on anything if I could do them all the time yeah I do them on the road or just they were just like you just yep yeah yeah you learn how to that path yeah your goat cheese you got yeah like a fucking ninja it's unconscious yeah yeah I love your description of it you talked about tying your shoes like you know how many tires shoes you don't think this loops going in here and this is going here and then I'm gonna bring it here you just yep you wouldn't even be able to you couldn't even teach it to someone over the phone me over the phone and be like I got to do it a few times first and figure out what the hell I'm doing cuz I don't even know what I'm doing I have no idea what I'm gonna want to tell my shoes and I'd do it every day yeah my son when he learned to tie his shoes like maybe six months ago it was he never wanted to he's like he wants to do everything he wants to decide where we eat every day but he doesn't want to tie his own shoelaces so um we finally made him he's you know and he was how he was struggling with him I used that as an opportunity to to show him how you could master anything anything that you're having trouble with go look right now you're having trouble that you could do it he could do it but he struggles so one day you're gonna do it like Daddy look how daddy does it I'm not even looking at my shoes look and I do it isn't that crazy I'll do it again look my other shoe and I do it he's like whoa did you do that Daddy that's like magic and I go I go you can do it to watch one day you're gonna do it and you're not even gonna look so like the next day he's trying not to look like Daddy I'm not looking look that wrote that then now I could use that that whole story that he won't forget ago remember that number when you had trouble tying your shoes and remember how good you get look how you are now this is the same thing whether it's gymnastics or breakdancing or jujitsu or Marathi whatever we do it it's the same exact thing your body is magic you just gotta tell it a thousand times and then it finally listens and will do it itself I thought about that today not today like now look if someone if I had to learn today how to do like a 360 roundhouse kick yeah at 50 years old but when I do it just like done my whole life yeah you know it's like dance and your bits like you were talking about like like bits that you've been like you're Noah's Ark bit was so goddamn Tychus we were on the you know back back in the day we were on the you know if you went on the road I hung out with you I went on the road and you know ever if you weren't on the road we were at the comedy store every weekend you weren't on the road so I saw your your act over and over and over to the point where I wasn't listening to the jokes no more I was listening to the audience reaction that was what was entertaining I got to sit through another hour of your shit so for me I I started being entertained by the audience like which jokes work and and it's very fascinating when you know there's women out there that go out there and they had to drag their husband out he didn't want to go out he wanted a stance cuz I mean you never take me out and she dragged him out he spent a lot of money they're buying money they're buying drinks she wants to make sure that they have a great time so there's always like ten of those wives to drag their husbands out and they just want to laugh so it's they're laughing at stuff that isn't the punchline and you you you uh there were so many things that you would say that just just the way you said them it wasn't it wasn't the the joke at all but there'd be like four chicks for just laughs and they're like ready to laugh you know yeah well people that love stand-up comedy you definitely get into like certain rhythms but then you it's like everything else right like you you like one level of comedy like one kind of comedy but then you see a bunch of comedians and then the original stuff that you liked you think sucks oh yeah I used to think comic view was the funniest yeah I was obsessed with cock my whole life was all about music but my two side things were fighting I loved boxing ever since I was a kid I was a huge gigantic boxing fan then I got into the UFC but oh and then comedy it was all I taped all I taped at home on my VCR was comedy specials and Tuesday night fights any kind of boxing it was just comedy fight comedy and fights were my hobby and music was the goal that was my life I taped comm anytime comicview was on that which one comicview it was all black is that B et yes yes is that the one that deals usually used - host yeah okay and you know you know live at the Apollo yeah the def Comedy Jam yeah I was on the biggest fan of black comedy the biggest fan I mean you know you know and then you look back at like some of those those stand-ups after hanging out with you though it all I started going oh shit okay that's low that hold a lot of those guys are low level well it's just there's there's premises that just get you know there's there's guys like out there like Bill burr or you know dave chappelle the real high-level guys that are seeing things and then they're commenting on things and they're pointing things out that maybe other people didn't notice then there's other people that are doing bits because they know other people have done bits on that subject successfully so it's not totally stealing but they're not really being creative they're just like trying to recreate some Matt there's a few guys that do that like you you hear them and you go man you know that Bill Hicks did a bit about that like you know that this guy did a bit about that like I see what you're doing like you're trying to like read like you don't have your own original point a lot of those shows were like that they were just trying to make it because it was the comedy boom man well you're talking about was like there was a comedy TV boom that included evening at The Improv mtv half-hour comedy our spotlight spotlight live on vh1 some Friday night thing they had on Fox that used to be at the Laugh Factory they said yeah the show yeah it was crazy there was so much comedy man it was out of control but there was a lot of guys that just didn't belong in the business yet I mean I couldn't say they couldn't eventually have broke but they were basically like did you ever notice hey like there's a lot of those fucking guys where they would like hey and there's goddamn Wild Kingdom playing out in my living room they had this like comedy rhythm that they would do but they didn't have shit to say but still work a lot of those guys were doing comedy to get it a sitcom they weren't jobs they didn't really want to do comment exactly exactly exactly they thought it'd be easier if they did it that way well there was a lot of actors that I talked to about it they're like hey Matt for me it's real hard to get auditions and he goes in for the longest time I'd sit around and watch you guys get development deals and I'd be like fucked out these guys don't even act and then I realize like why am i complaining and why just do what they do how hard could it be yeah it's hard dude Sam Triple E did a special last week at the Viper Room in Hollywood man and we've known Sam forever I don't know I've known for 15 years or something like that maybe longer damn dude goddamn this is how I'm special I it was just for special you know it took him you know ten years to get his shit together but holy fuck that hour slammed beautiful she's is a viper keep washes that's a great place to film a special yeah man it was he I stayed for both shows he did you know when you film you do too you know just in case something goes wrong yeah and he would do some stuff to it was weird I have I've never seen a comic before he fuck up a bit go wait a min let's do that one again and then started just wanted to make sure it was perfect because the response was so great that he was just on stage he couldn't even believe it he couldn't everybody was dying in Edwards was that beautiful yeah it was he it was really good to see him blossom I think that you know based on the Netflix specials that I see on average three minutes at a time dude they're just putting out comedy specials left and right by random dudes you never heard of and a lot of a lot of a lot of super vanilla Netflix comedy specials vanilla like they're not going beep beep there's a little bit of that going on and there's also I think people need to film more shows I think they're just filming one show sometimes sometimes too I really think if you can forty you should do for Ricky Gervais is his new one I was never a giant fan of his never really paid attention to him like Ricky Gervais didn't he do like cartoons or something like that his new special Netflix that one is a Grand Slam he's fucking oh yeah bells oh yeah yeah how about the one in the belly room how about I mean I was there for the other one do you remember how we ended that shit basically telling people exactly why he went to Africa that's pretty crazy that took balls yeah it's dangerous shit he's fuck I mean cat Willy he's doing a special is pretty good too I didn't like that one as much but I didn't like it as much as I liked this other one he spent like a but the first 20 minutes on Jacksonville because that's where he filmed it and I thought you know okay I see what he's doing but he had some I thought he had some pretty good stuff sitting that you know all the crazy stuff he went through I thought maybe he'll never be back and he's just gonna be like insane or whatever but he did he did come back and he is I'm a big fan of this old stuff some of the best oh my god come on yes Katt Williams Katt Williams was uh is one of the guys that if I'm just I don't have shit to listen to in my car I just put youtube and just Katt Williams just some random bit if I don't have anything to go he's like he's a go to yeah he's a go to for sure it's a good time man good time yeah now the comedy stores un-fuckin'-believable it's nothing like we used to hang out there everyday in the early 2000 2000 2001 before tenth planet was even a thought yeah my life consisted of DJing at strip clubs for money at home trying to make it you know in music and hanging out with you doing comedy it's crazy that was crazy me think about that place was always half empty yes it was it was like a dying dinosaur it was ready to go and shit was ready to go and then when you had that man see a shit and you laugh man that the place was it was like how is it surviving like right there on sunset such prime that's a prime spot you could put a giant hotel there how's that place not gonna get knocked down and then when you came back I remember asking you a couple times in that seven-year absence or whatever it was going do you ever gonna go back to the comedy store cuz I wanted you to go back and you were like fuck dad I'm coming back you were like really like you know you felt like you got really screwed by them and you did those motherfuckers turning their back on you at The Comedy Store took that dude side and then looking back they know they made a big mistake so you were like you're standing you're goddamn growing fuck that I'll go to the Ice House so I'll go to improv fuck the Congress tour and then you came back man and it's in it's like a different world literally a different world like it's fucking booming it's selling out every goddamn night both rooms are packed it's like it's like it's unbelievable quiet it's like you couldn't nobody would believe that shit it's so alive at the Comedy Store people just go there like during the week like it's a big event a nights Tuesday Tuesday night sometimes they have two sold-out shows the main room and the original the comedy chaos Tuesdays yeah that father's never been like that with those but they opened up all those those old decrepit rooms like and made a bar like they're opening up everything there's all that bar that used to be a video room that back bar is the best you can get away from people and chill out back there yeah that shit wasn't around back editor now the whole smoking corridor in the back now - yeah everybody goes out back and outside the outside bar move in there's always people there drinking it's it's crazy weird right the hump bar is always mobbed yeah and then across the street House of Blues they knock that shit down I would when you walk outside and you go up that ramp you know with that ramp is in the parking lot next door that views insane yeah the view is incredible like they have the best view in the world comedy stores like it's like Guns and Roses ma'am big and the fucking 80s disappeared for 20 fuckin year 25 years and now Guns and Roses not only made a comeback but they're bigger than ever yeah they're bigger than ever Guns N'Roses unbelievable everywhere they play there's just sell it out and it's an it's I saw him in Mexico City and got completely blown away like Mexico City we there for seminar I was there for Tony's fight incredible and I was never a giant Guns & Roses fan I respected them I like their songs and shit but you know as a kid once one of your friends claims them as their favorite now they can't be your favorite so it's like some stupid shit but some stupid shit like my friend Matt he claimed guns and roses I'm like okay because we wouldn't if he bought a Guns and Roses record I would just tape it I wouldn't buy it - so whoever actually owned that the master you know what I mean that was their band you know to me fuck you that's my dad it's like a sport it really yeah but you have a bunch of teams at yours my band was kiss cuz I even when everyone made fun of him I'm the only one who admitted they still liked him for a while yeah we get like that would boxers too no with boxing was different it was boxing is all racist it's completely racist and it's okay it's boxing only sport it's the only sport is a black guy well Jenna biggest bummer Jenna it was Donald Curry getting knocked out by Mike McHale Mike time if Mike Tyson fought when Mike Tyson fought Gerry Cooney Oh every white guy was Larry Oh what white guy didn't Mike Tyson what bunch of white guys but not anybody famous no not really anybody well Galata foolish guy who was your Galan that's right that's right but does he count swype yeah okay he's from Poland lot of these pretty sometimes European whites yeah and we don't think of them as animals yeah definitely yeah yeah Russians are always gonna go for the Russian guy yeah so boxing is the only one like I didn't give a fuck who the Mexican was fighting I'm going for the Mexican even if I didn't know the Mexican I already had love for him yeah he wasn't Mexican and he was Panamanian that's good enough right if he was Argentinian you know Juan Roldan remember him I mean if he's fighting a Mexican I'm going for the Mexican but if he's fighting a white guy or a black guy I'm always going for the Latin guy that's the only stir or you could be totally racist my best friend was black growing up and we we both watch boxing together and he always went for the black guy I always went for the Latin guy and it was like it was okay there was no wrong that whoo there was another Argentinian champion that was champion before Marvin Hagler goddamn it it's at the tip of my tongue I cannot remember his I was into Pipino Cuevas Alexis Arguello as long as that were Latin there were Mexican to me he was right before Marvin Hagler goddamn it I see him I see his curly hair a handsome looking fellow Carlos Monzon thank God Jamie's gonna pull it up before I can remember Mon zone was a bad motherfucker wasn't he from Argentina he was beautiful yeah he was a tough guy man there was uh those are the blood and guts days of boxing you know Roberto Duran Ken Buchanan it lightweight 135 pound killers there's a different world back then man those guys were tough as shit 15 round fights comedies different though I always what I was always there was a point where I thought generally overall just black people are way funnier than white people based on stand-up comedy I'm like is this like a Richard Pryor Eddie Murphy you know yeah I really believe that and like Mexican comedians I wasn't like rooting for Paul Rodriguez like I was I didn't I don't move yeah I know some people do but I didn't I was i I was uh you know nicest against white they loved him and see him more than anything when people found out he wasn't really Mexican they were like what he's Han Dorian during a German or something yeah did he ever see Mexican onstage yes yeah he was like it was like an end Andrew Dice Clay he wasn't raised by max can be he should he should have said that he said listen this is not all this is like it's my character I'm changing I'm Carlos Mencia change Andrew Dice Clay yeah but you that's first of all that's like a character name but I'm saying like change your ethnicity maybe Carlos I just see how to put tape on my eyes and try to say this curly Joe Chan people be like what right you can't do that yeah well but if you try to claim if I try to claim German right just out of nowhere you don't know any better you never seen my 23 and well maybe you did like a borock character where can you do it German accent not Arnold Schwarzenegger that's Austrian oh okay yeah no I don't think I could probably do want to hear there are not so easy yes so like I can only do sir I can't do Trump man you can't do Trump no I can't deal at all my voice doesn't make those sounds like I'm not a good Impressionists I'm just good at the ones that I can do what is Arnold think of Trump basically we've had this conversation before it's not a bad guy he's just a guy oh that's right he's listening he's doing what everybody wants he's making billions he's fucking porn stars you married him who looks like him and fucks like he does I'm a little bit more impressed with Donald after all these scandals it backfired yes trying to go Clinton on this guy who's not trying to fuck kids so that yeah hey you know here's the thing about like Roseanne Barr they were saying that Roseanne Barr was was talking about some conspiracy theories that have been disproven this is was something because she was talking about Trump breaking up child sex rings but he really did spend a lot of time concentrating on that and having people go out and try to break up these sex rings and sex trafficking this is not something that is a conspiracy theory this is something that he's discussed many times it's also not a conspiracy that there's sex trafficking so as much as you want to discount Trump here's a problem that I have with people that are on the Left right now they're not looking at everything they're only looking at what they want to look at he's bad for the environment he's always lying he cheats on his wife he does this he does that they say all these things he does bad but when something comes up like Roseanne says I'm giving the the benefit of the doubt because he's going after sex trafficking and then it turns out all these other people's that's a conspiracy theory that's a bullshit online no he said it he's put effort into it like you got to give the guy credit because if you don't give him credit for things that he does that are important nobody's gonna listen to you when you're criticizing them either because you all you're trying to do is win you're not trying to look at the thing for what it really is yeah he's this guy in a paper he's not perfect person but he did make note on many times about wanting to break up sex trafficking rings do you know that your your kid is 20,000 times more likely to get kidnapped than to get shot or to school you that make sense yeah and 20,000 is conservative it's probably really like 70,000 cuz if you go by the numbers 800,000 to a million kids go missing every year in the United States and you look that up though that doesn't I'd never found a source for that you said that before and I looked that up and I couldn't find that it wasn't me you know what I read it online so it could be wrong it could be wrong with these things like when we say them especially we say it like right now to million people gonna listen to us or whatever the fuck it is even 100,000 kids that's more than school shirts you one of you what's my point it's more than school shootings right like what would you rather have your you know what's worse I don't know what's worse having your shot at City right look at this according to the National Center for Missing Exploited Children citing US Department of Justice report nearly eight hundred thousand children are reported missing each year that's more than two thousand a day the NCMEC says two hundred three thousand children are kidnapped each year by family members Oh family well now okay that take away that's six that leave six hundred thousand yeah that is six hundred thousand so what's worse how does having your kid cuz not because the conspiracy theory is that there's this giant international child sex trafficking network going on that is being covered up that's what's going on and if you look at Jimmy Tsavo in the UK that brought a lot of lights right saddle saddle yeah that was a terrifying so yeah so with the story with him is Jimmy Savile he's dead now he died in his 80s at in 2011 he was a super famous like Dick Clark kind of guy he was a D he was the host of pop Top of the Pops it's like if he if your band got on that show you're gonna be mega he was huge he was friends with the royal family with the Prime Minister's Margaret Thatcher Tony Blair he looks disgusting pull up Jimmy Savile does he looks like a charm look at this guy check this out but he was 2012 super super famous and you know what he would do he would raise money for hospitals and specifically psychiatric hospitals and he would bring the Queen of England he had all this power to raise millions for these hospitals these mental institutions he that's what he kids for kids so he would what he would do is he would he would do so much for these hospitals that he would put himself on the board and give himself a job there in a position and he would hang out at these hospitals there's all there's at least five there's at least five hundred people that have come forward to say they've been raped by him when there was at a five hundred people at least he worked you know he worked for the BBC super famous super he would he had Christmas dinner with Margaret Thatcher multiple times what is that red hat he's got that looks like a maggot hat right above that yeah there's a crazy guy who it turns out he was a child rapist yeah and that's the same thing with Sandusky the question dude this yes because people knew they're complicit and they did danger the mystery the mystery is how is he so tight with the prime ministers the royal family all these politicians all this shit comes out when he died because every time there would be an allegation while he was alive he would just sit them down and go what are you gonna do I'm gonna ruin your life you better drop this shit what are you gonna do you think they're gonna come after me you know many millions are given this hospital so he would just shut everything down and there was all these underground covered up allegations they did getting knighthood was a relief because it got me off the hook he was knighted right so got him off the hook he got knighted when you get knighted couldn't not arrest you any more is that what happens is it like being a president yeah there's a there's a documentary on YouTube called the ninth circle Jimmy Savile the ninth circle you find out why they covered it up why did they cover it up widen this age in DJed is it's like Dick Clark they should have just mashed him up why was it all being covered up it's fucking insane when you find out why how does he ask for dead bodies in general the butter of dead people why he loved fucking dead people where'd you hear this it's you then the night sorry the ninth circle Jesus Carly's watch that Jesus Christ it's insane it's insane when you find out when you watch that shit dude it is crazy that you like you're saying this and it sounds like like they could never impossible it sounds like it never could be possible that some giant television star that worked with children it was always helping our children could have actually been fucking them the whole time and a bunch of him hundreds of raping him and then people must have known there's no way everybody he was killing he was killing them he was killing you'd think they found all these bodies it's a box it's a big scandal in the UK all right dude Jesus Christ there's an island called Jersey Island that's owned by the Queen and look into that shit I don't even want that I don't you want to get that deep into it cuz I have a rape children as young as nine while working at BBC leaked report unveils and this is in the independent yeah how come you're not how come there's not the same kind of effort for this kind of stuff like there is what the the gun shooting the Florida school shooting why isn't there that that's not a big where it's one thing where all the deaths happen and it's deaths or deaths but I understand I'm with you I understand but I mean this is also why people don't freak out about 500,000 people dying every year because of obesity like what would you what's worse what's worse having your kid get shot at a school shooting or having that motherfucker rape your daughter and multiple times and then kill I don't think what's worse exactly yeah it's just what's scary is that that is being protected yes there's someone that either knew about it and now is trying to cover their ass because they knew about it that was that's the thing about Sandusky you know San Gus key did the same thing he was raping all these kids and the whole time he was running these programs for underprivileged children and helping all these orphaned kids you got to watch our heads man you got a lot actually got away with abusing 500 children and sex with dead bodies hanging out with the Queen dude this guy's tight with the kingdom to God and all these little kids around them you know what you want to tell you why he got why they left him alone you do you know according to the ninth circle what is the ninth so it said it's a documentary about the whole thing wild cover on cuz everybody's doing it they're all doing it he was supplying everybody with kids that's what he used the hospitals for well this is not a new theory this is not a new theory when it comes to like groups of freaks he was the pimp yeah he was supplying everybody with kids this is this is something that people have talked about like very intelligent people that I know that have talked about in in terms of like there's been stories about people that have taken politicians to like islands and shit because that's where they keep like young girls you know I know why I'm looking at you Jamie do you know what but this but someone talked to me about this and they were saying you have to understand that if you are in a group of incredibly wealthy people and you have extreme desire for extreme sexual scenarios whips and butt and you can't whatever the fuck it is you can't young girls you can't let anybody know about this so people come into these people's lives that can facilitate these things and then they developed a sort of bond of silence and this is how when this shit gets out of hand you can get a jimmy savile or you can get it Jerry Sandusky that's the other thing about Sandusky there was like this is nuts guy was not on his own like he was supplying Berg but it wasn't that one of the things that doesn't come up Sandusky Google Sandusky was supplying children to other pedophiles because that was something that was also speculated about some of the donors that were donors to his his charities were also somehow involved in molesting those kids you know what a death right is Death Ride death right no Jimmy Savile would would supply 10 15 boys to a certain politician he'd have a boat you take him out on the boat he could he couldn't afford to have any witnesses so those were always the last ride those kids would take they're called death rides this is from that same documentary ninth circle see but how do they know that for a fact you just gotta watch it and and make the conclusion yeah well I'm not I'm not now I'm not ruling he's already a shit back so you got to look at him like a prosecuting attorney not a defense lawyer he's already a shitbag he's already confirms already raping kids what's the stop of revenge killing exactly exactly yeah I mean that's a good point because if you're the type of person that could rape a child what can't you do yeah and that's what I'm saying right yeah in in the UK the numbers could be wrong but I heard that every three seconds a child is reported missing in the UK ever that's 175 thousand kids a year get reported missing in the in just the UK it's a big business man it's gotta be more than that it's a jackings in a year isn't it every three seconds at 175 thousand that seems low every three minutes I'm so everything not everything seconds I'm sorry I'm sorry every three minutes every three minutes this is according to something I saw 31 million seconds in the day yeah yeah I'm sure the numbers are probably uh 100 175 thousand isn't as big as 800,000 a year but damn that's that should be you think about all this uh what we're doing for the Florida shooting and for these shootings and with that David hog guy come on man that that's what's scary is that people are buying all that stuff buying all what stuff the whole gun control propaganda you know it's so obvious it's it's it's ridiculous it's ridiculous it's really simple man it's like that they've been true you have to disarm the population and that's what they're doing inch by inch trying to disarm they used to say they used to say oh no we just want some restrictions and some background checks now they're just saying it you know they some people are saying to provoke the Second Amendment yeah they're tearing the Constitution they're tearing the Constitution those four kids those four kids there's they weren't they weren't that's not true no no that's Photoshop no it isn't yeah there's original image that that girl was tearing was like a target she said okay hard how can someone replace that image with the constant okay but they're essentially doing the same thing yeah no I know what you're saying they look first of all they're 17 they were at a school that got shot up their friends died I get it from their point of view if I was 17 I would think and also they got cameras in their face and everybody's paying attention to him and every the New York Times is interviewing on the Washington Post everyone's calling them up if I was them I'd probably doing the same thing you would probably do if you were in high school with those kids and all that shit went down I don't blame them my any stretch of the imagination I don't even blame people that are trying to revoke the Second Amendment the thing that infuriates me the most is that all people want to look at is the guns that's all they want to look at you need to look at the mental health of individuals that are willing to fucking shoot up a group of kids like why why the fuck would someone do that psychiatric medications are a big one that if you bring up people roll their eyes like oh this again there are massive changes to the fucking chemical composition of your brain when you take these things what you're capable of doing what bothers you what freaks you out what you don't give a shit about when you got all these people that are on SSRIs and antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication and over and over and over again when they test these shooters they all tests positive for something the pharmaceutical companies do not want to fucking hear about this they don't want to talk about this phil heartman my friend who got shot by his wife she was on Zoloft they got a settlement from Zoloft the family got a settlement from zoloft after she fucking shot him in the head while he was sleeping yeah this is there's a lot going on it's not just guns it is crazy that that fucked up kid could get guns it is crazy you just raised the FBI went to his house two years before but what can you do do you hear about that kid that they just stopped and China the Chinese immigrant kids they're sending back that his roommates in college were saying this fucking guy's stockpiling guns the cops went to visit him he went out bought another gun and he's talking all kinds of crazy shit and everybody's nervous about him like he's a fucking shooter wetting it ready to happen stop going to class and that's how they sent him back because he's on a student visa you can't not be class this kid was like gear and up he was gearing up and now maybe maybe they caught it before it happened and maybe they wouldn't have liked two years ago when they interviewed this the kid from parkland now the kid the strangest thing about that parkland shooting is the interview one of the teachers did on ABC that's this this doesn't make any sense to me at all it's like she said I have the video I could send it to you it's it's less than a minute she says I opened up I heard the shots opened up the door all the kids ran in they hid behind their desk and there I saw the shooter 20 feet away from me but at first I thought he was a policeman I'm like what is the police doing here he had full body armor a mask on a helmet on and was shooting I was like what is the cott what are the cops doing here that is the strangers video I've seen was it's possibly someone shooting at the kid that's not what she said she said she saw the shooter that's right but I mean how long was she watching for right if you're like looking out the window you see someone that's shooting someone or shooting a gun or even holding it down first of all you have to realize that people in those traumatic situations their memory is very fucked up it's very shaky your brains flooded with adrenaline you remember your opening a suggestion people could put things in your head and you all of a sudden think that that was a real memory that you saw there's been like scientific studies on that and about suggestive memory and about someone can literally especially during periods of great duress they can introduce ideas into your head and you will tell those ideas hours later days later as your own and you don't even realize that they put them in your head it's real weird memory in traumatic situations like gun shootouts and shit like that is haywire because you're on you're working on that reptilian part of your brain you're down to the lowest level like my friend Steve Rinella got attacked by a grizzly bear he was in a fog nak island it's a crazy podcast him and these other guys they had killed an elk and they were packing this elk out and they left the elk by the tree when they were at their camp then they wouldn't to go back and a bear claim the elk and this bear rushed him and he was like one of the ways he described to me it's like you have an idea in your head of like what like an animal instinct it's like and he goes I'm telling you this goes way deeper than that this goes wait when you really think your life is in danger you really think it's over you don't even exist anymore you're moving you have no idea what you're doing you're you're you you have to piece together what happened afterwards and you were barely there in the first place you're just gone you're gone you see somebody outside you have no fucking idea who you even are right there and then all these people do like I were to run in the building kick that fucking guy's ass you barely even know who you are you got this video oh I sent you the video the video of that people have to understand memory and then let's see if she sounds like okay so let's hear what she says no I actually sent sent you that the actual clip is not in didn't I send I sent you one right on your phone that's that's the lady but I don't know when when she's gonna say no it's just play cuz we don't hear it we're not hearing it Jamie okay when the fire alarm went off as students filed into the hallway she heard gunfire the killing had begun I was about two feet away from my door all of a sudden I heard gunshots in the stairwell which is about 20 feet away from my room and then kids were screaming and then running back towards me and towards the end of the hallway so I just went in this very strange autopilot mode where I pivoted on my feet I unlocked my door and the kids you start pouring in my room I don't know how many kids were in there but I was pulling them and getting them in and shouting at them to get in the room and then I suddenly saw the shooter about 20 feet from me standing at the end of the hallway actively shooting down the hallway just a barrage of bullets and I'm staring at him thinking why is the police here this is strange because he's in full metal garb helmet facemask bulletproof armor shooting this rifle that I've never seen before huh I don't know that sounds like someone who saw something yeah got a very good look at and yeah there's another video of a girl saying yeah we heard shots and were running through the hallway and then I run into Nicolas Cruz and I looked at him and I told him Mike isn't it weird that everyone thought this was gonna be you and then he just stood there and then we ran off because we heard more shots what that's it doesn't make any sense doesn't make any sense and that stops those videos get taken down those videos get taken but that video is not taking down they've been taking them down when they find them they take there's people actively taken down witness testimony that doesn't go with the official narrative man so you think that this is like a false flag like someone fucking shot up the school they do it all the time do they that's what they do and then they focus on it they gotta they got bad this Nicholas Cruz guy like oh we got a perfect guy so they come in they have there's a professional team they drag a Nicholas Cruz they do what they got to do they throw them in there arrest them and go we got them and then everyone buys it that's what's going on right Mike but this is a this is a crazy opinion right because you weren't there I'm at the other side of the country I'm sure but every time there's any sort of a mass event some horrible event there's always conspiracies you know because most these Scott they're like they have a what was going on right before this was the release of the FISA document and conspirator you know and what's the fuckin media was bearing that the FISA document was a document that one Trump released and got zero zero Arab play from mainstream media and it was a document that that showed that a lot of really important people in government from all the agencies were all colluding together to take down Trump and there's text messages and emails that going back and forth week Hollywood with using Hollywood so there's just so FISA document was about to get dropped and everyone was saying wait what they're backed into a corner they're gonna pull something off watch here it comes they're gonna pull out there's gonna be a booting or something wait for it here it comes and then BOOM so as soon as it happened the reason why conspiracy theorists were gone that's it and look at all the mistakes look at look at all the testimonies it doesn't make any sense that they're ignoring like that the thing that the thing that gets me is it there's so many fuck-ups in that shooting as a false flag were like all these these witness tests the witness testimony that doesn't make any sense that to me I think they did it on purpose to keep all the conspiracy theorists busy because if there's so much shit that's keep to keep everyone away that doesn't make any sense to keep everybody away from the FISA document you know what it's also possible the people that were at that shooting their memories all fucked up because there was somebody shooting people that's a real thing like that's a hundred percent she sounded like she didn't know she was talking sounds like it then but that wasn't when the shooting was going down yeah you got to see people when you see people like right when they've seen some shit their brain scrambled yeah that's something they have to take into consideration especially some nice lady probably never saw anybody get shot in their life probably never saw much violence yeah maybe maybe I don't know there's two sides of it things right there's people that believe the official story and then there's people that see it as oh this was the false flag to distract from the FISA document Melissa I'm not saying that false flags don't exist I mean you and I just discussed on this podcast in great detail there were most important false flag operation Northwest yeah they're willing to do that they're willing to do anything it's not that this is also the problem when we say they operation Northwoods was 1962 the question is if that's how they did business back then which is what they did I mean operation Northwoods they were planning on attacking Guantanamo Bay with Cuban armed Cuban friendlies have the metallic Guantanamo Bay they've been sacrificed American lives they were gonna blow up a drone jetliner blaming on the Cubans all this was to to get us enthusiastic about going to war with Cuba yeah they were going to sacrifice American lives this is a hundred percent they were gonna lie and think she's normal which is normal for empires for our countries this is just a normal false flags are it's nothing new it's been going on since the dawn of time right father likes it that's it's it's old-school shit the question is and this is for the rational person who's like this is ridiculous you have to wonder is that evolved right everything evolves the the the the way we use technology evolves the way we use literature evolves the way we use TV evolved everything evolves does that evil corruption in government evolve too or does it just somehow another gets snuffed out because of the light I don't buy that I don't buy that if you look at all the different things that we've shown that there's collusion in just look at the fact that someone like Hillary Clinton can run for president while she was making hundreds of thousands of dollars giving speeches to banks like when she was in that debate with Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders like released his transcripts tell us what you said tell us what you said to those nice banker people that gave you a half a million dollars or whatever the fuck they gave you like that's insane to think that someone's like listen dude she is so fucking entertaining we're gonna give her two hundred fifty thousand dollars for an hour it's worth it trust me I know we're in the banking business and I know we make money with money you know I mean we're all about money we know the value of money we're in the banking business this lady talking is worth a quarter million dollars it's the best she's gonna go up there she's gonna knock your socks off so good she's amazing she's funny she's hilarious how much she's amazing her speech is super well so weird and she stands up there on the podium and just knocks your fuckin dick into the dirt is this Hillary Clinton gets humiliating 7,000 dollars less than Snooki for a speech at Rutgers as her story grows old Wow so she got she got a price / to $25,000 I think they're gonna throw her under the bus her standard fee was two hundred thousand dollars per speech but some folks suggest that it may be her broken record that set the recent slash price of twenty five thousand on the Clinton Foundation she's fine she's like I'll do it for a thousand dude I got fucking a hundred million from that Haiti earthquake are you get it yeah but those people people like her I think one of the things in the back of their head is always the potential litigation I think they always want to stockpile legal funds could always come after them yeah they're like you know if you had a hundred million and now you have you know 75 million oh my god down to 50 yeah we gotta pick some odd jobs and shit do some speeches in Saudi Arabia listen it should be illegal for someone to run for president if someone who they could influence in a positive way with passing things and signing legislature if we're pushing things forward using their influence if someone is in a position that they could do that for a company and that company wants and giving you two hundred thousand dollars to talk that's just fucking insane that's insane that's bribery that's about you saying that it's worth $200,000 if she sucked every dick in the room it wouldn't be worth $200,000 right there's no way who's gonna pay $1,000 for a Hillary Clinton bro job other than for the story I think she can get a lot of money for blowjobs you think so did I think fucking okay all right guys to just be fuckin going down dude busting having bukkake you know it makes you do doable God forgive this I feels this feels like a disrespectful turn we're taking with ya I'm sorry as a person forget about it as a woman just has a politician no one should be it should just be impossible there's an authority theory that Hillary Clinton's father Hugh Rodham I'm assuming he's not alive anymore was a huge Jewish mob boss who is responsible for a opium going into Chicago I don't know if that's real but it makes sense to me it looked well we know for a fact that some politicians have run drugs before blow the bushes is the biggest one the fucking Kennedys open-open flat-out I mean it was moonshine at the time but guess what that's drugs yeah that's as much of a drama worse than we it's worse way worse I mean that is how the Kennedy family made their money we needed a president to run marijuana how cool would that are not much on for President Jimmy Carter was like he was just doing he just stuck to marijuana John for president Tommy's guy he's got diversity on his side Cheech could be the running mate ha ha Cheech and Chong 2020 guys get on it have you on the podcast support if you think about all the stuff the government was willing to do over over time I'm like like you know Operation Northwoods for instance they were willing to kill their own people you know there's a lot of corruption bribery a lot of shit in the government right right if you got to equate that to one person you could say the US government is kind of like John Gotti right right right kind of right a little bit a little bit that killed some people for some people that they've crossed a lot of yeah a lot of scamming going on a lot of stealing he's gone he's kind of like a politician he's kind of like the overall you know how could anybody trust anything he would say right yeah and anytime someone would say a dude like a some John Gotti nerd came up because dude you know he killed 15 people one night in Miami you wouldn't go did where's the proof where's the proof show me you wouldn't say that you would go you believe in an even if it wasn't true he's like it's still a douchebag he's still a criminal he's still killing people so yeah you were wrong about that I was actually you know trafficante and it wasn't you know but still you know what I mean people just naturally when it comes to the government they know how corrupt they are they know that they're willing to kill their own people they know the politicians aren't waking up going home I gonna make everyone's lives better so all those speeches you hear you know them trying to like hell they're not thinking about helping they're thinking about keeping keeping their power they're the criminals that's what's going on so well they're in a business and this business has criminal rules they've allowed them to have these criminals it's all about how can every politician that they're all trying to get ahold of that that tax money oh that's the that's the the endgame right there you get that tax money you're never you you could steal tax money and people we're never gonna come after you you still corporation money you're gonna die come up with something anything just anything okay what were we this bills to to build churches and we're gonna help children around the world and we're gonna find a cure for leukemia that fuck yeah cool boom it's really easy you just got to make up some shit you got to pretend that you to help people oh this one's the Affordable Housing Act you know we can help out more people like that politicians really trying to help what they're trying to do is rip off tax money that's it's all there allocate it move it move it to the people that they want to have it - yeah it's uh it's a dirty business I'm hoping that a change in the few I I think the way we are being programmed and doctrine ated I think it's genius it's working so goddamn well because it works on really smart people there's intelligent people all over the guys that we're invested in the system everybody's invested in this the indoctrination that the school system man you know school really is like designed to get your take the kids from the family like the kids believe their teachers more than their own parents and then it the state takes your key there they're raising their kids yeah it's it's ridiculous man I think most of what's going on in schools is not that I think most of it is people that are just totally apathetic about teaching people they don't give a fuck most of these people that are teaching they're doing it as a job there's a lot of terrible fucking teachers out there and they don't get paid anything and that's not they're taught and told how to teach and what to do they're not like okay just give us your own version push together with educators they get together to try to figure out a way to get people to learn these things but it's uninspired that's more more than anything because there's no money to the conspiracy theory is that the Rockefeller John Rockefeller and Carnegie designed the school system to create slaves and to separate the family what's the consumers career the conspiracy theories they designed to create workers right people that slaves to the conspiracy theories they openly said we don't we don't need any more philosophers or geniuses we got enough for that we got that and go we got science right here we got genocide you need come to us like what was the last what was the last science grade scientific discovery like in the last 40 years that wasn't government-funded like there's there's no what what there who's funding these studies why do you think that they're government-funded like some new shit they come out with I I don't know see I don't know yeah I don't know that no one can name anything well I don't know what I mean we'd have to go over some of the styles but I'm sure alive them on our government I'm assuming that most scientists are getting paychecks from the government I'm just assuming that I'm just I'm assuming that most scientific data is not it's coming from a bunch of scientists who yeah they're getting grants and they can't say crazy shit they got it and they're you know I sent you that one email that one guy was telling me that there he worked for a team of scientists and they're working for a pesticide company and they're told to they go we're gonna do some studies here and we wanted to look like this and let's keep doing it doing the studies until boom we get oh that's like well they can do that yeah they keep doing study until they get the results they want and then they don't publish the bad studies only publish the good studies and this is what they have done it seems like there's basically in a nutshell like three kinds of science there's there's the science it's like it's a pretend science but for sure it's not real it's false science pseudoscience and then there's the scientific facts like for sure it's not like it's a scientific fact that I can get on the internet with my iPhone I don't need to read of study about it and say oh I can actually can I know it my friends know it that's a scientific fact another scientific fact is my car will take me to point A to point B to Point C over and over and it may break down every now and then that's a fact that's us the science of my car I believe that sometimes that's scientific fact and then there's a science that you you you have to take the scientists word for because there's no way that you can verify that if you have to take you have to have faith in science that's like a religion what are you talking about like what makes any kind of any kind of science whether it's medical science if you out you have it you have a choice to believe in science that you can't verify yourself you could believe it you but you'll have to believe it say the experts in the field verify it all the people that we all the science that we know that so have been has been corrupted just the big ones sugar science a tobacco science marijuana science that in science we know for sure I'll just those four that there's been a lot of corruption and so it's hard to trust so when someone comes out and especially the government and goes yeah our scientists scientists say that it's safe and effective you gotta be like damn I don't know about that I'm not gonna just take your fucking word for it you wanna mean you guys are criminals you're John Gotti and you guys are saying you guys are saying that this is safe and effective I don't know about that you know maybe it is I hope it is but I don't know I don't know cuz I can't prove it for myself oftentimes drugs that get passed as being safe and they turn out to not be exactly the problem with these studies exactly this is like what we were talking about earlier with that nobody wants to discuss the idea that psychotropic drugs have played a part in school shootings this is all a very recent thing with human beings if there's reasons like but they're talking about the recent spike in shootings even wet by people they know were mass shooters those people are almost all on these pills but this these pills are very really big talking about yeah so when you're talking about just the history of human beings involved in mass killings it's really reset the brain is ramping up its going crazy yeah well you know what also is ramping up people taking pills yeah these things are somehow our new people they might not be the cause of it a hundred percent it might be Society it might be suppression it might be terrible childhood rearing it might be a childhood abuse it might be all sorts of like mental health issues that are inherited all sorts of crazy diseases that people inherit mental diseases in the vaccine pamphlets there's I think the HPV vaccine bit like girls are taking it at 11 and 12 man the shit that it says in the passenger's 1 there's no one set possible side effect is suicidal thoughts wanting to it's called in one it's called impending doom what's not touched take your pills last night that documentary on Netflix that's been going around how is it it's pretty good it's all it's not a lot of a lot of snot the adderall one is really it is yeah it is yeah so there's not a lot of information we don't already know I feel like they just kind of compile it and make it look really good but one interesting thing that you just brought up doctor says in it there's no side effects to pills there's just unintended benefits or non benefits that you want they're all effects there's no like side effect of like area for instance it's an effect of the pill just wasn't what you wanted I see what you're saying so if side effect an effect right right so if you take something and on some people it gives suicidal thoughts it's not a side effect he's just ineffective taken out yeah there's people there's there's girls wanting to kill themselves for taking the HPV that's just that for taking acting medication accutane is home for that a lot I know do you know Andrew Santino hilarious comedian no funny motherfucker he took a cue team when he was in high school so what he said said it was like the best thing that ever happened to him because his face totally cleared up but the worst thing that ever happened to him terms of like how it made him feel like it just it makes you feel a lot of people get it and they get suicidal thoughts yeah for sure see so you gotta ask yourself you know even if weather weather weather kids really are shooting up schools or it's a false flag and they're setting up the kids to do it well that's the other side whatever they whatever the truth is there there's a gigantic problem with these pills that are making people crazy and no one really this is not a big push to stop it or anything well then protect it there are but all there's a giant business and and there's billions of dollars sure but there's also a lot of people that like those pills there's a lot of people that love xanax like this is again this is one of those things where we always want to look at the bad side of it a lot of people love crack - mmm crack business you guys you could get thrown in jail for that ya know for sure but I mean people that are functional people just how you like weed I like weed some people like xanax I'm not saying you can't have that it's not my opinion that's not that's not how I feel what I am saying is like we need to be honest about the consequences of all these things and that this is somehow another left out of the equation one I think it's a major part of the equation I don't think it's the only reason why people are shooting up schools or any of this shit but I think it absolutely must be playing a factor and for whatever reason people don't want to consider that factor and I think some of it is because there's a lot of people out there who like those pills they like the way they feel on antidepressants they like the way they feel on anti-anxiety medication they like take an ambien before they go to bed they don't want to hear they like what it gives them I know people who can't sleep without ambient they can't sleep without it if you tried telling them that ambien fuck's up your heart rate or does this to that or need to make up some things I don't know who fucks up your heart rate I'm just saying that if you start saying that to people they would they would just immediately tune out whatever dude I'm sleeping like a baby you know it'd be a great false flag is if they set up another shooter and just said he was totally stoned you know that way they could reverse reverse the this nobody legalization of weed of course to choke do you know what I what would I start it smell nobody but change how they have the power in the media tent turn it into that like all of a sudden these guys are getting really high in Colorado and in California we need it we need a it's a joke it's not funny I wouldn't work today I've been smoking blunts you know like I smoked them I was like okay now I understand rap music like it was like these rappers are so aggressive but they're also hi I'm like what the fuck's going on it's the goddamn tobacco tobacco mixed in with weed that is a different thing that's a different animal it's a little too potent sometimes it's a little too woo like you're like like what are we talking about I like it every day on then every now and I like it I'm like you know what it gives you a different kind of head buzz well I don't Cerrone he got me on the dip when oh no he was not not haven't done since then but when we were in the podcast I did and I swallowed some of it and but one thing I liked about I was like oh now I get why you guys do it it's like it hypes you up it gets you kind of like elevated you know it's like it you ever smoked a cigar maybe two it's a powerful version of a cigarette you're getting some serious fucking nicotine your system and you smell her fat stogie you got a big old fucking hoyo de monterrey double Corona and you're Fidel Castro style by the time you get to the end of that thing your high is fuck dude you're not high like you can't talk or like you can't walk or you can't function but you're definitely feeling that tobacco you feel it's it's doing something to your system and they say it actually has a cognitive enhancing function that's similar to nootropics and coffee as well that like it actually can make you perform better in tests if you smoke cigarettes are a few smoked a cigar and writers always say that like I know a lot of people who write like writers for sitcoms and stuff like that those guys always smoke cigarettes when they write they say they can't write without smoking Stephen King said that it's like their weed yeah well it does have something going on man but it's instead of like it's not a it's to me it's more like amped than it is creative weed is super creative weed makes me think of thoughts where I write them down am i I can't even claim that that's not even my thought that that's weeds thought you know I mean yeah like I would have never just leave me by myself with no drugs and a notebook I would have never come up with that idea but the weeds like hey man listen to this but you know the weed weed is way more of a like an idea steroid I believe it till I see people who don't smoke weed and they write I'm like who you're so brave out there out there with no helmet you got no life preserver on and now it's crazy legal everywhere this sizing this recreational weed in California it's it's insane you just walk nine states now yeah crazy I think 18 states have leaked illegal medical and nine states have legal recreational nasa chooses mass yeah it's a wave it's going across all the whole country it's changing everything and it's good and you know what the next wave is MDMA MDMA therapy for PTSD patients has unprecedented results really Maps is involved in this what is it multiple multiple disciplinary Association for psychedelic studies or something like that Maps is amazing really above board organization that is at the forefront of legalization of psychedelics and of psychedelic research and they've been involved in studies with soldiers and they they have amazing results with this stuff MDMA just lets you forgive yourself and lets you forget everything let's it reprograms your brain it reprogram lets you forgive other people in your life it changes it get one hit of MDM MDMA I thought it was confused to me Molly it's a lot easier one hit can change your taste in music forever for ever I believe because before I ever did it the first time I did it was 1997 and before that I was a DJ at this point and I couldn't stand techno I hated techno music so much and I was a DJ and any time a girl went on saying she's a techno groan like this is cuz I I play drums for real so when you listen to techno or house it's like it that's the the most basic gumption every song every fucking drumbeat the same I couldn't accept it as a musician and most musicians feel that way about techno and I went to a birthday party at the Key Club in Hollywood and I walk in and upstairs is techno and downstairs in the like little bottom Club is hip-hop and it was a birthday party and everyone was downstairs and me and my buddy Rick we walk in and we're standing at the edge of the techno floor and there's like all these dudes just like dancing by themselves there's like a mental case right and I was just standing there look at him going what the fuck is wrong with these people oh my god so I went downstairs they're playing hip-hop like that's what I want to hear at clubs I want hear hip-hop at a club I want to dance with a girl not by myself you know so I'm downstairs and then they start passing around some Molly and something you want to do and I'll never forget that that first one was blue am i who i don't know i don't know i took it me and my buddy both took it and it hit us that that first hit just hits you like a fucking ton of bricks we go upstairs and we're on the dance floor dancing like morons dude and we're looking at each other go you get it I get it you get it I get it and yeah that point on you got all in the trance yeah that point it wasn't just like that night it changed my musical taste right in one hit and I had a friend at the club who was a total R&B dude he hated techno and he would talk shit when I play technical one day you're gonna do some mauling and you're gonna be all into technicals fuck you that'll never happen I can't stand this music he starts dating the raver chick like six months later at the club some raver chick he ends up at a raid he ends up drop in Somali he starts coming in and bringing all these new techno CDs full-blown in the transit techno just one hit this is the real problem it's illegal so when you get it from someone you don't know what the fuck you're getting that's the real problem with Mali this is a real problem of MDMA it's also the dosage you don't know what the dosage is supposed to be look you can overdose on alcohol and alcohols everywhere but everybody knows what the dose of alcohol is when you go to a bar and you get a shot of Jack Daniels you know what that is it's not like sometimes you get a child action Jack Daniels and Jack Daniels sometimes you get it and it's super fucking moonshine it's 15 times stronger and you die that's the problem with heroin it's a problem with a lot of things the real problem with MDMA seems to be that it's illegal that's the real problem and what they're finding is that there's great benefits if it's used correctly I mean anything could be abused but that doesn't mean we should make it illegal and what they want to do I think their their timeline is somewhere around 2021 making it legal for for therapy it's gonna change the world it's gonna change everything it's gonna change the way people feel about the past it's gonna change the way people interact with each other you're gonna know just by people's behavior whether or not they've ever done it you know where it comes from where MDMA come come yes the part of it the active ingredient that takes you that just swam right where's that planet it's in the Thailand crazy war either Thailand or took a quarter what's Cambodia it's in Cambodia it's like the bark like the something about that like the root of a tree trunk or something yes has something to do with the tree James pulling up but it becomes very dangerous for those people right like all that trafficking becomes crazy yeah there's they fuck up for us like for us are being chopped down just for them not only that people being murdered it's like it's heavy-duty stuff I don't know just look at images and that's what maybe MDMA just Cambodia trees sassafras okay maybe that is sassafras and stuff Roly sassafras yeah I guess it's sassafras dude it'll whatever whatever that plan is they take the see if they're just Google vice the making of ecstasy because I'm pretty sure of ice to this but could you Google that please I think vice had that special on that I wonder what would happen if he just ate it raw I wonder can you do that um is there a special what does it say the truth about ecstasy yeah so there's some sort of Vice episode where they grow this stuff anyway this should be something that's not distributed by criminals wearing ski masks like you've seen in this video should be something distributed by stores and there should be doctors and if you wanted it you could have a rave where you even have medical centers in the rave where you keep people from overdosing yeah and when they're the transitionary period from people going from drugs being totally illegal to some drugs having massive benefits like if you're you go to a club right and everyone there's come on we're doing shots we're doing shots the whole fucking bar is getting wasted and drunk everybody's fine with that but you're not fine with a club where everybody does a small amount of ecstasy well why can't you do that well that's drugs well the other ones drugs too he just used to those drugs once we get past that hurdle and it might take a whole generation before people get used to place we know one drug gets you violent one drug makes you want to have sex but listen you're not gonna stop that drug here's my point it's a powerful really useful drug people gonna find out about it's an amazing experience they're gonna do it so what's the best way to handle that best way to handle is make it safe make it legal make it regulated so they know what actually is in each one of these fucking pills you're not getting it from some pimp or some asshole or some fucking crazy dude who stuffed it in a balloon put it up his asshole and made it across the border with it you don't know where the fuck you're getting this stuff and they cut all sorts of shit shit amphetamines and all sorts of crazy shit and people die from it because they don't know what the fuck is in there here it is okay it says murder boy mr mode aah pyaari w ph n om trees murray Prudhomme trees in cambodia and they're found in cambodia is Oh frass the factory's been set up to distill sassafras oil process by boiling the roots in the trunk of the exceptionally rare plant other really rare trees - Wow how crazy is that how many of these fucking trees are like in the middle - rainforest so we don't know about you know I mean there's some this got to be some shit where they haven't tapped into it yet they're finding all sorts of different pharmaceutical drugs that they concoct out of stuff the Tramp plants the glamazon yeah what something like insects are evolving so fast in the Amazon that they only have names for I think ninety per ten percent of the insects ninety percent they have no names no it's crazy is that true they have all sorts of bugs in the Amazon for sure that they haven't identified they know that for a fact and they do evolve they're a rare thing where you can there's like some primitive life-forms you could find that didn't exist before like they found this crayfish I think it's in India or Europe maybe Europe crayfish that produces by cloning they don't have sex so female they're all female and one crayfish just makes a bunch of other babies just makes babies she doesn't need sex and they're like what the fuck I mean obviously there's no genetic diversity right because they they obviously would need a male DNA that makes it the female okay there it is mutant crayfish clones itself and it's taking over Europe so this crayfish doesn't fuck they just reproduce like one crayfish could just reproduce it's really bananas so this is a new thing that didn't exist 25 years ago this is something that they are very sure wasn't a living organism up until recently here's a good thing crayfish are delicious people are starving to death now they got some motherfuckers that all you have to do is just throw some stuff and there you don't have to count on them fucking maybe it's the same stuff that made the frogs gay maybe it's linked but if you I mean it could be could be pesticides could be look there's another thing about the amount of people that flush pills down the toilet and how much that shit goes through water treatment plants and into aqueducts and yeah reservoirs and Shera yeah there's a lot of pills that get flushed down our toilets and some of them make it into rivers and shed some of them making it to the ocean you know what's supposed to be particularly bad I never thought about this until a friend of mine was a surfer told me he was a yoga teacher was a surfer and said nobody told him and he got real sick because he went into the ocean right after the rain you can't go to the ocean after the rain because when it rains in LA all that bullshit all the chemicals and toxins and cleaners and oil and gasoline and plastic washes into the water like right at the shore and that's where it's all just swashing around in there with the waves and you get in there and you get sick as fuck you're basically getting poisoned is there some kind of filtration system before they just let all the water just run right and right right in from the hood streets from the runoff just from the streets I think where does the toilet water go does that water goes through a sewage system difference is that it goes through a sanitation system but sometimes those break I was at the Charles River in Boston once and I was it was like right across the street from where I lived and I'd hang out there all the time when I was a kid and I was standing there on the shore and I saw these bubbles and like these chunks of things floating up to the water I was like what the fuck is that and then I saw a condom bloop come up and what oh that's a sewer pipe they're flushing condoms and they're like shit and condom water it's coming right through the fucking ground into this river where all these fish live this fish are probably living off a human shit what's the water like after the sewage water runs through the filtration system what does that water perfect and where does it go Fiji based on what I saw online it seems like BG water is the best water out there they tested a lot of bottled water and a lot of bottled water has a lot of bullshit in it look at this after 50 years Boston's Charles River just became swimmable again took 500 million dollars in nearly two decades of work here's how the city did it that's it man that was the river that connected to over that River went all the way down near my house while we saluted people gross but dude when and people start building shit in the 1800s didn't give a fuck about the future they took that sewer pipe right there pop it right into the fucking ocean I'm gonna take a shit right in that water it's gonna go shooting down that pipe and drop right on a fish's head who cares they didn't give a fuck when they were building things they would have all their industrial runoff just go right in the rivers they taught they polluted thousands of rivers like who the fuck knows how many fish died because people in the early days of the Industrial Revolution were fucking assholes they didn't have any consequences they didn't they didn't think about the possibility of completely destroying the environment like that didn't exist before the age of the industrial machines the only time it existed before that was in dead bodies would would pollute river systems after war you know yeah like when people would throw bodies into rivers like that would you know that would fuck up people's wells that would fuck up you know any drinking more people got real sick how to change it well what did their toilets look like like back in the 1500s 1600s like some dude the his mouth yeah pimp-ass toilets for the kings back in the day I'm sure they did once you google it Jamie toilet from King Henry the 8th King Henry VIII ago killed all his wives right yeah well it's from all the way back in the BCS but I'm gonna go to King Henry 8th got tired of those ladies just caught the fucking words where does the Kings loaf go to mmm what is it Lee suspected by doctors they want to make sure he's got enough fiber in his diet ha ha ha keep his highness alive where did they go would you just find Jamie what's that face thing called a thunder mug oh nice pull that up here we go make sure oh ok this is for the 1600s that's what he shit into it's know it says that's what I say this this is a Shakespearean chamber pot not mmm the bards own Thunder mug but it is a typical chamber pot that's what they would call them chamber pots I so it's a pot he shit in like literally shit in a pot that looks sturdy the so it's really like bull it's like a toilet bowl it just doesn't have water in it right do you think they've left water in it to make it easier to clean I'll be next to it probably smart have water in there yeah yeah otherwise you get a couple slaves to pull it out dumping you're good like you ever have to take a shit on a plane and you see how little water there is and that little thing that you drop in logs into and then when you flush it never gets at all you know and you gotta think do I just like play stupid and get out of here ha ha I give a courtesy flush a hole in the ground nice magic falling into that hole that's your death you choke to death on shit what's happened a hundred percents happened it's happened I read about a dude who fell into a septic tank the felon is septic tank and drown had a septic tank in his backyard and he was fixing it somehow or another and it broke he fell through and he dragged in a fucking septic tank how did they get rid of their shit in the city just regular peasants like what they just threw out on the streets or did they have to collect it and drag it out to the woods - good question well there was a real issue in Rome in the early days of people shitting in the streets and apparently there's a lot of people in San Francisco right now that are shitting the streets it's a real issue Jake Shields my friend the MMA fighter jujitsu master Jake Shields you know Jake yes he put a video up on Instagram of some dude shitting like pulling his pants down and like shitting right into the street like you said it's happening everywhere San Francisco has done an amazing amount of bums I think with Jake Shields I don't want to speak out of turn pretty sure that's the best city for homeless people for sure they let people do whatever the fuck they want nut City they're so nice so open minded and they feel so guilty because they made a billion dollars from like brazzers dot-com or some shit you know they paid all that tech money yeah you know it's a different kind of money there they're so liberal in comparison to like Wall Street banker type dudes those dudes are like cutthroat right-wing like private jet fuck you Minko big watch go go go doing coke where is the money on the other side like the tech money they're like well diversity is really important and and women they need to be represented intact and this is their space this is the space for them too we need to let them know we need to encourage that like they're so left way if they're like these homeless people they also just because they don't have an address doesn't mean this city is not equally there's you know we have to help them and offer aid crackheads just taking diarrhea splatter heads against walls like they just let these people get away they were fucking mentally ill people and they just let them wander around to their Street yeah if it really cared you know what they would do they would really put some money into taking care of these people instead of just letting them wander on the street shit all over the place have a place we can get them clothes from the Salvation Army or something like that have a place where you give them regular showers have something that's like appealing they can go to all the time so you keep them from just shitting on the streets in front of everybody that's crazy Billy Corgan had a residency in San Francisco maybe eight years ago and it was all about him just writing songs on the spot and going on stage that night and doing brand-new songs like a weird kind of residency and he had this one song that he wrote about you just hanging out in the park in San Francisco and just wrote about the bums and how disgusting it all was and called the song peace and love excellent song one of his greatest songs it's deep mmm about the bums there's so many men we used to run into him all the time when we did gigs in San Francisco we'd go out to eat you'd have to do like this bum obstacle course on the way to the restaurant gosh here comes one ghetto street up no no no everybody grow out there super aggressive yes yes people are real tolerant there yeah but isn't that better that's better than the opposite it's better yet I think it's good to live in a place that's as tolerant as possible even if the super lefties get annoying you don't want the opposite to see they might fuck up because there's the same sort of mentality that goes on with people on the far left and people in the far right and that mentality is my ways the right way I'm right you're wrong fuck you I'm gonna make you change make you do what and that doesn't work that doesn't work on anybody but I always feel like it's safer and better when that's happening towards like kindness and compassion and income equality and all these things that are I see like even though it gets very authoritarian I see that at least it has like a good heart to it all like even if it's misguided some of it some socialism's misguided or even if they're pretending do there's always that that's a good move right if you're gonna pretend you pretend towards the left yeah it was awesome money yeah you could steal all sorts of tax money just pretend you're helping people there's definitely a lot of that going on there's no doubt about that dude we haven't talked about turning Ferguson it's 2 o'clock yeah this is the kind of already do holy shit we ramble we god damn we have to talk about Tony Ferguson scene is how you're his jiu-jitsu coach and I was fuckin convinced I told Jamie I told Jimmy Smith I'm like I'm not buying it I'm not buying it as April Fool's the shit's coming on in April Fool's fuck you man you know fool me once shame on you fool me 50 times or how many times have been busted by April Fool's like there's no fucking way Tony Ferguson got hurt a week before the fight there's no way yeah and it's true that's the first thing I thought I'm like oh my god everyone's gonna think this is April Fool's yeah everyone no one's gonna believe this and I found out late Saturday night you know I'm in the studio with Danny Lohner just making some music and you know I knew something something might have been wrong because we were supposed to work Saturday afternoon and he never no shows he's late a lot but he was late I'm just hanging out in front of a studio he's got his own gym now and after a while he didn't return his texts I'm like something you know he's he's a fucking superstar there's a lot of shit going on inside you said okay fuck it so I left and went on with my day went in the studio and then I get the text like at 11:25 at night Saturday night he said I fucked I fucked up my knee blew my fucking LCL out he wants to fight he wants to fight he does not he did not not want to fight but his doctor said you can't fight and he was like I need a second opinion so he went to the UFC doctors they said no you can't find his LCL is detached from his knee according to so it's pulled from the bone it's pulled off the bone yeah that's they said it's really it's it's not like usually that's no Dana described yeah usually you tear your LCL or your MCL usually because I've done my MCL before it repairs on its own so thick according to what the doctors tell me I don't know shit but they're you know but you need to tell your meniscus you probably need surgery for that or you're tearing ACL you for sure need surgery for that if it's a physical if it's a complete tear but the LCL and MCL the only time they're you again according to what I hear the only time I need surgery is if it's fucking blown the fuck out like motorcycle acts accident free things and when I say Tony wanted a fight he he would have fought with that shit he didn't give a fuck they wouldn't let him fight he wanted a fight was he walking with sunglasses on indoors I don't know I don't know what he was wearing this is what Dana Dana was saying I think said he he tripped over some wires some you know those those thick cables that they lay you know apparently tripped over water and fell off fuck that's insane it's the craziest thing ever it's insane it's so crazy it's so sad that fight is doomed Dana White said he would never put that fight on again I'm like are you crazy book that shit again the thing that sucks is the thing that sucks is four is a magic number Dana said in an interview kind of hinted or alluded to the fact man I hope I'm wrong I hope I'm wrong but that they would they're gonna strip Tony of his interim belt like you know Robert Woodward you see that someone told me I didn't hear it so that's why I'm saying I don't know if it's true someone said yeah they just did an interview knee he was he was a hinting like oh he said in so and in such a way that Tony is gonna get stripped of his belt nine ridiculous well here's my question if someone is the champ right and they get injured and they can't defend their title then they have an interim title right yeah but if the interim guy gets injured and can't defend the interim title do they strip to end does that ever happen Robert Whittaker he has losses interim lightweight title winner McGovern often Holloway square off so I guess they're taking this yeah they didn't do that I mean they didn't do that to Robert Whittaker he was the interim interim champion should they have an interim interim no doesn't see they they let Whittaker take 11 months off to recover why would they does the exact same thing it was the exact same situation Robert Whittaker was fighting for the interim or he had the interim title was gonna fight I forget who it was it was either so no I forget who it was and then he got injured they didn't strip him right why they strip and Tony do you feel like it's punishment for him getting injured a week out like they're pissed and like fuck it yeah I don't know I don't know but that's you can't do that's right I mean you got Heat did Tony want her to fight more than anybody we got a break like if he happens four weeks ago and it's an injury and training and he tears it from the bone is that they just rescheduled a fight right yeah and it's still for the interim title why is it like a week out the interim is cancelled maybe it's because they have to make a big fight with max Holloway versus khabib for the world that might cause that cost Tony a lot of money because he has the interim belt he he was this was gonna be by far as the biggest payday ever for him I mean he was making some good money right it's because of the belt so if you just rip him his next fight he doesn't have that belt anymore to to get money you know and so he'll get significantly less money say what if you don't have a belt hell yeah let if what if max or could be blintz right one of them are seumas gonna win whoever won it is and then Tony gets healthy and then they're gonna have Tony fight one of those guys for the title like he would get less then he would have for this fire if he doesn't have the belt really so that's part of the contract if you have a belt if you're gonna negotiate for a fight and you have a belt you have way more power than if you don't have a belt right so by stripping him of the belt his next fight when he heals up and comes back he's gonna it's gonna cost him no and it's not fair because again Robert Whittaker didn't get stripped of his eternal belt they should max Holloway and khabib should just fight just you know a main event fight doesn't have to be for a belt cuz that's gonna fuck Tony well why would it fuck Tony if he still gets the interim title if he kept the interim title then it wouldn't fuck yes exactly for his next fight will negotiate his next fight him and he would be interim title holder versus world title holder why does max Maxon could be back to fight for a belt it doesn't have to be fair belt this is the thing is the UFC holds all the cards they can make up the rules they can do whatever they want when it comes to the rankings and stuff right they can't do it at whatever they want when it comes to rules so with their their position they're like look this is gonna cost a shitload of money how do we recover eek ook that money you know how do we okay we get Holloway to fight well that's almost as big that's a giant fight - okay now we're back now we're back in business and the stripping ham thing I don't know what the policy is on that I don't know if there's a public policy or if it's just they just maybe I think they could do whatever they want to do I don't I don't think they would never give up that power if they did have it like to some organizing body like why would they write because organizing bodies could even get corrupted but I think you have to be very careful when you make like interim titles that you don't make too many of them and you don't have them around too often you know like once you have them you got to get them resolved pretty quick like they're they they're a way to build up excitement about the fight but yeah I mean I don't think they would've stripped him if he got injured four weeks ago but who knows I might be wrong they might just be maybe they have a new policy maybe they just stripping people but then Connor hasn't fought in 500 days he's not stripped yeah exactly Connor is not stripped yet he hasn't fought in more than five hundred days mm a last time he fought was Eddie Alvarez does his last MMA fight I was a long time ago man yeah as a long time ago and then he hasn't been stripped so imagine being a lightweight just sitting around waiting well he's on boxing TV having a boxing match with Floyd Mayweather he doesn't even get stripped of his title doesn't defend it makes 100 million bucks feel like when you fighting again I was like who fucking knows it would be a lot of shit it'd be a lot clearer as what to do in the situation if Connor would have just fought like a regular lightweight champion there wouldn't be this this interim confusion it's so good for Conor though all of it just makes it bigger and bigger it's like they even changed the rules for him you know I mean like think about that for him like it just makes him bigger he has had fun 508 who fucking cares he's just rolling around in a bathtub full of hundred bills every day just dive it in there and swimmin he can do whatever the fuck he wants yeah did you see that documentary on that play no I didn't good yeah he knew he was gonna be a champion back in the day it starts when he he has just one tattoo the one down the one down his back that's it none of the neck tattoos or anything and he already knew he knew he just had but dynamite in his hands you know crushing people on the local local scene crushing them yeah one shots boom yeah I saw him fight in 2013 I think somewhere around there in his first chance at the UFC I wanted him know and if I didn't see this document it's hard to keep track of everything but wasn't Sweden it was a Swedish show it was like last-minute replacement they brought a man and he fought what was his name black guy shit I forget his name good guy real good guy and he'd let him up and that was like damn after that one fight like there's there's footage of of him and Deena and like Dana was already here any nude he goes man I guess the hype was real Jesus my favorite fights with him are the two fights with Nate Diaz though you know why because those the fights we couldn't put someone away just crack him and put him away so you had to see him fight yeah he had a fight yeah and it's a totally different game like if you see what he did to Eddie Alvarez that was a totally different kind of fight because he's stung Eddie early had him her and he was his he owned him and then he fucked him up and stopped him that was a beating what round was that it was a second saying was a second he barely made it out of the first right yeah I barely made it I mean he got fucked up from the get-go and Connor just had his numbers way faster way quicker in like covering distance just just like laser beams that night and I don't think Eddie fought right I think Eddie was a little bit too caught up in the moment this is a big hype of the fight and the fight Conor McGregor and he just got fucked up I kind of had his hands behind his back and standing right in front of him and then popping him in the face like that was ugly so that you know like what year was that those 500 those 500 days ago like that's that kind of fight is a great fight for Conor but that's all hammer when he fought Nate he had to be the nail through a lot of that yeah the whole fucking second round of the first fight when Nate got him down was the second round submission right wasn't it I don't know when he submitted him but Nate's submit him in the second round what are you looking at me funny woman you got something these foot pull up more than I do with my deck that's what Conor said these fools pull out more than I do with my dick I'm like how he had specified with he must have only pulled out four times max that's not that great the fights with Nate were fights you know he had a dig deep and he lost the first one he got beat up he got taken down he got his back taken he got choked he tapped I mean he fucking lost that fight and then the second fight he drops Nate but he can't put Nate away Nate gets back up they're going after it there's fucking times where he's got and walk away he's gotta walk away because he's too tired he can't engage right now okay so he walked away a couple times in those exchanges those were Digg Digg fights what's this buddy round two yeah yeah yeah okay submission rear naked choke four minutes and 12 seconds it around - yeah he beat him down warm down and then stopped him that's and the fight that Conard one could that have gone either yeah arguments right that's very close fight and very close match I think in the new rules Conor probably would have won because I think look I think even just a one knockdowns not good enough for a 10-8 round it's just not you know in a five minute round like one knockdown it's it's depends on how the other exchanges were going the exchanges were all the same then you cracked him once you definitely won but did you win ten a like ten eight is a beatdown I think you know yeah but even I think that should be wrong I don't think it should be that I think should be like a hundred points yeah and I think they should have like scores for like one through ten in striking one through ten and wrestling one through ten with it or non-applicable if there's no wrestling at all you just eat ten but you got to look at it this way though if if you could have a fight and in one round it's super close and really nothing happened and super close and no one really connected anything and that happens all the time that's a 10-9 round right should and then you you compare that to another round where a guy got dropped but it was kind of a flash knockdown he pops back up and then they then it's kind of even for the rest of the round that can't be a 10-9 - so either you got to make more 10 10 rounds or nine nine rounds and then you could say okay a knockdown doesn't necessarily mean ten eight because then at ten nine is gonna mean one dude clearly won and landed some good shots that's a 10-9 right it's all how you you lay it down so if you're gonna give you know due to where the round could have gone either way and you're gonna give someone at ten nine and it looks just like a dude getting knocked down ish that should be different so it all depends how to add more draws or make it so that if you knock a do down that's an automatic 10-8 round you're not gonna do down that's ten eight you know what attend together ass what if he's beating your ass all over the place and then you catch him was like five seconds ago drop him and he gets right back up and he cracks you with a jab do you still get at anything as you dropped him I think that's uh I think I would say that's a nine nine right because again before the guys beating your ass down the whole round and then you clip him once and he drops maybe you weren't really beating him down that hard maybe he just looked like it cuz he's still cracked you if you were really beating him down how was he able to to knock you down that happens all the time guys still have power especially if you run into something that's a that's a hard one to school a knockdown then a beatdown you get outclassed the whole match or the whole round and then you get knocked down once do you remember when the draw Drago Pete's L fought Scott Smith Scott Smith from rocky for no drago in the second round against rocky we draw a Matt Serra's PES member pizza tomato pizza yes exactly Pete dropped a hurt Scott Smith real bad with a left hook to the body like Scott doubled over and winced and Pete moved in for the kill he's got miss just landed the perfect picture point but he but he was that like was his Huracan it no faking it no he dropped an agony after he knocked him out yeah Pete hooked hooked him to the body hurt him real bad and when Pete moved in for the kill Scott Smith hit him with a picture Brodie remember I remember that just knocked him out he falls back and then Scott Smith drops to the ground if they stopped to fighting he's an agony holding on to his side it was crazy it was crazy see that can't happen like even if you're beating a guy down they're still moving if they still just plant and just uncork one Pat Barry Cheick Kongo remember that shit Pat Barry I'd check Kongo on KO we're Street he was wobbling and dude all over the place it looked like the fight was over and Pat moves in for the kill and boom Cheick Kongo hits him with a haymaker as he's running in flat lines Pat Barry for the first time in his career shit can happen if you're not knocked out you're still moving you still could knock someone out it can happen especially if they get careless there it is hits one to left leave this boom I mean that's a picture-perfect left hook to the body but watch this he's in agony if he moves in BAM I mean that is a crazy right hand that's like round 9 of Lang versus Balboa look at the ground and agony afterwards Pete's out couldn't even believe it happened yeah you should always feint before you move in always always even if you think you got a guy hurt ok ok give me something show me what you got going on I mean the best guys they never just charge like max Halloween we finished off all dough this constant pressure constant pressure but when he feels although firing bags I'll step back for a second right back on you babes the best fainter I seem always pretty goddamn good at it it seems like I just saw someone fight in the UFC or maybe Bellator that would say go oh it's just fainting just wonder boy wonder boy might get my vote for the best fainter because wonder boy also has like it's like what what style faintings most effective wonder boy has a extra advantage of having that right leg forward or left leg forward whichever he chooses sideways stance with that long body of his that's a weird thing I've dealt with that man and the old martial arts days and Taekwondo days it's the hardest thing to deal with those long guys that can have that have a powerful front leg he just keeps you away you don't know what the fuck he's doing so he faints and then BAM he comes in with the left hand or he faints and boom there's a roundhouse kick in your face I think he's the most of because he doesn't also it doesn't move like everybody else everybody else has like sort of a modified Taekwondo style or a Muay thai-style rather except for the Taekwondo guys there's a few guys like even Conor Conor has more of a karate style a lot of the times he'll stand like taught like when you see him fight Aldo he stood totally sideways yeah I mean he was he was bouncing back and forth back and forth like a karate fighter remember how don the dragon Wilson used to fight East to just get up on one leg and just keep his left leg oh yeah but I'll just be on one leg and just keep the left leg all the way up dude I sparred with that guy once he's annoying right he's very good at that yeah he's very good at that he was real nice man too much energy well he was good I kick him you could tie kick him dude he's good at that too if you watched on Wilson's fight with Dennis Lexie Oh Don Wilson fuck Dennis Alexio up back when Dennis Alexio didn't know about leg kicks mmm Dennis alexia wound up becoming one of the very best guys at leg kicks he was also one of the first guys I ever saw get his leg broken in a fight he fought Stan the man Longinus and he had a grass skirt from Australia yeah and Stan Lodge anita's he used to work with my French shoe key remember shoe key the yeah Israeli guy yeah it was teaching me kickboxing back in the day his leg was all fucked up because he would hold pads for Stan Longinus he had that big old Thai leg padded oh dude holy Sh like if you think some people like if you see a guy who kicks real hard right the heavyweight world champion Muay Thai guys or Thai boxer kickboxer guys like a Stan Longinus the the power they have in their kick is unfathomable remember you brought this up with you but you say it wasn't you I was at Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu once and we were watching pedro rizzo kick the bag and I was like what like you just think of one of those slamming into your thigh and you're like there's no way there's no way his shoe keys hold leg was fucked up I'm holding the pad on one side he was gonna need a hip replacement damn dude imagine guy kicks your leg while you're holding pads for him so hard you need a hip replacement that's what it was not worth it the dragon Wilson beat the beat Dennis Alexio with leg kicks it was my point but Don had that weird style like know he would stand totally sideways yeah and he didn't take any chances you fought super-intelligent he finds deep into his forties too man he's an OG yeah yeah my dad's real commentary with him we were he was my partner in king of the cage for maybe five or six shows man talk about the worst comment ever me and on the driving was really bad commentary is it's not that's not my gig man I could do color but being the play-by-play guy yeah that's just a hole that's a whole different I did that once with Phil Baroni Phil Baroni was fucking hilarious Miami show me you have seen Miami I think that was the only one ever right oh I don't know about that this dragon Don Wilson who's he fighting here there he is look at him in these red pants man oh it's him fighting Dennis Lexi oh yeah see how he would just flip that thing out everything was like light and flippy and they just yeah they didn't know what to do with it they couldn't kick to the legs right all they could oh they could we oh look at that so ya know they could see he just kicked him in the leg right there Don Wilson fucked him up with leg kicks in this fight si dance Alexei was trying to kick him in the legs this is after what had happened was a lot of these guys like Don Wilson that had a traditional karate background learned how to kick box they realized how potent leg kicks were a big factor was Rick the jet Rufus Duke Rufus his brother who was one of you know the all-time best pka style above the waist kick boxers Rick Rufus when I was a kid man I wanted to be like Rick Rufus he would fight dudes sideways stance and just fucked him up fucked him up with hook kicks and roundhouse kicks and and dive in with punches like blitz karate style punches I mean Rick Rufus was doing shit that nobody was doing and he fought this Thai dude I do not remember the gentleman's name but Duke Rufus brought it up I podcast is being like a big transformation in his life because that touch side fight it just chopped Rick down just like a mix rules a little bit of Muay Thai a little bit of American kick box and they allowed the leg kicks but they didn't allow elbows or something like that exact mixed it up and and k1 yes here it is the guy's name yeah the fight that was pause that real quick Chang's black Kia song grit key at song Jung Chang quick chine quick song grit I wish we had an okay record it was like year oh well yeah more than a hundred professional fights I mean he was a world champion he okay guy yeah okay I thought he was a beast he okay let's see what what his what up with his hands though Rick was fucking him up with his hands had him hurt had him almost knocked out a couple times but he kept laying those leg kicks and the led to expect and he had to be carried off in a stretcher yeah yeah he couldn't fight because he couldn't walk his legs gave out gone well he didn't know what it was there so I mean this is like a long time ago he didn't understand but he tagged him with some punches my oh yeah I could hear he couldn't hang with his hands no look at that spinning backfist and the punch behind it I mean he was fucking him up he really was little he was landing them like little Thai guy is though to take those shots one of them to rank fights ever in kickboxing history just just the fact that this is how Rick Rufus earned the power look at that fuckin go back there real quick go back there guys almost go back look he go back watch this look at this move that he does he does that a touch jumping side just spinning wheel kick hit him in the head dudes out on his feet at the end of the bell they sit him down in the corner out on his feet just keep playing this this is one of the greatest matches it's so historically significant in martial art yeah this is what this is where they learned yes this is where those American kick boxers this is this is was an eye-opener this is like UFC one for kick boxing dude I remember the first the first time someone ever kicked me in the leg they didn't even do it hard they did it to show me like how hard it is when you get kicked in the leg it was like a light bulb went off went oh no the first time I've ever heard of a leg kick I was working at the strip club as a DJ and one of the managers was all into karate tournament he always had done tournament karate for 12 shit look at this dude he's lighting him up with these leg kicks and then uh-oh he took me in the back one day and it goes dude stand there let me kick you and he kicked me with the shin he goes people are doing this now how does that feel this he wasn't she was experimenting on my leg goes does this hurt they're landing with their shin they're like damn it fuck that hurt the shin that's weird well the crazy thing is when you feel it for like from someone who's just like tapping your leg how much it hurts now think of this dude whose name I can't pronounce again oh look I so Ric would try to throw his own kick but his low kicks were like foot kicks they mean he was a foot kicker yeah he wasn't like a shin kicker back then like most karate guys were instep kickers he would hit a guy with a roundhouse kick but you would hit him in the body with your instep you hit him the head with your instep almost everything I ever did up until I started doing muy Thai was with my in steps or you heel you know like heel kicks wheel kicks stuff like that there's Incredibles that Americans didn't figure that out you know isn't that insane Oh between the leg yet I mean this is crazy shit did he hit him with a punch on the way down back that up again real quick work just so just a hair look at this he goes down yeah I'll bald him in the back of the head holy shit dude show that again dude watch this again watch what happens he goes down and on the way down watch this boom see that elbow yeah yo dude no doubt dirty elbow to the back of the dome one more time please one more time please look at this down on his way down watch his left boom yeah he fucking cracked the back of his head with it help her referee didn't even know what it Noah was that's an invalid technique continued you totally missed the punch landed with his elbow they tried to land a punch buddy boy I'm gonna take any points away because you didn't land he's fucking that right leg up southpaw a southpaw oh look at that made him switch dances look at that he's chopping him down dude you can't even imagine how bad just must hurt for rick rufus in the middle of this fight he doesn't know how to block these things he's taking one on the front leg one on the back leg he's just getting crushed I mean this is crazy do you want to cross the front where the dick is dude he's flat-footed now he can't take it can't spin he can't spin look at this accompanied by a stomp he stomped him oh that stomp to the body was legit oh my god damn they need to make a movie out of this this is crazy right they should make a move they should make a documentary from his point of view from the employee a port I fighter right fight Rufus and make it even though like like make Rick Rufus the evil white guy he can't he wants to blow up the world he can't even move this is like these guys are so important it's so important to our understanding because Rick Rufus was so good he was so good and he was doing movie shit on people those jump roundhouse kick spinning hook kicks look at this round two I mean he was doing some really wild shit and even landing it on this guy like he was fucking good he was a legit champion no doubt about it but he just did not understand the low kick game yet and this was it was so important for a guy look at that he lands that high kick it's it was so important that a guy as good as him fought this guy so we know for sure it wasn't just that you know the Rick Rufus wasn't any good no Rufus was real good real good then too oh he's getting crushed with those and this Thai guys look at his open hands too look how he's moving forward just open hands he's all about protecting himself pushing off and low kicking look at his hands see his hand placement I mean that's crazy shit look at that boom pushing off he's barely even trying to punch with them he's basically just using his hands to create space and distance and give Rick Rick Rufus something to think about and to block the punches and the kick that Rufus throws and then boom leg kicks he just leg kicks him to death look at that he's not keep punching he's just leg kick leg kick hands up hands up thank you that is crazy as soon as he stopped exchanging punches he just started dominating the space and then slamming those leg kicks in look at that boom fakes with the hand and across both thighs that's one of the most painful ones man the ones that cross both eyes ah ah dude Rob came in back when I was coaching from him he tapped me across the front of my thighs with his shin just dunk just tapped me my legs hurt all day this guy holy that throw holy shit those ties can chuck each other around two men I posted a little clip oh shit look at that of a fight where they had did not they just wrapped up their hands they didn't have gloves and head butts were Leos kickboxing where you could throw push this and you could headbutt did you see that clip no it isn't dude it's evil guy head butts his opponent standing up he just just Spears his head right into it knocks the guy down just from a headbutt and Rufus like he only stands that one way most of the time too so that that front right leg is so vulnerable to that left outside kick because they're both southpaw if Rick see now he's trying to switch up and he's putting his left leg forward because he's in so much pain like look when he walks back to his corner dude he could barely walk at the end of the third round barely was it from Thailand or was in the States I don't know where it was it looks it says Coors beer on the canvas so I want to think it's in America and plus the way they're making him wait he's wearing those pants I got to think it's America those pants look so stupid in comparison and also Rick Rufus was also wearing padding oh shit how did he go down there like kick another like oh can you rewind that Jamie look at the pads look at the pads on his feet okay this how did he go down below that was just a leg kick yeah just low kick caught him in the spin and just totally took his leg out and he's wearing those those booties on the tops of his feet to like to protect the bones of his feet because he's a foot kicker yeah see I'm saying like that's extra weight you weren't an extra four ounces or whatever the fuck it is on your feet it slows your kicks down and the tie guy just says taped up ankles and shorts on it's really interesting because this really is like kickboxing versus Muay Thai bloomie chop still a again bloomie chops Lee again look at this we're crew this isn't so much danger here I mean he's basically just totally helpless and this Thai guys going across the shins he's going across the if he's blocking with his knees and you were fuck he's just kicking through him everything boom look at that boom look at that he's just walking him down he starts on I got fine oh no terrifying that must be to have that guy walk you down like that that's all like a call that they call the fight I think is that JT will the referee there's a famous referee who got who's will and like all those karate that's dick dude that's Duke right there no that's not JT well that's Duke right there telling everybody that he didn't think that it took a lot of skill to kick someone's legs became like the man who this you know I don't think it takes much talent to kick somebody in the legs jumping what's crazy well what's crazy I mean Duke I think was only 19 at a time you know changed he's learned and one of the reasons why he's so good is because he's open-minded yeah he became a world champion more Thai fighter himself which is crazy it's just like jujitsu and leg locks you know just like that that doesn't take any time you're just jumping on a guy's leg dude all two all martial arts techniques that are effective there's still people that don't believe in certain techniques and and the big another big moment for Muay Thai in the history that martial art was Paul varlyn versus Marco who that's what we saw was UFC 7 that's when we saw that damn because before UFC 7 everybody was thinking ok you can't really do any kind of striking you you have to learn jujitsu or you will lose it's gonna be people were just losing faith and striking all together like just work on it was almost like jabs didn't even work like who throws a jab in MMA you're gonna get taken down and get choked out and UFC 7 that's when we learn ok leg leg kicks work you gotta learn yeah that changed everything yeah parlons Vaughn's was huge the polar bear they're calm that guy was gigantic Marco who washes took his legs at high all right and then Marco who else he also beat Remco pardhu that judo champion you remember he mounted him in the knee tapped he goes it's over once you get them out it's all that's what he thought that's it that is what he thought it that crazy look at this Marco who else would get heel hooks on people and shit who's he fighting yeah I get them in the heel hook right for this I think this was the first heel hook in the UFC might have been if it wasn't him it was oh that's amazing oh wait a minute wait a minute II can't shamrock against Patrick Smith yes I don't know the heel hook ankle lock was just an ankle ochres Hyuk yeah Ken probably had the first ever leg lock and then I was gonna say Oleg Taktarov didn't Oleg get some heel hooks he got a knee bar and a straight ankle lock I think's hmm old school son Oh like some kind of MMA show reviewing old fights straight maybe Paul Paul varlan it's VA our Varro you ever talk to Eric Apple about his old days sparring with Marco they would spar Brazilian style you just get ready for concussions it's just yeah didn't matter if you get your nose broken get back in there like everybody was just going to warm yeah that's what time everyone was scared to death of back in the early days and I was a white belt ever you hear about half Gracie school up in it's Paul varlyn versus at Marcos versus that's Paul violence fighting it looks like in a pre UFC fight or maybe after he was was it trapped fighting I don't know I think it's something like that it was trapped yeah there it is right there at the top it's the UFC he wore a singlet remember he wore a wrestling singlet yeah like look he's six seven can you this big fella can you wear those singlets anymore you can't right now why not uh it's a good question girls can well it actually it looks like he's get different colors shorts on or is that the monitor so he's a tank top he's a tank top on he's fighting with tank top on it's not even a singlet mm right it looks like a singlet a little bit but doesn't look like different colors maybe you're right maybe it's just we're seeing his legs and a dick yeah go to the last minute as a flame the last minute of the fight that's where he chops him down he just chopped him down there with the first one boom yeah he's so much smaller than him look how small Marko is in comparison to Marco's a big guy boom see Paul violence doesn't have any idea what to do here so he he just keeps kicking back he just touched his leg he just oh oh chopped him down your fuck's now son no and Marco just got on top of him a drop two hammers on a boom boom no gloves yeah yeah old-school yeah after that everyone started throwing leg kicks firmly believe we need to go back to no gloves firmly believe I can't emphasize it enough I think people would get less hurt I think it'd be more realistic you gotta have Rogan Fighting Championships on an Indian Reservation I don't think it makes sense I mean I'm beating a dead horse I know I'm a broken record I just don't think it makes sense to tape your wrists up your wrists are very vulnerable you shouldn't be able to just make a cast out of them and slam them into things I feel the same way about your ankles like imagine if you could tape your wrists up to the point where nobody or your ankle up to a point where nobody could ever get you in a foot lock cause your ankle is protected that would be ridiculous right well essentially when you get someone in or a wrist lock what are you doing you're pulling against the wrist well is that a valid technique okay a valid technique like a wrist lock like this very hard to do when someone's wrist is taped the fuck up when your wrists are all over here it goes all over your knuckles it goes all around your wrist he goes all around your wrist it makes it much more stable you can really dig into things it feels way better it feels way better to hit things because when you don't especially like my hand is bigger than my wrist so if I hit things on either side it'll be like more wobbly yeah you want it that you want that bitch taped up you know solid yeah and even if your hand is the exact same size as your wrist yeah it's just this is a joint that is super articulating look at this wrist and you look at all the stuff your wrist does your wrist is crazy you really think about joints is the only joint like it your knees don't do that shit I guess your shoulders are kind of crazy but your wrists when you're punching you would have to develop some sear strengthen your forearms to be able to be a really effective bare-knuckle fighter me truly bare-knuckle no wraps in your hands no nothing just truly bare-knuckle you would you would also learn that you must punch things with the top knuckles you have to and even then you could break them but if you start hitting people in the jaw like right there with this crack this fucking thing is just gonna break hit something in the forehead right here crack it's gonna break you gonna break them your elbows break them for sure you're gonna break up but with those gloves on you get away with that shit you can get away with that shit and you could you could pittypat guys you could do that more and just not even like try to find like specific spots just start hitting them you can't do that you have to make sure you're getting the soft tissue you got a target soft tissue you got to look for the job but it appears to the public to be more brutal right if you don't right listen man all you need to do is watch anybody kick somebody just think the fact that we let someone slam their fuckin chin and the some dudes face that is watch Jeremy Stevens when Jeremy Stephens fought Hannie Jake what's his name honey Jason remember honey Jason yeah Jerry Stevens hi Jason it is like the head kick to end all head kick Sam I don't remember it oh you guys aren't allowed to pull up like UFC footage I wish we could we should have a special exemption from I pass like maybe like promote bypass every time you use it that would be a great way to promote right they would let us yeah thing one time like they reached out and said like here's an account but then they never respond and I was like okay it would be a great way to promote it yeah I'll talk to the UFC I'll try to see what we can get in on your show you could talk about fights and and have no issues with pulling up that would be huge for him that would it's free they don't pay and and that's that's how people would do it at home they'd be hanging out with their friends going fuck remember that one fight put it on fine are you coming in New York this weekend anywhere no no because I gotta be there the next week anyways I got to go to Brooklyn again the following weekend geo is fighting Gordon Ryan's brother right that's gonna be amazing to be awesome man those guys are awesome yeah I love the level of jujitsu that's available right now it's just such a way better than ever I mean the level of just the purple belts these days would destroy purple belts of like eight years ago it's precious and it keeps going up and up to him like I was watching some videos today online instagrams huge delue he watch a technique and you could just watch it over and over again exactly that that makes that accelerates the learning process so much I was watching a clip today I watched like 15 times in a row it was cyborg doing that tornado guard pass on some big giant dude cyborg BJJ I think this thing he hit this giant dude with that tornado sweep you know he doesn't he gets under you yeah and spins and walls over him very very interesting too few people can do that is so strong yeah but that's what was post was about his post is about technique and strength is that like your technique is like the steering wheel but your strength is the engine yes I believe that I believe that yeah yeah I mean every top pro athlete has a serious strength and conditioning program you look at Gordon Ryan's body yeah look at that kid's body the kids are go Willa you know it's not it's not a coincidence that he's jacked as fuck and has awesome technique and taps cyborg yeah I think about how good cyborg is and then think about him tap and cyborgs and tap them pretty handily look at that sweet man boom that was our Lando Sanchez - that guy weighs 300 pounds exactly crazy that's why it's way crazy I'm big this is it look at this sweet look at this sweet leg up in the air and a hand to dance in between the legs and then he pushes the hip with his hand that's one of the greatest sweeps of all time a vault all the shit look at this he goes under his foot and he tucks him under and pushes him I'd like to know I can amaze I'd like to know where the left hand is at left hands on the hip watch how he rolls when he rolls him watch his left hand seized right hands on top the left-hand seat on the hip see it pushing where he hit though looks like curry time probably just getting anything that he can it's flat if you look at the way what was his left hamstring has got to be so strong oh dude he's a gorilla that left hamstring insane right but he it's not even just a hamstring cuz he looks to me like his foot sideways watch her he does it again look his foot is sideways like a sidekick look yeah look at that I mean it's like he's going against the inside of the leg this is what's even crazier the strain is like the abductor muscles yeah he's doing like this way and look at look at his left leg blocking dudes left arm yep look arms right like I'm sorry the right leg right right yeah it's amazing yeah and that guy he just swept is an ADC see gold medalist and he's 300 pounds and he's a really good wrestler he's a black belt in jujitsu that right there that just that he should just leave that on a loop at a school yeah well cyborgs are gorillas he's got a mate you see ever see his strength and conditioning routines I know that motherfucker doesn't play dude he's a gorilla he's a gorilla all the top guys oh yeah got to salsa and regalo doing dead yes let me ask you this is it better to just let the dead I was gonna ask you because of that when he dead lives he's a girl is that best way to do it do you tell me I don't know shit I don't know shit either yeah I would always think that the negatives are important I mean negatives for me are very important like for chin-ups I go way slower seems like every six months there's a whole new philosophy on strength like and it's totally the opposite of the last one so crazy there's like now the big thing is you know with intermittent fasting it's like okay there's all these diets and eat this and gluten that and all that and then now the new diet is don't eat for 18 hours that should work you know what's great about that is it makes you have a time every day where you can have the most fabulous meal ever because when I when I eat I'm starving and salads taste so good yeah and when you're not when you're not that hungry it fit now now I feel like if I'm not that I don't want to waste a meal because it's so much better when you're starving and you're out of control yeah yeah I eat that way most the time except on days when I know I have a really brutal workout in the morning like a weightlifting work I'll run fasted I'll do yoga fasted but if I'm gonna lift I want to have something I need I need some fruit or something it's almost 3:00 right now I haven't eaten at all yeah I'm fine fine you know it's uh it's a it's some interesting diet I hope that it isn't bullshit no it's definitely not bullshit I was never a morning person either like I never I never really looked forward to breakfast it was always at have I got protein bar or something just because I had to did you ever listen to my podcast I did with Dom de Augustin oh he's a scientist from I think his University of Florida but a ketogenic specialist does a lot of keto research and research on fasting and the benefits of fasting it he goes into the scientific benefits the proven benefits of fasting very very interesting stuff would eat what would that I would really want to direct you to that I want to fuck it up but it's for the Prevention of cancer really yeah ketone bodies in the blood increase cognitive improvements I just think we eat too much yeah it's thing we eat too much weird all time so easy yeah I like watching TV and snacking yeah we all do but if I'm watching Netflix and it's 9 o'clock at night I really shouldn't be it's no weird that a popcorn became the official food watching movies no weird I know it's loud chewing shit you can't hear dialogue and no one likes to say do this go let's go get some popcorn no one no one ever looks for popcorn unless they're at the movies that's a good point this is the only time it's not that good maybe at Disneyland because it's like yeah I forgot about popcorn fucking don't buy that while I'm here - mmm other than that like the circus movie Circus Circus Circus got peanuts into the mix maybe there's something about the popcorn that like the it's like genetically modified and it's like it helps with with the brainwashing just and the mom yeah probably opens you up it's microwave that's what it is girls this box with your head bro did you know that basically microwaves just kill everything right when you microwave your food you basically just don't have anything it's just like yeah nothing survived something run away right isn't it crazy that we haven't really improved upon microwaves like they mastered that shit forty years ago and it's still the same goddamn micro I know what's really bad for you they're gonna take out of microwave popcorn when you get microwave popcorn there's fats in there that your body just doesn't know what the fuck to do with that's why those things can sit on a shelf for so long those little packets yeah I think what is it what is the toxic ingredient in microwave popcorn that they're eliminating it's Alerus they decided all this shit kills you but we're gonna let yourself for two more years they didn't just make it illegal they've made a moratorium I think it's trans fats I think it just might be vegetable oil fats there's certain certain trans fats that are just your body's just like what in the fuck is this non-food yeah you're making me yeah we're talking about delicious protein bars before the show that give you the most unbelievable farts oh that's how I know I shouldn't be eating something yeah if I'm if I'm eating something and I'm just lighting the inside of my car on fire chemical here it is chemicals use the lining of microwavable popcorn bags including perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA are part of a class of compounds that may be linked to infertility in humans according to a recent study from UCLA an animal testing the chemicals cause liver cancer testicular cancer and pancreatic cancer so that's one thing but I know that they ban trans fats I might have conflated the two stories did because what is the ban of trans fats is the one where they're given them like all the like hostess cakes those bullshit cakes and the thongs that sit on a shelf forever ding-dongs are my favorite those things those those pop those pie cakes that you get from hosts it's like the lemon filling those are just trans fats to the gills the whole Twinkie myth that they last 20 years or whatever how long do they last we still like wink you and I were laying around fucking bored smoked a little weed watching some TV uptown so we got here man cabinet you had like ring-dings and Twinkies I might grab a Twinkie yeah if I'm starving if I was laying around yeah watch survival for Schilling I might eat a Twinkie Twinkies are like the worst wedding cake it's just well you know what I had last night at strawberry shortcake us popcorn makers could face long expensive road to lose trans fats okay this is why me I conflated it microwave popcorn makers could face a long difficult task ridding their snacks of trans fats US Food and Drug Administration proposal to ban the additive goes into effect so the u.s. is banning so the u.s. ban on trans fats is what I what I got confused with a significant that he's less ban on trans fats is like a given these people like two years isn't it crazy that they're there they're making a big deal out of this they're going after the trans fats but they don't go after like like like real shit like alcohols like killing people all day every day I know right it's like you say why don't you say this gonna kill you if you keep eating it yeah but it's off but you're going after trans fats yeah maybe it's like someone someone in the popcorn industry just pissed off in an illuminati america you don't want to go after them and this is just like a smear campaign by trans fats did you know they're bad for you once they know they're bad for you what about the that one drug that everyone's getting addicted to that's legal no it's it's like heroin it's morphine no no no very popular prescription oxycontin oh yeah oxycontin for sure fuck's your life 100% but if you have serious pain it also levy eight spain and the thing is can you can you just they're going after trans fats here it's crazy let them have their popcorn fuck it they're going they're making like news articles about it who googled after trans fat what about the eight hundred kids that go missing every year what about one chuckles well different different people go look for the okay that's true but these are different people these are food scientists yeah but I think the point is that this stuff that there's other ways to make food but the thing is I don't know what is the benefits of trans-fats does it make processing easier like why do they use that as opposed to like other healthy fats I don't know why it probably has something to do a shelf life maybe yes probably that's probably why it fucks you up too you gotta think about what a preservative is you know like someone was explaining did you see what's wrong with wheat or what's with wheat do you see that documentary maybe they were talking about roundup and glyphosate no roundup the stuff that they spray on some plants that they said well don't worry this only affects bacteria yeah 50s I said that well there's one that we're creating it this is one of the reasons why they allowed it to be used but what they're explaining in this documentary I don't know if it's true or not but what they were explaining was yeah you have bacteria in your body dummy like you're taking this stuff into your body they didn't say it that way you have bacteria in your body you're taking the stuff into your body that only kills bacteria it's gonna kill a part of your body like your body is partly bacteria in fact there's more bacterial cells in your body than there are human cells but that's just a fact of being a person so this is a crazy thing that they don't know that and they either know it and they did it anyway or they didn't know that in which the case what you're saying earlier they should have no business telling people what's the good science and the bad science they allowed that to go through yeah that's another example of bad science yeah it's well it's definitely example of maybe they didn't know when they first came up with the stuff yeah but as technology as advanced they haven't eliminated it either way whether they didn't know or they did know and there was a diabolical plan whatever it is it's just it's that science is bogus yeah but should you be allowed like we know diet cokes terrible for you should you be allowed to sell diet coke if you want but does most do most people know how bad Diet Coke is for you or diet soda I should say the most people know most people don't most people don't they don't know mostly part now and again once a month or so I'll have a diet coke I've been pretty good at keeping sodas out my life yeah yeah I discovered the Pellegrino mmm Pellegrino is great yeah just water with asthma I love it a delicious no I used to struggle with being at a restaurant and struggling what should I just drink water or can I get a fucking I might have a coke and then I have two cokes and then I feel guilty all night that struggle went on my whole life dude I've been drinking way too much water left Pellegrino the Pellegrino that Madame Perrier that that satisfies me enough yeah ZV is a good one too and there's a couple other like flavored waters there like more carbonated it's carbonated water raw Lacroix Lacroix is Pellegrino and carbonated waters is that bad for you is that gonna is it gonna come out that we get cancer from that are the bubbles fucking me up yeah they are what do they do just as bad as soda water is I mean it's just not good for you it is so don't let me it isn't Pellegrino it's the same thing and carbonated water is bad for your teeth in mass amounts I mean like one or two probably not a bad thing so we'll just drink what about in you once it gets in your stomach that do the bubbles do the bubbles like fuck you up gasps Illuminati bro they're all ideas those are those ideas in those bubbles getting you to like well buy into bombs yeah who knows maybe maybe they find out that the bubbles are going in your system do something a mad for you yeah right I mean I would anticipate I hope not sure hope it's completely benign because I heard we have heard about I drink the shit out of it I do too here long as it's plain carbonated while there would no added citric acid or sugar the answer is no the process of carbonation is a simple addition of pasteurized pressurized carbon dioxide gas in the plain water acids sugars and salt are not being added it's the addition of those ingredients that ups your risk for tooth decay so it's no harm at all so it's just carbonated water is just carbon dioxide gas or maybe that's an Illuminati dude stop freaking me out did you know the fungus is fucking like mushrooms they breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide like we do does that make it make it good it's like an animal more than it is like a plant they're closer to animals and there are plants fungus yeah fungus here like an animal most not really because it doesn't move I mean but it's closer to the animal removes that fungus that's the worst man that's worse but like mushrooms are there there's some sort of other thing they're not a plant fungus isn't a different kind of thing from another fucking planet man that's what I think you think our mushrooms aren't legal right they're not there's that recreation of mushrooms that ballot for to come in California any states already legalized mushrooms they should they should do it the same way they do with what they're gonna eventually do with MDMA look mushrooms are great so any process remember the first time you were living at your old we were chilling in the backyard dude we live yeah yeah we wasn't that much of a small dose yeah but it was enough to go whoa like it just gave me a better perspective just opened up my mind to that I was I was relying on all the patterns that had been explained to me about life to be correct instead of like looking at it with fresh eyes I felt like at 30 years old was the first time I was able to look at my my life with fresh eyes look at life itself and go oh this is just this weird temporary experience you could see it in your comedy tear your comedy just you know from from the early Joe Rogan like your first CD somebody someday I'm gonna be dead right I'm gonna be dead something I'm gonna be dead someday from that comedy to the once you started getting into psychedelics bingo difference yeah changes who you are because well it also makes you super humble because even if I don't appear humble when you when you get hit by that that the big dose whatever it is DMT or whatever you do when you get hit by that dose you realize you're just a part you're not the big thing it is a part of something that is indescribably big and the idea that you're important or that you're the most significant thing around you is pretty ridiculous like you got to do your best to keep your body alive and do your best to do your part and whatever the fuck you do for a living do your best at that but you're just a part of something that's infinite did your experience with mushrooms and DMT did that make you think there's got to be a creator to all this not that there's a creator like a guy in a lab it's like making a person inside of a fucking yes not not a creator in a sense of an individual but I think that the idea of an individual became more ridiculous than anything it's like I understand that like what we are is almost like something filtered through these predetermined like almost like we're a membrane like something from another dimension expresses itself through this physical membrane and then we're almost like the barrier to what comes out on the other side that this is the thought that I had when I was on mushrooms that what we are as a person is almost like the carrier like a vehicle for whatever a soul is and this thing uses this life to pass that that thing through on to another experience that happens in the next dimension that'll be so fucking alien that you can't even imagine it today in this dimension and this dimension would be alien to that dimension that it was just this never-ending infinite process of soul travelling I had this very bizarre like thought about like if you like people will often say look if you had to live your life over again you were born again tomorrow you got to do it all over again could you do it you like what oh my god I gotta start over from scratch I could be a baby again and rely on those same fucking people again oh my god I gotta go back to first grade that was terrible that's what my parents broke up and huh and people start freaking out and thinking but you already did it you already did it what if you have to do it forever could you do it forever forever and ever and ever over and over and over and over and over again could you do that like reincarnation you might be doing that that might be just as possible what would hit me is just as possible that you've lived this life an infinite number of times and you would continue to live this life an infinite number of time and when you do maybe so you're saying there's a possibility that we have some kind of soul type thing right I think I saw stability that you're on a loop yeah just like those those YouTube videos or those Instagram videos of cyborgs hitting that that sweep yeah we're on a life loop if so if there is a loop and let's say either either it's involuntary or voluntary either you say either when you die you wake up and you're whoa that was an awesome ride let's do it again or it just happens automatically you think you get the choice either way maybe you do maybe you don't some spiritual gurus say that yes you some people choose some Souls choose to keep coming back some stay in the infinite heavens forever or whatever and then come back some every now and then who knows what's real but you're talking about there's some kind of soul thing and there's either you're probably you're saying that that's probably involuntary reincarnation of some sort Yeah right so it's so amazing possible maybe either if if you decide to come back for sure if that's the case you would you would say okay I'm going I'm going back into that earth realm and you for sure don't want to know where you came from that it would seem I'm guessing that the beauty of life is after you dying you realize what the hell oh that's right you you don't want to know it's like watching a movie like the other day I watched a movie and I'm watching the trailer and 30 seconds into the trailers unsane the movie 30 seconds I stopped it because I didn't want to watch the rest of the trailer because now okay I got enough I want to see this thing I didn't want to see more to the trailer because I wanted to go to the movie and be full I didn't want to know what was going on I wanted to be confused I didn't want to be able to figure something out from a trailer so and most people are like that I'm not special like if you went to a movie and you already saw in your buddy did and you told them how it ended he would sock you right in the chest fuck you do and you just ruin the movie from you faggot you know the main strong word but I mean that I don't mean that in a homosexual way I'm sorry I'm just trying to be funny and I apologize to all gay people out there I apologize I love gay people I love gay people that was just me trying to express an emotion but and no one's also at the same time gonna go to a movie with you if you're ready sansei dude before it starts tell me the whole movie well I'm kind of better analogies that you never get a chance to see the future you're not gonna get a chance to see the future once you're reborn again this life when you come back do you want to have a memory of your past you don't you don't get that keeps it's a part of the system yeah I think even even whether it's voluntary involuntary it's best to not know where you came from it it's best to figure it out that's probably what this is all about is figuring it out because when we go to the movie part of it is it's all about the journey it's not about the destination people always use that as a you know an Instagram it's not about the journey it's our thought about the destination it's a journey that's one of the most popular sayings ever and it's beautiful you have to say it every now and then to remind you remind your mind another thing to remind you don't even think about it as a journey just be in the moment accept the moment and be in the moment live in the moment think about the future plan for the future but exist in the moment yeah you know don't think of it as a journey or as destination but the people that are the most fucked are the people that are trying to make it one day I'm gonna make it and then when you make there's no making it never happens it doesn't it doesn't change yeah yeah illusion I fell for it hook line and sinker oh my god the wanting to be a rockstar my whole life they got me good I wanted that mansion oh I was gonna have that mansion filled you know with chicks oh that's what I was after my whole life they got me good when I saw kiss and I saw that shit I'm like I want that I knew right right when I saw kiss meets the Phantom of the Park 1978 on NBC one of the worst movies of all time oh it just blew me the fuck there was a power outage I was watching at home the power went out I was devastated the weird thing about that got arrows 1978 and if you followed kiss if you were old and I was 8 and if you followed kiss me you know from 73 on they already had their early cool years and then after kiss alive had a few more awesome albums and then they got to the point where I started doing disco and that was 1978 that's when I got into him when they started doing disco so I didn't I didn't even know what's selling out was I just heard I was made for loving it I loved it you know I mean I had no idea but I'm ya know my fucking point was what were we talking about I don't remember either the point was you're never gonna get to know what the future holds you're just gonna be living your life and that's how it is with everybody I don't remember what the fuck your point was oh the Rockstar thing though you wanted to be a rockstar right they'd get you they've gets you there's so many different ways they can think what do you know you get yourself you get yourself too you gotta you gotta think about what you're exposed to but look it's like music videos what they sell in music videos they sell that it's like they're offering a good look I got and and a lot of those rappers that are flashing all the cash is not even their money it's not even their mansion but it's pushing that you like pushing like you want to do whatever it takes whatever it takes to make it I was so zeroed in on that you know me up until up until a few years ago I was a zeroed in on it then I began to realize wow they got me real goddamn good you know I was obsessed with some some an illusion Fame is an illusion well you're obsessed with the destination instead of the journey right well I enjoyed the journey but it was like I'm saying you're obsessed with it was all about conquering the music business that's all it was about and it's not about that anymore obviously thank God thank God I sucked musically because if I would have had a record deal in my 20s shit I would have did some crazy Illuminati shit back then I would have did whatever I said whatever just I would have been to those parties with the crazy mask parties with the crazy eyes wide shut thank God my music sucked because I would have went along with all that shit in my 20s I was so obsessed I was so obsessed with making it in the music business I wouldn't do anything but you wouldn't have done that yeah party to Jimmy Savile hanging out with whoever was famous no shit well you know it's like retirement is a lesser example that people are always looking for those golden years one day I'm gonna retire and yeah thing with our hands at the sunset like yeah no you're thinking about death don't do shit anymore you know I have nothing to do you know the only time you should think about retirement is if you have a job that you can retire and they pay you still and then you can go do whatever the fuck you want that's what you have been thinking about retirement but thinking about is this time we're finally we get to really put our feet up and yeah and then they turn you into Soylent Green yeah your turn you in the photon switch you were really great aiming for yeah and you know and everyone is is working to get that vacation and some faraway Beach where they could have a beer and the destination is that they could go far away at least five to eight hours you got it you guys can't use you can't use uses you have here these beaches don't count they they count for people in on the East Coast they count because they come here but you live here so it doesn't count you got to get on a flight and get on it go to a goddamn Beach it looks just like Malibu just like you got a trap chasing that Beach and then what are you on the beach the first thing you're gonna do is check to see if there's internet that's the first fucking thing you're gonna do and then every time you go to the airport you see that picture of like some dude just laying there on some deserted beach like that's even possible I thought that was possible I thought if I could desert that you have your own deserted Beach you know then I don't see that off camera out of the frame of the picture is a bunch of people trying to sell you an inner tube and some just you know people trying to rip you off and sell you shit they don't show that part they just show your feet is your feet in a beer if you have a perfect beach like that you're gonna sell it to a bunch of people and stuff just give me just one dude unless you want those Richard Branson guys that's when you go full baller your own Beach well yes yes you have to let those those only exist for jay-z you know what I mean you gotta buy an island well those Richard Branson type dudes or Tyler Perry's got an island and it just seems like these vacations are all like ripoffs I remember me my wife went to Cabo San Lucas and we looked at the package like oh shit let's get this resort there's five different restaurants amazing all-inclusive this is amazing you get there and it's the same kitchen five different restaurants but only one is open at a time they just take different shifts and it's the same waiters the same food come on Cass place yeah there's a good place in in Cabo
