the Joe Rogan experience you know I remember coming back and his kid beat the shit out of me Bobby Buckley and my father said what are you doing at home you better go back out there what go back out and fight him against it fucking all right yeah but I you know there's a lot of different ways to be like in Charlestown growing up I mean I was I grew up with some guys that were like unbelievable like you know there's a there's a whole morale thing maybe or a social thing about say robbing a bank I mean would that ever freaking cross your mind no but that's a Charlestown thing that's one thing that was true about that movie the town but but what I was in awe of people that would do it it's like where do you get the balls that you know and I'll never forget this friend of my Joey Rocco who's no longer with us so I see him up at government somebody remember government center yeah so I see him up there and he's got like his lunch and I said Joe are you doing and he's kind of blew me off then I see him a week later he says hey Swain's what's up I said what's up when you blew me off a week ago he said oh I'm so sorry I was waiting to rob crimson travel and I had my gun there and I was interested I was interrupting his work so he came into Nick's comedy stop of 400 people I did fantastic I was like practically a standing ovation whatever so Joe's in the audience right and I I so I talked him afterwards so there's a number of things he could say like jeez I liked this show I didn't like your show good for you getting out of Charlestown he gave me this look I was like wow it's gonna be a lot of money in here I said you think I'm here to case the joint for you it was unbelievable we used to uh part of the thing at Buck Shaw stop growing up let see how to shoplift that was did you do that when you were a kid like sure I got caught shoplifting candy why yeah you were bad you probably was terrified right again terrified I got brought into a manager's office I think it was 12 oh yeah I got in trouble I was terrible to I was so paranoid but anyway there was a department store called Jordan Marsh and my job was to catch the football they throw me the football I catch it and run down Tremont's Street so we just you know stolen a football right so that's that was a gig so one time I'm up there and uh this other kid system he pick up the end of this Cano I said what he said grab the end of the Kanoa still in a fuckin kanuto but so we're walking down watch that Street in Boston with a Cano right now mm I don't know where you're from but it's not a big item in Charlestown canoes in the projects you know and I mean it's like not that you couldn't fence it the nothing's like the four of us though the chemistry with the finalists yeah can't fuck with it no it is the best and it's the most fun by far is the most fun tries a different dynamic yeah but they're talking over my god tried to listen to it you did I try to listen to side with you dudes I want to know what it sounded like we were talking over everybody it's terrible I did that drunken Hein a long time it was awesome there's people for whatever reason love those kind of chaos shows like that Alex Jones Show they love chaos they love it they love drunk and stoned and an interdimensional child molesters and fucking they love all that shit they love it off the charts nuts dad Alex Jones one though I told you I've never been a fan of his then I watched only gotta like him now people mad at me some people are mad at me but you know there's nothing I could do about that they're gonna be mad at me anyway but one of the things that they were saying was you know fuck you for they were saying given him a platform for normalizing him I'm like you can't understand that's how I know him I know him like that that's how I know him I know that guy yes that guy that came on here and this is a guy that by the way on his show said he's gonna kick my ass and break my legs and fucking all kinds of crazy shit and I want to fight it with UFC fight I'm a offer I'm a million dollars like I I knew I knew him I know the real him I'm like when we're not in front of each other you could say crazy shit like I'm immune man I don't care I don't care anymore let's he's doing an entertainment show he is doing entertainment but but when I know is the Alex Jones that was here and by the way he was right about a lot of shit a lot of crazy should they were saying about about fucking human Pig hybrids that they're working on those and actually making human Pig hybrid fetuses that's real they really are the problem is he throw so much shit out there at one time I don't know what to believe exactly and you gotta go state start start over again what what's happening on the moon he's for sure crazy yeah but he's he's great but I think that crazy is OK and it's entertaining and I'm not a fucking child so if you want to nerf the world and make the world so that only children can watch everybody cuz like make make things that that their own that are safe for everyone including children well I I don't want that I'm a discerning adults I'm pretty rational and I can figure out what's real it's nonsense but I don't look at the political spectrum of people when I'm looking at their to write you you have a bio they are you're biased and you're you're targeting specific individuals because your rules support this perspective no well so can you be clear though and like what rules support that prism specifically the the easiest one is misgendering right because that's so clearly ideological if you ask a conservative what is misgendering they'll say if someone is biologically male and you call them you know a biology man you called a machine that's miss gender as a conservative view the the the progressive view is inverted so now you actually have in your policies a a rule against the conservative perspective I have a rule against the abuse and harassment of trans people on our platform that's what my rules we just give context in the background of why that is and I brought some some research so we obviously received a lot of feedback so we don't make these rules in a vacuum it just to be clear we have a bunch of people all around the world who give us context and the types of behavior they're seeing how that translates into real-world harm and they give us feedback and they tell us like you should consider different types of rules different types of perspectives different like for example when we try to enforce hey we'll conduct in our hateful conduct policy in a particular country we're not going to know all the slur words that are used to target people of a particular race or a particular religion so we're going to rely on building out a team of experts all around the world who are going to help us enforce our rules so in the particular case of misgendering I'm just trying to pull up some of the studies that we looked at but we looked at the American Association of Pediatrics and looked at the number of transgender youths that were committing suicide it's an astronomical I'm sorry I can't find it right now in front of me it's a really really high statistic that's like 10 times what the normal suicide rate is of normal teenagers and we looked at the causes of what that was happening and a lot of it was not just violence towards those individuals but it was bullying behavior and what was what were those bullying behaviors that were contributing to that and that's why we made this rule because we thought and we believed that those types of behaviors were happening on our platform and we wanted to stop it now there are exceptions to this rule we don't and this is all it this isn't about like public figures and there's always gonna be public figures that you're gonna want to talk about and that's that's fine but this is about are you doing something with the intention of abusing and harassing a trans person on a platform and are they viewing it that way and reporting it to us so that we take action so so I will just state I actually agree with the rule I'm from you know my point of view I agree that bullying and harassing trans people is entirely entirely wrong I disagree with it but I just want to make sure it's clear to everybody who's listening my point is simply that you know ben shapiro went on a talk show and absolutely refused and that's his shit you know and he's one of the biggest podcasts in the world so if you have all of his millions upon millions of followers who are looking at this rule saying this goes against my view of the world and it's it's literally 60 plus million in this country you do have a rule that's ideologically bent and and it's it's true you you did the research you believe this well then you have Ben Shapiro who did his research and doesn't believe it yeah and I relied on the American Association of Pediatrics and you know Human Rights Council another and I'm sure he has his sources too for when he gives his statements the point is but at least wonder if they have that context I mean that's and that's where we have also fits it's as well as just explaining the why behind a lot of our eyeballs hidden reasons I I would agree and I think it's fine you did research and you found this to be true but we can't simply say maybe ben shapiro and the other conservatives who feel this way don't know we have to we can't you know the point I'm trying to make is it's it's simply whether you believe it what whether you justify it or not is not the point the point is you do you do have this rule that rule is at odds with conservatives period well I think I think that you're you're generalizing but I think it is really important as Jack said to the why behind these things the why is to protect people from abuse and harassment on our pot I understand but you essentially created a protected class if this is the case because despite these studies and what you know these studies are showing there's a gigantic suicide rate amongst trans people period it's a forty percent it's it's outrageously large now whether that is because of gender dysphoria with us because of the complications from sexual surgery sexual transition surgery whether it's because of bullying whether it's because of this awful feeling of being born in the wrong gender whether that all that is yet to be determined the fact that they've shown that there's a large amount of trans people that are committing suicide I don't necessarily think that that makes that makes sense in terms of people from someone's perspective like a Ben Shapiro saying that if you are biologically female if you were born with a double X chromosome you will never be XY if he says that that's that's a violation of your policy and this is you're creating a protected class to be to be fair targeted express that opinion so it's easily entitled to express that opinion you know our bodies will be living differently in a world that's two degrees warmer than they are today we can't really predict what those impacts will be but they could be quite dramatic and they could be things that we can't even imagine today because they're you know by some counts millions of bacteria inside us that we haven't even identified yet Jesus Christ you're freaking me out David god damn it it's a crazy world out there well not just crazy but it seems like when you're talking about things like this when you're talking about climate change affecting our actual gut parasites or gut biome and that this literally could change the way human beings behave I mean these are all things that I've never heard discussed and it it just it's really terrifying really is you know I mean and part of the problem is people here like I'll relax everything's fine this is this constant thing that we do where if it's not affecting us currently right now in the moment it's not a fire in front of us we don't worry about it it's a weird compartment compartmentalization thing that human beings do yeah and it's you know we you think that evolution would have trained us differently you think that evolution would have trained us over time to have at least some long-term capacity and I guess we do have some long-term planning capacity but it's we choose to think in really short term way is just about all the time if people don't understand they think just because someone doesn't have the best vocabulary or because they don't have a comprehensive education that they're not intelligent that's a big mistake no person's intelligent I remember going to the Catskills when I was I won the World Junior Championships in Santo Domingo Dominican Republic and I remember that American team was saying oh wow you never fought the best Maya in fact the best I thought Americans had the best team yeah but one guy is like taking plans and his manager don't like taking plans either so I'm like who's that and he told me was Mike Tyson custom model so me and my trainer we left Canada and we drove all the way up there and while we were up there I erase the Radek was up there and they said Oh raisin really came to inspire with us so okay I'll spar with you I'm here for four days so first time Tyson actually met me you know he was nice guy a really nice guy took me in his room showed me some old flicks that I've never seen before of all time fighters would tell me about each fighter like he studied them and then you know this is where he got his old star is his style of fighting from and first day in the first they in the gym bell went he came across and he was trying to kill me like you know I did my Muhammad Ali thing obviously stayed away from his power but the first day was really hectic and then the second day was lactic and that got better as it went along and the last day is I got actually the better of him the last day and I remember custom Allah's saying Mike you gotta meet him someday don't you do that and not always echoed in my mind that will we ever fight will we ever fight cuz cus D'Amato said that we're gonna fight well and it did happen and there's footage of it Wow Lennox has the footage of it footage of the train soaring how old was Tyson at the time Tyson was like a use about 52 no no how old was he at the time what time fifteen he was younger than me I was long he's about 17 Wow [Applause]
