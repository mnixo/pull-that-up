hello freak bitches well you did some guys who just get trapped in a persona we were just talking about emo Philips the other night cuz emo Philips is apparently back to his persona he let it go for a long time and he just started just being a guy on stage talking about shit apparently that the people weren't into that and she's like alright I give the people what they want that's the story I tell by the way I just clarify this is what I've heard I haven't seen him but this is like um you know Robin was Williams was my best pal and he got me a job on on a Snickers commercial and I needed Bret and he was so nice he's like oh you know you know so I want you to use my friend you know the buff cat he's got to be in it you know and it like it like you know he actually put their feet on the fire and they had to hire me and then he goes he's I don't take the first money just the way you know tell him no so I don't know and then they came back with more and way you know I mean he was great right right so then he cause what because you know they're gonna want you to do the voice are you okay doing the voice and I go for the amount of money Snickers is paying I will fuck a Snickers bar on camera by the way I should say it's a really candy but it's my all-time favorite yeah you know I I said I was gonna go but it's something I will will address a little bit and talk about you know Robin had um his coroner's report came out and he had Lewy body dementia and that is a it's a form of dementia that is very rarely ever discovered when someone's alive it's usually discovered in their their autopsy so he had this form of dementia I witnessed it it was missed diagnoses Parkinson's ah and I I witnessed this eyewitnesses processing reality completely different than the way everybody else does what causes it it's um I'm not sure if it's a gene or what but I mean it is sadly his brain was riddled with this and so when I think about that I think about how strong he was you know you would have like some days you have a lot of days where he was doing kind of OCD stuff and processing things and correctly but then you'd have a day where he was back so you go oh well maybe shut a bad day or no maybe it's the Parkinson's drugs and they've got to get those dialed and you know he had he was going to divert he's in therapy he was doing and it just the only reason I talked about that is his brain was giving him misinformation complete misinformation and I don't if some people die from depression and and my heart goes out to them but that's not what killed him he he he really was getting this information from his own brain and was suffering from this disease so I just put that out there because I folks know that we were friends in there although ask me about it and and and I would like a spot like put on the disease that actually in my mind was what was responsible for its demise ah cuz you know a lot of people say did he ever talk about suicide ago or comics we talked about suicide for 33 years you know sometimes when we talk about other shit you know hey congratulations on the Oscar well thank you how would you do it I don't I think a car yeah but I just say that because he fought you know that's what we do I don't know about you but a comic that's what we do we fight depression things don't add up it doesn't this world doesn't seem right we go and we spew about it and I feel better right on a selfish level I don't really give a rat's ass you know I vent and I feel better hmm and and and he fought it and that wasn't it wasn't depression it wasn't career wasn't you know he'd been sober most of his adult life you know so so it's very disturbing to me that a lot of people were trying to tribute all sorts of reasons for what he did it and yeah there was a lot of like well that's men's rights groups that were tribute to his divorce settle down sir yeah there was a whole thing that's where this guy was doing this video where and I even talked to him about but yes it's it's yeah it's it's he he had a disease he had a disease that cause dementia that I witnessed I didn't have anybody I talked to more you know I talked to him in text and everyday I didn't have a buddy that I talked it more so trust me it it wasn't the divorce right it was it wasn't his family it wasn't we have the same agent so like when this guy was saying this is what when the reason why I pissed me off cuz this guy was saying that you know he's in financial ruins like no he wasn't no he was wealthy yeah yeah and also it's it's a it's yeah I mean no one wants to because what as human beings were trying to make sense of why why that happened and why that happen in my opinion which is right what's his brain was who would know more than you was in his brain was getting misinformation and he was processing reality completely wrong I mean I won't go into details but I did witness him thinking things that weren't real were happening and to me in the middle of the night and that's the other thing like people say oh he wasn't in the same bedroom as his wife it's like yeah because he was having seizures and he didn't like to wake her up oh it's not a question of somebody not getting along I didn't mean to get no person no no man and I don't mean to talk about about his his uh that's okay his home life because you know Susan's a wonderful gal and and and it's just sad you know ya know it's awful that's the one of the scariest things is talking to someone who's whether it's a loved one father mother that's losing their grip and I think people wish they were courteous to a point but I don't think they they take his his kids in the consideration and friends and people worked with him for all these years and I guess I can't expect them to you know I mean I'm sure I've taken shots at people when they pass way but it's just it's like people would come up and they'd go did you hear what did you hear what Rush Limbaugh said and I'd be like I don't care what what she says I'm dealing with people who dealt with them on a daily basis let me ask you this what is it what is this impulse that people have to denigrate people right after they die it's almost like everyone else is everyone else is talking about that like I saw a lot of that with prints when it was revealed that Prince was suffering through opiate addiction yeah and I was like there was like even gene Simmons had some crazy shit and he had to apologize and I'd seen some other people say - but what it's almost like it's a crunch a contrarian thing like everyone else is saying oh we lost his genius well you get heat from it mm-hmm and I'm sure in gene Simmons is you know I'm sure there's a jealousy thing but you say look I used to say outrageous things about people and and this bomb would go off and I would get I would get some heat now get some buzz right and I stopped doing that I made a decision I got you know realizing that these weren't just harmless things I was saying right right right you just yeah yeah you know it was yeah because you're a lot of that when Kurt Cobain died - yeah but you know and that's the I wasn't besties with Kurt but I did know my toured with Nirvana yeah Kurt like my standup and asked me to go on the road with them I did a bunch of date yeah we talked about it but but I I mean it wasn't like the situation with Rob but but I did have times in my life where I spent hours with Kurt with no one else sitting around talking and laughing you know um I don't know why we want to do that I think I think I think we try to make sense of it I think we try to make sense of it I think I think that's where a lot of conspiracies come from I think when when someone who's in our mind reached the American Dream and then they die or yeah look or or take their life or overdose we have to say well they had it all and that what we believe is the ultimate fulfillment and happiness you know that America is the People's Republic a Spring Break you know where no one's pursuing fulfilment everyone's pursuing happiness you know there's two different things I'm really fulfilled am I happy am i laughing all day I might know but you're happy sometimes I'm happy a lot of the time yeah well I've never met happier you like if I didn't know that you this nuanced guy that's very thoughtful and you have a lot of opinions and you're always considering on sitive if I just took like if I tried to form a view of you based on you and I talking we're always laughing yeah I would say Bobcat so jolly every time I talk to him it's like laughs and hugs and but it is true and it's and it's uh because we never see each other before noon first of all but it's a it's a it's a daily reprieve it's a daily decision you know I get up the squirrels are up before I do and I and I beat them down and then it turns and when I'm directing on a set I'm like I can react and fear or I can just sit here for a second or two and it always usually works out very rarely do I have to say no again this is you just sit there I think so much of show business everything's based on fear and people thinking someone's going to say you screwed up or you didn't do it right or you didn't get extra takes and all that sudden but man my job is really not to to freak out hmm I'm really happy right now
