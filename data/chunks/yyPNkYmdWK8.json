the girag and experience we were telling stories this weekend about like like one time at okay one time one morning I thought I was my parents are out of town my little sister was 10 I was probably 21 I was drinking a lot at the time cuz you know party animal shit and then I was pissing a lot of places that like in around houses like I pissed on my ex-girlfriends dining room table and was walked in by her dad do you want to talk about a fucking nightmare Oh what wait a minute wait a minute you pissed on the dining room table down Mehta and her dad walked and caught you her dad Larry medic in Orlando Larry if you're listening I I what I'm guilty I so here's okay because I never really accepted blame for it I would said it never fucking happen cuz it because I would didn't want it because I didn't want okay why did you do it was Thanksgiving it was right after the Rolling Stone magazine came out and so and I go back to party what do you mean the Rolling Stone magazine with the number of the really stone in 1997 called me the number one party and I'm on the country just for someone who's not doesn't know and then that was a big deal I became famous and I became famous in like Tampa Florida Tampa Tallahassee Gainesville Orlando anywhere that I had people with four one two four two state lived I was fit you they knew who I was they were like that's the fucking party guy so if I went out shots really weed any do people put drugs in my hand like it was fucking insane I get roofied I got roofied a couple times so you became like a sort of a celebrity party or I became the guy that I'd walk after the before the article I was just a loud fun shirtless guy on top of the bar getting everyone in a frenzy and then when the article came out it was like the fucking linemen would come to the bar I drank at Yanni's and they pulled me aside they're like you drink with us tonight we want to drink with the party animal and then I just be up with these line in like four linemen and we'd be just doing shots and shot a shot and these guys are 350 pounds oh my god - 218 at the time probably like going through 218 and probably more like 225 but but and so I became like like I say famous I think I say like reality-show famous like the way Snooki first season was you know so that's how you were in your town and you're in Ocala has if I went any right after that article came out in Tallahassee definitely in Orlando I knew 40% of the bar knew who I was in Tampa everyone knew who I was back when people actually read magazines the Rolling Stone stuff was crazy when that came out
