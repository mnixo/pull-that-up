the girag and experience the cards did you ever have a comedy card no never had we had a card once to promote a website that I put out to promote my website hey there's that there was never one for like like you know I'm appearing in this town like with it like pointing to the right and the peaks so someone told me what am i coming to you someone told me that I'm my track record is this and then i'll tell you what somebody told me George Carlin said but at least I wish I could have said I never had a card but i'm proud to say if i'm gonna be a hundred percent honest i had one for like a month and then I just didn't like the smell of it I got rid of it as you know yeah i was like no Todd glass comedian I was like shit I think I saw some other comedian with a car to me I should have cards you know and then I got rid of him so now I'm glad because someone said somebody at the George Carlin was talking about cards backstage at the comedy magic club and basically said he was kinda Jenna you mean he doesn't have a fucking card you know and then the comedian that had the card sort of felt like he took them very quickly over to the trash because he had just gotten cards yeah that's that was a thing about headshots back in Boston anybody who's any good had a shitty headshot they didn't give a fuck about their headshots right right and you'd see that same that same path they would talk about it like if you hire a photographer to do your headshot you fucking suck on stage did always say that that was like it does look like just such an unspoken are there exception yes but no mostly that's such a great well there's something that makes you want to take a picture of yourself and be all sexy looking that's uber douchey yeah it doesn't translate into comedy you know there's some guys who could ham it up like I remember Kevin Knox had like a really zany like head shot but it worked for him cuz that was like his act like he was a wild energetic guy what if I i talked about how bad that is and i agree with you but then you guys pull online a picture of me with mine she was a phone we took this picture of you i got that with the shoe yeah i was act like it was a phone nobody did that then no it was really the first I thought it was real for sure when I was a kid I was like they SAT it on TV they said it's a Bigfoot the guy got Bigfoot but then when you watch it like slow down and then enhanced and then you look at how little detail you're really seeing like everything's all flush like that everything's like bright like the leaves and trees it's almost white like there's no detail at all sure so you're pretending that you see all this detail in this monkey suit but ignoring the fact you can't see the fucking trees you know where's he going he's very much a lot about it it's a girl supposedly Oh where's she going I'm just gonna go get some dicks baby dick that's often it would what a big kind of nonchalant like oh I got spotted ok I'm off to lunch like you know there's no real purpose out look at this like to me is like there's like some moments where she picks her feet up or it or he Bob hieronymus yeah and the bottom of the feet it's fucking have used man morn big feet big rubber feet like that you gotta really throw your legs up higher and it's definitely a parent and that was one of the things that they said that the gate was off it was hilarious I was talking to this expert when I was doing the sci-fi show he was arguing to death with me about this he was like the average gate of a human being so it was like you know nine degrees but the Bigfoot is like 25 degrees I go oh you mean you would have had to do this so then I started walking around like big fun like what the fuck man like you're supposed to be scientists like you're crazy that's a guy in a suit but it's like a it's a cryptozoological Jesus like you're not supposed to fuck with the patterson-gimlin footage they all believe it I have not talked to one of those dudes who are like crazy Bigfoot fanatics who think it's a hoax well they're all so fucking wanna believe I got so high once i believe for 15 whole minutes I thought for a second and we were at the ice house and we were doing a comedy show and then we start talking shit and we played the footage and we were so baked I was looking at the video and I was like oh my god what if it's real and I'm just an asshole what if it's real and this whole time I've been denying with the greatest discovery cryptozoological history and I'm just being a dick but then I sobered up well you know it's like wanting to know believe in real monsters I mean the Loch Ness monster is another one I mean that every culture has won the Loch Ness monster has got to be the biggest pussy of all time because he never kills anybody how do you get to be a monster's I caught a whale may just think I'm missing people because they they're taken under the water your opinion though your expert opinion what is that what's what are we looking at for the Patterson footage just for the record what are we looking at okay an innocent man in a suit yeah hundred percent right ninety-nine percent Jesus Christ he's a fucking special-effects expert and these knuckleheads like thurs ways that the legs move you just can't do with the human frame they want to convince themselves so bad that a con man figured out how to find Bigfoot and did it in like a day you know lying is your new book and what it's a there's a really important thing that you you bring up and it's not on the front part of this I read it online somewhere that you can avoid a lot of problems in your life yeah simply by not lying almost almost all of them we have the of all the ones that are avoidable yeah yeah when you just look at how people screw up their lives lying is if it's not the reason it's the thing that enabled the other reason it just it's people complicate their lives massively by a willingness to deceive others and and emits that this has many features to it one is just there all the things you you can do based on the cover that lies provide that you shouldn't be doing because they're not good for you and no and everyone would hate you if they knew you were doing them or your wife would leave you or whatever whatever it is and so the lies lies create a space in which you can let your life run off the whale run off the rails whether it's becoming an addict or or you know perpetrating financial frauds or whatever it is but there's there's also this component where you don't actually you never actually discover who you are in social space if you always leave yourself this out of line so it's like you never discover if you keep canceling plans with people and just tell this white lie that you're too busy or you're not feeling well you never have to confront the fact that these are people you actually don't want to see you know you're like you know people in your life who want to go out to dinner with you you don't want to see them and you're never having to confront that because you have this out that you're just going to lie you know yeah and and and there's it's just if you want amid there's actually no change in a person's life that I think is more important in terms of getting your life straight your relationship straight you're just getting into the future without screwing it up for yourself there's no more important change then then a commitment to being honest in in whatever the situation is that presents itself i was a freshman at Stanford I took a course with a professor who I actually interview in the back of the book Ronald Howard who is a really a brilliant guy who started a whole academic field called decision analysis in the 60s and it's it's a it's a mechanism which allows someone to make as rational a decision as possible by putting all of their information about a topic into into a essentially a calculation it's got nothing to do with with with line or honesty but he's a professor in the engineering economic systems department Stanford and he is kind of a sideline to his his academic work was teaching these these courses on ethics and one course was just on the question whether it's ever ethical to lie and so as a freshman I was sort of put in the machine of this course and came out the other side convinced that in virtually any situation apart from like a self-defense situation where your things have really broken down and you're not in the presence of someone who you're going to collaborate with line is just unacceptable it's just not it's not how I want to live it's not how anyone should want to live if they look at it closely enough
