[Music] that's the other thing judo guy MMA and sauna sports the the memes the use of social media so it really gets so cool man well unless you Ronda Rousey's do that Nunez fight so many fucking people you know those mean mean mean what do you think she's coming back no I don't think she is yeah I'm you know I don't think I don't think if she does she should come back in a calculated manner like don't just rush in and fight for the title like she did I think that's crazy taking a year off getting head kick knocked out you know where's your head out like and was she a hundred percent committed to this as far as like training for the entire time off or did she just get in really good shape over the last few months and had she been training at all before then I mean you have to ask her and answer all those questions but if she doesn't want to be fighting she shouldn't be fighting you know but you know Emma shot in from the beginning had movement had movement so I assumed they worked on the hip movement I just think the pressure in the way she comes to the angry face and all that shuts her down and and you know it's too much pressure a whole Hollywood career writes on it I mean that's not gonna happen now right right i mean because buddy the rosa we talked about no footwork no but that's what nerves can do to you I would you I'd like to see a Ronda with a smile on her face go to the ring being relaxed and calm send her away go to a Duane Ludwig for a year and have some smokers because you can still legally do that in other clubs just striking you know to just get in that moment that to see where you went I think in training this is the problem that everybody has you know in training you always do good a lot of guys did good but you know as well as I do there's these gym guys are really good in training they can't do it on a pressure so if she's been boxing and working on a striking and she's been hitting people left they're right there they got some good people coming and I heard that she that works out even with extra boxing champions or grill against hers yeah but then again you know that that's a nice safe environment bringing it under pressure with all the crap she had on her shoulders I thought Saul so noonas is a very dangerous pancha didn't Strikeforce man right away Hicks right away her kicks or punches she kicks and punches so fucking hard and she has long arms man and she puts you on the end of these long punches and she dinged Ronda very early right you could tell she was rocked she goes right on back into the whole fight that's what I think happened there and there's also leans all the way over so it's hard to take her down you know and run this you know so you know and maybe she's doing I'm just saying what I don't see you know maybe start wrestling over as well Intel because a girl like that with so much talent she'll pick that up so fast but if she suddenly shoots for a singer she comes but she'd already been rocked so I think that because remember she shut her off clinch is always upper body couch and she always reaches him with the left arm like this you know Chris Jackson Holly Holm fight that they had she comes at you she got that left arm extended tries to get a hold of girls at the left arm hip toss ISM gets him on the ground armbar ISM and they just were so prepared what is it that was gonna say interesting that home shift mmm from boxing dem ma just trained for Ronda Rousey fight Cory car brand remember says a kickboxing and boxing champ but I'm saying in terms of her MMA prep the goal was Ronda Rousey right and now with Cody Garr Brandt he talked about in high school Dominick Cruz and you think you wonder well the the laser focus right the television obviously you have to work on everything but if that's your target and you see what he did to Cruz eyes well there's no fighters like [Music]
