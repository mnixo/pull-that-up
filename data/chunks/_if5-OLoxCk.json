have a new alpha brain that's coming out it's called alpha brain source for all you folks in the UK that have much more restrictive laws when it comes to nutritional supplements like they can't even get vitamin b6 over there and some herb in some places in Europe that's right strange rant yes yeah so our alpha brain was considered a drug so it takes it out does it put anything else in no well it's just different alternative ingredients okay that have similar effects and so we're still fucking with it right now a hipster ingredient um it's you know it might be better for some people that find the original alpha brain is hard to take like some people get nauseous from it and some people it doesn't make them feel good it's it's it's real weird it's like everybody has a different everybody has a different biological setup I know I feel like I was a little sensitive to it yeah but I took a lot yeah I took two in the morning two at night and I think that was too much I took three once in one dose three or four and one dose I'll forget and I did not feel good yeah and I was like maybe this is what people feel like all the time everybody's got a different tolerance for caffeine for anything but for me two is good I take 2 alpha brains and it's just and it's not that shit from that movie what is it with the Cooper's yeah it's just vitamins to hang its cognitive functions all it is enhance just like vitamins enhance your health it's very subtle but effective I enjoy it and the most important thing about any of the honored products is there's a hundred percent

expensive I urge you please if you're interested in nootropics to go online google the subject look into it there's a lot of interesting studies behind it and I personally have been studying in them and experimenting with them for a long time now and I like it I like the effects and if you think that that on it alpha brain is too expensive go to the website and steal the ingredient list just look at it's all online the exact amounts are online go buy in bulk and make your own stuff and I hope it works I swear to god I am way more concerned with people not feeling ripped off than I am for making money that's why we make it as easy as possible I never sent money back gaurantee to don't forget that so enjoy it or don't enjoy but there's a bunch of different cool products that we have out now one of them is called shroom tech sport and it's excellent for anybody who's really into working out if you're really and if you do anything that's like super strenuous you know you you're you know you're doing running or like some serious weightlifting class or something like that anything you do will you really exert yourself it's an amazing supplement it's great for jiu-jitsu I love it for for any kind of athletic stuff but if you're not into working out like Brian doesn't even take that shit doesn't help yo-yoing we also have a shroom tech the shrimp tank is based on all the information it's a tonic calm oh and nit calm but it's based on the Quartus of smush room which is a mushroom that actually enhances your body's ability to process oxygen and people like in higher climates and animals and higher climates eat it and they actually get energy and that's how they figured out this stuff works we also have a shroom tech immune which is an immune supplement and basically the way this one works was it's been explained to me as your body doesn't understand what this mushroom is I mean it thinks it may be like a bug thinks he may be sick so your body's immune system fires up for a fight that never comes right and so then your immune system is just like on Full Tilt you know it's it pumps it up which it's really I'm really into probiotics I drink kombucha tea every day I take acidophilus I might take live cultures that's why cutters never get sick cutters yeah like people themselves yeah and their body thinks they're dying so really that's what you have to do or he would never get sick just give yourself a little cut every day yeah yeah I don't think it works that way ciao we also have new mood which is a 5htp supplement which is a little serotonin booster and again like I said please study all this stuff online 100% money guy back guarantee always and right now yeah you have a special coupon don't you I saw it yeah what the fuck is

else that's tuning in Peter Joseph is here we get to the bottom of shit [Music] we're gonna get to love this shit first of all before we even start this interview I want to tell you that I'm ready to join your cult yeah I've gone online I've seen other cult members and leaders before they're not nearly as charismatic as you they don't make as much sense as you I think you're on point and I'm ready to sign up you just tell me what I need to your your utopian view of the perfect society it's fucking brilliant man it's it's it's dead-on Peter Joseph you don't know is the creator of zeitgeist the the original movie and then all these follow-up movies and now it's actually you know you refer to it as a movement and that's not cocky in any way shape or form that's just what it is it's a movement you know so the zeitgeist movement that you know tzm on twitter the TZ movement on Twitter and it's a fascinating thing that's going on right now and your movies and your movement I mean can you say it's yours now now it's sort of like it's it's become a and what other people like it or not they're a part of the zeitgeist movement one way or another what is the zeitgeist movement it's a definition of the times it's the cultural nuance if I did this all the shit that we believe and think is true and how we progress through time hence the zeitgeist movement so whether we anyone likes it or not they're a part of the zeitgeist movement so I just brought that into that particular context how did you become this smooth-talking bad motherfucker how did this happen how did you become this guy because it's not just that you have all these great ideas it's you never use the word um all right you just sail through these sentences and you're just like your musician is that what your background is I am a musician with percussionist classical percussionist that's what I tried to do for years and years but didn't fit in the whole orchestral establishment to percussion scene now percussion enlightened me exists it's not just he's not drums drums you have the mallet family then there's the kettle drums like timpani and you know hand-washing and learn them all as much as I could given the time that I have in my studio in Culver City I have full section of my little house blocked off or Wow never I can pursue my old hobby again which seems to be less and less unfortunately listen these some of your stuff online do you have us no I'm working on compiling I've been hesitant to do that because my identity has been so bizarre right there's a filmmaker which I never intended to be actually I think I sent you the link of the first zeitgeist performance yeah a performance it wasn't intended to be a documentary in the sense formally eclis as you would traditionally assumed how did how did it morph what happened well I had the 2007 I did a six night run in lower Manhattan free who was a thing I spent a lot of money on prepared this piece over the course of seven months didn't expect it to go anywhere because basically I had no rights to actually pursue this as a film so this is a firm firmly one-shot off fair use type of deal so I did it publicized it people came everything was cool everyone liked it it was very dramatic some people walked out simply really liked it some inspired Q&A it was a catharsis for me I was in advertising I was doing shit that I didn't appreciate doing is what the system does you know it forces you into a particular pocket for the most of us for a lot of we don't necessarily enjoy what we're doing so this is a catharsis and the unique thing about it is it was so honest this is a very honest work for me I didn't really think about approaching a demographic and when I when it went online on Google Video before YouTube this is what Google video is the only internet video site that actually had full-length stuff and very rarely you'd hear about feature-length films getting there and I just happened to hit that paradigm right then and it went crazy viral and the lawsuits were threatened and everyone thought it was some big documentary big production they had no idea the background what kind of lawsuits were threatened I just the people that are in it you know that film was a fair use film it was not intended to be released so people saw like 2030 million views in the first year everyone's seen dollar signs as though and I wasn't even selling anything I wasn't intending to and then eventually I went back you know the tail between my legs with all these people that the whole thing's full the whole thing is a montage of the zeitgeist it's right just one big cluster right of all sorts of different personalities kind of mushed together and most of them supported it and then some of them got a little greedy but everyone got paid off for the most part and there's still a few rocks left unturned but the statute of limitations is now up on that so if there's anyone wants to sue me you're gonna have a greater effect what about the ass yeah well it isn't stuff that is out there in the public record especially you can't put it together anyone can sue anybody for anything they think they can get money out of it especially in the film and the film media industry so you obviously surprised by the response at the first film you had no idea any of this was gonna no intention to make a second film I never considered myself a filmmaker I was always musically driven and then addendum came out in 2008 and that was that was picked up at the art of this Film Festival shown here at the Egyptian theater that had a huge response even larger in a certain sense because it was the first time it had been publicly display this whole phenomenon and then that carried over into the zeitgeist movement which was basically the the thought experiment I had as a cocaine we have these films seriously have plenty of people like Michael Moore making films do they really support change though are they really doing anything to actually initiate a community effort to get something going and at that point in time I had no idea what that would actually be it was I did I figured well it says it the movie on if you remember zeitgeist addendum it says you know join the movement let's start the largest critical mass the world's ever seen to try and get some change going and it seemed to take root and then from there it's been this kind of bubbling changing and morphine kind of phenomenon that's global now the zeitgeist movement which is which is a shared community I want to make people understand it isn't like a movement that any the world has ever seen it's just the people that the group of people that have a similar value said that's the only way I describe it's the ultimate anti institution so I often don't even referenced the movement I referenced the ideas behind it so you make this documentary it gets out and then all of a sudden you realize that there's this crazy movement behind it now how do you attempt to organize it how do you attempt do you not do you just get out of its way and let it organize itself like sort of an Occupy Wall Street type situation of the two we started off at a self organizing capacity but volunteers from around the world it was beautiful actually just getting all this communication from different demographics I mean the whole xikar I respect from the audience if you will for not just the film's with for the movement that it paid attention these ideas is totally vast you have people that are definite kids they're like 10 years old with a little zeitgeist movement t-shirt on up to 80 year old men that you know that they're looking for something different so it's amazing and the ethnicity differences are massive want to be in Israel next month giving a lecture it's truly unique so it self organized it began we started a pinpoint different coordination positions people in charge now you you the old places and give lectures as well I do and what is like what is this the lecture essentially is it just you breaking down how this got started or is it you talking about your perspective well they're usually lectures broken into three released now lectures broken into three typical lectures broken into the first part being what defines awareness and logic and reason how we think about information we're just missing the messenger look at logically XY z-- and zzz forget forget the subjects it's all about the train of thought that the process of thought is is irrespective of personality there's a huge conflict in society between logic and psychology and they're very very different and i can expand on that as we go second section is the criticism of the current socio-economic platform which i consider to be an one massive corruption we talk about corruption ii little hard drive corrupts it's messed up or a criminal positive gone robbed a convenience store it's a corruption of the system the socio-economic system legal system to me the entire socio-economic system namely economic not only politics politics is an outgrowth but i won't jump on that one is it is one massive corruption of what it means to live on this planet what it means to perfect good public health so there's that section you hadn't seen it that's massive and most the criticisms and presentations i do then there's the solution which supports a train of thought which has many different names as far as a new social system which I don't even really address anymore I just like to go for the train of thought and what it comes down to is you have to have a system a system that's based on planetary resource management very fundamental stuff by the way a system that's not based on growth and all the the strange infinite growth paradigm stuff I'm sure Mike resource management as a whole community one giant community gets together and says okay what do we need and how do we keep everybody happy and healthy globally globally and you think about it in the broadest symbiotic sense one of the great psychological revelations or intellectual revelations that we've had as species is that is that we've been living in these divisive kind of tribalistic concepts and we assume normality with it because of how long they've persisted but we tend to find that what we find now as far as information is concerned is that we live in a global system we live in a symbiosis that stretches outward almost to infinity so the very idea of separation becomes tangibly uh nap lickable to the way we approach our life way we approach knowledge the way reproach approach society the way we approach economics which is the defining feature of our existence you know how we get what we need how we relate of course how with the renewable elements the regeneration if you will the Omni regeneration lords of buckminster fuller of everything how do we respect that and the ultimate realization is that we have to begin to unify all concepts you see this in intellectual things concealed Ian's is a book by Alberto Wilson early on in the 1980s he wrote about this concept of all the the disciplines starting to merge together so you can't talk about chemistry without talking about biology or other way around you can't talk about physics without talking about mathematics you can't separate anything anymore and that's a unique phenomenon that's occurring and you can stretch that train of thought backwards and forwards in my approach as far as simplicity the economic system has to be unified and has to have a very simple respect of what actually supports us I can ramble how would that transition take place I mean even if you were to engineer the perfect utopian mathematic formula for keeping everybody no such thing what do you do with the money that you have now does it just dissolve do we start from scratch like you know how does that work how does it transition from from one monetary system that makes no sense where there's massive amounts of corruption and people with huge amounts of resources that they've probably gotten by what would be considered immoral although legal ways sure with their money well there's a few few answers to that one let's let's get rid of the word that utopian though I mean I don't mean that in a sense of a fantasy that's impossible of being achieved okay I mean it is ideal like Boulder Colorado as far as what my mind said to me once it's a working utopia yeah and I believe it is you know I don't mean it in a sense of impossible you put utopia is a touchy word I like the word yeah I sometimes it's dismissed as finite yeah it's only the best that we know up until now right and the great flaw is that we're not actually doing anything based on the knowledge we have today but answer your question how do we do that you know how do we transition the system's failing you have an unemployment crisis we have a debt crisis and we have a and we have a energy crisis that's looming three the nails in the coffin as far as I'm concerned that are interweave in certain ways if you we also have another crisis and that crisis is the way people who raise children we have the crisis of you know too many people that don't give a fuck about their kids and they're raising these little problems yes these people that are you know and the crisis of consciousness yeah means for sure and that absolutely transmits from parent to children you know when when they're not paying attention to their kids or their bad parenting or you know whatever they have that brings up that he gets the same sort of it's like how do we change their their how do we change society at the core cuz really you got to get to them too that's a big percentage of people that are impoverished and uneducated and it's great for strip clubs it's great for a lot of things it's great for porn too yeah yeah he's just we want a lot of chaos you know you want a lot of messy things great for fighting too but III think that's that's a big problem right I mean isn't it heads the nature of what the zeitgeist movement really defines itself as me you can talk about these solution-oriented things but really it's it's the it's the evolution of human awareness the real crisis is the crisis of ignorance right there's no energy crisis it's really just a crisis of misunderstanding what we're doing and the fact that people have become addicted to the money that's going around the the people that are taking money from corporations it's it stopped becoming a matter of whether or not it's a good thing it's it's precedented there's a precedent it's already in place they're making the money they're gonna continue to make the money and they want to make the money and so anything where you say well hey man I don't think that what we're doing is really fair I mean we're being unfairly influenced by corporations uh dude we're making this fucking money we've been making this money we're gonna continue to make this money you don't just stop no you know it's it's very difficult to just stop that's why the failure is so important if you will the failure that's on hand is it's not gonna it's not gonna be altered by any new legislations or any fail-safes the establishment might have there's no way this system can persist for a number of different reasons I could throw out there first of all the of Occupy movement right everyone says maybe that at this point in time the division of of rich versus poor is more than it ever was actually it's not it's not it's always been structurally classed there's a structural classism built in system occupy has only been the first to really acknowledge that on the global scale a parent of a an issue that's been there from the very beginning because every element of this system supports that and it's getting worse we live in a plutonomy now there's more money moving amongst the upper 5 percentile influencing GDP so much money that it makes the lower percentiles movements of money irrelevant so on from a firmly economic standpoint the lower classes are literally irrelevant to the function of the economy therefore to the to the powers that be if you will to the corporate establishment and to the taxation feeling and in big business that fuels all government and this is all because the system has been manipulated no intrinsic ly flawed base beginning based on the need for differential advantage in an old form of tribalism psychological tribalism that you have to gain advantage over others a socially Darwinistic view and what's unique even though I hold that to be self-evident and true to the human condition if we were we were both existing in extreme scarcity and we had nothing to eat we end up fighting each other most likely to we're having to survive that's the natural human instinct what's happened now though is that the jumping ahead here but follow me is that the entire infrastructure of society the human populations so large their industry is become so big we have the Fukushima meltdown we have the nuclear weapons we have nano weapons that are on the horizon what we have now is we can't have the risk of this type of mentality being the forefront of our psychology we can't have the self betterment of the individual to be the forefront of us because it goes against our long-term evolutionary fitness which means the entire species is at risk so to put it in a sentence the self-interest that tends to dominate now that's that really is the psychological fuel of all the motivations that you see the greed if you will is degrees just an extension of the basic motivation is really no such thing as greed it's just there in the system all of that that you see is going to fuck us all up until we begin to realize that we can't operate this way because it's gonna destroy us does that make sense we nuclear war was the best example they don't need passports to us see the fallout nuclear winter would have taken over the entire planet at the US and Russia went to nuclear war even a minor war it would have destroyed almost the entire human species and a few scientists realized that said you know what this isn't really a partisan or a country or nationalist issue anymore this is a life issue so the greater our technology the greater our ability the greater vulnerability we have and the more clear it becomes how we have to unify and make our self-interest become social interest if we intend to survive as a species and this is the great paradigm shift of all human thought so what do you do with all the weapons well you get rid of them dismantle them and hope you can reincarnate them into something effective imagine if we to take over the Pentagon and use their equipment for monitoring the earth's resources use the amazing surveillance equipment to actually have a productive use it would be incredible what we could do answer I think everything you say is brilliant and I agree with it a hundred percent but when I think about it being implemented in today's society I think of the human beings that exist right now and how they've been running their lives based on greed the real greed based on real ignorant based on violence I mean you're gonna get these people and everybody's gonna go hold hands and sing Kumbaya together you know I feel like there has to be something you know there there has to be some sort of event that unites people there's not gonna be a stopping of the separation of rich and poor if the rich are only gonna get richer and smaller and smaller and when you want to see anger just wait just wait we're having touched the anger stage as it were when you see that is what's gonna start the initial transition into something new and the point of the movement really is not to try to initiate some step-by-step logical transition to assume human beings are rational they're just gonna say oh that sounds better that sounds more efficient no it's not the way the human being works at all at this stage so the failure will happen the zeitgeist movements on the sidelines as far as I'm concerned trying to spread information about what a new social system may be exposing the roots of this system and as this tipping point occurs those that are on the outs will slowly become on the end and you'll have a very powerful large complicated revolution that will happen one way or another I had this and it's an inevitability to me so all the rich 1.00% doesn't have any billions of dollars they have the police are not going to put there's gonna be a very unique unpredictable shift in the human social structure it's a fucking movie isn't it it is isn't in the movie and really a great time in the movie time when things get really exciting yeah I've said about the Occupy movement that to me they're like white blood cells they don't know exactly why they're there but they know that there's an issue and they've there's a there there's a sickness here social disorder yeah social immune system response it really is they just clogged up all the areas where there's corruption yeah it was a beautiful action too bad the majority of the Occupy movement hasn't been able to really put a train of thought forward that others can grasp they have all this media all this press I tried to I don't know if you've seen anything that I've tried to do with them I know I've done some talks in LA in New York and just really trying to get some seeds planted as far as what a new social structure may be because you can complain all day right until you put down to some fundamental logical elements that people can grab expand and get into the public consciousness into the zeitgeist we're doomed until that happens it's just gonna be one iteration of rogue you know the idea would be amazing to have an entire culture filled with cool people and everybody works together like boy you feel like could that work is that possible and it if it was possible would anybody ever get anything done would there be any more competition would there be any more creativity would everybody just be masters banging each other and giving each other hugs the fun thing about modern sociological research is that a great number of studies have been done in those issues yeah incentive is been a large forests of the market system to assume if we're doing mechanical stuff yet I'm gonna be on a conveyor line which can easily be automated now and you know be on a subway line at least blows my mind I walk and do like a subway restaurant there's a conveyor belt of people that you could automate in five seconds if you want you wasting their lives yeah you have to pay people for that when it comes to creativity very few are actually motivated by money and money actually inhibits there's large studies that are done by a man named Daniel pink called drive I recommend that book to anyone that's interested I would think that yeah if you were just concentrating on money you would that you would lose part of your mental resources that you could have concentrated on creativity so deep in inhibition everything I've ever done creatively have never money's a pollutant to me you know for anything that I've done I did absolutely yeah it hinders my creative response really fucking and reverse the fucking love money I love buying cool shit I like going to movies how much it costs you hate money period I hate money period I hate but if I had if I had not to do limitless resources yeah if I just didn't have the along with it I hate dealing with bills you don't hate hate I hate having to deal with that part I just like waking up doing what I want to do creativity like like likely not having to worry about that at all would be amazing doesn't it just go somewhere and give them your pictures and they give you some meat well I mean again like of course that you have to get paid to live well if that I could take that whole part out that'd be amazing exactly yeah it's a system that we're it's not it's absolutely not the best we can do you know there's no way that's the best we can do especially the stock market man I don't give a fuck if you understand it or not I watch it sometimes i watch those numbers scrolled through the bottom of the screen and there's some fucking dude with his his classical attire his traditional attire that he's wearing with his tie and is is and he's moving around and pointing to all these different stocks they're going up and down and you know it's all based on confidence you know what kind of a shit bag system of you put together what kind of a goofy fucking number game what's all going up and down and shorts and derivatives you tell me what the fuck the derivative market is again why is it a hundred times bigger than the real market what as much as I hate to admit it I was a private equity trader for about six years I'm sure I'm who is that like well it was a personal choice to get out of the establishment you know the only occupation in existence we don't have a boss or a client or reliance on an audience is in equity trading so were you is it like being an educated guess er is that what it's like there's a huge strategy that that's called technical analysis that people use it's now it's automated behind the scenes by groups like Goldman Sachs that are raping everybody slowly but surely but no there's a firm Ted a lot of respect for the traders independently because of their mindset it's a great discipline it's like a sport you really have no you're doing you can't just wing it it's not gambling and any kind of sense like that but as institution the stock market and the whole concept of these representations of equity and finance and how how much influence it has in society and of course the derivatives blowout and everything else that we've seen it's the most cancerous thing on the face of the earth the stock market is just unbelievable I have no clue it's the ultimate manifestation of the worst concept of having no social contribution and invariably making more money than any other sector of the population even though you create nothing you do nothing it's just like Wall Street and Michael Douglas he's like you know it's like I create nothing I own yeah it's amazing that it's been able to get to the point where it is now what a what an out-of-control ride and you guys that made like 40 million dollars a year doing nothing nothing and you say to yourself well here's the market system this is the capitalist concept right oh everyone if you do the most contribution you're supposed to get the most reward that's the underlying tone so if you work really hard and make that invention then you can contribute to society no it's you better go your only offer yourself fuck everybody else that's what's rewarded in this system across the board and the market system is just the highest level of that psychological manifestation did it grow too fast for our little monkey minds is that what it is did technology and the concept of being able to control money and all the different things that we have to deal with his variables didn't exist when our minds are created our DNA is essentially the same as it was ten thousand years ago it's our DNA is really essentially set up for the natural world and then all of a sudden we've shoved it into this weird new dimension where we're dealing with an incredible amount of variables you're dealing with all kinds of craziness I mean it's just I don't know if the mind is set up to deal with the world that we've created which is why it's like a kid at the helm of a car that doesn't have a drive and he's stomping on the fucking gas but he's too small to look over the over the dashboard so he doesn't even know where the fuck he's going he's trying to figure this thing out as he goes along it's like all of a sudden this little kid has a car you know and that's what it's like with us like we're like these dumb fucking monkeys and we're we're still evolving out of that dumb monkey soup and popping out we're weird this monkey that's aware of itself and then in the process of becoming aware of itself barely getting our shit together we've created everything we've created nuclear fucking bombs and cellphones and video that you can get it a little screen in your pocket and the ability to do things that we would have never thought possible just 50 60 70 80 100 years ago sure it's it's almost like no one could have managed this it's almost like it blew up sure faster than our reasoning evolutions always natural one way or another whether we destroy ourselves well then I guess the human species was a evolutionary cul-de-sac it's one way or another everything is always right you know I mean there's no wrong here but you know the the disorder that's in place in society is what concerns me which is what you alluded to at the beginning you have this huge disorder based on the system that's basically a self-destructive system it's not respecting any general variables of resource management it's not respecting you know I saw a recent stat that said Oh China has less unemployment than America because there lacks EPA if you were whatever they have in China lacks environmental issues like we should be more like China and reduce our environmental things and they have like huge smog thing it's just disgusting I've seen destroying ourselves one town where they say it's like smoking two packs of cigarettes a day just living there the skies were like dark grey so it's it's a disorder that we don't even see it and we just keep killing ourselves whether it's why is that is it because we still recognize ourselves as individuals and we still haven't realized that we are a part of a giant super organism that is the human race so because people are acting as individuals and then they could do so as a corporation and do so without guilt they act as individuals all going towards one goal but under the guise that the company's doing in the best interest of business and then they're able to get away with a lot of shit that you just can't get away with in a one-on-one basis you know they're there instead of thinking of human beings as a whole and putting that at the front of your ethics that's like not even into consideration it's like what can we get away with what it's legal you know and it's not our fault if it's legal go back I go back to my early life I had a normal upbringing but I I did all sorts of shit out of college that was high illegal reselling things just it was whatever you could do to make money it didn't matter and everyone did to those whatever you needed to do to get money and what's happened now with the value system disorder is that since that's the pursuit that's the divine drive of the system that's what status is defined by it's what your success is defined by that everyone can blindly look the other way with how much destructions occurring in the world they can look the other way with the wars and the cancers and and the just every natural phenomenon that we've come to to disintegrate that all the trash that's surrounding the planet right now and I've liked in the war too the way people react if you know that someone their family's been molesting someone it's almost like they don't want to know the way looking away they don't want to think about it they don't want to do it that way if it was right next door we'd be thinking about it every fucking day the fact that people can just commonly accept the fact that there's no further for no reason whatsoever that you could ever argue where we have thousands of dudes with guns in some other part of the world it seems normal doesn't it it seems normal cuz it's real life and people are born into this normality they don't know any better it's exactly so it is what it is because we feel like the system must be smarter than us I mean it's it's big it's huge it's gigantic you know but it's a but it's a group of goddamn individuals with their own personal interests at hand and their personal interests will extend to killing people and profiting off of it if they can get away with it my favorite example of that concept was remember the moving network yes which I a little skid number when they got frustrated the very end because they were losing money with the character and they sit around they go well we could kill him and if you think as the audience member that they're just joking you think someone the rooms gonna go yeah whatever but then they're like well if we do it we have to be very careful then the film ends right there so you think about that logic a human life becomes quite secondary to most motivations especially the higher you go up in the sort of corporate neuroses well you know it's why I've argued before with people about you know this the September 11th especially that the I mean I've heard more conversations about you know what people think happened September 11th and I I believe this and I believe that and from from the very moment I've said you don't believe that they'd be willing I'm not saying people did orchestrate any sort of attacks in America I'm not saying they let I'm not saying anything but what I am saying is that we know that they went to war and they said that there was weapons of mass destruction when there weren't so they're willing to kill some people that they don't know they're know they know that they very least they're willing to kill some people that they don't know in order to push their own agenda we know that just like when they opened Wall Street the toxic air and the thousands that have gotten sick since then and what was my take on it is they don't know you either so you don't think they would kill you right you really think that the peace anybody that would orchestrate death for profit you don't think they would kill you you really think that they would because you're a u.s. is the nature of the gun and the entire and the entire military industrial establishment I mean this is a killing machines yeah they wouldn't use that in domestic purposes and not to mention there's so many examples of that their history that people blindly look what quorum it's just so sad that's why it's an offensive when someone says that you're unpatriotic when you see that when you see that you pointed out no you'll know that is patriotic that is very patriotic because that's not what we're supposed to be about that's not what this country was supposed to be founded for this country was supposed to be the best alternative this country was supposed to be the people that got it together say listen we have two fucking rules man here's the rule we separate this from that we do this we do that we don't let anybody do this you know don't give up your liberties you have to have essential liberties you have to have guns okay you got to protect yourself from enemies foreign and domestic you know it was all set up it was all set up sure they knew we could argue little nuances of the found I'm sure but I understand your point one thing did you hear this fucking dummy Newt Gingrich this would be King fat-headed clown this guy actually said that he believed that the founding fathers would be much more aggressive in the way they would prosecute people from marijuana and that they would do it probably much more violently ever growing it themselves not only would they grown it themselves it says in George Washington's fucking Diaries that he was separating the male from the female plant it's very clear that he says he was separating the male from the female plant four people don't know when you're growing marijuana you've got to separate the male from the female plant so that the female grows the buds and that that becomes psychedelic that's how you make it so you'd get high from it right so George Washington is essentially saying he likes to get high and he said oops a little too late so he's a fucking stoner he separated them too late what did you have to do back then I mean how many different things did he have going on George Washington was a fucking stoner dude almost a hundred percent god bless for sure they grew it and by the way they grew hemp and they they you know they grew hemp because they used it for a lot of things outside of the psychoactive effects they used it for all sorts of different things and there's all these different this is all different different passages people smoking on their hemp pipe it's written in so many different people's Diaries when George Washington said that he did mean his slaves were separating it for him right probably yeah they all did right it's so hot right there it was a different time Brian it's a different time he was a good man but the point is man did these fucking people that are in the positions of you know wanting to be at the helm of this monster you know it's like what a shitbag group of people we have to choose from you know again what do you expect you know what do you expect I always go back to one of my great heroes George Carlin he's like garbage in garbage out yeah what do you expect from this system now you could argue where these people came from which is where the scam comes in of the entire election cycle where did these people come from seriously you look like the guy who won Iowa they found that he won he beat Mitt Romney the crazy religious dude oh yeah Santorum is his name right oh he's alone he's a fucking he's a oh he's a good one he's full helmed Jesus he's he's Jesus like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic he's at the front of the Jesus ship with his arms up in the air this guy's yeah I had no abortion no not things he's super Jesus he's pushing it hard what an amazing group of humans we have trying to be at the helm Michele Bachmann and her gay husband it's a real guy it's a goddamn Coen Brothers movie we're living in a Coen Brothers movie and a real good one it's a teracle one at that you know it's a big football game it's sad to me to see how you can't watch the news of that them covering this as though it's relevant or important to anything any of the decision processes that these people will have the power to take hold of will actually accomplish anything when it's obvious from our last great hope Obama that big business isn't going anywhere yeah it doesn't matter who's in even Ron Paul if he was magically to be swept in with bulletproof vest on and everything else I you'll see some dramatic shifts in his policy the moment he comes in because he knows he knows what's actually possible in that environment before the shitstorm hits them from all sides you know all the examples of what they did to Ralph Nader you know with the prostitution thing I don't remember that the car company remembers what happened there was a basically a car company set up Ralph Nader and in a hotel room with a prostitute and then documented it because he was doing all this publicity against this car company how and safe there there's they're cutting costs on their car production he found out very discreetly how bad it was people were dying and they tried to set him up and to make him look bad with this prostitute was that's just the tip of the iceberg of all sorts of games that have played you can go straight down the whole political spectrum and look at all the things that seem random Lewinsky and all these things there's there's a subtle orchestration happening to that not to be conspiratorial oriented but that's just the way it is you don't mess around it's a mafia system I want to know how where to get casting for that because I would love to be a part of the next one you know like I'm found in Obama's locker room they must hire yeah they probably do Craigslist I mean at this point in time they can easily pay someone to just fuck up your life yeah you know pay someone like this is your job $250,000 your job is to seduce that guy and go and get into his life somehow or another they're called PR agencies is that what they do well PR agencies can go both sides they can be positive towards you or they can be hired to have completely black lists do they make you look like shit I know that from my own experience of the weird and things that have happened to me which I wonder where the roots of some of these things are the people that blog and anti-psychiatry to Joseph manners every single day and follow everything I do Mike how do they possibly have time to do that maybe think they're big maybe why just know some companies that were listed to me that do the exact same thing to other people and you don't see them on the forefront they're these PR firms that you can use to you've probably seen the ones that you can go and to get bad things removed from your name on the internet there I've heard that on the radio like doctor or something right so there's ones that worked the other direction the more of a black op kind of way go after you yeah and they're paid to do so Wow that's been into porn stars right now really yeah dude you have to porn stars I don't know there's there was a they brought this one person broke into a word they get tested once a month I think I might have talked about this before and broke in and stole all the records from all the porn stars and they just put him on line and then that shit got taken down eventually and it found out it was just as a male porn star that did it and then now there's groups of people that use all those things that were put online and attacked every single porn star online by putting their information everywhere oh wow what the fuck is with people why would they want to do that I don't know a few different motivations there so it's a weird thing man a weird thing that you know people want to hurt other people that badly the self-appointed guardians of the status quo that could be labeled I was a line I picked up a man named Jacque fresco these people that Dave they're not the only thing they have is their identity preservation they will fight tooth and nail to make sure whatever they believe is held true whether it's political religious I mean I could I can't count how many death threats I got since the first film came out well you're quite just questioning the status quo all they're doing it's fucking on camera why would somebody want to harm them well because if saved some deeply religious individuals sees porno or catches the Sun with it or something like that they feel a huge threat there for whatever purpose you'd be surprised what motivations people again that's the root cause the root the root issue is how fucking dumb people are and what a giant percentage of them are just so off the tracks and in the woods misinformed been conditioned how do you how do you turn those folks around because I think you can't really have this next-level society until you get those folks to on track look if every but that's one of the things about living in a nice neighborhood if you live in a nice neighborhood you know there's generally a lot less financial strife so people are a little bit more calm you know it's one of the things that people don't like about living in neighborhoods where people are poor that you know there's a lot of tension and sometimes shit goes down sure well you've got to get everybody to the level of no tension in order to have a beautiful society how the hell do you do that as you pointed out earlier you start with the kids you make a there's there's a deeply religious and high structure thing going on in the world where everyone thinks they can just keep having kids and it doesn't matter what the resources of the planet you know it's doesn't matter that no don't you dare tell them how to raise their kids forget any kind of instruction you know the kids people have natural pre-programming it's pretty obvious what you watch like guys moving forward a whole section that's the very beginning zeitgeist moving forward on the development of kids now it little small nuances can mess them up for the rest of their lives whether it's goes to drug addiction whether it goes to mental disorders or even physical disorders and no attention is being put on that there's anything that I would like to see put in the public educational fountain it would be how to really think about your kids how important it is how their earliest things that happened to them will fuck them up the rest of their lives if they're not carefully carefully collared or carefully orchestrated allowing vulnerability we're not talking I like holding kids down and making them do things in a structured way it's allowing the vulnerability of this natural organism to come to fruition a horse for example falls right out of the horse that born Falls they can walk boom humans because of evolution they come out way too early so the susceptibility of the of the the the infant is so massive and so misunderstood up until now that people have done things to their kids that have really fucked them up for their whole lives at the infancy stage because how much developmental requirements are actually there the protections are gone so it's a huge topic and there's a lot of people like a list that can that can describe those issues in text got in gabon mate' is a really good one so what is the best-case scenario is the best-case scenario that the psychic movement takes place after some sort of a collapse and we develop a new society that's based on the using of natural resources universally and across the board and there's no hierarchy of citizenship and and then the people are on the outside what do we do we fight them off well you you would want to hope it's hard to be doing you'd want to hope that whatever the Cataclysm may manifest itself to be that's pending that those on the sidelines the barbarians at the gate as they might have been would eventually turn around to see the folly of their ways as well you know it's hard to predict the zeitgeist movie is really a movement of logic and reason it's like okay here's we have we have technological automation you know people are being replaced by automation in fact the great driver of unemployment now is automation they won't admit it aren't most economists well not a few are coming out now in the middie knit you can go back to Roosevelt administration they actually wanted to have a stop on technological invention during the Industrial Revolution because of how fast people who are being replaced by machines and that is the four core driver of all unemployment you see in the world today period so what does that mean what is the logic say well we can produce more with less we don't need people to slave over some shitty factory job anymore we automate it no vacations higher much higher degree of accuracy machines can do things there's all sorts of modular machines now I can do things like scientific research to extremely specific things Thinking Machines people like Ray Kurzweil and all this massive evolution like a good ramble on for a long time what does that mean for human labor do we keep human labor as a requirement to live your right to life is to get income or do you create a new system that says okay let's go full forward with machine automation all sectors possible and fill in the gaps with whomever is willing to do so and I think the abundance produced would enable a society to exist without people needing money every minute of the day what happens to all those people that were working on those assembly jobs well at this stage they wouldn't know what the fuck to do right but if you evolve it out if you really think about this periods of time you gonna be a problem we're gonna have to face eventually face it now well I'm tell until you see someone in power say okay we're gonna start to automate and basically do the form of socialization if you will giving people free food free energy in order to supplement then further along their lack of purchasing power which is what's happening and tell if someone starts to do that in government or having the workday like if Obama was smarting a bunch of Roosevelt administration they would have put in a mandate or whatever you want to call it where the corporation's receive some type of subsidy where they would have the workday and they would hire twice the amount of people for that corporation giving them the sustenance income that would be that would be applicable to be probably a little bit reduced but what else do you do they're not gonna do that because the core motivations so against it corporations responsibilities to the shareholders shareholders don't want to see anything like that what happens when someone lays a whole bunch of employees in the stock market that goes up remember yeah it's just sick the whole thing's backwards so back to my point until automation no one's gonna stop automation cuz it's a profit-driven thing you cost less money to automate than it does to use people and that's in what you call the contradiction of capitalism in the words of Karl Marx believe it or not he recognized this long ago and all you have is this thing collaging together that is unreconciled well until a new social system system is put in place what do you think is gonna happen with the current system how much time do you think we have before it's just chaos in the streets oh no I mean it's already chaos in most of the world in pockets I think I think 2012 is gonna be prophecy aside I think 2012 would be a very interesting year it's amazing that things have accelerated this far this close to 2012 when you look at it from the prophecy standpoint sure everybody thinks it probably look it's like the boy who cried wolf it's like at a certain point in time like y2k and this and then in the fucking Pleiades and where's Nibiru and at a certain point I'm like are I with your fucking apocalypse talk stop it but then as you get closer and closer to 2012 you're like man you know maybe the Mayans were onto something well I doubt that but what does scare me is believe the feeling shit and the people jumping out of windows and shooting things up and all the ones that have convinced themselves of some deluded idea that's going to be very interesting well you know the other thing is like no one's saying it's gonna be the end of the world it's just the end of this calendar you could be a new era that's awesome you know it very easily could in my personal analysis the end of the Mayan calendars at the end of the Age of Pisces that's it that's that great year starts again with the Age of Aquarius it's too hard to predict you have like a 1500 to 3000 year buffer it's 2026 thousand year cycle right perception the equinoxes right and that's what I think it is but whatever I don't pay attention to those things I don't pay attention to it but I do pay attention to the fact that so many people pay attention to it of course you know I'm fascinated by astrology I don't know if I'm believing in it a hundred percent but I think it's amazing that they can you know halfway nailed down personalities and different traits when they're really good at it and we could argue on that one all right the power suggestion is is quite phenomenal in the world today be amazed and as far as structuring questions for our structure leading people into yeah I've seen that I've seen like psychic stuff people do shit like that but I'm not even talking about that I'm not gonna like somebody giving you a date and some of those real astrologists they want to know like what time you were born and I don't know if it's real but it's amazing that it's been around so long it I do not know if it's real but it's amazing that at one point in time someone actually dedicated enough time to writing down some sort of a system to figure out which different things that are in line when you're born in them that's kind of amazing really I think it's beautiful beautiful from the standpoint of cultural still trying to find your place in the universe that people are doing they're looking at the sky it looks flat and 2d they think about associations they want to feel like they're connected to it the whole definition of God and if you go back to my first film most natural phenomenons stellar cults originated merged into the Islam judeo-christian Islamic religion by symbolism just became historize basically but you know the beauty of it is that people are trying to relate to something that's what I see but they still thought the sky was flat so the constellations don't even exist they're not actually not actually there they just looked that way you know they thought who who's they thought this guy was flat well if you look at the sky it looks perfectly flat and the constellations and the depictions are actually flat that's how they're that's why they have little animal things right right and the Sun rising that say this summer solstice you know where you I believe that's the birth note or most the spring equinox you can't remember it's a completely 2d prima fasci surface flatland view mm-hmm and it doesn't hold any actual validity because they had no idea that it was actually the depth you know the depth of Mars and their their radiance is away they're burning out they're changing there's more Fame there's expansion so you know so they just looked at it it's like almost like a picture of flat yeah two-dimensional picture right chance is gonna fall down it's amazing that they did that for so long though they really studied the constellations I guess that's beautiful art form it's a beautiful concept that was outside where's outside who's a mother beating nice kid okay well this is the only that's the worst you have to worry about Pasadena you know this is not like you know it's funny is jungles of Africa I know a lot that I was a stripper a long time ago and she found out about you from the green room of a strip club there was a hairdryer designer that was he was a gay guy that was in love with your shit and so he used to tag you throughout San Francisco and in this green room of a strip club your your tag is all over he just tagged the fuck out of this green room that's how she found out about it and then she got so moved by your movie that she started posting flyers around San Francisco to promote your movie because she was so moved that was what was so phenomenal on the the original in it it still persists to this day on its own I did no publicity for any of these things it's always been self driven it somehow it seemed to tap into some element of people that they appreciated and felt the need to recommit to other people which is inadvertent to me I certainly didn't anticipate that but was it blown your mind I guess well I get these I get these marketing calls occasionally or emails from these marketing jackasses like how did you do that are you using in your viral media like it's just word of mouth man that's hilarious yeah this is highly envied the film story is a highly envied by a lot of people they're trying to there's a lot of films trying to duplicate the idea to duplicate the concept and build kind of a forest community out of it in the same way that was natural to the movement so but anyway what do you expect it's amazing everyone assumes dollar signs and there's a lot of people around yeah of course there's there's always been someone that at the helm of something at different points in time you know different cultures different religions different you know different different kingdoms has always been someone with a new idea so and I think everybody sort of recognizes that this thing is falling apart no one's buying anymore and a new thing is gonna come along man and we've got a jump on it we're gonna jump on it because this is this really is the future because this this dying animal that you see this this fucking elephant and donkey system is stupid it's stupid and everybody recognizes it's destroying us yeah you just look around it's destroying the fabric of almost everything that you see around you you have every life-support systems in decline our psychology is really fucked up have you taken a look around what you're doing today I mean the public health issue is bad enough I'm just waiting for the tipping point where where the lifespan starts to tip because I think it's just a matter of time I have a friend that has a 10 year old and she has her 10 year old is in school and you know he's an active kid and the psychologist or psychiatrist I guess it would be for school he's trying to give the kid drugs and he says well he's a good kid he's not he's not he just gets bored in class and he acts up a little bit but he doesn't need to be drugged and she goes you're so easy you're so quick to drug them like how many kids in his classes are on drugs and he says well I am NOT on liberty to give that it's confidential information but let me tell you somewhere near half so I don't know why the fuck he would say that he's not at liberty sure so and then she goes wait a minute half half do you know what you think half of the kids in school have a mental problem to the point where they need drugs wow that's amazing that is amazing that there's someone out there that is a professional that's able to do something like that now this is a woman telling me about her child I do not know if her numbers were correct you know I mean she might have just I don't she was adding marijuana though she's not a dummy you know and she was she was telling me this with and it made a whole lot of sense to me and I was like that is amazing that they're just there's so many willing to drug people that's a sign of sickness absolutely I mean little fucking sucks okay there's a reason why your kids moving around he's healthy he's healthy his brain works great creative yeah he's and he's getting all this input that blows and he knows he can get out of that class and play video games and have laughs with his friends and and say hi to girls and that would be awesome but right now this sucks and just I can't take the suck any longer it's like it's like you're telling me that the only way to learn is to be bored into a fucking coma and just accept this really low frequency of memorizing shit that some other asshole figured out and so that's that's that's that's what school is every day just pounding it into you that the only way to get through this is you're gonna have to hate it well meanwhile everything else you get good at every game you get good at you get good at because you love it you know you get good at video games cuz they're fun when you get to be a badass at a video game it's cuz that video games awesome why do you guys get good at basketball cuz it's fun to be good at basketball when you hit that repor nerds fucking fun everything else that you get good at is fun except the shit that you have to deal with in school unmotivated people they're underpaid and you want to talk about like the symptom of a sick society the fact that we put so little emphasis on schools so little emphasis on teaching it should be an honor to let in to guard over people's children man you should be the most honorable respectable people available super intelligent and super well-paid we should be paying teachers fuck loads of money man you know they should be it should be like a prestigious position it should be something that you like really aspire to instead of something where it's a passion but you're getting fucked by the system when you barely have enough money to eat you know you look at how much a teacher makes in a public school system it's it's fucking deplorable it's amazing that it's accepted it's like for whatever reason we don't step out of boundaries and then look at it objectively and go we've got some core problems and a big part of it is our children and they develop to become shitty fucking human beings against their own intentions it's not like they want to suck go now kids don't want to suck because they're just balls of potential victims they're victims of a system that really doesn't care doesn't understand how to care doesn't put any resources towards it it's like you have so much money to go to war and you have so little to go to school that's amazing it's amazing that you've worked out the numbers that way and the highest level of imposition you can have is to go to college get $80,000 with a debt anything guess what you're ripe to be enslaved and some hideous corporate establishment we just hoping you can afford Alexis next year yeah you know everyday just live in a slave but back to the drug issue it just preps kids now so they can when they get to be adults and try to figure out why they're so miserable why they hate their job while they've no contribution to society why they don't have any artistic energy anymore well that's perfect cuz then you can give them the prozac and well give them all the other drugs that will nullify them to make them adhere to this process yeah poor little guys so if you analyze all that new statistically view public health from a psychological mental health standpoint you look at depression rates look at everything then you look at the environmental problems you look at you just go straight down the spectrum of public health to physical health to to environmental health you have one massive drop-off it's ridiculous and that's that's the data I deal with far too often and that's why I think the system can't hold up for that much longer I mean the cancer rates are out of control for one as a general rule there's more cancer occurring now than ever before there's too many of us right no it's not many of us no no I don't agree with that at all that's that's some people intuitively speaking you would want to say that I think the world can hold many many more times the number of people if it was properly structured but we have to also deal with something different as far as like fuel right and we can't be we can't be a carbon you know we can be a fossil fuel-based another great paradigm shift is we've been living off of fossil deposits which is most ignorant things possible since we're surrounded by the movement of energy from the Sun to everything else we have these we have with there's no crisis in the energy there's no energy problem there's only the crisis of ignorance as I stated before and that's really the big thing we have plenty of energy so you think ideally especially in Southern California we should have like solar domes right they should be like should be solar they're well you should well really you should have ringed the sky all solar you just go at your local you take this block which has plenty of sun exposure and you apply photovoltaic paints and high high quality advancements and there's unfair little money going into the research by the way it's hard to get any kind of funding for those things so if you imagine how fast we could advance with these renewable mediums localized if we actually put the energy into them you can do the extrapolation on how far we'd become because technology just continues to move beyond our expectations do you don't you need batteries though for solar between super capacitors and and hydrogen which is the new idea you could store these things for easily overcoming it or intermittency of solar easily through battery technology the problem with battery technology again in the market system you want constant turnover you want scarcity you want people to go back and buy more batteries because that's what this entire systems and also the problem minerals to create the batteries like lithium-ion they get I think go for a hydrogen but now I think hydrogen bad or hydrogen storage storage so this would not be a solar issue then because you can't really do you bring the solar into it you bring solar power and then you convert that into hydrogen so it's stored it's stored in the water stored in the hydrogen that's that's a new technology that's that's been Wow so no need for batteries no need to buy on nothing no need for the minerals that they get in the car you might have to have some lithium ion in intermittent sense I don't how the battery is constructed or but super capacitors which is another concept which isn't utilized you know how you like your computer has capacitors that store energy it's a very different technology than the the standard battery which is kind of like a you fill it in there's many different forms there's a great deal of advancement there there's really nothing I can find that would inhibit storage for an admittance II from solar if you really put your mind to it there's to say that what takes some more you know deep analysis but that can't imagine which one of the mineral is just for that well it's just it's always been ironic to me that the the chain from minerals coming out of the ground to super advanced technology just such a barbaric chain and they look down at the people in no shoes with pickaxes pulling the minerals out of the ground the Congo and how that eventually gets to your Apple laptop wow it's pretty fascinating that that is all I mean that that's a part of the equation the part of the equation for a high technology whether it's solar power anything is you need the minerals from Africa of course and that's how they're extracting those fucking things until molecular engineering comes into play and we begin to synthesize these these raw materials from scratch they were likelier engineering which is around the corner probably within the next 50 60 years there's already small advancements in that see the more you just like that's alchemy it is kind of kind right yes sure really it's like that's what people predicted well you remember probably the old many years ago it was one of the companies they spelled their name and little atoms and they showed it the magnifying glass at big feet we've come a long way since then and there's a lot of great futurist ideas out there that can basically create replicators for your home where you're not going to be I can be going to a store to buy anything you're gonna be creating these things in your home and if there's anything that will destroy the market system quite rapidly it'll be advancements like that how do you possibly maintain systems where you can synthesize a laptop in one swoop download the model from your computer it goes into this VAT it's in this this dust and then the molecular element is released just like you print into a printer or 3d printing which I had in my film moving forward as a primitive notion of that they can print full cars now in one swoop yeah there's so much advanced technology out there that is not known that would solve so many problems it's frustrating it's very frustrating and the very fact that these efficiencies are there and not being pushed as fast as they should be is even more frustrating but you see why why because efficiency is the enemy of everything that turns a profit that we don't we want to service everything we don't want to solve problems we want people with cancer not to cure the cancer we want you really think that's an ethic though that they think about that or do you think that their subconscious it's it's a syntax of thought they don't necessarily think that way just like guys sitting around a room and the Pentagon start to justify killing 3,000 people they're not thinking in terms of being murderers or anything else they're thinking in terms of business so you know if you if you want to make a laptop and you want people to buy it again that things in a lot died probably three years from the time you buy it different component problems that will go out does it mean it has to know but the turnover is so important efficient inefficiency is the driver of this system which is why we have the pollution problems the waste problems and the health problems and why they feed in together and why our whole GTA is literally driven by sickness and inefficiency and waste that's that's if there's anything that blows my mind it's how anti-economic our current system really is on all levels so if you want to solve problems you want to make a car that last 60 years that's easily interchangeable that can meet this beauty more than that Bailey a hundred years easily interchangeable they can be updated you want to make a smart phone that has the longest lasting component so you don't need to throw away these things could be done if we wanted to do it but be anathema to what the market system requires for constant turnover cost of turnover constant money circulation means more jobs so this planned obsolescence you think is this like a business model it's planned an intrinsic another level is intrinsic just that people you know they build things the best they can and they don't last they just break two levels to it planned obsolescence is very real you can go into historical archives with car companies to know that they strategized I can guarantee you people behind Apple sit there and there full-on statistics caught operating systems oh you have an operating system update your the software the software scam is even worse because that's just number ones and zeros the fact that they even charge over and over for that's more hilarious that's planned obsolescence intrinsic obsolescence is even more fucked up if you think about it that computer for it to be built has to go through the engine of the industrial profit complex which means all the components the extraction everything else someone's taking off the top throughout the entire thing right and there's cost efficiency at the very end so if you're Apple Computer you bought to buy the components to make your computer you can't buy necessarily the highest gray level stuff in order to main competitive against the other people that are selling computers similar like Windows whatever so you have to constantly be a little bit behind in order to be competitive so you can drop the price in other words the quality of the product has to be diminished immediately for people to afford it the equation of of cost efficiency refuses to allow the best possible goods to be produced at any one time period it's a rule it's a natural evolution natural and natural dynamic if you will of what it means to save money and to make profit so everything's a piece of shit the moment it's produced yeah well that's except for shit like Ferraris even a Ferrari though think about the price of a Ferrari though well that's why it's so expensive yeah I mean they really just make the best shit they can make but it's not really the best oh fuck yeah it is the 458 Italia have you seen that thing no twin clutch gearbox the ridiculously powered v8 mid-engine supercar come on man that's about as good as human beings have ever created it really is it's the the peak of engineering there you know they use racecar driving too to engineer their cars they push cars to the limit and every year they go around the Nurburgring like a couple of seconds faster everybody's like straining like the new Porsche there's seven minutes and 40 seconds the new 911 is like this is electric no it's not electric but they have they have cars that they have developed at our electric Porsche has they had a gt3 Cup car that they raced in the 24 hour race that was that was an electric car they're definitely trying to come up with electrical technology but they are making the best cars they can make well let's define get to like there's certain things that are being done right now they're at the peak of production even though they are being produced they're essentially making like some high-end shit that's the best they can make good we could probably argue that one because if you look at all the advanced propulsion technology that's used in NASA why aren't they employing such things like that you can see not exactly but there are all sorts of things that could be that are probably more advanced than either of ie either of us know that could be applied to that Ferrari but they're not because if therefore no one will build and work on gas that you could get a pump either you have to work within those constraints because our gas is actually really really low compared to our octane is only 91 in other parts of the country I know you can get like 93 or for sure so I guess it's bad to have more octane but you see my point that you can't make something really that people can buy by stenograph heart it's demographic targeted - so what's the majority the majority of people majority people are lower in middle class you make shit that doesn't work very well so they can afford it and it invariably it breaks and they suffer in the end because they have to deal with the constant cyclical turnover and the need to constantly repair and everything else when everything hits the fan and you start your cult what what will everyone do for a job how does everyone get you'll be doing my lawn - I'll be doing your laundry I'm not good at laundry you're not gonna want me to do you like what you see what do what does everybody get a job I mean what does it become communism I mean how do you figure out what the fuck everybody does to contribute to this thing you what if you you know what if you're a lazy cunt how do we deal with lazy cunt you remember that lazy concert victims of culture right and that's that's the threshold here as where do we take them on mushroom trips and straighten them out well think about it this way if you had a kid go into a store and they there's a kid and his mother and the kid it's today and the kid goes and grabs some stuff and shoves in his pockets the mom says no that stealing slaps the kids hand the kid learns a valuable lesson and his values are altered right think about the same type of idea where we go into a store there's no money it's not even a store it's a it's a supply house a kid goes in he grabs whole handfuls of shit that is really unnecessary because there's no utility for it and the mother says no that's not what we do because we don't need all of that it has to be there we'll come back and get it later as we need it because these systems that efficient so you see how the value programming is very easy to add at so throughout time you'd begin to change people's values how they relate to their environment imagine if you didn't have to worry about money Joe imagine the extent that you could pursue in your life the interest that you found interesting and invariably I guarantee you if you look at how people respond especially in their later years and they get more introspective everyone wants to feel like they're contributing to society everyone wants to feel like they've done something social so that kind of greed self-absorbed shit that's a very adolescent immature thing it's probably there to a certain effect in the evolution of the adaptation of the human being as he grows but if you have a sister doesn't support or reinforce those issues then the miserable cocksuckers and dimwits and assholes and jerk-offs won't won't materialize they need but they're here we need to figure out how to get rid of them either to get rid of them or to fix them and bring them up that's gonna be very difficult because that's a real issue it's a real issue super real issue at the core of everything it's an educational problem so I Doug Stanhope how to stop doing this parties in the desert Doug Stanhope my buddy and hilarious comedian used to have these parties in the desert but you would have like you know anybody could come and everybody knew about it online so you would have like a thousand really cool people and - just unbearable douchebags and the too unbearable douchebags would make the make the whole party useless and those guys need to be you have to figure out what to do with them there's some people out there that are fucking mess you're having this beautiful solar dome where you're all this hippie pussy inside just lining up for you we're still gonna have to deal with the barbarians at the gates then otherwise they like to like the Nubians that stormed Egypt and took over the pyramids they're gonna come in and rush this bitch well I don't I don't see this materializing in some isolated place where the barbarians are waiting on the sidelines to it they're their people yeah the power went out right now there would be hordes of barbarians on the street with hockey sticks and guns and whatever the fuck they could yes yeah whatever the fuck you had and that would last for a little while and tear until someone said yeah you don't have to do that if we just calm down a moment the transition can happen even with the people that we have now that seemed to be the creme de la creme the victims of this culture it just gonna take a great deal of care and I think as a natural consequence as the system fails there'll be a great number of people that will turn around faster than you would believe once their needs are pulled away from them they realized that their needs have to come from some other process or somewhere else then the adaptation becomes natural well one of the things about the Occupy Wall Street movement that's fascinated me is the idea that all these people sort of live together you know they don't they're not just you know protesting together they have fucking tents and they have a community there you know they have books you could like go to their little library and and and read their books them all set up there you know that's so I mean it's essentially right now it's not really a commune but it's on its way and they kitties it's one of those guys said listen man my comment my cousin is a hundred acres out in the wilderness and they have fruit trees and they grow vegetables and there's animals and we can hunt we can make a fucking culture let's do this as long as we so obviously don't show any aggression towards the government certainly been done before but then they shut you down and they go Waco on your ass and fucking there's a building they or if you're a whole other country like the attempts of the Bolshevik Revolution of some of things something new despite what anyone ever thought of communism that was quickly shut down as a concept by the Western powers you got to be totally non-threatening if you want to start this cult you have to like get a nice piece of property but it's got to be real pretty and there's no property this isn't this is an evolution of ideas we're not gonna we're not gonna set up any questions man you're gonna need a camp you need get a need camp Peter right come on man right right outside of Arizona Jim Jones glasses yeah you don't need glasses dude you're gonna be fine you're really good at this you can make I talk to these people and just and just run the whole big solar dome right there from Sonoma so Nome was a good spot they're prepared they're accepting it they're ready they got the crystals out they're ready to take the vibe in yeah what is gonna happen man do you think that we're gonna have a situation where money is gonna lose all of its value I mean where it's gonna be so bad and the economy is gonna get bankrupt so so inextricably that we're gonna be stuck in a situation where we're like like Russia was at one point in time or you know where they were waiting on line with bales of money to buy a loaf of bread well you're already seeing the militarization of the police you're already seeing the social destabilization spread because of the faulty economic premise that is creating the unemployment that is creating the debt crisis that it will invariably highly be very inhibited by the energy crisis if massive moves aren't met so the three issues as I mentioned before is the unemployment crisis and expand on that let's think about this for a second if you have technology replacing human labor which is emitted across the board now mostly by colonists as opposed to economist because economists market economists are an extreme denial on this one and many a debate you replace people but you're not just replacing their job you're replacing their ability to purchase other stuff and circulate the economy and that that's even worse in its farthest extension that means that the entire fuel of growth is being slowly shut down which means that the system will lose more and more and the system will eventually just stifle to a point that it can't operate anymore apart from you know common remedial jobs or problems that might arise but there's no way you're gonna continue employing people on this planet and numbers that we have in the past it's all downhill from here because the profit motivation it replaced people who are machines is inherent to the interest to save money McDonald's has had systems on the shelf for 20 years now that would replace everyone in their kitchen now they are the front kiosk systems as well they don't do it only because their corporate view is to be social and as an employer they have a stake in that even though it's completely contrary to logic and if you look carefully they are automating very very slowly just like other grocery stores are automating you're reducing purchasing power there's no way the system is gonna maintain itself one that's once that continues and accelerates it's the contradiction of capitalist so the idea of human labor is becoming obsolete that in its own right is going to inspire some serious reflection and some massive upheavals it's going to call everybody contribute is it possible that everybody can find their own unique way to contribute outside of manufacturing things outside of working menial jobs outside of fast-food supermarkets retail when you remember that it's a lot of jobs man consumption is twice what it was now than it was in World War two advertising is completely fucked capita spiced per person per person the average person's in America since World War two consumes twice the amount of shit which obviously means something's ask you why why is that why do we feel the need to have all this other excess stuff socially speaking if you go to small tribes that don't have access to television they're very very happy with a very minimalistic life they're not they're happiness isn't contingent upon how they compare themselves to others or any type of notion of value they live in the culture that's been manifest within the resources around them and they happier than any American with the multi-million dollar house and everything else which is usually on antidepressants so we have as a neuroses that's been built which is fueling all this industry that's completely irrelevant basically and the more that happens the more we try to invent new jobs you know I had one guy economists tell me that oh we're just gonna end up using Facebook money say we'll have everybody on the internet doing something with Facebook or some other network where somehow they gain credits and they'll use those credits as currency folks now is that yeah something I don't know I was talking about this like like a year ago remember this just remember Joe we talked and my point is it wouldn't surprise me if we reached that point where you have a whole group of these freaks like straight up like idiocracy or something where they're all doing the most relevant actions a relevant waste of life waste of the human brain does nothing to contribute just to maintain the the idea of employment so I don't think that's gonna happen I think it's gonna self-destruct once the energy crisis hits and the debt crisis which continues to stranglehold the entire planet these three things will combine I can't predict the future but I think within a couple of years you're gonna see some very very radical shifts and a lot of governments on this planet I think a lot of detachment you're gonna see an extension of military invasions they got of Iraq they're gonna go into Iran and they gotta get their energy resources there they got a secure the Middle East for other resources as far as minerals and gold and other things that are there too there's a there's a the the faster it collapses the more criminal the meltdown becomes and that's something to I think people should pay attention to seen shit yet now that we have time holes by the way Joe did you see that Pentagon created some time holes and now they could make it Vince disappear well no first of all you're dealing with like nanoseconds you're dealing with right now this is version one yeah and this is only what they're telling us about they they could have been having these time holes for a simple time I don't think so because essentially the Pentagon is using guys that are at the forefront of science and the forefront of science is pretty it's published it's pretty much out there everybody knows pretty much what everybody's working on I mean not naming the art there's some definitely some black out projects but you know these guys is there's not a whole lot of these dudes showing the way they stay at this level of you know of being a bad super intelligent motherfucker house you have to exchange information how far how long is it just a few seconds like my nipple and I'm like who did this no wouldn't be able to perceive it there's no way you'd be able to perceive it but the idea is that this is just one a full forty picoseconds that's what it is it's what it's the researches admit there's a big difference between human hiding laser means forty picoseconds on hiding military operations lasting minutes or even several seconds but the idea is that they've they've started it Wow yeah they've started some interest it's exciting that is really exciting you know what man it isn't it isn't I mean everything is military it's really the Pentagon is the one that's fucking came up with this that's the most incredible thing like when you look at our capacity for innovation they're the really impressive shit is all the stuff that blows things to fuck up course you know look cell phone cameras are really impressive it's really impressive that you can make a little video and make a movie from your phone you know it's way more impressive you drop a little box out of a plane and a city evaporates yeah that's incredible you know and what is that that's just that's you know that's the peak of our technology a peak of our technology that's the most impressive is a fucking laser beam to cut the earth in half you know if there's any better proxy I'm not quite sure what is you know if you look at how much energy and ingenuity is going into these things what if we apply that idea to feeding people what if we apply that idea to doing actually relevant shit and then the hard-nosed folks that occasionally I agree with would say well you know what these fucks they don't feed themselves this is evolution out there that's supposed to be figuring it out supposed to be getting it together which I don't I don't 100% agree with they should pick like a year or something where like the whole year they're like all right every scientist you're this year it's cancer you have one year and just every single scientists like devot cents because scientists have particular fields there's two good scientists to go after aids well if you think another example the market system so inhibiting through its competitive mechanisms that the the prima facie Association the assumption is that basically everyone competing amongst themselves within the same sector will produce better results but that's that's cognitively erroneous you want to get people together to share their ideas not get proprietary right you want people to actually if what they really have the interest to cure or solve a problem or create something of the highest efficiency or utility there's no better way to do that than to get them with that creative drive in one setting so you take all the cellphone companies put them together diminish them into one holding company for all of humanity to produce the best goddamn cell phone right you could do that for anything and I'm sure if we actually thought about that cancer would be be cured well there's actually cancer cures out there already but cancer as we know it in the establishment would have been cured a long long time ago there's way too much money being made through this competitive practice though and of course the elongation of cancer it goes back to the efficient the inefficiency mechanisms what drives it all if I could give you the wheel if I could give you the wheel of this great great world this great society there's one one giant global culture what would you do would you first move well if we Peter Peter Joseph just wrong one the electrons the wrong logic does is well there wouldn't be any elections there's no greater insole an online poll you won you get to be king yeah I would there wouldn't be a place for that Heidi Montag was a close second you she didn't get as much pokes which is fortunate ladies when he pokes is you but you know the zeitgeist movement prevailed and then you're you're in charge of putting this thing together you don't want to be right you want it all to like figure it out itself no one single person it's the greatest insult to the fucking have like a President of the United States what would we the dynasty what yes we still are Month primitive Linda we need an alpha need an alpha month yeah it's apparently it is well we're still metal truly we just definitely still monkeys the weakens percent chimpanzee or whatever we are we can adapt pretty quickly that we have that cerebral cortex that popped out that can override all those lower brain yeah yeah we can long as we're dedicated we grow up well we're taught how to squash our instincts those stupid instincts are still there the instincts to dominate the instincts to gel be jealous the instincts to want to fuck other dudes girlfriends those instincts are all primal you know they're all in there only maybe maybe not though every every film every film you see out there reinforces such things like that it's hard to say just ever even Elm reinforces it but also does every no your instincts your own nature you know we are clearly some sort of an animal and unconscious being hybrid you know and we we battle with these very primitive I mean you ever be in front of somebody and just want to punch him in the fucking head well if you were a champion you were living in the jungle that's what you would do would just punch him in the head that chimp is pissing you off you just bite it you know I mean that's what they do that's what you're we have this thing going on in our head where we're trying to squash all that nonsense I just there poop on him you're a bonobo that's why it's more much more peaceful it's right most of their fights with carrying around sticks so they do whoever picks up the biggest stick it's like oh he's a bad motherfucker look at that stick right you know they don't actually like to go to blows like the regular chimpanzees fuck each other up they kill each other but bonobos really they mostly solve their issues through sex is a you know how do you saw you poop on you okay there's no universals there's no universe was okay I know what you're saying and I know you're very sensitive about this because that is that what happens in every situation where one person gets an inordinate amount of attention like I'm sure you're getting and you're a very charismatic dude you're very intelligent you're very well-spoken there must be some sort of a in one sense or another to get you to kind of lead things right I mean you must feel well that's why I'm here I'm just trying to communicate these ideas I'm you feel responsible like you mean you've created a movement right I mean essentially you press the button created see created itself but you did press stuff to start my start but then again you know in the sense of causality who of us really trigger anything I could go back and take the zeitgeist film and I could say well this is an influence of all these other people I could say Bill Hicks and George Carlin and made zeitgeist you know this is the values just spread is like there's an evolution and not organism of knowledge everybody hold on - but you were part of it as well no I understand I know you're being humble and I understand your point if you didn't create that video we wouldn't be having this conversation you wouldn't have had this movement you wouldn't have so you've charged up a lot of people's brains with that man it was a there's been a lot of inspiration out there which has come from a different direction explain I had an issue with the 9/11 stuff that when you guys did the first video essentially you were saying that 9/11 was an inside job then you knew that the buildings could not have come down any other way right isn't that something that was said with creative license yeah that's what was definitely implying said that just for it for a fact because it was your for the this was the you you did not anticipate this ever being what it was and you were just trying to get an effect I'm sure the audience would of course make up their own mind because before that there's a great deal of evidence in the opinion of the creator then all probability is moving forward yeah that statement was made declaratory do you think that when you see like Tower 1 and tower - do you think that they were detonated Tower 1 and tower - most probably were it's all XY z-- and Z's to me the World Trade Center 7 by all means the World Trade Center 7 is the only one that when you look at it it fell into its foundation which is exactly what happened even beyond that I witness testimony of people that were stepping over bodies from pre weakening explosions that were there you have all sorts of things that do not add up seismic elements that were brought into play supposedly no one died in an Tower 7 no there was a whole sea of people there was number the guy that that mysteriously died I believe of some illness his name was was a black man with glasses I know what you're talking about he was ago said that he saw bodies one other person were in the elevators that blew out on the eighth floor mm-hmm and he basically is the only eyewitness testimony to that in the in the lobby and he actually worked for the mayor too which was even more interesting well that one certainly looks like a demolition wood the way it fell but the other the other towers I've never seen a controlled demolition where it starts from the top and sort of Pancakes down like that it usually falls into itself you know it goes it goes and collapse into space I mean I don't know maybe there's another way to do it maybe they can do it where it pancakes down but it also couldn't it isn't it possible that a structural failure because they were hit by giant jet jet engines jet planes not since they were not since they were designed to take the impact of this faulty engineering like they thought it was the idea that you're having a cold structure law conservation of momentum you have a cold structure down here at the regardless of how hot it is up here to see a systemic collapse if you look at the NIST studies and everything else which didn't even explain the collapse by the way it's beyond improbable and I've yet to meet one structural engineer that could ever explain that especially given the freefall nature of it when it hit not to mention all the other characteristics on there meaning it would fell very similar to free Falls be very close to freefall speed of course I mentioned the pre weakening explosions the sub-basement explosions the recipe of it was perfectly in order with everything that you'd see in controlled demolition except this was just extremely advanced and it's an implosion instead of an explosion I've had this conversation with several people who believe his exact same thing and one of them was michael rupert who's on last week and i always ask the same question how many people how many people know about this if you believe that that is the case and you believe that it was some sort of an inside job coordinating explosions well if you were an engineer that could have access to the elevator shafts which would lead you to all the pivotal structural beams that would be required to do this you could probably do it over the course of time with 15 people 15 people then what do you do shoot them all I have no idea those work I'll think about how long it take for them at about the Kennedy assassination I wanted to take four you know all these other events that have occurred that people have been tight-lipped about for so so long about any historical event of black operation there's it's a tight Club in world tight tight Club it doesn't doesn't surprise me at all that no one would come forward my god no one would come forward and they would set up explosions and bring down two gigantic skyscrapers why the world watched and none of those assholes wanted to claim credit for that no one wants to step up and say they had something to do with that based on historical president precedent it doesn't surprise me at all just go back and look at all the history of black operations CIA and FBI look at the names that were under it where did those people go why didn't they talk about the things they were involved in before it's interesting that I know you know about Hitler burning the Reichstag and you know Nero burned Rome and we know that this situation has been it's happened in history before where someone has created some sort of an artificial dilemma to resolve it and and they've done it you know to pass laws to impose their agenda whatever but then when someone tells me that Oklahoma City they blew it up just to pass new terrorism laws I go get the fuck out of here yeah it's part of me doesn't want to accept that part of me is even though I know that it's been done before yeah it's a more complicated web it was recently released that the FBI has been involved in over 50% of quote terrorist acts that have occurred US soil what they do is they infiltrate and then they enable in certain ways and sometimes they bust them in the middle or they let it go forward and it's the case of the first World Trade Center bombing the other guy with the recording of the with the excuse me the the agent that was there that was working with the terrorists and sided with the FBI and they the FBI told him to go forward with the explosion they gave him the bomb to do so so that's that didn't need to happen that's public record really so they knew he was gonna blow up the World Trade Center they didn't they'd infiltrated the group long before it knew he was so suspicious yeah they let they gave him the explosion they gave him the detonator the FBI handed saw mom was his name and they the guy recorded his conversations because he was so upset by what the FBI wanted him to do all that all of that's in the zeitgeist movement companion guide by the way and perfectly honest I'm so sick of talking about that shit oh really oh it's always the drill there god damn though that's unbelievable I know about the guy and I believe it was Dallas where they talked him into blowing something up gave him a fake bomb set him up and he went and did it and then they were asked to them I'm like that is just you found some really dumb guy it's easy to see if you look at all the warnings of a song bin Laden and al Qaeda easy to see how that CIA FBI agents infiltrated a rogue group that we're planning to do a terrorist attack in the World Trade Center infiltrated and aided and to make sure it worked in the way that they wanted to even after the fact with industrial industrial organizing people died in the first World Trade Center bombing I believe a couple people did it wasn't that big I think of seven people or something so they're responsible for those seven deaths and the only reason that didn't bring down a major beam by the way is because it was another van parked in the wrong spot it was supposed to be right by this one support beam if it did it would have partially imploded down partially collapsed again and a whole lot more people would have died so you believe that they could 15 people could have rigged the World Trade Center towers and over the course of many months yes and they could have been planning this thing out the whole time and Dick Cheney's got all these I don't go so far to say it has anything to do with presidents or anyway I think it's it's a standard operating procedure black operation that's its telltale back in time and just look at how they operate it before and they just did it again who who sets it up no it's not that obvious corporate interests in Wall Street are highly intertwined CIA in wall street a highly intertwined you can't speculate on how this idea would really come to fruition all you could think of is that yes you have the options there any of the preston to do so i have no idea where the source would be it had so many benefits in so many different levels namely benefit though as to the administration the interest of the oil industry to move in on the powers of the middle east and give the ultimate precedent and as a side effect they were gonna orchestrate it though wouldn't they orchestrated with some people if we're gonna go to iraq that's the plan wouldn't they have iraqis attack us i don't think they could have infiltrated it but they tried their hardest to pin it on saddam i have one of the first publications by the way that was produced today after 9/11 by Time magazine it's the most amazing piece of propaganda you flip through it you have every horrible shot as exaggerated as possible and in boom you hit you hit Osama bin Laden there is next page Saddam Hussein next page the the guy from Korea so they just lined him up psychologically and they you could easily have seen Saddam was a highlight he was sitting there with a big a big big bazooka it was hilarious I mean it was there was there's planted as you could possibly get and which is not a new thing either it's just sad to see how people have no sense of history they don't really understand how business has been covert for so long and then again what would you expect big government is a business that's what it runs it's one big business we expect more transparency because we have so much more information transparency was never there to begin with the only reason that we thought we never had the Internet either exactly the only reason we think is because now it starts to leak because of how powerful then the WikiLeaks and people with conscience is you know coming forward and trying to help and make these things come out but it's really going back to the the social system you know flaw if it's a survival of the fittest concept if it's a competitive system doesn't matter whether it's two people competing for a job to corporations competing for market share or two countries competing for resources and their own esteem or whatever their interests are as an empire it's the same fundamental logic when Julian Assange came out with all this information released all this shit and what did you think was gonna happen to that guy I was just disappointed that he chose to put himself in the forefront because it painted a picture of a personality cult of personality which I just can't stand I didn't know what I figured he would just be he would be character assess it left and right I doubt they would try to do anything to him physically why do you think he did it it was an ego move to put himself I think it was inadvertent I think he was a spokesman was inadvertent but if if I was in that position of such massive attention I would have gotten a team to take the reins and not have one entity that way there's less for them to attack there's anything that I do in my work even though I don't consider myself to be that famous is I am always dispersing and getting other people to do lots of other things and take the attention away from myself for many different purposes for one I don't really feel comfortable with that any type of role as you've joked about it's really not in my character whatsoever I'd never done anything you've gotten to this point though I just feel like I've been pushed I still like the Lamar the king things like he just felt like I've big Martin Luther King fan he was felt like he was pushed so I kind of Lao myself to be pushed and I kind of go with the flow but there's nothing more important to me than showing a larger face to this type of concept and not get caught up in the cult of personality issue so there's a few different psychological are you making a living of doing lectures now like what are you doing I have never been paid for a lecture I make a modest living trying to commercially now exploit zeitgeist and occasionally I believe in and I still do some equity things and we do what we have to do in this system but I see you're out there scamming the people now I'm scamming other traders that's what you do is that what you do it's a little it's like a game you play it is that's all it is you do what you have to do you know it could just be a bartender somewhere you know you people I want you two boys and charge money for lectures seems I don't like it I don't like doing that people would be nice to compensate me for travel I appreciate that I can't afford to just didn't flagrantly go out there right I'll be you fly all over the country for free not usually but if there's an event I try to hope that they give me at least something it depends on the nature of the event are you guys gonna have like some sort of an annual thing like some sort of was like guys party we have well we have we have a site guys today which is a very intellectual day with a series of lectures about a dozen of us that give different lectures and different subjects what do you do that we're doing this one in Vancouver last year we did it in London before New York see that's pretty badass yeah that's that's a big pivotal part of the kind of awareness program we had we had great turnouts that's how you meet the guy with the land that's how that's how the story started he's bringing it to my laundry I did guy who does your land set up your cunt your compound who do you think killed Biggie rampart bro my captain conspiracy here are you you're not a conspiracy guy are you no I don't care for those I did I see the causality of it I don't care for the idea of conspiracy and certainly not into the concept as a theme people misunderstood the first film as far as what was said that became quote the greatest conspiracy film of all time and some press media which I thought was a bad it was it the idea was on cultural phal ability yet religious forests you know the 9/11 forests any of the entire banking wor scam it was all really a matter of how publicly manipulated everyone is into believing that these things are actually legitimate and hold up the social zeitgeist well I think what you did to is package it all together in a really easily absorbable form that really like sent the point home you know and again a lot of people started on a path of thinking that they might not have ever started on exactly that's watching that seemed to be so amazing you know you get emails like you've changed my life it's amazing to see the response again completely inadvertent but you have a certain amount of responsibility because that you feel it you know I of course I feel it I you know I don't take myself that seriously though I'm just like anybody else so anytime I run into somebody that has a kind of a cult of personality thing I really try to shut that down as fast as possible I can't stand being complimented oh it's on gets crazy you are my hero like that yeah I really met any chicks with tattoos your face on yet they're out there not that I've seen it I bet there's a couple girls that have your face on their calf definitely the hippie pussy you get must be unbelievable though throwing your way I don't know if you're in a relation with tattoos I think for some reason oh yeah I like tatted yeah tiny girls with crystals yeah girls ready you ready for you to start that cult it's not I don't have a rock star life unfortunately why is that we need to fucking manage this shit better choice if you need a podcast it's not in my character come on man that's all well and good let's pretend no one's listening let's pretend no one's listening let's pretend that this may be just one frame in an infinite movie that goes on forever and makes no sense you should be enjoying the shit out of this and you can enjoy the show this with rivers of hippie pussy let me tell you that man fortunately before do we do for Peter Joseph take them to the off guard if we get gave him a podcast Peter go Joseph every week yeah that'd be awesome dude come on you gotta give me a podcast you can have a consequence we all right I do a radio show okay what do you do is it on regular radios BlogTalkRadio that we do for the movement it's just a free is it online it's online so it's essentially a podcast as well it is a podcast yes no kiddie oh yeah more yeah you could go on for hours and hours I got the sex squad podcast I know you do but I mean it's amazing you never say um you like one of the the most eloquent guys I think I've ever talked it's amazing I was one of the things I was mmm paying attention to when I was watching your presentations like he's speaking so clearly he's like he's always so good with getting his that son that's not the easiest thing to do for a person like me who's essentially lived at least half of my life doing public speeches sure you know either stand-up comedy or or acting stuff or it's not natural to me I guess because I was a musician I'm not too afraid to speak in front of people I guess that's part of it you know it's to be a performer if you will but do you feel like at this point you have like as like guys act oh well and I say act then not that it's bullshit but almost like with stand-up comedy you know you have subjects that you know you're gonna go into and then once you get into those subjects you have stuff that you already said always sure sure well it depends on the trends in the circumstance it's a vast range of stuff and I could ramble on about a lot of other different issues if you want to go back for it but yeah so it's formulaic obviously I'm addressing occupy wallstreet I have a very specific kind of gesture I'm going for a little more in our key oriented trying to get relate to their values a little more angry because everyone wants to get riled up you really can't so you have a fired up speech that can give the angry Peter just again that's a great way to get to that hippy pussy you got to be a leader that's pissed off in any communication you need strategy so I try my best to call her my strategy just like I'm doing right now with you yeah well your so your your main gig is this now I mean this is essentially what you're doing you do your musics on the sidelines I do that as a hobby I do we do these we do art festivals and things like that to kind of make a little fun out of things the socially conscious aren't festive we had a while back but you know musics on the sidelines the film is of a new film coming out at the end of this year so what is that like guys beyond the pale and hopefully by the end of 2012 a month that completely set on that but it's gonna be the fourth it's me a live-action one I'm not gonna give away too much about it but live-action one I mean I mean it's gonna be a documentary but it's gonna be a very untraditional documentary I don't want to talk about because but it's gonna be it's gonna be very interesting I do a lot of character establishment with this one this is kind of actors in this one it's it's the same ideas same pushing forward with this broad social expansion the idea of what a rational society is and kind of did you see moving forward it's gonna be a similar portrayal of the third film but in a gestural sense which I think I'm excited to do is I've never done something like well that's not kind of a cool concept to actually show people as actors moving forward creating some new society it's not exactly like that no the the fifth film I'll do is the trilogy will not the trilogy the whole series will end in the fifth film this is building up to the fifth film but I did films gonna be a puppet show we do in a cave but the fucking marionette act we're gonna have a nice fire we're gonna lay over some bear that we just killed as we clean the meat you'll see your puppet show you'll explain right explain how it all went down right do you think we're in danger of that do you think we're in danger of nuclear war is it within our grasp that were that stupid that we might start bombing Iran and they start bombing us well the big argument is how mature a society is you know if you have molecular engineering which is coming to fruition and you can have someone using nanotechnology create off-the-shelf with a very small lab a very destructive piece of equipment the size of this bottle that can wipe out or poison or do whatever the hell knows to a very large landmass what does that say about the culture that feels the need to do that because now we have a rebellion across the world in real terrorism not the forest terrorism but there really is this angst that's emerged from all this deprivation from abuse blowback if you want to look at it a Chomsky how to view things little more complicated than that psychologically what's gonna happen we have a whole group of people that are so pissed and they're so deprived that they begin to have abilities with technology that far exceed anything like a grenade or a suitcase bomb so nuclear war as an extension of that seems almost inevitable not to mention the small destructive patterns that we can have I don't think people even realized that potentials on the horizon because our world is so programmed by our daily experiences we're so used to certain experiences and a level of those experiences and we're not you know where we leave with the idea that we're at war to us is some sort of a vague thing that you see on television unless you've actually been over there it goes back to the point I made earlier about broad collective social conscious versus the individual until we begin to look at society in a social way when you look each other as yourself like in poetic here it's just you can't have social stability until everyone's taken care of if someone's deprived in the other side of the world I'm not safe because they can be dementia dementia can kick in who knows what biases they might emerge who they might trigger and boom suddenly a suitcase bomb explodes behind me at some restaurant no one's safe anymore with with the technological advancement we have the risks to Fukushima power plant again you have to have a world conscious view at this stage especially with the age of modern technology and warfare or it's just as in the words of Albert Einstein our technology has exceeded our humanity he said that when he experienced the the nuclear bomb that he helped engineer he seed how I saw how bad this was even even the the great scientist that's in the wheelchair Hawking Hawking has stated that he wants to see everyone get off the planet he's he feels that we're already doomed we have to get in populate for the extension of the human species we have to populate another planet because there's no way we're gonna survive and this one based on what we're doing that's these are very smart people that think these ways so very smart people who are studying the human race if we're studying a colony of ants or studying anything else that you can clearly see where the way they're headed yeah it's scary unlike anything is it natural it's all natural it is all natural is it natural that the you know they say someone said this I believe it was McKenna that every parasite is a failed symbiote and then you know what what they're all trying to do is find some sort of I mean every body is filled with other sorts of living organisms and that these living organisms they work together in synergy they work together they they're they're symbiotic and that every parasite is like one that didn't quite work out and just fucked up and killed the host or jack the host or does some terrible of those isn't it possible that that's what technology is that technology is also sort of some sort of it's some sort of a parasitic symbiotic thing where it's it's in the middle of in the middle of helping us it's it's enlightening us and it's allowing us to to move forward it's allowing us to to exchange information to rate never possible before but it's also when you when you establish the highest levels of Technology they often are destructive and it's gonna feed the need for people to try that shit out and use it well there well there's the flaw of the broad human psychology is in this defense posture that we've we've groomed so well you know it's not the technology that's the problem it's the fucking people behind the technology sure absolutely but I mean isn't it like entry I mean it's almost inevitable that we we with this kind of power we will have this kind of behavior is it almost inevitable that with ultimate power like that well if there isn't a very dramatic change and the way people think about themselves how they relate to the world it seems inevitable to me how did you develop this line of thinking did you have some sort of a life-changing experience we just had great influences from you know from Carl Sagan to to even even George Carlin and Bill Hicks and the comedy spectrum coupled with the scientific community it was very influential to me both from a cultural standpoint and a progressive standpoint if there's any individual that's most influential would have been Carl Sagan as far as values because he was so in line neither guy and he smoked weed every day son did you know that no I didn't know that Carl Sagan would smoke weed and just think about space that's what he did he wrote some beautiful eloquent essays on cannabis use yeah it was brilliant guy this is amazing yeah it's a long value shift and I you know I went through the same stuff of anger and everything else I think a lot of people do then I met even more people that fascinated me and a lot of authors so many brilliant minds out there from Jacque fresco to buckminster fuller's and a job for us those the guy that's ahead of that Venus Project is that who he is the director of The Venus Project yeah and the Venus Project is explain that to me because they this is they a resource-based economy and Venus Project is a is it is a concept encapsulated concept put forward by Jacque which goes farther than a train of thought it actually in design actually has design issues that he's come up with throughout the years he's about 95 now and very brilliant very brilliant guy they basically are promoting very specific systems and the zeitgeist movement promotes long trains of thought without being specific to a design we used to be in partnership The Venus Project in the zeitgeist movement and you guys fell apart there was a falling out there unfortunately what happened hard to explain it was a kind of a personality drop-off motivations of that code for hippie pussy that's what it was they were fighting over hippy pussy Jacque Fresco's used to being at the top of the heap we need 95 years old you've been doing this forever and this young whippersnapper comes along making his fucking films like bitch I got a map I got a map for the future so this he's very specific as far as like engineering this sort of a designer and social engineer ah you spend a great deal of time doing it and it's just like buckminster for which i think is a good counterpart these are prominent guys that have really tried to push forward with new ideas and many different genres not to mention approaches to the entire social system I you know I watch a lot of things online and when I sit in front of it I do too that I mean I'm yeah I absorb whatever someone's putting out of course I listen to their message but I also when I see something like what Jacque fresco is saying I try to look at it as if I was someone I was someone who is in some sort of a position of power in government you know I was someone who was in some sort of a position of power of political influence that you know running the banks running the world I am math where the fuck it is it pulls the strings for the world and I would say how do I deal with this guy what do i does this guy a problem is this guy ever gonna be for real is this ever gonna be an issue that I have to deal with this guy and debate him as to how the world's resources should be used and I mean is this is that a concern for a guy like that I mean did the disease do you think that a guy like him or like you do you guys have to deal with someone too it depends on how far we go I think anyone in the you you think that right do you think like as far as like moving forward I mean if you did buy the land and get the people to start living there that's when you would have an issue well I don't again I don't advocate such a thing I don't advocate running from this how big is your file the FBI file they have on here if you had a guess I'd say it was fucking massive right I don't know I don't know what your if you started writing for you're very young right now look how old you you look 39 no 32 32 that's amazing you're 32 that's incredible so when you came out with the first sight guys how old Bo well it's four years ago so it's totally shit so you were in your 20s when you put that together that's very unusual man you're a very unusual talker you know if you're only 29 that's what you said 32 32 32 see that's very unusual man so what is it would you have to be to be President 36 but now but we for real you say that there's someone come along I don't believe in the system I don't believe right what exists change is a little bit listen man you could run this shit well the next project is something called the global redesign Institute which is me a non-profit I'm found in which is going to basically take artists and engineers get them together to show how to redesign the infrastructure for particular regions in the most sustainable non monetary was sustainable practical and efficiently possible so for example you could take Los Angeles you could show the public in conference a completely new redesign that didn't say have cars scenic gasps excuse me sitting at stoplights you know wasting gas how much gas is wasted by the inefficiency of the stoplight system at least Europe has those roundabouts mi better but you could think of all sorts of creative means from up in over systems you know a lot of cars they stopped on they shut off actually at red lights now what's good that's smart but it off the gas they start again a new technology I've seen there was a couple with battery stuff yeah yeah it so engines as well busted engine we see how the concept of efficiency is vast the pressure transducers and streets that can power the lights you know you have pressure transducers in these walls that could help power the lighting system in the building there's so many things that could be applied to society to make it so grandiose efficient that would rule out the market system by default but it would solve so many problems of poverty and hunger and even conflict petty crime and most crimes are related to money you could eliminate so many massive things not a utopia if you just applied the most efficient means and give people you know vertical farms with the coast of Los Angeles running the sounds asian processes from the water boom organic vertical farms feed everyone locally forget globalization think about how much energy is wasted on globalization moving shit back and forth product made here and China assembled over here in Uganda you know it's nuts what we're doing when you take that standpoint you begin to see how yes you can feed everybody on this planet you can have everyone have an access abundance we call it on this planet doesn't mean you have everything you want that's impossible the very idea of having everything possible which is the catalyst everybody can't be the salt number nine well everyone can't have a 50 room mansion or two Jet's parked in the front lawn that's actually an act of violence if you think about it social violence as an act of violence to think that way because you're the amount of deprivation you're imposing on somebody else by that acquisition of resources which is so excessive is in fact inhibiting other people's lives one way or another so wait a minute by having a jet or what have an only thing that is of such such excess and you can be subjective on this but anything that has no utility it's of such excessive vanity such as one guy living with his small family and a 40 room mansion and having two massive gas guzzling Jets parked in the front long just because he can who does that Travolta yeah Travolta does he do that yep well listen you gotta fly that dick in from all over the world gotta make sure the but it will to keep quiet jocks magic second that's so far I get that argument though someone says to me well I don't like your system because what if I want to have four Ferraris as though that's a utility need it's a completely vanity orientation I say well what if I want to have Africa as my backyard is that okay what if I want to block off Africa and Africa is my baby that's just funny you can buy Africa if you have so much money that you could slowly buy up the entirety of Africa but you see the point buy Africa and so is there is this a competitive society as their competition in this society competition would be within one square development which is what real competition is about accelerating yourself not against somebody else you know I could completely see how people in like a sports advanced society in like a sports context they're not really thinking about beating somebody else they think about beating themselves thing about improving their own betterment it doesn't become so in the process somebody gets beaten up then a lot of the a lot of the motivation you know if you ever talk to anybody very competitive it's not just about them performing at their best it's about winning sure it is sure that's what the culture reinforced every sort of winning culture definitely reinforces it but it's also I think a piece of human nature is involved in that as well it's too Universal it's not just this culture it's pretty much any culture where any sort of competition he starts going you know people people want to win you know it's a it's a natural thing and I think it might be one of the reasons why it's driven innovation to such a radical tipping point you talk to anyone who knew Steve Jobs or anybody who knows Bill Gates one things I'll tell you is how incredibly competitive these guys are very competitive sure I think it exists on a different level though and there's a lot of flexibility to it I'm not denying the that exists but for me I'm not competitive I have no interest in the right but you're also not the head of Microsoft sure you're not putting out computers and again I'm you've done an amazing thing creatively but in order to push innovation in order to push a company to push success and achievement you almost feel like you have to have some sort of a sense of competitive archit system invariably you have to be competitive or you're gonna fail you're gonna fail financially you're gonna fail in your status if you look at Steve Jobs writings and his talks the guy was a very creative individual that you could tell that his money aside he wasn't motivated by that incentive for one and I think his interest to be competitive was really just to make the best he could for whatever demographic or concept or idea and of course to compete against Microsoft to make sure he maintains his market share so competition is inherent to the game that they're playing that's that's my point who knows though am i competitive with other people it depends on the context of and also the conditioning within that context of what I'm doing if I have to survive and to go into a fight with somebody well that's an obvious competition that's something that my life might depend upon so obviously there's something ingrained there that means we respond that way but I came back to the you know the later existence of the prefrontal cortex we don't have to operate that when someone goes into a bar and steps on my foot or insults my girlfriend I don't have to beat the shit out of them I could say huh that's another dipshit one of many and walk away or I can say there's another victim of cultures all sorts of responses that we could have that are not based on that reaction yeah there's certainly a lot of fights you can avoid I was having that conversation she was someone today it's like you know avoid everything you can if you can get out of something talk to someone and get out of it get out of it are you crazy you want to get in fights with people so it's amazing this guy interviewed James Gilligan was that guys moving for tea is one of the most one of the most acclaimed criminal psychologists he would talk about shame and the issues of shame and why people behave so violently he spent his whole life analyzing violent behavior greater gave a great insight into serial killers and a lot of people that you think are natural outgrowth they're just typical of the system or typical of humanity if you will and he found almost throughout the entire thing it was based on a form of humiliation and shame and what was so fascinating is that the majority of the instances of violence happened in the most mundane and arbitrary circumstances wasn't life threatening someone would literally insult somebody else and they would get really upset by that and the shame that they would feel from being so small from getting upset from someone saying fuck you caused that much more reinforcement of their anger to get into a physical brawl it's fascinating it's a fascinating subject I recommend anyone that's interested in violent behavior to look up James Gilligan well you know I I am a huge student of human nature especially human contact in conflict right and and aggression and you trained as a fighter right yeah I've done martial arts my whole life and I think that's a huge part of being a human being I think every man if you're gonna have to deal with some form of aggression in your life you're gonna ultimately worry or wonder what happens if this becomes physical and I think taking that off the table and learning martial arts as it just as the animal human being is a great way to prevent him anybody ever fighting I've never seen a fight at a dojo I've never seen a fight at a jujitsu gym I've never seen a fight I mean I've I've never seen a fight between fighters you know for the most part most fighters they can communicate better because they know that they don't want to fight like they don't have anything to prove they know exactly what they can do look at the philosophy of Bruce Lee yeah I mean he was amazing there's a fee I mean there's been a few brawls post-fight brawls because if people get emotional and there's a famous one on CBS oh boy while back where mayhem Miller and the Diaz brothers went at it on CBS was kind of ridiculous but I mean for the most part the the amount of altercations that you're gonna get if you're hanging around trained martial artists are way fewer you know uh amongst themselves they're very rare and you put them amongst and the other group of athletic aggressive individuals you're gonna have much more conflict I think you take it off the table once you address it and you understand it it's like with a lot of people the idea of kicking someone's ass really a big part of it is they don't want their own ass kicked sure it's a fear it's like an overcompensation absolutely an initial fear yeah we need to figure this fucking thing out Peter Joseph goddamn it we're closing in on it we're clone is closing in on some some real interesting lessons well if you want I can go back to your question I guess from like 20 minutes ago regarding what the system would be if I was the leader of it which is the forest notion but what would defying I said okay yeah King what would if what would define a new value system it would define a new sense of operation and if you'd attract you track a fundamental train of thought you arrive at a series of conclusions the first is you get rid of the property system as we know it you create an access system best example is the Zipcar New York amazing mmm I love that above the zip code yeah people don't know explain it it's remains if cars just a rental car that's very easily accessible you have these special keys and they come and they'll they'll drop the car off or they'll leave it at a place that's that's close to you it's all approximately oriented computer-generated and basically you can have a car drive it and then return it and it's like a rental car except it's more convenient that's beautiful most people's cars sit in driveways for the majority of their life that's a great idea access access system versus a system of property is the most efficient concept of social excuse me of Environmental Management you can have think about it yeah it's so stupid for everyone I have so much film equipment stuffed in like closets I would love just to rent it but I can't do it because I had no value like to better resell it I'd spend much more money renting this stuff over and over again than owning it so it goes against it and then monetary sense it's monetarily inefficient you know that Zipcar concepts is a great idea for someone who wants to live in a place like New York City where it's just prohibitively expensive to try to have a parking spot or anywhere if you had a so if you had a society designed first of all if you're an inner city you really want to get public transit working well because that's the best way to do it there's so many failures my great-grandfather was an engineer and he had designed the system in Los Angeles years ago many years ago which was a trolley system that was above-ground wasn't wasn't susceptible to to earthquakes it was brilliant I was like why didn't they put this in back then it was like one of the first transit ideas for Los Angeles and even to this day you have you know you have them you have the subway but that's nominal doesn't really go anywhere and you have these cars just coming here I was just want to blow my brains out in traffic in Congress today so you can't keep operating like this eventually gonna do what they do in Latin America they're gonna have you driving by license-plate number you know they do that yeah you can't even drive in I mean what's gonna happen when population you can use to increase and we had these inefficient systems in place we needed her Mexico cities like that right now now sure Mexico's a lot of places on Brazil always traffic just traffic all day that's ridiculous even in China they've been moving out the bikes or they've been trying to motivate consumerism in China to get people to buy cars wieck's is good for GDP oh great so they can create more air pollution and create more congestion on their streets as well everything is antithesis is the opposites and anti economy it's ass backwards from top to bottom with the way we approach our economic structure so how do we fix it we have to wait for it to fall apart and start our own shit and then we have to show the audits show as I mentioned the global redesign instead of to show the world an alternative that they can understand to see how these problems can be resolved and then I advocate a parallel government system that's radical is that statement sounds I heard governments well you have government well apparent well you have the existing government and whatever region or in its holistic sense as far as say the United Nations if you will the parallel system would be a group of people that are not politicians are not jockeying for public support and public opinion and manipulating the values and abortion this and gay rights this and gay marriage that they those to become nominally obsolete because they are completely irrelevant culturally compared to what the problems we have the group of technicians and engineers and thinkers and creators that want to simply design the infrastructure society correctly to meet the needs of the human population and with that train of thought I guarantee you people be chomping at the bit volunteer to show what they can do to make society more efficient and as a side the product of that money goes out the window because if you really detail the issue of money you can't have an efficient system in the market model of economics truly efficient it's impossible one final point green economy almost about green economy right the green economy books written on green economy green economy is impossible also in a monetary system because of the inherent flaw of cost efficiency needing the cut corners to get the right product to make it so people can buy it the inherent flaws of cyclical consumption the need to have constant turnover our economic system is in one big paradox and the old economic theory it says there's scarcity therefore we have to have it the assumption of social Darwinism that some people can have the right to this through their equity and some cannot never enough to go around is the assumption simultaneously it's based on infinite growth simultaneously it assumes that we have to constantly keep consuming so people can stay employed and with a growing population well you have to have more and more consumption to keep everyone that's populated and employed it clearly hasn't been planned out there's no plan it's it's all been which is understandable in our evolution this is weird we are monkey cells trying to figure out what the fuck's going on but luckily we can begin to assess we can see the the light and now it's the big conundrum of how to get the fuck out of the system and it is something that actually works without seeing too much destruction without without seen too much breakdown I don't want to see the system fail the infrastructure completely be demolished I want to see terrorists come out of the woodwork I don't want to see we got to get people on mushrooms stat that's what's going on man the only way we're gonna fix these fucks is we gotta get them on mushrooms know why people are gonna make some just radical leap of change they're gonna recognize just like they recognize right now in other parts of the country where there's a leadership vacuum you know whether it's in Iraq right now there's racks going through a fucking Civil War congratulations to America we're just fucked up another spot in the world one of many some new dictator is gonna move into place some new ruthless motherfucker who dominates the situation meet the new boss same as the old boss right as long as they're in favor of Western geopolitics they'll be safe yeah maybe right what the fuck do we do Peter Joseph do we wait for the aliens or are they not real god I really wish aliens would come I would have set a great precedent wouldn't it we'd actually be able to see another entity that that actually was beyond us could actually give us the obvious awareness that were one species I would everyone family that's the Ronald Reagan speech is it do you remember Ronald Reagan he gave a speech during the middle of the Cold War saying that how quickly we would unite yeah as a as a race once if we were faced with a threat from another world and everybody got crazy like damn the fucking aliens are coming Ronald Reagan just letting us know I think nothing happened I had a great idea for a film was a bunch of hackers they go in I shouldn't give this away by doubt I'll give it away but make it well I'll give you the premise because it's fine I'll do it they'll be online they're gonna steal it well I hope they steal it okay you go put that information out we have a whole group of hackers right so they hack into the u.s. Pentagon and hack into the military systems that are interconnected around the world and they find gay porn and they plant a fake a fake asteroid attack coming towards Earth all the media now thinks is an enormous asteroid coming towards Earth that will destroy all of humanity what happens motivation of all the continents they come together they try to combine their resources they try to create some type of anti asteroid weapon and then suddenly someone figures out that these are just a bunch of hackers and they're brought in Chains and then they give this nice speech at the end of how this is their attempt to unify humanity before it was too late like a scooby-doo episode there were hackers trying to save humanity it'd be a good boy I think the audience would like that especially the audience didn't know they were hackers at the beginning they thought it was all real until they came forward that could work who do you think was how you know play the lead Matthew Broderick would you go with Kristen from Twilight what's your name Kristen Stewart should be good right here these to me one of your Matthew Broderick and wargames you know what's amazing I like watching alien the original alien what they thought that the cockpit of a like a sophisticated computer setup would look like right this is so wonky no no graphic user interface at all right right I'll just like numbers and letters and it's interesting lands interesting to see how people think about the future and what ends up being yeah I mean do it predicting space travel to other planets no problem but figure another graphic user interface it just really never been then whatever wrap their head around it yet so hard to predict what's what the future may hold man do you think the technology can save us is it possible that there's gonna be something that comes along that creates some sort of a connectivity with human beings that allows us to be more empathetic to the idea or more accepting to the idea that we are really truly one species that we are a super organism well in the words of Carl Sagan when he was approaching you know the nuclear fallout possibility during the Cold War he said if there's anything that positive that come out of this it will be the unification of humanity on the level of really a lot realizing that they are all at risk by the actions of just two small seemingly small superpowers this is a pivotal thing someone's breakdown a society occurs when people see how interconnected things are in the infrastructure of society in the fact that computers run everything already you know it's very obvious - symbiosis and I think will come to fruition if there's any pattern that's become more of a trend now it's the oneness poetry I look at it very literal but a lot of people like to take it into a metaphysical sense the unification the species is not just the unification of us as a family and a gestural sense even though you can go back you know to the mitochondrial Eve many thousands of years ago we all have the same basic mitochondrial DNA construct we all come from that basic kernel one way or another the entire species but the entire association of values in our minds is utterly symbiotic it's the group mind it's a collective consciousness if you want to use that old term I use the group mine it's a little more practical everything you think everything I think has been communicated to us one way or another filtered through a basic genetic pre-program combined with all sorts of other data coming from other people so no one originates anymore anything no one thinks in any kind of novel sense it's all an illusion and it was anything that could show the unification of the species on that level as far as what we think we are we can only be everything because they're very constructive thought is determined by what everyone else is thinking feeding into us through information whether it's your parents whether it's your educational system so there's no there's no way to rationalize separation you know I mean on a molecular quantum field level if you want to jump to that route it's all a big sea of molecules moving around just this is all a big illusion I think we all know that by now right well if you get to that how much do you think that you can manipulate your environment with thinking how much do you think well the beauty of technology as an extension of ourselves is it the ultimate tool would mean thinking really is a technological idea logic and reason which came to us just a couple thousand years ago with Aristotle we finally figured out how to think even though most of the planet still doesn't do that these tools will lead to something and if they values are right if we see the rationale if we see the reason if we see what it means to relate to the environment is very very simple if we see the benefit of automation as an isolated example we naturally adapt and adjust and what's happened now though I mean frankly there isn't a crisis there's only the crisis of the way we think there's no reason you couldn't turn all this around tomorrow or he wanted it to somebody makes a terminator well the old were a fantasy takeover by machines I'm certainly amused by but amused we're already taken over we're already taking everybody I know but I mean what if it's like literal yeah I don't there's no you don't think so there's nothing in there that that I could see programming wise that would allow for such a thing the ultimate expression of that was that hideous film I Robot at the very end the computer goes we have to exterminate all of humanity because they are a threat to the planet so the logical calculation that humanity can no longer is this that's the ultimate sci-fi fantasy of ought of artificial until that wasn't necessary but that's a big-budget Will Smith film and they got to do what they got to do of course as an idea of but that's a that catered to the long-standing assumptions of artificial intelligence and automation and a technological singularity you sure and as Curt small points now we don't really know what will happen with a technological singularity but once technology becomes sentient and as the ability to move and manipulate things who knows if there are if they're extensions of us they become our tools who's to say we want to program them to the bus says who says us that's what we're talking about earlier about failed symbiotes you know that the the parasitic relationship between you mean the symbiotic right now relationship between human beings and computers it's it's very similar to if you look at like other organisms that have you know lampreys on sharks or whatever I mean we're almost inseparable we're a part of the same sort of ecosystem now we need the lights to stay on we need the refrigerator to stay cold so that we can preserve the meat better I mean we have it sort of set out so we're almost complete the intertwine with sick knowledge neva Tabo and then we give birth the live one we give birth to technology where it's sentient and we're to figure shit out and so on and it becomes another life form it becomes a life form much like a biological carbon-based life form just completely different and unexpected and something we didn't see coming just like you know it's all very possible look at you mean do you ever like look at like broken computers and shit those are bodies those are dead bodies it's fuckin dinosaurs but they're happening really quickly at this stage of our evolution either we utilize technology to help us and hope for the best or we're gonna perish anyway so if it happens to be we become enslaved by a bunch of machines in the end well so be that must be a natural evolution so you're cool with that given what's at stake today I'm cool with that given what we have to deal with I'm perfectly happy to be a robot that is now I'm gonna be on the Internet Peter Joseph cool with robots taking over hey I'm cool with that this is the zeitgeist movement's primary premise we're cool with robots taken I will say this if there's a phallus the the problem of human psychology is so vast now that I can only dream of the cold quality of calculation coming forward to save us because we've fucked up just about everything so far we are way beyond our sense of self control that's what calculating society is that's what our brain does it's a calculation process and it's too bad we're so clouded with these us-and-them issues and all these things that are multi issues evolutionary baggage exactly and again it's easy to see a amazing beautiful society emerge if we simply wanted to construct one correctly because we have that power now and we have mushrooms do a barrel roll that's important that's an important part of the equation I don't think you're gonna fix people without some sort of a large-scale psychedelic experiment I did see an evolution special that alluded to that old Bill Hicks joke which maybe came true that that mushrooms could have been that link that pushed forward the human brain yeah that's my theory the stoned ape theory in fact when you probably saw yeah he said that it was in a more academic circle too that was actually more Buddhist McKenna yeah there's a bunch of scientists that have speculated it because you know the incredible powers of psychedelic plants I mean as far as like powers of experience I mean if you don't know if you never had it there's a lot of people ignorant to the experience but you've done mushrooms before I have you just wink if you're PR if everything in high school in college so yeah if you've had a real big experience a big trip you realize how humbling it is first of all just to know that that's possible that that's even an experience that a person can have and that they're not dying from it either and that I know we have a lot of friends that have had gone through crazy psychedelic trips and everyone's okay but be the the the experience itself to someone who's uninitiated it's almost impossible to imagine like you can't imagine that it's really possible that this could exist and then this is not discussed every day on CBS Evening News and someone's not saying listen man you need to get on mushrooms okay you need to find a fucking place where you're comfortable and you need someone who get you the good shit and you need to go there with clear intent he needed to yoga I need to find yourself because life it can be way better this recent John Hopkins study where the dark talked about one dose they had one large dose of psilocybin and they had measurable increases in their happiness their personality over you know a period of like 20 years let's just reset their whole life right so what do you mean Equis add mushrooms there's like there's another in harmony if I was magic and Fox magic we need Fox magic that was so weird by the way I'm still trying to figure the Rupert micro Rupert has a whole Fox magic thing where he believes in foxman well let's be real honest he was high as fuck and if you get that guy sober he probably would have never said that he knows Fox magic he's an interesting cat you know but you have to be that guy you know he's not it's not he's out there man he's he's not following any of this status quo that guy's out there trying to expose corruption and the government at every every step of the way you have to be a little a little he's got he's a hero quality to him yes he's out there he's doing it you can't really fuck with him he's oh it's a good guy too you tell he's a good guy he's a good guy we talked to him he's not an asshole out there doing the right thing you need people like that right Brian that's right Fox magic bitches magic well Fox magic t-shirts send them out there and then Peter Joseph in quotes I'm cool with the robots taking over that's how we're gonna make you some money beautiful market you all right this is very cool conversation yeah is anything else you want to say is there anything that people need to know about shit there's tons of things I could say tons of things I mean we got events coming up I'm gonna be in New York if anyone's in New York at the end of this month in Columbia for anybody want to hook up go for some drinks yeah what is the best way to find out information what is your number one website I know it's it's TZ movement on it's the zeitgeist movement today movement on Twitter that's for the movement what is the best way to be informed what website can people go to main movement site is just simply the zeitgeist movement calm and then the movie site of zeitgeist blue V calm and then you can link to all the other sub sites for the films and there's a bunch of scam sites that like zeitgeist film series has been subject to more manipulation and scam and resellers I've been screwed over so extensively by attempting to be altruistic with the distribution of that film and people buy things for me to resell at a profit all over the place I just now stopped doing a lot of things I used to do after four years because I'm running out of money I can barely see myself making this new film it's gonna be quite the quite the difficult venture but zeitgeist has attracted just about everything whether it's people that want to abuse it people that hate me people that like it there's no no more strange phenomenon I've come across recently than the zeitgeist phenomenon as far as a cultural issue it's really strange I would imagine there must be a pretty big life change to go from just being a classical musician right to all the sudden at the head of some crazy movement where you're being critiqued and criticized for every single word that comes anyway probably critiqued people gonna be mad you for even doing this stupid show this ridiculous show would make fun of everything you know you know I think it's important people realize that we're all just people and no one should take anything anyone that seriously I I have a great deal of humor with all of this I I have the karlon level I call it sitting on the sidelines and that's something I don't readily admit but the karlon level of George Carlin is where you just don't give a shit anymore and as much as I push forward with all of this there's a side of me that says you know what it is what it is if myself if my posh excuse me if I become just deeply unhappy and get tired of what I'm doing then I'm gone and it is what it is I don't owe anybody anything if people out there support such ideas they need to become their own leaders and really push this forward learn educate and do the same process that I've been doing there's nothing special here so is anything I would leave to the audience that actually has an activist bone it's that don't don't follow anybody you got to get out there and do it because a lot of these people that are trying to lead if you will are not gonna be around forever I could hit the karlon level and say fuck it evolutionary cul-de-sac goodbye humanity and I can go live on the moon somewhere after I do something or lie there at the compound at Sonoma at the car the zeitgeist comes where they're growing hippie pussy on trees well thank you very much man as a very fun conversation thank you appreciating a fascinating again all the information the
