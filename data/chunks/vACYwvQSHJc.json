hello freak bitches I also don't understand why it is automatically the guy's fault if it's if it's consensual I'm not talking about someone being incapacitated right blackout drunk that's reasonable people would see that as an as an assault but just it you're both really drunk and you have sex why is he the rapist because that tends to be what happens on the campus they do blame the young man they don't say you raped each other they say they will take her side if she can show they'd had drinks and I find this another strange thing that's happening with feminism today is that it's going but I call it fainting couch feminism it's almost as if we're going back to the Victorian era where there were delicate ladies preyed upon by men and as if the women aren't moral agents I mean if you take a lot of drinks you're probably have made a decision to lower your inhibitions and be Wilder what all kinds of things for going on that would explain that you're still an agent and in charge of if you're you know yourself self-mastery but they deny this of women it's all as a women have no agency and are you know constantly triggered need safe spaces at Brown University by the way they had to feminists debating one of them was a libertarian great Wendy McElroy and she didn't believe the statistics and another was Jessica Valenti a hard-line feminists they were debating but that was fine it was a debate you'd think that would make everyone happy both sides well were I presented no the brown feminists were traumatized by the very idea that someone would be invalidating our experience they use that phrase and they had they formed a safe room a safe space where you could go which had videotapes of frolicking puppies coloring books bubbles what stuffed animals no he had four adults and this was described in the New York Times by one cover story in the New York Times Magazine by Judith Shue Lovitz and this was the safe space and it you read it and your ear astonished that the of the infantilization puppies puppies frolicking puppies safe bubbles coloring books yeah I I get it it's kindergarten Fred's it hurts my brain you know this speaks to how people have a hard time accepting some of this new information I have a friend who's a scientist and the last time you were on she said to me did you have a climate denier on your show a climate change denier and I said he's definitely not denying it no but some people that's all they hear when you bring forth a non mainstream point of view or controversial perspective instead of considering the possibility it almost immediately gets dismissed is this climbing thing is another ideological struggle yeah sure climate change is taking place but what are the causes for this you know are we so sure that it's all caused by human beings I would say there's very good reason for Humanity to clean up our act in lots of ways regardless of the issue of climate change we're living where we're abusing Mother Earth we're living upon this planet alike like parasites and and destroying it we thoughtlessly created gigantic pools of pollution we're crazy enough insane enough to actually invent nuclear weapons and you know day long periods of detonate the like of things you know this is the lots about our behavior that we need to fix because it's right to fix it philosophically right we should not behave that way we should not behave that way to one another we should not behave that way to planet Earth but to say that we need to fix our behavior because of global warming that's an ideological argument and that argument remains to be properly tested yes global warming is occurring but are we the cause of it or is something else some some grander scale cosmic effect involved in this what we talked about that considerably and I noticed in a lot of the comments from from our last discussion most of the critical comments were people you know not liking the idea that I had questioned the dogma of global warming but there are some facts that you can't escape though the global warming began 200 years ago and we see that the glaciers from the Little Ice Age began to shrink back in the early 19th century before there was you know a century before there was any significant human contribution of co2 to the atmosphere so something was driving that warming that began and it's important to realize that the Little Ice Age was probably the coldest period since the end of the great ice age in fact the data overwhelmingly supports that in that the glaciers grew to their largest extent around the planet in 10,000 years so when we're talking about glacier recession it's important to understand what the baseline is our baseline in this case is the biggest the glaciers have been in 10,000 years and what's interesting and this is going on right now as the glaciers have been receding geologists and biologists and and glaciologists and so forth have been studying the landscapes that are being revealed as the ice shrinks back and you know what they're finding is the remains of forests that had been overrun by the Little Ice Age glaciers up you know and and peat bogs and things that would suggest that prior to the onset of the Little Ice Age those valleys that were filled with ice from roughly 1400 to 1800 were actually forested because the ice came down and over and these forests and now it's receding back and revealing that there were forests there so that tells you that you know at some point probably going back to the Medieval Warm Period those areas that were that have been glaciated during the early part of the 20th century were actually free of ice and so you know the climate has been extremely dynamic that's the thing we have to emphasize all by itself without any help from humans and this is what I've been saying is that we have to look at that and and realize that yeah humans are a factor you know somebody I did post and said all the other factors I had mentioned as you know ocean currents and wind currents and geomagnetic field and cosmic rays and volcanism and all that had all been investigated and dismissed and the only thing left was the human contribution but you know to me that's really we're putting all our eggs in that basket and that could turn out to be very dangerous because we're so focused now on our own contribution that we might be Oh looking the fact that there have been natural factors driving climate change over and over and over again I mean because I still have not heard any consensus on what has caused the planet to first go into an ice age and come back out of an ice age and I think that what Graham and I are talking about actually presents a possible solution to what could have brought this planet out of the Ice Age something on a grand cosmic scale and the other point I think I'd like to make is that we have to really to understand our planet as a system we have to realize that it's part of a cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been a much bigger player in what's been going on down here than has been a previously understood or appreciated [Music]
