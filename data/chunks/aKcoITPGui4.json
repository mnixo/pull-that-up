join my dango rocky podcast my night all day round kick man god om photos to the body - it was a domination like a total complete domination and yeah yeah it was a strong favorite in this fight I air max Holloway well all those numbers tablets out sighs let's like build a guy up and that's I think this is like the bike tour our brand well as a killer someday in the future I think that's legit fight and I think that's an interesting fight not like the Frank Holloway is a bad motherfucker max Holloway a bad motherfucker it's a really interesting fight I agree with you yeah okay well they they made Ferguson could be official yeah for interim title everybody can tunnel traffic faster but I got every right now from now on will be an interim title not dim it that'd be nice wait cubby I'm sorry they made what 20 burgers and another seashell yeah but they made it as mortgage for title which I don't understand super confused it's very confusing because Connor just won the title I see I think this is more of a sign that Colin's going to fight Floyd next because if I talking Dana like you don't see me anytime soon son or it's more of a sign that they wanted to have a pay-per-view card that was stacked with championship fights but if you keep doing interim titles people are like alright we get everyone to fuckin water but you know the cars about to have a baby because wife's about to have baby careto that's going to be such a scary time well maybe he's not it means we'll richer than lots of guys yeah I'm sure that's true and he's like listen I don't wanna go through training camp right now on experiences with jet point first kid anyone had a baby don't get in training camp yeah I mean so fucking man how badass is Yaya Rodriguez i'ma last the coming-out party folks BJ sit on his back his it though or is it a product of BJ being basically a heavy bag in there and I love BJ it's that but it's also look I think BJ when he was 10 years younger it would have been a tougher fight for you here for sure within 10 years will be 3 or way tougher fight pieces well you know still get blue tile cool fucking no this is the problem though is that it's not just a matter of BJ being a legend BJ being an all-time great - division world champion bad motherfucker without a doubt but his style is a boxing based attack then a vicious ground-and-pound and vicious top game submission game BJ is not a guy like submit skies off his back and BJ is not necessarily a guy who kicks that much but so yeah here who's an outstanding kicker well that Snickers he has just as huge advantage do you know what it's like if you you know maybe to check window yeah if you had a guy who said you know a new box a little bit if you had a guy that said hey let's spar you can kick and I'll just bark I feel like well good luck with all the exactly can I kick your legs yeah many of you like yeah be like oh well well you just you're gonna find terrible afternoon yeah terrible yeah well right now you're fucked they just didn't BJ fight didn't am I crazy or did he fight Machida cheated anyway so heavy so Christ there's a heavy weight on though it's called the rock and the Rambla rock I'm rockin Hawaii no no my god he fought Leo dough in Japan in rumble on the rock he fought Carlos can't no he didn't I called times I'm slightly Liotta and rumble on the rock he fought like o me he beat the fuck out of go me remember he brought go me over to Rumble around beat the shit out of him and strangle them I thought he wily other but he fought in k1 he said he fought Duane Ludwig and k1 as well I thought yeah I thought he fought Lee Otto in Rumble the rock hmm you might be right I don't know it appear that Jamie Eiffel fucking tie and pocket-handkerchief much bigger for tyron woodley timbers wonder boy I know I kill verse 1 boy to like law you got what do you got a fuckin I kind of felt like you happy unless Judge George st. Pierre comes out of retirement then you make an exception but since you're out look at this just is horrible to watch man taking that left kick to the head all the wheel kick and this is like right away early in the fight is getting staggered he's getting his leg kicked out for like those WME boys made oh man that's 360 round kick to the night yeah totally front kick and itch oh my god - what yard Yair Rodriguez first Brian Ortega is a fun one look the iron Rodriguez vs. anyone is a front one I mean the kids 24 years old who the fuck knows what happens with you I hear ya year might not even stay at 45 he might be stepping up to 55 the next year might be the Mexican Conor McGregor might be the motherfucker anyway going boom the Arctic is 45 ranked number he's ranked ahead of yaaaa he's number 9 dude when you say BJ Penn get rocked like that see the legs give out like on like k1 hero's for me we're set up longest active win streak in the Frederick division max Holly giant Joe you're right yeah thing was k1 right yeah and before that it was a rumble on the rocks and who do you find rumble on the rocks back up a little bit there UFC grows down way down keep going no we go me he's hot Takanori going with me fight someone else yeah Gracie illegal rodrigo Gracie that's right and that was a decision right that was kind of a boring fight for I remember correctly powerful Larry Landis referring having seen what kind of did to any of us what what did you what did you take on Alvarez I mean that Conor khabib that doesn't matter that does that just a fight Tony he's got a fight time that's what you can't just dismiss how you don't know I got one like you could be gustas no no no you're right you're right you're right I forgot about that that's very and you can't ever use mm a map here had lied Ronda Rousey submit some cat Zingano in 14 seconds cat Zingano stops Amanda Noonan the third round Amanda Nunez destroys Ronda Rousey in 48 hour math never effort wasn't work you can't make a base without that matchup Styles it's one-on-one it's like when you using that translator thing that I told you about and you read things incorrectly but Ferguson is dr.
