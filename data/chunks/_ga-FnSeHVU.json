I like these five four three two no yes hey everybody I'm sorry brother yeah Brendan Schaub of Bryan Callen were engaged in some shenanigans on Sunday rough house Sunday rough house I was trying to chill I was told I was poking the bear I got I had too much coffee and I went I went into it I got into his face and then he decided to Jamie chosen as I'll be on my Instagram story double tap out yeah that was not right yeah yo top well I got a fucking huge a rug burn on my fucking forehead now that's it I'm kind of well that's what happens what kind of shit fucking production is this look at this they got who's running the cameras over there in England they do showed niner in the background and the fucking the curtain that's covering the monitors whoever did that sucks this is what happens on the UFC got rid of all the old guys now you got new guys over there in England too or wherever the fuck that is the Stockholm yeah so Eddie Bravo can't be here folks because he's on the other side of the world we're flat world that shit is ironic the flat world where is the I think he necessarily says the earth is flat he's never necessarily said it he don't know he just says things like I don't know bro take a look at when you look into it do it I'm not saying it's round I'm not saying it's flat what's amazing though is the angry Flat Earth people when you even post something like that oh my god they get so mad but don't you think you're being trolled for the most part no no really I think people are that fucking stupid I think there's a bunch of meth babies out there I think there's a bunch of zombies who are eating nothing but sugar and their own kids and these kids are stupid as fuck that's a lucky turn yeah I think there's like a few trolling but in general the mass of those morons yes well a lot of people just don't have any idea of any kind of tradition of where we came to these conclusions so they think that history starting right now with them well you know I mean there's a lot of laziness yes a lot and there's also a lot of confirmation bias they have these ideas in their head they don't look into him they're just not interested in like really getting into it well you know like listening to that that debate with Michael Shermer and Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock like if you wish your scientists and smart people they're very careful about what they say because they could call that on it sure you know what I mean and arriving at real conclusions is something they tend to avoid they'll just have these big discussions and kind of approximate what probably happened yeah and even in that discussion you got to see people that got into trouble for saying something didn't happen and so that as Randall started unveiling more evidence and Graham started unveiling more evidence it was one of those things where everybody kind of had to back up and get okay well you can't say it didn't happen because of all this stuff that we know did happen now so it's it's very complicated when you start saying you know things and when you know almost nothing about science and space and astrophysics and all the different shit that you need to know to understand satellites and ice walls I have a widget how about the way our mind works like that tobolski what's-his-name who I just listen here vodka yeah what's the policy so I listen to a couple of his lectures back in the day on Ted comma like when he was talking on all the variables that lend themselves to how your brain works oh yeah and who you are but good luck getting to a conclusion he's a staunch determinism but believed well not even I wouldn't say a believer because he's a scientist but what his conclude mean what he's trying to establish with people is that there's so many variables that go into you being you biological biological variables also genetic variables variables in terms of like what genes are turned on by stress when your mother's has you in the womb yeah there's so much shit that goes into you being a person and so you know what he's saying is I like when we look back on today and we look back at people being punished for certain things that they did being imprisoned we're gonna think it's absolutely barbaric when when real neurologists firmly established the actual science behind human behavior meaning that we don't really have free will where our behavior is dictated by our biology and our mojo yeah I mean there's well be some will right because like why alts are their inspirational memes that strippers put on their Instagram page I just got it boy is amazing want to try to ride the bum high more than going to China Oh rats above ditch I'm trying and you can't hide inspired right yes like can't we see this is where the free will argument kind of hits a bump in the road because you can get inspired by shit and when you do and get inspired by shitty can improve your life like for how long though right then yeah well it depends multi messages what's that old expression is that inspirations like bathing it's effective but you need to do it daily yeah yeah or how about the fact that pond fish I've ever heard the huh yeah got to read a little bit every now pond ash one doesn't bless no Marines that's I mean it's multiple shit that I just got my tattoo I'm getting that as a tattoo do a good look like oh my dog that's a bold move guys tattoo their dick I'll change forever would you like what would you do we should tie to your dick black just all black just a black band Alice I people do that they gets like their whole arm black that's a weird I wonder I thought it was cuz they messed up and their god better just cover everything go black but no for some people they do do it for that and some people do it because they just want their whole arm to be black yeah some people that bands can look good and then there are people that just get random shit like a Cadillac I mean or a doll well how about Travis bark he's got everything you name he's got is are yeah I got that tattoo doodles had a tattoo cattle excellent row yeah he was a guy is guy things guys cartoon or forgive the guys name but he'll have two of them worked on at the same time Jesus Christ both on his back just doing work dudes like that like run out of canvas like he's kind of running out of canvas yes zombies I didn't know his whole head is done Jesus tells his whole head is done but a lot I mean he's got a lot of tattoos but remember he got in that plane crash and he had like third-degree burns all over his body oh yes I remember he got a lot of them after that oh yeah covered kind of that bullshit yeah that was a fucking crazy insane man he survives that guy DJ am and then the guy kills himself afterwards well he was really fucked up right after oh yeah drugs but I used a little fine before then and then goes in the hospital and then beyond the medication the miry lab yup I know I know a woman who got injured like that and then she was they put her on morphine and she has to basically battle a morphine addiction the rest of her life yeah she said I will always be addicted to opiates I always want you don't have to be but yeah well no I'm saying she's got that urge all the time you know well you got that urge when you had your nose fixed right oh yeah yeah a lot of issue but you know what's it like uh you just want them all the time like what is it like when you say you want them like what's the feeling like like the same feeling as like I don't like if you crave something like you're constantly craving it I got it I'm I'm good right now I'd be so much better if an oxycontin you know Wow yeah like this all right we'd be going out like it's gonna be fun it'd be so much fun if I said one oxycontin though wow did you start doing they see they're like damn I'm doing this for everything hahaha you were just oxy it up I'm not nonstop Wow and they're so easy to get Jesus Christ so no one ever question you when you want to get a refill or anything like that no because the doctor was like hey I'm hip I'm cool here's like 300 you know like a shit long yes he liked you because you're UFC guy yeah we're boys yeah oh boy kind of mine 300-day Jesus Christ what did you ever tell him hey fuckface he kind of turned me into an addict no I kind of blame myself yeah well that's healthy well that was like smashing machine when they went to do that that thing on markers oh yeah they didn't expect I know the guys have made it they didn't extend it Noah's gonna take that turn yeah well they went to get him like right when the water went over the top like right when he crested over the top that's the documentary oh yeah I've never seen it's really good it's really good cuz they went to they went to document the greatest fighter on earth cuz car was this just juice machine how long ago was this made shit man early 2000 yummy so Marc Marc restful down 188 yeah it was actually I think I might have been cuz I marry you and I talking to him in 1997 and he was 260 he had just you just need that Ranger in the face yeah Ranger stopped yep and then I said I said I said you wrestled it 188 he said yeah so what do you and I guess two-sixty put a little miracle-gro in the cereal every morning and I was like god damn is Tara's look good on him steroids the cold it looked amazing on him yeah he uh give k2 or no is that oh well I don't know hope so I know sana a wonderful man a really nice man I hope he's gay what's going on here so who are these gentlemen the guy with the writing on his armor Herman 4:30 right Hermanson Hermanson and Nicholson and the for 28 for 27 for 26 for 25 in round one if you want to sync up you look at the fighters on the start and it's a fucking good luck spit with this spelling look at him back then look at that she's all right just a little shelter just dealt it's so big oh my god and he'd made her American he'd wear American flag shorts that looked amazing yeah he was oh they called him the specimen right well they fart they started I'll call him the specimen then they call the started calling the smashing machine um when he fought I forget who he followed and kobish danbo but she got danbo bitch down and he submitted him by shoving his chin in his eyeball he put his chin in his eye socket and just grabbed the back of his neck and just plunk enforced his chin is the biggest meathead move of all time all time it's up there it's a great official meathead move move I mean I know it's a move for a shirt some meathead shit but it's a move beamed is it more of a meathead moved in the can opener cuz he submitted a guy with a can opener - I feel like Caleb was a little more technical he jacked some dudes neck with a candle how is it more technical you're just pulling on a guy's head yeah but you got to get them for this I mean for your future staring like fuck it Chindi I brush in the eyeball there's no technique so do that right now that's actually more technical that I can oh shit or is it more part bear it's more barbaric for sure but I mean well I guess that would be well this fights over I guess did get Jack Muhammad Jack in mind that I guess the big issue with 12 to 6 eyeballs would be if a guy was down and you are conscious Ison right into the eyeball yeah this is more like a steamroll approach which is real slow presses much no fathers me that I can't do that to a man what do we look at that up there Jim oh sorry thought you thought you'd shown us some I'm gonna work on that technique you couldn't do that to a man is that what you're saying I mean you know I just kind of cut a smaller guy I'm fresh off my wound ice my head still hurts from you fucking hurting Josh Martin on the ground and stuck your chin in his eyeball think it's a minim yeah there are guys I don't do that it J their little dance which was a comedian oh yeah there are certain communities I could do that too yeah I feel like it's all a pecking order isn't it to Jay Davis might give you a hard time remember when uh uh Valentin's over brother in Maryland he got the can opener on Ray Sefo you remember then yeah super old-school did he submit it with that oh yeah I'm pretty sure it was out of sight control Valentijn Overeem submit a Randy Couture with guillotine old school no school yeah he just didn't have it like the ring no well he would fall apart when the when the bombs started dropping when when the going got tough he's like you know what fuck the check please when you're winner when you when you're when you're racing foe who didn't he was more of a striker wasn't he uh yeah to say the least yes sir so for him I guess getting caught in a can opener just as a function I'm just like you wouldn't get a high level jujitsu grind can opener would you or would you I'm in the same situation I mean I really does super gorilla like Mark Kirk could get a good black belt in one if like he just could the guy just could not get out it's exhausting yeah if Mark gets ahold of your neck like he's just gonna rip your ligaments apart your tendons and late week back then he was so good realist wrong I mean it didn't even make any sense yeah he was so stupid strong and you're not used to like if it caught you off guard like I had brought a Waterman Ron Waterman take literally take my face and smash it between his tits had to tap out yeah you know hope to not be ground water minutes you Bri aroma he's Josh she's all tan literally took his - when was this smash cro cop fucked him up that was one soccer kicked him in the yeah that was one of the first like cro cop becoming cro cop fights when cro cop started learning takedown defense motherfuckers got terrified oh my god baby god baby shit he fucked him with my nose tackle do you know what's funny is when you see what happen it was so embarrassing and Shane goes Shane Carwin is just three of us in the room and Shane congas damn yeah I go have you ever taught Degas you're looking for some kind of camaraderie and it was just dead silence and I was just this + e of the day maybe come back next week just do you know it's funny is when a guys who've never had any combat experience especially with wrestling get caught up with a guy who has experience so but Dov had never had any wrestling and he grabbed on to mayhem Miller loach and and Jason was kind of showing him this it might you know it's like we're all out of wood floor and Jason started showing him just a couple of things where dub was grabbing him stuff and Dov was so kind of a nice box so he knows the difference with striking but he called me up the next day and he said it's very difficult for me to get my head around this I said what is it to be that dominated by another man that easily and to realize that I could just be his Dov of a mirror in his house no no I ever take off his clothes veteran era he knows better he knows better but easy he's not a bad boxer for an actor or comedian he knows better mayhem Miller though yeah but ver doom black the other like looks a little Jake she'll be honest about what's going on love double punch in the face dub is a good boxer luck with that he spars a lock with the head though though is not a bad boxer for a man especially at his private time especially at his prime mayham was a monster man was a bad mother foam I catch it but you know like I really feel like mayhem just took too much punishment in his career and I think you know he also has some some obvious D mental health issues and pain is one of that brother yeah yeah rough rough upbringing I just think yeah I like my hammies every time out such a good dish all those those weird you know things can't control I think all that accumulate on him in the hot Sun brain trauma maybe on a percent brain trauma man that Bisping fight was a motherfucker dude Bisping beat the shit out of this before that doc is going it's really going into that fight like that wasn't I've never seen mayhem fight like that before even took a punch I was like what the fuck is he doing well that was is a big fight for him because that was one of the first fights we had a lot to lose because he was on The Ultimate Fighter coaching against Bisping on the Ultimate Fighter he not see if he could pull up mark or submitting danbo bush with a chin to the eyeball I'd love to see that I was there for that one were you yeah that was like 97 that was the early days of the UFC and I remember thinking oh shit remember that dude when when they would have it in a parking lot somewhere and I would always come with you and we just sit there and it was just such a different well we were in Louisiana once you me and Rikki Rockett and Eddie Bravo yeah Rikki Rockett was taken to jury-rig rocket so like a legit black belt under the shadows legit black belt like rolls he's very good and I know you're like skeptical HIPAA face down with them um but we were all in like fox somewhere in louisiana or some shit right where the hell were we Baton Rouge man Roush I think it was someone ever just meet me at the airport yeah just like let's go and I would just be walking out these guys children wrestling you guys were just fans at the time you weren't working I was working we're doing with post fight interviews John I 107 God damns yeah dude I've been like in 20 years late to Joe and I admit I remember you and I walking like I like little schoolboys Randy Couture was sitting there being interviewed I remember the so well and you and I kind of addled up we kind of like stood at a little bit of a distance and just stare it at him and of course you know me I was like it to look I was like look at his shoulders he doesn't look that big Zorin is like look at his leg he had a bulb on his knees like lays in that big and we're just like looking at what a badass he was just year this body forged his peers on the whole it you guys are around next weekend are you for that I am I leave Sunday night Sunday around a night for Australia so Saturday we could do if I companion for this that's a big fuckin car that's all oh no you know what I'm gonna be in that what is that because I'm gonna be an Irvine 238th oh I'll be here yeah yeah dude remind you an eighth night we Jenna somebody's come see me this is a legit fight oh my god is it Elijah's max Holloway has a legit chance I think max wins you think so really yeah I like mats in this fight Wow I don't like that you know I don't know why he's not getting more respect I don't max yeah so fucking is getting a ton of respect you don't think max gets a lot of respond i Q should or the press I like the fact that he's willing to fight him in fucking Rio too man max doesn't care getting your fuck talk about a just incredible champion though although well you know what man all those great legacy in his reign is always gonna be tarnished by that 13 seconds against McGregor which is so crazy benefit because you take away that fight and he's got one brutal war with Chad Mendes where he got rocked and stunned which is a tough fight to my part too yeah ii won't be one of the best fights welcome great fight and then that those are like the only hard moments he's had inside the Octagon really other than like maybe round five against Ricardo Lamas remember Lamas had him down and was doing a little bit of ground and pound on the fifth round but that was like although was too drained making that weight but he's smaller now you know he generally looks smaller he definitely chose to slim down you know because I yeah because he was had unbelievably brutal weight cut horrible early in his career he was just too big for the weight class and so he just chose to slim his body down your boy beat door fights Nate Marquardt on that yeah good and that's his last fight in the UFC and then he says he's gonna go elsewhere time for the return of teeth I can't wait he's going to Japan son hey dude Godzilla vision or go to Japan and fight super heavyweight you can't get a 240 let's celebrate that and just happen to everyone with the shin and reflected on the animal you can't find a chimney high ball bang damn it can you find it mark curtain I think it was in UFC 14 which would be on fight pass which I'm signing up for to get okay beautiful um yeah man I'll oh I like to see Vitor come back and she's still gilt used to guild members crop heavyweight well man send me up what's going on and rising is like it's all on the table you know this is not it's no funny business yeah okay but man do I got a do everything's good just for recovery problem just working for recovery need recovery it's important you recovery you need yellow eye balls remember when Ben Johnson won the Olympics and his eyeballs were yellow cuz liver was processing so much steroids oh my god I don't know to whites of his eyes were yellow yeah really yeah yellows was Ben Johnson goddamn xmin and Johnson the one who won the gold medal and was the first like real publicly shamed steroid you remember how fast how he pulled away from Carl Lewis and everybody just you know what do you matter what he looked like oh by the way Carl Lewis was on steroids to correct all of them work his Ben John's was just better well he just went too much you took it to the ultimate it looks like Simpson yeah just Mitch I don't know what Carl Lewis is on but I do know Carl Lewis tested positive for quite a few things when I started researching the history of doping when I had Victor Conte on from the ball Co scandal ultimates yeah the ultimate super snitch he's the super snitch of all time and then this person talking to Lance Armstrong and understanding like in and going in though I watched maybe five or six documentaries on drugs and sea-based got your masters if you watch that many documentaries like says what I feel I don't even take a guy that's a nightly college degree i watch real them be like I got this a young master so let's see what I did take out of it was that like according to Victor Conte all of the track and field athletes are dirty it's more prevalent in track and field yeah Eenie yeah he was a training track and field 100% what he was saying essentially was that what Ben Johnson did was get caught but there was a lot of people that do it not only were they doing it but it was coordinated by coaches it was coordinators a game yeah and I say this all the time I think it's that's it's just part of professional sports yeah it really is I'm not seeing your favorite guys doing it but you know that the odds are there's a lot of these guys that you see on TV are doing it you guys think that there's game Gerizim boxing oh for sure yeah that's a serious question well don't you understand that Shannon Briggs just got pulled out of his world title fights for testing he's 45 so I can taste what I'm talking about like cuz what not to say I'm not saying anybody's doing it but when I watched the Kell Brook all specified great great fight by the way amazing fun amazing fighter stance on an athlete new world changes right dawg yeah that's right on and another tumble option to go on there in his domain and he got it kind of boxed up for the first few rounds I didn't have a winner those first when the when they brought up the scorecard my god I disagree I feel like broken ass don't work well I agreed with what's-his-face Steve far would says named Steve far hood far would I know each time of that brought up them he's a Herald that of enough showed yeah a lot better though you like he's like him better yeah your little man's like all right everybody there we go Jesus Christ that's not a brush it's so much good it's so intense that's really it's roses you know but that fight was great I had I had Kell Brook right in there that round seven he was still doing work out a round or two away at least in Spence just put it on him those body shots were ruthless and his endurance is incredible my favorite part is if you look go back and listen carefully the corners they pull that the same game plan I wish God even pass that around and I'm gonna put it on nigger the other corner let's just get past this ten and then it's all you baby yeah they're both saying the same thing well Kell Brook thought that Spence was just not experienced enough and didn't have because he'd been knocking everybody out enjoyed been he's only done ten round yeah and in his corner fella Kell Brook cut too much weight it's a really yeah yeah so they're like look this guy fuckin article of kin and 160 like he's gonna be struggling here yeah it's interesting very interesting amazing the fight no nor gentle ebb who's the boy fighting the man yeah that's a really Nordine Taleb is all bad ass fucking striker I do not know this gentleman but he looks dangerous here's a fresh home Zamora he looks like eighteen thirteen years old here it is yes I know this is not this is not the fight this is a different fight because that is not oh my god Dan Boboli the size of um Joe that's crazy that's also tariff it's natural dambo Bish's a guy look yeah Dan Bo bush I forget who that guy is that guy's a karate guy though he's wearing a karate guy he fucked up yeah the guy got super smashed Jesus is that um mochi Hornstein ah damn how good is my fucking UFC memory very good yeah this kid looks like Krav Maga guys from 1977 have you seen this the 35 year old fight a 19 year old here what's going on here celeb is a beast man yeah got a check 35 year old trailer guy you go check your head what are you doing your head you're fine you look normal no in my showroom cuz he's an actor it's an actor but makes his living off his face but well you don't have anything coming up such an odd character this Brian strange bird strange but ideally they would like it wrestle with you like genius aw I was just down what does this Duff Davidoff talk Duff damn just tough guys a tough guy like what what the fuck you saying okay so here's dambo which look he gets on top of them the fuck is he fighting bo Bush was a tank to a big old strong man looking dude so he gets on top of them and watch what he does with his chin was a beer mmm he gets the chin I believe he pressed his face up against the cage we went for a head-on yeah now here it is right here right here chin right to the eye socket dude y'all bet that would fucking hard look at this smoosh oh wow he's covering his eye my eyes fucking christ look at Big John McCarthy yeah that's where you want to quit that's a legit move I wonder if you can still do that the change in the I'm using at my next no one's ever said that but no you can't touch the eyes there's nothing you're not touching it he's holding on to his head another if you're sneaking the chin into the eye socket recently would you say Jamie there's another fight in a formats that it happened in - I don't know interesting it was a fight that bi gouging correct there was a fight recently the chin sort of but I mean isn't it i gouging when you shove your knuckle in there yeah which is also illegal but when you knuckle when you punch someone but that's not intentional is it sure it is you're trying to punch him in the eyeball try and punch me Thursday Chris yeah but Haseman beat he'll vez no Cinna sick yeah don't belt that's a while ago that's interesting because Elvis is a Machado black belt even bet what's this commercial but by the time you're you know in that position I question is going on here Christopher Walken what are you selling five calories um what was the art what was the fight recently in UFC where where the guy was covering the other guy's mouth so he couldn't breathe that's a but what a brutal brutal time at X naught I mean that's something about no BJ Penn you stood at all time that I used to get guys to he would cover their mouth when he took their back and then they would try to stop that and then he would grab their arm with his leg brilliant and he would choke them again Anderson Anderson Silva everybody did it's good common move yeah yeah that's pretty common I don't use as you don't use it I tried don't ours don't gave it off easy stuff does yoga master who's doing it there hey Chris huisman Elvis Elvis in a sec that's the shit that hold your sport back a little bit once there's no holds bar TV oh yeah this is no gloves - yeah Elvis might not even a black belt back then he's tapping oh Jesus he's tapping to the eyeball eyeball damn Chris Haseman also had a fucking wicked front leg side kick he's one of the first guys in MMA that figured out how to use a front leg side kick well like I just fucking poked this out and had a flat top so he gets the win there that's Haseman yup flat top Hayes yeah yeah speak speaking of eyes did Kell Brook hurt the same brake the same orbital different one different eye yeah he's got titanium I guess four is that from the titanium from triple G yeah yeah he got boxed up God maybe it's good to have two titanium eyes and that is the other one broken - did he break his left like I feel like he did his ya know diction a similar thing that was a bummer man and as I was all flat now but he also could have been like really paranoid about it because of the triple that's what I think because you want make surgeries like not losing mine's a fighter that's Indian it's always in your mind and by the way you don't know what kind of vision damage he suffered like a guy like Bisping is tough as fuck he will tell you he's got bad vision his right eye I mean you won't hear someone commentate a fight or analyze the fight about bhisma go and he's also doing it with one and a half eyes like it's well known knowledge like he's suffering but what is the deal because back in the day like if you had like a detached retina or something like they wouldn't let you fight no cuz he's got so I talked a little bit about it he's got oil now I want to fuck this up no your whale in the red zone so he can't really fix it yet run to these dates is it yeah because if he gets another shot than it could do more damage though and I don't know if that I think it kind of came out the thing with GSP - it's his medicals has something to do with his eye it came out now yes it's a jaw what isn't talked about it he's got a what's called a floater in his eye it's like it's like a little bit of damage there's something going on with his eyeball and that was the holdup he was like oh he's scared to fight I hate when people it's like well do UFC knew about it everybody knew about it but they were hoping that they could fix it and I believe they gave some injections to his eye they tried to repair it it's not like threatening his vision it's not like a permanent issue to time issue so this guy something needs to heal this guy cut zero weight and the other guy cut 30 pounds you know no I don't know but I like the way that guy's throne it's old-school karate side exit warm-up today I like Marquez a rough day how old is this kid did they say I think they said he's 19 now he's 25 20 new WoW is he yeah he's oh you just said he's not he's baby Jacobs hometown but I mean I'm sorry sir but excuse me it's the UFC be alright but um what's going on mmm who's the youngest guy to ever fight in the UFC I want to say it's Dan Lausanne I feel like she got more yeah I think Dan no Peter I was 19 I think Dan Lausanne was 18 held was sage Northcutt 22 Tom Nordine Taleb the guy in the red shorts is a badass striker amazing striker tries to a very far intact enough super free super technical look at that look at that beautiful treatment yeah yeah he's he's elite shit this youngster ain't fucking around all that I skated guys it's really bad back well just till he'd laughed at it he's very karate based though you could tell about him throwing that that kick you know how old was Joe Lausanne when he fought Jen's Pulver on that short notice masae was 20 he might have been the youngest I do not know I don't think so not things young man's composed by oh he knocked out Jen's Pulver the left hook right yeah oh oh that is a huge underdog yeah sure huge da cholos I'm still doing the damn thing - he is a bad motherfucker Joel those well yeah smart as shit - super smart guy yeah I mean easily could have been like some IT tech guy really yeah but he's a junkie for adrenaline he's a beast video game guy - um this guy's definitely talk mono guy see that guy's name and Kent I don't think it's tiny ones oh man I think it's karate I could be wrong but you know the thing the problem was saying it's Taekwondo vs. karate is like really depends on who's teach all the wheel kick right looks like Taekwondo yeah but he oh but a lot of cash Otakon guys they throw kicks that way - they ooh nor Dean's chewing up that leg hey that hurt him - that bothering the way Nordine is not getting her head kicks in much bigger in Taekwondo I don't I mean he's definitely more muscular but he's only as much it looks like he's much heavier walking around he'll is frame he just looks eight price walks around at 200 pounds whereas this guy walks around at 170 well he also looks like a man yeah whereas the other kid looks very young - the key baptizing that Logan movie that shit is so depressing is it oh my it's Wolverine with cancer beacon through life he's a limo driver I'm not interested for he's a goddamn animal driver stop don't do this to me well yeah I'm trying to help you guys I don't see a couple people told me that the

guess the game's evolved did you get your blue belt in 2000 enhancer Gracie the jet hence Oh Gracie blew up what do you think they would let you have it now if you went back to class they keep one I've given my purple just honorary do you think they would say listen man you got to go back to why do you have to put spinal I would volunteer that dude is a volunteer has anybody ever get like demoted like you ever get a purple belt and then that happened to me when I first met the Gracie Kenny they made me wear a white belt for a long time I was no I got a brown belt from someone else I was in a white belt for a while who general brown boat from I'm all Easton am all women I'm all East and give you a brown belt and the Gracie's told you have to wear a white belt I'm saying it was just like for the first few weeks just to see where my level is that I did it but you're in a mall Eastern brown belt that is very very legit that's not like Freddie Mercury some fuck you do the Midwest not the other I'm the other Freddie murder we're the same mustache but you'll have a lot in common you know navaids when I trained in Brazil - they made me wear a white belt what I feel like that's so disrespectful you have a brown belt from you should a state from who Oh Molly's - oh okay come on in yeah and she liked it so tribal though innit so you know yeah but that's the same tribe yeah it's a hen's Oh Gracie black belt I think it was more just like I don't know I had no issue with it I literally did not care but I'll tell guys if they didn't know who I was like I'm not a white belt I'm just like I know we don't I'm not a white belt brother like know we might fucking ears man yeah yeah but I mean dude that's just I don't understand that it was only for like two or three weeks was this one you were in the UFC yeah Jesus Christ everyone gay I mean it's it's like most people knew you know right just don't make any sense yeah that seems really weird to me I went to that beginners class and fuck them up we don't really know guys today I meet ten yellow belts I don't like you doing your mood I don't like you doing that summer saw move on me it's annoying well is that thing you just did to me somersault move yeah he just starts around here oh yeah and I and that's that's where I sustained oh you just got wrong oh she's great check left hook boy his kids winging these guys are on that's kid that's a great fight man right now do you still have that Tesla yes I do and I've opened down at all no dude is my favorite car I'll never have another car that I'm a Tesla man Sam Harris is Tesla broke down twice on him what hey I love hearing the left and stranded know what Hannah yeah he had like a full charge and it said pull over immediately your car is not safe to drive it's like what it's annoying my Tesla is impeccable I'll never have another one I'm a Tesla guy just like I'm a front foot sidekick guy I'm a Tesla got front foots yeah I mean only in street fighting cuz it's sneaking mmm I haven't even opened up I'm Brennan with my kicks yet I you know I only get to I want to get an older Porsche man that's why I'm in the market for I believe I was here talking to me about it don't you fuck with those targets I want to see like a car that makes noise when you drive it I don't get a wind whistling in yeah not that yeah those things are shitty some nights it's gonna be fun man if you get this one this one's redone it has it has a bunch of new snow you're gonna get it your urine why did I look at it maybe did I send that text from the dealer maybe what year is it it's a 88 did you drive it no they drive like shit it doesn't matter this one's new it's a bunch of modifications oh yeah yeah butter if Brennan has something in his head if he starts talking about is it gonna happen it's gonna not with these older cut like I've looked at a few now it's just it's just like a weekend driver yeah what do you recommend for a Porsche if you want to get a used one Brent well your MBA there's there's some really good used Porsches like you I mean even the early models they're really fun to drive but you got to know what you're getting into yes you don't want a lemon and those cars are really they're really fickle like when you turn mate like say if you're making a turn and you're on the gas if you let up off the gas they'll oversteer like the back ass end of the car will come out on no it's a far cry from you know a new Porsche something like yeah like new twin turbo that 991 that you used to drive like that is as modern as it gets I mean those things are glued to the fucking Road I agree but this one this one that's modifications can be sick like the old-school vibe to borrow my car for a day you'll throw that other car in the trash your GT so yeah you'll little light that 1987 shit box on fire hey bro do you get that fish you can hate on the dealership with your fucking wheels things you used to like that dad uses to start a fire nah one of those he's gonna love it for those Coleman grills yeah one of those things for camping just squirted all over the car and let it on fire dude I saw someone in a brand new gt3 is parola gt3 RS yeah they make them this fucking purple does it does cars man ass dealer sewed oh my god I'm sick they finally make him with a manual transmission again finally the 2007 or Dean to lab side control the 2017 s you could finally get with a manual transmission I was he were complaining well as Porsha was trying too hard to just get lap times that people were pissed and they were complaining like what the fuck does it three how come it's a double-clutch how come I can't get it with a manual transmission so finally they they released this thing the 911 R which was essentially like a gt3 without the wing good luck get that thing dude there go for the good people are selling them for like half a million dollars and more well they only made how many hundred or so letting 911 crazing they made 911 and right with the stripes yeah but now they're saying that this new gt3 the manual one that you can actually just buy is actually better than the 911 R yes because the reason that the automatics the PD case it's you know it's faster in humans yeah so know what rack time we can't keep up with it waiting 40 min faster than humans like well like shifting stuff like that the computer does all computers millisecond sir track time and it's instantaneous it has two clutches so it has one clutch that's in like say if you're in first gear there's one clutches in first gear the second clutch is already engaged in the second gear so would you hit it it's instantaneous like like these so you don't have to shift it it takes shifting out of the game you can have it in automatic and it'll shift for itself or you can have it in manual and you shift with the paddles but you don't have to push the clutch in so you're not pushing your left leg if that kind of takes away from them right yeah manual fun of the driving if you automatic you I thought my poor shadows the panel's case yeah is lame and to think about computers and stuff where they take out the tactile enjoyment yeah and the the timing and the human timing and all that it kind of makes it not that much fun anymore I would imagine with a car it may it really makes a big difference unless you're on a race track like if you're on a race track and you're just trying to get zero to whatever you know zero to sixty times and make sure the year your lap times are quicker then you want something that shifts instantaneously but those are also to put up numbers because like enough the new Viper they see are compared to the new Porsche the lap times they don't want look bad so they put their best foot forward well the problem with the Viper is the Viper is a standard it's a manual transmission but it's so fucking fast it doesn't matter they bring that Viper ACR to every track and they go hey we're here to break the new track record the fuck out of the way we have the most ridiculous car America has ever built it's got wings all over it Jesus dude whenever we talk about this that the same guy shoots me damn he's like it's a picture of the Viper here it is man for this price like how it's like a little guy he's got to got Ilia so you're you're just drawn that has no lore to me you're drawn to it like a huge engine like Tesla species good pull-up Viper ACR does he do nothing for Brian listen we're gonna hang this which I don't get cause you like masks and stuff be I like masculine something got a Tesla you've never driven one that's the problem you drove the Tesla ah now finally no one is like out to a tr got kick and no last even makes fuckers don't know when this understand about lag I don't settle for lag lag yeah hey Jack it's a it's a racing term hmm I didn't know look at this car Bryan Callen - this car doesn't give him some volume and looking at your Lydia aluminum on that bad boy and the fence it's like comes five is it guy knows my course it's got a v10 a v10 things under three horsepower lamps can we get some volume on this there's no volume you don't need fooling don't need volume I'll just music Tim why do you want volume it's just music because you want to hear though I prefer in a silent assassin I call my Tesla's a good size for you B oh my god I think that you have this car look at this here we go you have no idea what this is it's got a giant fan shot Brian you have no idea what this feels like bullshit cause to be in a car that has this kind of power would change your life no way oh you don't understand if you drove that thing it would change your life you'd get out of it your hands to be sweaty your balls be tingling my phone dude a car 13 times more testosterone than when you got into the car that's left you fuckers not if you got in that car and then went and dead lifted you'd be stronger I'm not kidding that car so Robin that's so American not as nice as well I have an eagle like a Trans Am what's that what's that gonna cost me that's 150 which is a good 260,000 good deals for that sorry tremendous deal you thinking what the fuck that thing is it does look like an I give you like an eagle like let's make a cake it looks like a viper snake I think they're gonna discontinue it I think this is the last term which bums me out man yeah hey guys the fact they're making something like this they say it's so much better than the Corvette we got three minutes nautical vibe boys well the new Corvettes are pretty badass but they say that once you drive this you go all the Corvettes trash god this is gonna sound like we're just a little bit like an asshole pulling up in that though I feel like an asshole pull up my gt3 nah but I do it parked out front the Kali Jordan is an campaign a is he we Sweden yeah yeah this is gonna sound weird but he's gotten bigger as the fights progressed I feel like he's I feel like he's just somehow that this is sort of return I feel like he looks like a swedish wonderboy thompson yes he does I think all the blood that's in your dick is fucking with your vision okay what are you trying to say and why is tell absurd shorts have been hiked and they haven't come down yeah you wanting luck we can get the different cuts be you know well you know that that's what thing that muy Thai fighters do they always pull their shorts up yeah but that stayed up that's interesting it's almost like glued on a squad son good luck kick there oh yeah tell you what man and camp did you hear the rumor they're trying to make Francisca no JDS late summer oh no oh no furu what do you think JT is yo not Sonic I thought they were trying to Derrick Lewis with Derrick Lewis gets by Mark Hunt oh you can't kill their fields you soaring young black boy there's Melissa's talk too much shit about you call it an era African booty scratcher yeah but Elvis jerk loose is my one of my favorite UFC fighter 2 because an update not just because of his fighting style but also because of his Instagram page it's hilarious Derrick Lewis is the bestest he goes Hardy fighter hey when he beat Travis Browne you went so hard in the paint it's always coming out this girl just hilarious and funny fucking dude man I mean yeah yeah some nerve fucking shit to Francis the fucking terminator god he scares the shit out of me he's so to Soaring embrace though it's like too crazy I'm not sold on it leno Chacon with braids right for me right now oh you're on this bullshit I done he's on another level who's he be house gonna be tower laughs keys it's not who he beat see how he beat some huh knocks him out dude he's so big you know understand like Cheick Kongo was a bad motherfucker in his day but Cheick Kongo wasn't starching people the way Cano is he did my first burst on the scene people freaking weekend he's knock down Pat Barry in a crazy wild slugfest when he was already hurt you know I mean that was a super impressive victory he's got some good and some good victories go fight right Nelson yes Roy Nelson knocked them the fuck out look at that example that's a horrible example deep Roy it was just like this right now I do Roy knocked out a lot of fuck Roy's in Bellator now just like do you think Roy in Mitrione rematch and belt madrone tweeted today hey how about we fight after I get through phaidor like you better focus on fate or Matt yeah Jesus hey real quick Roy phaidor fight what is going on I got surprised head-on dad who won this fight I wonder this sir this is interesting we're bearing a student at the viper now talk about friends you know to Soaring y'all don't understand why not the idea that a Viper is a stimulating experience yeah I have no experience with those kind of cars you haven't been in my test the one I've opened her up dude I have bigger driven tests now how about that they're very fast I like um yeah great I do not I just don't like I don't like the fact that they've run out of batteries quick yeah I don't like the fact that Sam Harris has left him stranded twice that's weird it's not weird I think for a guy who's not a car guy like me who doesn't get off on the mom you know I like that I don't have to go to a gas station and he's got more issues charging like you like god I gotta find someone to charge it is an issue all the time who'd be like let me drop you're a scatterbrain you probably won't forget so it's not far for you yeah yeah scatter Brett like there's a gas station everywhere yeah more charge at my house that's it yeah you just plug it in this is your super charger their super chargers but good luck finding them say if you drive the Improv and you like fuck I need a charge what do you do you got some issues I've call up originated to my I've made it to my driveway with zero battery zero yeah like literally zero where I was well here goes no it's terrible now like I I drove to Irvine and then I realized halfway back from Irvine or I'm gonna be June 8th 9th and 10th where I realize halfway through that I was done like I was I was not gonna make it back so I had to stop and and charge and then how long it takes for a discharge and you don't have a super charger you're you're like those charges they have in in garages are complete bullshit for an hour you'll get you know 18 miles but it's those ones you can stop by on the road or be struck yeah those are great those and a half hour you're good where are those they're all over not really all over yet but I will say this that they're trying Tesla's trying to get a stations where you can go in and they switch her battery out right there let's say guess who want to leave I think I think probably to leave already come down to the third round boy they're going hard with only because he was telling that shit is so depressing what's that logo get the fuck out of my face but the ads are brutal now it shows me in the UFC when a fight starts and they have to do an Nordine Taleb one the fight starts and they have to do an ad while the five episodes oh yeah that shit dries you'll see 211 brought to you by alien it drives miss summer his nose is very swollen right now he got hit yeah so fight I got punched in the nose B mmm Dan Hardy still talking about coming back because I know he was talking about it for a while though if they could figure out some way to let hold on either good commentary this team this English to come tain team I really like these guys I never hear them because we're always doing this but I'm sure Dan's excellent yeah they're really good his arm is nice fucking brilliant he's really good I worked with those guys way back in the day when I was doing shows in England and they were just sort of like they tried out for a while before they actually did it you know there was some some testing they did who that's a nice check Larry left hook they it's a different vibe than you guys they really talk you know they talk about talking to the five is the week of they stick a lot of that mmm you know yeah everybody's got their own style that's a interesting thing about Colin he's also ghost weird style the way dresses like son some 1970 election that's a journalist shit boy that look at that trip series work I'm not mad at it I'm not mad at it completely different involved with that checkered pattern what does that called look at it I didn't see oh the plan is it plaid yeah mmhmm Nordine buddy brother the Tesla like for superchargers in like all of them they're just packed they should have a twenty part with white P number that you can call if you get stuck somewhere with white people pack let's be real who buys Tesla's the only black choice guys like me the only black guys to drive Tesla's they're the same black guys they keep their cell phone on the outside of their shirt with a belt hook oh okay yeah yeah those sous-chef Joe super tango hood in a pedalo no head no the rare black guy that drinks tea any problems assured until keeps one those Bluetooth earpieces in those ones oh the blue light on it has a white one woo fuck has that belt clip 5 years let's fuck you where you should wear a fanny pack all the time bitch I would never wear one I wear one too to run I said Joel Pizza look at my run strong I have three different ones that I wear for running that's impressive preen ones with zippers yeah oh yeah those are good to keep it tight but they're not good enough for me when I travel when I travel I need the official higher primate fanny pack it's large this ace tyke is my running one don't say tiny like flops around too fucking annoying oh you gotta get a better one I got some good running ones - you might say tight is funny know what they are I need one it's good I know it's just called the running belt I love is it that handsome bastard dude I got a hoodie on down-south fucking spider in the kid hoodie that's that beak any fighter has right that's right represent man I'm slump surprised you'll see like you back that shit up Jamie show him show him he can't I'll kiss life do you well you can give him a little rewind Kim a little show his own product what happened to action on showing I'm wearing out your show linen ah shit yeah you fucking beauty go do you want to really show you buy our stuff yeah I only need to go like one huh when you do these Jody don't you don't matter a studio here in LA yeah so you don't have to obviously go anywhere oh yeah yeah not going anywhere this let me tell you something man this is like one of the hardest things that I do is these when these fight breakdowns because uh you ready some homework I not only have to do some homework but I do them I'm writing them and performing them live like there's no script like I have zero script there is yeah strong fighter in the kid hoodie look at that camera right babe you can hunt with it and disappear in fully Yeti - you're spying on your ex you all kinda shit you really don't wanna hunt in cotton but all right well you know what it looks good we're releasing the hunter edition of your wool well you need to get in with first light I have the make a fighter in the kid remember we're we're in wool like when we were wet and how like you could be wet in Alaska and it was cold but you'd be in the morning you'd be cold that you'd put on wet wool and you it scared you it kept you warm yeah it's crazy yeah dude I want zero Rihanna yes that's the fight I feel like I want rose to have a year or two more man that's not the way it works I know but she was three she's beat Claudia twice now really shouldn't Karolina know she lost Karolina that's how dare Lina got the fight who did rose did know I'm saying Johanna oh yeah yeah yeah yeah she beat claudia twice she beat Karolina should be just gunshot Jessica oh Jesus Christ is Jessica and Roger have a fucking chin that chick is so tough and they're saying she's so this hunk a hunk - I'll take a shutout well mom she is a tank I said I won't sit mind seeing her in rows because here grows a little more warm up but that's not the way it works there's nothing left for you Lana I know that there really is nothing left for I mean after Rose dismantled the karate hottie you know miss Mason palatal I didn't think that was gonna have head kick - choke woo good lord good I think Rose has real legitimate world championship possibilities huh no which is that I would just like to see her I mean look man I might be wrong she might go in there and get her she might get your the thing about Rose that you can't count out is she's dangerous she's more explosive and like more dynamic than any girl out there I think my child you tell me smile she's so athletic you told me you'd like to freak athletic because we were trained together at grudging man freak freak do you ever see her do flying arm bars yeah she's headed in fights it's crazy yeah the girl can hit a flying armbar in a fight that's so she is like x-factor that Jana hasn't seen yet but if that doesn't happen for know scary scary woman well you want striking would you say it's the best in you see isn't just just flat-out right like technically technically I think so well I mean it's definitely the best in women's MMA but it's not like she doesn't have the brutal knockout power that like cyborg house which she has is like excellent technique like over and over again she's using perfect technique and footwork but she needs a volume of punches to get people out she's not a big person like she has small hands just small feet just small bones she's not like like in the Jessica and Raj fight the perfect example on Drudge was so scary every punch she throws us like she's throwing these fucking bombs where you wanna just picking at it about technique yeah she's so much more technically she wasn't she wasn't stopping in any way on drugs is kind of Cosmos 15 pounds though yeah Lily Humphrey 2 pound female 5 when you want a teen that you can fight differently - right I mean obviously you can be more technical whereas if you're fighting so technical I mean there's a lot of technique but I'm saying I feel like when you would pay very dearly for one shot from somebody who's bigger you almost have to fight differently right yeah for sure yeah yeah if you're fighting Mighty Mouse is more technical than yeah you know yeah anybody really know about him TJ ain't happening yeah DJC on like now you gotta pay me like it's in you know I love TJ I know you probably listen I for DJ it doesn't make sense for Mighty Mouse for my team s it does not make us why TJ doesn't have the belt it's not a super fight he would super fight sequel super money that it went in went it's not a needle mover unfortunately as if I would love to see the fight it's a ridiculous fight so what is Mighty Mouse head no - it was straight up was like ain't happening wow the UFC wants to happen he's like nah I'm good it ain't happening rate boards the next contender isn't that interesting that he can make those calls - I mean it's one of those weird things it's like in boxing you know you have mandatory challengers and then you know then you try to make super fights in the UFC it's like they're like hey we've got a fight for you and he's like I'm the champ well but it's rare right like if you only have one title defense yes yeah you better get the fuck out play play with us you know I'm saying it is it's a clusterfuck because right now like there you have to have order like I'm all about super fights we have to have order otherwise you know think about if TJ went down there then what happened to Cody garment fight lemons with DJ you know I'm saying but right it's Conor McGregor kind of phenomenon it was trying to do it yeah well I think TJ just went through a huge camp and he wants a fight you know I mean he's gone through this giant camp getting ready for Cody I get it and you know Cody they were trying to pressure him to fight he they even sent him down I don't know Washington Germany Germany they're just kind of in Germany to get the same shit you can get in Santa Monica weird is that well Dana doesn't believe that it's the same and I don't understand that so so what what is wrong with Cody he's got a statistician yeah he's got a back issue what is it do we know he's got something with his disk and he needs time off he needs spinal decompression and he's got the Regina Kane he went and got a full treatment they said I'd be ready by September October yeah gotta wait maybe but you have to absolutely make sure it heals first I sent him a bunch of information I sent him the reverse hyper machine sent him some stuff on spinal decompression and he's also talking to dr. Davidson who they're starting to do some stuff early and yeah he's he's brilliant they're starting to do some stuff now in the UFC where they're the the stem-cell doctors are now going to inject stem cells into discs and they're going to regenerate disk tissue that's cool it's amazing this is a fester yes yes oh yeah yeah leave them be gotcha they've got studies that they've done enough of them now that they have some real good evidence that it does regenerate the same way it regenerates cartilage and ligaments and but there's a lot of times with the entries where you know sometimes that's not going to be enough you're right it depends on the injury a lot of times those stem cells it's just sometimes you're fucked yeah a lot of that is that there hasn't been that much conclusive evidence to for example that it grows yeah when you shoot it into something I've Kobe Bryant would beg to differ doesn't necessarily regenerate sometimes you know or a lot well it's it's very difficult to say why it works on some people why it doesn't work on other people but I think money's yeah case by case but I think one factor is whether or not you come back too quick and that's what what Cody did Cody got the stem cells and started working out like four days later thank you can't do that that's not smart you can't do that I mean you know like look he's got a fight he's got a big title fight and you you I think actually took two weeks off or something like that but you need like months you need a lot of time you need to have your body heal it's a very difficult area to heal and a lot of people don't do it correctly and then they wind up getting some serious atrophy where the nerves get pinched the swelling and all the inflammation Cody needs to take it slow come back in in that TJ fly to be there but you can't rush that fight but look at Eddie I mean Eddie Bravo as a he has a fake disc in its back down I mean I shouldn't say fake it's a you know artificial it's titanium articulating discs that he had put into his back because of this the same issue like disk degeneration having those injuries constantly training and rolling never really letting it heal didn't KRK niched surgery yes on more than one occasion yeah yeah how does disc he didn't do the and he's still not back maintains there's no fight lined up for cane McCain do maybe that would be the divider yeah that would be the fight but I mean if your cane mean Jesus Christ he's been out forever it's gonna be a tough fight fuck yeah real justified to make though dude steep a is just he's a monster right now he's in which cane is I mean only especially if it's like a healthy Kade ready to go dude that's the best fight in a long long time at heavyweight oh man are you kidding me I was calling Lesnar I think yeah I would have loved to seen that fight in his prime Kane's prime and steep steep it's like people go I guess Kane over the hill came beat the brakes off Travis Browne Travis is obviously no Punk like he looked fucking great yeah I think I think the guy needs rest I really think you little more run at its he's got a cumulative injuries for sure but those are because he's Russian we can't brush on him so maybe if he takes all this time off they fight at the end of the year we get a prime cane Brits a prime steep a side me the fuck oh this came Mary how old is he he's still fairly young I think is 32 Wow not that old wow he just he put his body through the wringer and his fighting style is a grinding style that he's gonna catch up were you showing that video of him doing kettlebells with those really heavy weight he was probably training a little bit he fucked up and he had a bad strength and conditioning coach for sure and he's got that guy got criticized hardcore by people that are like really in the know about technique and it was background adore yeah there was Deepak kettlebell swing so it was more of like a like a it was like almost like a shrug but I got two hundred pounds oh he's getting chalked up all his injuries to that no that's definitely not helping no it's not helping there's a lot of so has he corrected that does he have a better so I don't know you know you'd have talked Cain but all bullshit aside he in my eyes he's one of two of the greatest heavyweights of all time he got phaidor and he got Kane I mean he's one of two well it but also it's steep a fade or cane he pays resume top three oh yeah of all time yeah well ver doom was right up there until steep a knocked about for doom submitted fade or he submitted Minotauro and he submitted Kane he submitted three hot looked it looked great against Travis brown yeah I mean you know what eyes twice every of the top-five heavyweights of all to shit that uh big-ass fight card in July got over in for Doom rematch that first one is strike for that one that there's the third ones trilogies right that's a one strike force I watch the other night so poor a terrible fight yeah redeems sitting there calm over dude fucked his knee up real early in the fight real early terrible fight though yeah whatever what a crazy rematch that's gonna be that's a fun one in that and over ins been knocked out so many times in his career oh dude I just feel like I don't know it just gets to a point where you're just like out to what when are you gonna realize that you're taking serious punishment I think Dutch people are different I think they could just keep getting knocked out I feel like he's alright you go man guy that's alright fuck this is the thing B you say that we watchin fighter Doom you will and you'll be sitting fuckin front row clapping yeah this is the line item Fanta fans are like this like I can't he keeps getting knocked up when that motherfucker fighting on tunes not necessarily out come on be not with ovary not anymore was one fighter what he just fought for a title yeah he went on to win streak I don't care no bullshit I really don't I don't find myself as a world-class striker I got up double it doubled light a lot of guys out here's the thing hey the best heavyweight striker of all time over him you won't want to watch him fight yeah but but yeah I thought that was then right no he just won four title in knocked a DP on his I understand he fought for a title right now he's the best striker in the USA I understand but if you could pull up his how many times been knocked out in the past two years it's done a bunch it's tough to watch two years not really and there's also past two years J like there there is it's got remote such an exciting ball it the bullshit you you're buying right now I thought at the highest level in the world and hiking I said he's gonna have more knockouts then upper doom then I'm then all these other guys but not come to the territory but but not so much anymore right that's all I'm saying I say these two names I just don't want to see him get knocked out of al-hassan and achma Tov that's what I'm saying try doing a spelling bee for those little bitches on Tam for this fight card that's a beast I was looking at earlier well I'm fuck this guy's a wrestler this guy said this guy's been on am a strong grappling see this like this there's regular strength and then there's Russian dude strength especially hairy Russian dude trying stuff they got here 10% stronger they got hair I like that I like that our loskis shoulders on it this here on the shoulders got shit god damn it that's like extra test on my strong deity on his back fuck me huh I'm smooth as a seal fuck it's coming out of his ears like all those shaving brushes as connected as mustache oh god damn it look at that beard for god sake he's at he's yeah what straight out he's he's one of those wind up before you throw a punch guys like he's like digging in some would say yeah yeah real stiff it's not just a stiffness may like a lot of these guys they could be like more fluid but they're trying to knock you out with every shot it's almost like a curse to power like it's absolutely beneficial all these but there's a there's also a curse to it we can remind you lay down so much it slows you down so much when you're trying to use it that much but the the greatness comes the guys know when to use it right yeah timing yeah well one of the most beautiful things that you see in Conor style is how he has none of that like when he's throwing punches unless he's got you fucked up and stunned by your fuck Diego Brandao or something speaking of punches gachy have you seen gates just can't you fight just engaged he's a bad motherfucker he's gonna fight Michael Johnson how good of her to bite that when is that a dude is it June or July it's July so it's on the July 7 that's the eighth card I've never done that it's the Ultimate Fighter finale either way it's in that weird span of fights just engage she just says technique fuck it we got two of the big guys from there we got Marlin mirai's two is also a fucking three we got Goethe you got homeboy who's the light heavyweight champ middleweight champ David branch David branch yeah he came over he just won awful fight but that's alright it takes a lot of warm-up with the fuck did he find number nine light heavyweight the Russian cat see Russian Croatian you know I'm talking about flying under the radar but either way awful fucking fight oh yeah yeah I remember yeah hey do you guys think that the Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather thing is is all a hoax and just a way to get Conor have people talking about him until he has his next fight like do you think that's just a big huge thing for frying ploy I think the world's flat - you think it's real I think me and Joe both don't wanna talk about I think we're both red in the face on it no I think no I mean you think they're gonna have a bond it's gonna happen it's gonna be worse closer than I was a dog so you're gonna happen it's gonna happen it's so close I'm telling you this why don't talk to myself unusual you go where's the contract there is a turtle bar think I never do a new podcast called the fighter and the man walks Hughes listen to me she's too confusing the contract loosen the UFC and Conner have already come to an agreement I'm we go right now you update them tonight okay right now they're in negotiation with the Floyd Mayweather team right so Floyd Mayweather team is going to want to absorb it an amount of money they're very patient they're gonna take a long time to dry this out right so then get the best deal but essentially the UFC and Connor have come to some sort of promotional agreement and now they have to figure out how much money Floyd gets and whether or not they want to gamble on giving him a flat rate of like 100 million dollars whatever the fuck you want that's a big whether that's a big like if yeah but he's also going to want a piece of the pie correct they're not close to a contract yet they're not close but they're 90% that's what I'm saying is that I feel like amento so what happens they don't pretend that you have any knowledge of this just do a study a favor said I have knowledge on yourself is my theory do yourself a favor and don't let your mouth get ahead it's my theory that I believe this is a very smart way of keeping him in a limelight that's and by the way let me ask you this when when um Tony Ferguson and let's just say Tony Ferguson could be fight before that and now now somebody's waiting uh-huh to fight Connor will Connor fight those guys before he fights Floyd no definitely not so then what happens to the money the money right now is in Floyd versus Connor for Connor and it's just exorbitant money like he might make who knows how many fucking millions of dollars maybe a hundred right so that's where the real money is for Floyd right and this is where the real money is for Connor so for Connor to jeopardize that by fighting that fucking Russian savage or Tony Ferguson who also could beat him I mean I'm not saying he's going to but it down the of Tony Ferguson is a motherfucking world champion caliber fighter so is Habib that's a fucking killer fight so but we don't even know if khabib can even make 155 anymore man his body's him he says he can close by October 8th court Circe says he can but he didn't make it not only did he not make it fuck I liver shut now and he had to go to the goddamn hospitai come he was like did you die almost but did you die did you tie you hey get up there make 55 so I can fucking eat my popcorn and you fight Tony first what did you do did you die and did not get the fuck up and make the wait for my entertainment I just need one fight a time but did you die did you die like a beam whose f was that Ken yes Ben yeah ken Ken Jong yeah but did you don't love that guy

Bravo my god just the pizza gay Chronicles every 100 in a beautiful sweep did I tell you that Donald Cerrone came and watched me spar and I go what am I doing wrong and he goes everything everything is everything he gave me a lesson it was crap out we're flying out the honey so it's talking about boxing yeah I he wouldn't talk to me he got mad I go my sparring and he goes I'm not talking to you yeah about sparring I can't have this conversation he got he got really loud in the plane he goes I can't do this I can't cuz I was mad and I was like I'm not my left and he's like I'm not gonna what the fuck cuz I sucked him in for a second like I sucked him in he's like well if you wanted if you would what do you want to do it because qua line what if I go what am i doing Saturday I'm not talking to our fight do you not have enough gone your life that you need to focus on sparring and ball he's distracting himself with like tennis lessons and writing jokes no ship and I said he's out there fuck hatin mitts and I do it all you do it all yeah do you how tired is this guy I'm gonna change this topic I'll talk oh nice takedown I'll run in the pipe let's go let's go take that simple simple he's almost caught to simple's my legs hey slider you guys notice mouths quietly Russians are just taking over they're not regular white people they're not they're just quietly taking shit the culture that that puts masculine power at a premium Anthony Joshua would care to differ hahaha Hey Dude how about fucking Frisco walked in a box and burn just in walked in was is cool Oh a fucking dog just giant dude checking things out I'm here to mix things up you watch the train because his girl daddy wants to train there you know just when he's doing things here in LA oh that's so that's gonna be that Jimmy works out think so much things you're working on a boxer sighs Jim well kind of I'm Conor McGregor's I'd enjoyed a wild card I don't know maybe doesn't want to deal with all the bullshit yeah it's true yeah Wes is blocksome Ernie Kenny they'd load the shut like for comic oh they shut it down I'll do that when I was in camp they'd literally shut the classes they organized stuff around interesting I was talking to West Chatham about he was like you would work at it wild card West but like every time he were not somebody would be like you wanna spar you want a sparring it's like that's the culture there yeah that's tough when you just want to workout it's like and he doesn't want to say no and I told you this before Brian because Brian was like I just want to get better so I went I want you to walk in a wild-card West and get all this while you can handle my Lopes will punch you in the dick so I will punch you the dick so fuckin my sparring as Mario does easy I don't even do that much but do I worry about that I worry about those guys that do that recreational sparring yeah and then all sudden one day like where my keys it doesn't make sense man fucking hit it doesn't make sense to me yeah why are you doing or you can pay to get in the head I don't know is it I talked to him about it when he fought one of our friends from 10th planet jiu-jitsu he's been boxing for a long time so I think like yeah he has been like legitimately yeah he had an amateur boxing match with a buddy mine I did get I get it's fun you got to test yourself and maybe you know your TV so you got to make sure you still have your man card stuff like that but I just there's other ways to do it I just Jiu Jitsu is the best way to do it because you don't you don't you don't get the brain damage but a lot of guys don't like the damage to your neck and your knees and your joints and your back I don't know there's less it's a personality thing - I think strikers a lot of times have different personalities I'm talking about guys who do it like the difference between a striker a pure striker and a pure wrestler there's actually a personality difference I think sometime maybe it's also like you know a lot of guys who could have been big-time story would have really gotten big time into striking they found you Jitsu first and their big time in jiu-jitsu kids where they lost it depends of that look I like both of them and I love striking and I like it all I loved you Jitsu I mean I think that the difference in striking clearly is that you can get hit and hurt you get hit a little bit in jiu-jitsu headbutt each other and run baby share but yeah do you know what I would have done and I'm big not being funny here when I when I put me in a time machine and I was like say 1814 I'm not kidding not reflect with traded wrestling on are you kidding yeah I trained in relaying Taekwondo all this up I would be I would be practicing an instrument I would be a great dancer and I'm saying right just wondering I get distracted by pussy and you would start doing stand-up mighty pussy I was it no you do I don't think you'd do that be maybe I'd be a fighter I think no I've because I I knowing what I know now I don't have that nothing dancing what you you fucked up by not singing and dancing look at me I would have been great at see dancing actually dance at scene I don't know singing I was singing it's something you can work at my beats in town I'm not gonna being your singing no you're wrong you're completely wrong yes some people have amazing instruments but you can become a very good singer just with training believe me you can use things but you don't have a few ways they could translate into being good singing well not to be a dick but I can't look up I did sing it when in theater school like I got to a point where I could I wouldn't hurt your ears I mean like what song did you sing I don't know I take all the musical since I give me a puzzle I know it's give me a couple notes I'm like I sang into the woods okay so no more chance say a little bit no come on a little bit nah cuz I'm it'll move you to tears come on I can't I I can't just lie picture me there is a Western so there is music inside of me I picture doing like a cover of like some Hank Williams jr. no dude I don't sing country I picture like new killed my country new kids unlock no no no listen some people like have great voices buddy gotta remember Justin Timberlake's been singing since he was a little kid boy a lot of towns though it's Messines since he was a little kid and dancing talent though talent but also like des is I think on I wish I could go down you're wrong LeBron James I don't know hold on it's actually very different I'm sorry yes there's talent but there's all this timing in common but like singing and dancing is something that when you've been doing since a little kid like that that the reason that he's so good is that's been trained into it he also has talent they'll be he has talent a lot doesn't is some people definitely have talent but I think what Brian is saying is you can get better well for sure with coaching and I think that it's also a muscle yes right isn't it row your throats a hundred percent Amasya so so you you can get to be like it's a hundred some muscle so you can get very good and very powerful with your voice I just know too many Broadway singers and dancers the amount of practice that they put in from early ages it's it's a very very physical process like opera is the same way I agree can practice being get better but don't you think a lot of those singers it their parents learn from a very young age their performs like they're good at see sure I mean look as I look at my brother probably not for yes and and even if even if Michael Jackson helped him sing his life he's not gonna be a professional sing so my blue me lessons Adele had might examine up well she's very special but she also was always singing she also makes money doing it but but but some people are very very special but like um my grandfather when I did a musical my grandfather saw me do a musical and I was 20 wool through two or whatever and he said to me it was great it's a Sicilian from Brooklyn no nonsense he goes listen me you're funny you made them all laugh with your antics you're never gonna make it live it at the singer don't sing don't waste your time on this now I had only been singing for a year so you know said absolute gave up - how about I show you fuckface ya start singing his face yeah Oh fuckin Sun Allah Allah Allah yeah here's that fucking bullshit look interested not interested don't do a girl a little girl she's the best thing well she's she's the best thing in the movie I did it looks pretty good as high-octane action that's what they just said and me'll ask you this when he got jacked for Logan how many steroids did he do all them hey you know hey a muscle listen it's Muslim fitness he goes you know when I got the Wolverine role I knew I need to put on some muscle so I called up the one guy knows about this and Rock sent me his dietician I got in his diet I went to rock now it's just deep winstrol else at work is an grass-fed beef yeah is it just pure red meat and testosterone he's got a big frame he says hey J Sikora big guy he's a big guy for sure but I mean he got yeah yeah that's like look up Thanks you don't get that kind of vascularity in your forties Mr Bryan Callen you know well there's a picture of him that's not even the best picture Carly's photoshopped a little bit but oh I don't know about that I mean the veins that's a little photo shot that Dawn's a little photo show there's there's there's pictures of him legitimately in the gym lifting weights that muscle he's not as big there as he was in the other ones but that vast irony in some movies he got bigger not matter ones but that's probably as legit as it gets yes that's what he really should add it man yeah there's some that with him lifting there's one of him dead lifting see if he could find hugh jackman dead lifting things can um comment on that I don't know there is in the pool I'll get that some bullshit there looks like Alyssa yeah normal don't looks like there's one of them he's dead lifted yeah jacked that's Wolverine so I wait right there wait yeah yeah he's lifting some real weight I mean that's the way to get bigger man you why you're bigger you got a deadlift yeah deadlift does I always say John do is that we always say always you and I take the one takeaway does

to come up with a better word Demian Maia has a very hard time taking Woodley down well why didn't have fight goes down it's a hard fight for Damien very hard fight because when Woodley is ruthlessly powerful on his feet his fucking striking is so scary think about what he did to wonder boy two fights in a row uh two fights in a row one fight two fights that second fight was drunk shit he hurt him bad though 32nd in the fifth round but still he can do that he can hurt you it's always a liability and he's hurting wonderboy was one of the best strikers literally ever in the hundred seventy pound division true tyron woodley can hurt anybody he's got sucked but Liberty did a Robbie law or one punch ball here's the problem is the problem well not the problem but here's what if Damien mised I mean engage in that he's gonna jump to garden half guard that's where it gets tricky to try but he's 39 years old and he's gonna try to eat way bigger way big well he's a beast way big tall is taller but Tyron is a fucking tank he's all muscle yeah but you get Damon Maya in a deep half guard I don't care who you're you have some trouble yeah but you gonna be taking shots on the way in oh no I think Woodley's the roughest matchup for Demian Maia to get a belt yeah I think so yeah there couldn't be a worse matchup for him but I like it it's I like it because it's interesting but man I wish Damien had a shot at this like a few years ago so bottles got some good striking he's got a great jab watch this he's doing these undercuts and all this kind of stuff so bombs good fighter dance very good fire yeah striker first d-lister in this corner yeah he is definitely is Dean Lister and Peterson bombs coming up interesting where is it this jabs uh you'll see him boom pretty sure Ben's gotten a long-ass reach man and he likes to throw a lot of those front kicks to the body dude how abouts cowboy Robbie Lawler that's crazy that's crazy so I think Ben I mean Ben can stand with people for sure but I think Ben's best chance is if you can get this fight to the ground yeah I think Ben in the clinch I was really jabbing okay great I love bending the plumb yeah I know he's got a great palm yeah great plan what's knees he's long they can't really get to him do so much bigger than them what's the plumb the Thai clinch oh um uh sivadas been lighting him up with that jab man that's a nice step in jab yeah Swift she's going underneath - he's doing uppercuts and I think it's hard time sometimes when southpaw fight other southpaw stool yeah yeah it's a bit of a shit show yeah this guy's facing looks just like Ben's eyes pretty fucked up ah yeah yeah keeps getting caught man working then just trying to close a distance oh we got close look at that left hands the same they're not clip oh let's not go now Ben's taking a lot of punishes moving no okay but he's trying to get tired but he's trying to get that clinch in Sebata okay let's see if he can do anything okay okay here we go smarter bigger sabato just let him stand a lot of fucked up yep you gotta let up stand up here he's a mission control he says what bad news is not good this is not good for his about and Ben's got these crazy long-ass legs gonna get that left leg out watch watch him pop that left leg out he's also de Sebata is trying to ease his his right knee forward every time Ben moves his leg but it's gonna pop up over the top now Sebata is not in a good place this is not good he's trying to be in danger getting caught with here submissions so first of all his left eye was loosely trapped and his right arm is on the mat which is the wrong place for it his right arm should be on the chest right now because Ben's gonna put him in the dead orchard which means both legs trapped in a triangle or both arms rather trapped in a triangle how much time is left though not much holds the clock it's by ten ten seconds here up but also remember Ben's recovering right now it's a great move by Ben but terrible move by homeboy to let him go to farm down to the ground yeah I don't know why he did that I think he thought he could hammer him out you can round up yeah interesting so what we were talking about nan fight related we were just talking on something super important um we're talking about tyron woodley brian wishes who's a singer bender a second cyborg uh yeah yeah that's work I think takes a lot to what you do too much heat you know she do you yeah I don't think I change the physiology don't you think that I mean no more than anybody else has right talking about in other words a woman has done that well and I don't I mean we're talking about steroid use that she got caught with 2012 I mean how many people have been caught with sister and I think she takes a unfair bra look at that straight low that's right stratum I don't know hey Joe all that stuff look it is what is so let's say what do you do with that 145 pound division you just don't give cyborg a fight no I think you vacate if Germaine de enemy does not want to fight cyborg she said and you are allowing cyborg to fight and she won't fight her you first of all you got to give cyborg I mean you got to give her a fight right isn't she fighting cat but what cat and her both want it but they for whatever reason they will announce the fight on the Anaheim card why won't they announce it I have no idea talk to your boy hmm who knows what's going on you'd have to talk to cat cuz cat just came out hard against Reebok well see that is that the I saw that but the thing is is uh Cat Cat once fight cyborg wants the fight but something did some seems to be some sort of hiccup I'm not sure well no one knows but also you know with you know cyborgs gone social media you know and it's good she's voice and pin she's unhappy but it's relentless it's every day I don't know if they want that as their champ so you want the fight you want be the champ now but the UFC's go and hold on she's already you know yelling now what is she saying every day she said give me a fight Oh Ben Saunders with a stiff jab she's literally saying I don't understand give me a fight let me fight Megan Anderson who's you know rock champion and Victor let me fight Kat let me fight somebody doing something well I could see her argument that makes sense she wants a fight Megan Anna she wants a fighter I think that's a good fight that's the best fight can make yeah - I really don't make sense well cat Zingano has a name in the UFC and Megan Engine doesn't have a name you have see yet but yeah I agree with you that's a good fight and Megan Anderson's a big girl we're really good big girl and very talent Allen - great fight she's legit on Oh Ben got rocked ah oh oh Jesus suffer Ben man he's taking a lot of punishment in this fight Jesus fuck he's tough though though he's coughing shit good god it's a tough toughest oh my gosh otto's get that crazy Sebata like that like sort of no jab up jab please yeah it's been very smoothly non-russians taking punishment here let's bust it up man he's busted up oh what a tough fucking taken punishment keeps coming trying he's trying to strike with him two men that Anaheim card has John and DC though - you can't wait for that whoa and I think there's another big fight on that car - right there is who is it it just got announced in it young Jamie what is that uh what's what's that's current state of the Anaheim I show no I don't do cyber caps cyborg verse that make any Anderson oh oh my god stop stop please stop them please please stop oh he's gonna start but now it stops that's it that's good stoppage good sandwich I stopped the terrible fight avenge yeah oh jesus peter sobota a man for then he's a tough guy but it's a legit stop it Jess oh yeah you got her that's fair he's taking on me monitoring peer support look good you'll see 2:14 okay Daniel Cormier John Jones what else we got here oh this isn't the mink I mean this is just who's on so far Oh duo Troy and Andrew feely sterling sterling uh Hannah brow let the Lund one I mean these aren't any needle movers but the boy they're still gonna fill the card up also Jared bro that's a big step up for Al Jemaine sterling huge step on there bacon on head and kind of being over the hill I think he'll drink number 15 is he god I mean he's lost his last choice Heather wait how old is he it's featherweight now right remember we've already Fox right but still 15 yeah fuck son did you hear that uh what's-her-face tested positive with the fuck surname in Dallas yeah yeah I saw that who was test under USADA yeah she she had a elevated epi' testosterone ratio who is this it but Alan Belcher manager yeah but under you sada rules she would have tested positive so tell the Dallas Commission Casey doesn't say yeah Courtney Casey put in Casey there you go that's what that's what sucks is she's you know her win is overturned she's fine five thousand but Ernie you saw her rules she passed the test but her Dallas Commission like NASA not up in here under Sadr rule she passed the test yeah how's that work I have no idea but she has an elevated epic testosterone testosterone ratio right yeah before Dallas though but under you solder regulation she did it that's weird but Dallas Commission's one who overturned it cuz that's the Commission and that weird well I mean it makes you think like why doesn't do you sada have more stringent testing than doubt understand like they have different standards like Olympics one to one I think are two to one some are four to one here is Casey picked up the biggest women blah blah blah us you sada the official anti-doping agency has yet to announce that they'll be taking any action oh so Dallas is only suspended for a short amount of time though the only suspended for 90 days we have not been informed by you side of anything regarding potential anti-doping policy violation for Courtney Casey no positive tests no suspicion of anything now or in the past you saw does not been in contact about anything so scroll up to the top of this article so what happened here then suspended for three months see that's what's weird because suspending her for three months through Dallas if if you get suspended through you sada it's two years yeah right isn't it two years but I'll you and I mean mostly Commission's they list they all follow the same rules but she's just suspended in Dallas via Oh daddy but yeah interesting weird with all the all the that you know four to one well I think Olympics two to one just depends on the Commission but it with you Sonic as you sada as an employee of the UFC remember you saw it as an outsource subcontracted employee of the UFC yeah but how does USANA not catch it that's what I don't understand I don't they test the samples as well well isn't it random they don't test everyone do they I don't know I don't think they don't test every fighter on the car died but Dallas does so or Dallas did random she was one of the random ones now what causes someone to have an elevated epi' to stockholm range like there there's a bunch there's a bunch of wasted yeah rip those yeah but a lot of it is like taking some sort of external testosterone idea mmm peter sobota tkl right - and look I'm good look at that wolf jacket look at that handsome bastard you better come correct in England man all right Isaac Carter's a handsome did is a very good-looking man it's got a pocket square of course he does right yes there it is Guy Ritchie style oh they're powerful demon luster thickened

world we're in right now tear you why did I need so many management by the UFC I think that what you said oh it's a Frank yeah girl giving that young guy to Frankie Edgar that's a different thing that's a dinner you eat and you're young what ready yeah it's just you go through phases in fighting like box right now is killing it and they have all these stars ready to compete usually by saying that after the fact if Yair did to Frank Yeager what he did to BJ Penn you've got a giant superstar in Mexico but but let's be fair though Joe yeah year it fighting BJ Penn is completely different yeah they're fighting Frankie I go like if I love BJ Penn more than a lot of people however say he had no business fighting Yair that's a shitty fight to do - but we found out that he had no business here he thought that he did did we thought he was gonna be able to do something crazy no well and then we're like yeah Frankie but remember the higher ask for Frankie key so high Milus yeah but you don't just cuz he asked for was it timeless father time son who is it though yeah dude time was for Randy Couture well until Machida said is it timeless how about you doing my DA flying front kick

Jaime washes her ass is all it's 100 cent muscle me mm-hmm watch this watch his ko a little bit just a wee bit earlier watch this I remember this thang crazy motherfucker come on Nana was so accurate yeah she's a stud athlete and if you look at her house her ass is ridiculous best female tennis player say redonkulous it's read on redonkulous but her legs are - yeah like her legs fit her ass in for all horsepower I feel like everyone here including Jamie's little light in the ass for her include myself well she likes but she likes regular white guy have you seen her man finish her man looks like she's marrying a guy looks like you know he'll dread it and looks nice in here what's up he was on here Alexis Ohanian she's marrying him yeah better wise guy she's pregnant with his baby oh that's ridiculous you know she fucks him with a strap-on I know she does she probably weighs a man thank you really come out be like where's a devil masks and puts a strap-on on it bitches in tennis balls actually like a racquet yeah she rackets him in the asshole maximum in the asshole that babies come out already the size of the damn bike who the fuck is this guy yeah not no punishing wow that's amazing shrinking ass there Lex is a nice guy but that's just ridiculous dude good for a ham for bowling huh I'm impressed I like it that's incredibly you're fucking right you're dressing up as a beard sure whatever the fuck that's incredible and how did he pull that off to think we had a shot Phil he's a smart guy maybe he's like all just beta enough to sit back and let her get gorilla fuck by stud athletes on the stage all right sir you're talking about the greatest film find out but don't you think that she's gonna want some like real dick no or maybe you might have heard there's a Drake before that he's not like a giant he might have a real dick maybe does who he might decide Alexis you're angry read it dick just fuckin yeah and we don't know or girls don't care that much having that cowboy pulls it out and smoke comes out of the nose like smell like a hog oh my god I'm not gonna have this conversation Serena he just he might just be awesome so diving in with the awesome my stomach is so full sushi by cold cool how would she won that tennis tournament at nine nine weeks pregnant did she really yeah oh my god fucking monster if you'e mamie she's such a good athlete man God that guy hit the jackpot having her baby dance amazing for sure for him huh well she doesn't need the money she's rich shit yep maybe she just likes nice guys he's a really smart device white guys yeah interest he divided she dated to Levon Arrington for a little while okay how does this fight play out his glow ever have anything left you know Glover knocked out Rashad but Glover's got a bum shoulder man and he was having a hard time with his shoulder in his last fight against Jared cannoneer yeah and I had a hard time in training if Alex and Agustin it had is on right he's that to me he's the best light heavyweight in the world really yep but DC beat him and John John Zaffino I think he beat John I think he beat DC in that fight well he's the best light everyone weight in the world now that rumbles were tired you're saying well that run my fight he got head-butted yeah okay there's a lot of asterisks to me talent-wise if his if his mind's on right like remembers fight at 165 with John no but it but is two heads colliding it's not like you're hitting him with a weapon I'm saying it's a bit of a freak accident and might they fight again I bet that fight goes different I'm not saying you'd win dressing goes different especially now yeah you don't think they lee johnson that showed a fight DC will beat would because i think he was on his way out in that fight that's what i'm saying that fight he just it seemed to me like he really just did not want to fight anymore on that that's what i'm saying like when he started clenching with t seals like what is happening weird are you take down the one he had already had it in his mind it was over he told everyone weeks before that's great so his camp at fail i was hearing that he was barely trained for that fight that's what I was hearing and I don't know I thought it was bullshit I was like come on he's fighting for the title and I was hearing all kinds of shit like he came to training for weeks out side women I get it but if you're one foot in one foot out you like eyes we get this money just trying wrestle because that's what we make how much think he made in that fight five hundred thousand so I'm Glover is a guy that if he didn't have those six years outside of the UFC I feel like he could have been a champ not with John Jones at the helm no I wouldn't have been a champ John John's the helm it would have been before John Jones who was before John's Shogun yeah you're right it's fair he coulda probably had a chance he had a chance he just got some right it was a visa issue yeah for six fucking years when he was in his prime he was one guy like when he destroyed so could you in the WEC back when the WEC was in what Northern California in the middle of nowhere remember that yeah what Reed was running that Reed here so yeah I'll free to love Reed he's great guy still with you you'll see yes I love that guy but when Glover back in those days Glover was a fucking destroyer like a goddamn destroy it was like the Brazilian boogeyman everyone was like dude with the wait till this guy gets to the UFC I wait he just eat there trying for you guys visa and then Chuck Liddell signed off on him and have women signed off and then by the time he got there you know yet that rampage fight wasn't great well he fought Kyle Kingsbury and smoked him and then everybody was like Walden Otto got him but Maldonado clipped him remember that gave him the chicken dance what analysis he's that secret freaking bad bad box Brazilian boxy clip phaidor he beat faders I think he should be a fake I want you to beat in Russia yeah yeah you're good yeah I don't think so I don't come on bro yeah I mean he tried to he tried to protest like you should have protest the fact you got on a plane and went to Russia protested anywhere else you won that fight kid it's true oh man I mean by the new scoring he wanted in a big way easily yeah for sure I mean phaidor never really hurt him never dummy he hurt the shit out of phaidor yeah I'm afraid or not we're strable to stop that fight in America a lot of fun yeah especially in New York the Phaedo I took a term where all the men were mayor and dresses like that was fuck we're Street what do you think I was fatal material Mitrione easily could knock him out yeah early on I just think that phaidor is still phaidor in bursts but I just think if you look at the Maldonado fight look you're not talking about phaidor in his prime later on his prime kills Mitrione you go back to fade horn pride in the pride days but Mitrione is way closer to his prime than phaidor is Mitch and Mitrione has a chin like a motherfucker still Roy knocked him out oh boy TK Odom he did not comply lined up yeah flat line hit the hammer and drop drop and he did a flatline I'm like you know Rhonda scholars I'm like no like Mark Hunt as he uh was only a couple punches though yeah but I'm just saying he didn't like flat flat yeah but we would both agree he could take it and Mitrione is a way better athlete Mitrione is fast on his feet if metrion fight smart I think he can win that fight just had but that's the key there's has to fight smart yeah me and people get mad at me for saying that but I'm just saying Fedor in this day and age this fate or the today phaidor it's got a wolf tattoos chest a lot of people would a lot of phaidor fanboys oh god damn it it stood on 17 you fucks it's just hard like in matically said Wanderley had fucking surgery on his face it's life should happen I would like to see phaidor take the Vitor route and get over to Rison let's get this party started yeah I'll just stay in Belgium just keep on Russia go my boys this happen it does Alexander goof doesn't rain in Sweden where does he have a camping not all these glass bottles listen these boys love it on these glass bottles a victory sahlan there babe let's bring it back to end the golden years ah T we're gonna get you up the TRT a buncha gets to get on that cabinet hugh jackman sauce and i draw 50 mannitol yeah that's the shit that makes you grow eyebrow hair if your forehead size gated hairy and shorter huh ya know this guy I'm on this guy right here yes amazed Oh what where does he train Gusterson in Sweden or is he have his camp somewhere else um that's a good question he doesn't used to a lot of alliance in San Diego

it's got a Native American he's got a wolf and he's got the is that the club of a jack of spades yeah and he's got all those little lines or like when he fights every time he fights he gets a new one and the ones that he wins are dark and the ones he loses are white and then the ones that he get I guess a draws like I like that might be my tattoo so two bunch of white lines gustafson the tongue dude and he's also seven he's also a dude yeah I go over been around those six years cost him hard man to being his goddamn prime right have you smelt I would like the nicest guy ever clovers the best savage behind the eyes you think he hates you but really is cool he's a sweetheart yeah he's a really really good guy Brazilian with Russian mentality oh he's a killer and you know I mean it didn't help that he was fucking left out for six years but look he put Rashad away last year but then go over but let me now rampage excuse me Rumble put him away with one punch well mom with knocked his tooth though he knocked his fucking soul out his soul had to come back down gravity had to put his soul back down in such a sec have five at 220 wine crazy especially in school that was I thought that was CGI is it definitely a to that full hours right sure I think it was spit I think Gustafson if he shows up shouldn't murk blower I hate to tell you I think it works on the interest I think you beat them up interesting yeah and then go over be ranking way behind my boy who just won tonight I'm really interested to see that mature on phaidor fight I'm gonna buy that I'll buy that on pay-per-view I'm also really interested to see lorenz larkin lorenz larkin vs. Douglas Lima but which one Diego Lima is the you see guys fight in the UFC the Douglas Lima yeah Douglas Lee a belt or jihad correct he's a fucking Duty's Chandler - I love watching challenge yeah that card is fucking busy Rory motherfucking MacDonald looked as good as any the best rate on the planet he might be he is he might be champ you meet the champion beat Damien but I lost a wonderboy but still but I was the Wonder Boy but his nose was jacked right how good did he look phenomenal well then he said amigo do you have a message for Lima or Munson her fuckin with Larkin yeah he goes uh I'm gonna take your belt let me take your health yeah I'm out I'm gonna take your belt and take him down and dead serious yeah dead serious he's dead serum I see that well he he told me that he spent a lot of time working on improving his game while he was taking the time off to heal his nose he's like he just sparred too much as no just kept opening up and it was a real problem his nose got smashed in the robbie lawler fight he never never gave it you told me he'll see he only got hit it all went white in the blood like

Glover's taller than I thought I mean big dude I don't the angle the camera the angle doesn't fucking six six he's dozens huge yeah um Glover has a fucked up right shoulder from the John Jones fight

John dismantle clubbers like don't you oh you're good check this up yeah if I see one more advertisement for fucking Logan I'm about the bust I'm a bust they are really coming hard with that Logan ad God get it out of my face in alcoholic and it's really aggressive I like the way this guy I like the way Gustafson's moving guys side side to right now Justin wrestling to is very underrated but clover can grapple the best of black belt Abu Dhabi competition he's a monster who could kick more knocked out power clover clubs great boxer man nice uppercut oh boy be careful okay oh alright alright let's calm down everybody calm down clover also on the way wrestling ah that's right on its grandpa's really rose good cuz old little summer school if gusts and losses again its hometown a little nervous right down he's a little nervous remember got blasted fucking Johnson in some town am ia for fucking year yes tough when you're the hometown hero man well it's also you trained so hard for this one big moment and then you lose and you gotta like reassess like where am i he was on billboards and shit he's still only 30 that's another thing to think about with Alexander it's 30 years old is in his athletic prime it's a little nervous right now I feel like a dare you how dare you little hesitant a day judge then I'm nervous I'm gonna have him tweet about your writing don't you fucking dare do is I'll funny with that wise cousin trolling me about my fucking writing oh oh there you got to write this one now oh nice up Wow yeah he's twice as handsome and he just loosen up Jah gossiping cuz that Rumble fire is that job son don't I'm talking forward need up what country I don't like those little wave from that right hand mmm man man gusterson's good though let's call little check up there he's wake him up called call wake me up fuck up all right she's just avoiding it that's smart man good movement that's the over him tactic there we go away deal free remembering start doing it and it worked long legs look at this shit look at his long arms fuck who's the one dude that Nate quarry fought that was literally running away from him Kalib Starnes philip stein that's right and Nate quarry was was Cohen after him like this yeah yeah but I think he was hurt in that fire but no he covered his eyes yeah I wasn't heard that funny was that funny years foot fucked his foot up running that was a terrible fight wasn't good that it ruined Caleb's clear yeah people were so always going about hope dummy poked him all right can you poke well I guess if he put his left hand down first and he hit him with the uppercut goddamnit what do you do what'd he do he poke him first and then we still see in the replay what happened shit if this is in New York Oh clover wins the fight no no contest fuck this is the worst part of fighting is he's goddamn iPod I know clovers fine sis I'm alright oh yeah yep oh yeah I'm lucky that amethyst yeah yeah yeah well see if they can get a bit oh man look at that right in there that's the worst but that's the other eye is he is right ours let's get both eyes do you get poked in bolt honest ain't that a bitch maybe he's like squinting lisslow Glover saying I'm good to fight get out of the way that's what you want some of the wrong guys be like I don't know it's tough literally get the fuck out my way the old eye gouge for a street fighting most food guys are onto something oh they were on some eagleclaw oh I got it I got all tiger an eagle I use both bronze you see that without Taichi guy fights the MMA guy : I did not it's a it lasted like a few seconds you sent me that oh yeah what yeah mm a guy crushes them and then the MMA guy had to go into hiding because apparently people in China want to kill him yeah because it's like a disgrace to the Chinese martial arts well it's not a march it's not fire that right hand be it's their fault oh oh that's a beautiful uppercut the table did and he's so long you get out so it's a nice upper mantle and looking slick dude I'm deaf if you go really champ him and John man that's the fucking fight it might be my bean well now that rumbles out of the picture I mean Gustafson you gotta remember did rock out Jimmy Mario's it's a writer right hand over the top I wonder how they handle that now they've been training together you know Dustin already beat minimal yeah I knocked him out but I wonder how they handled that because if manna was still in the mix if they do eventually have to cross paths again I'm not trying to see that again well it's so it's so thin on there so until they have to they have to fight again it's almost like flyweight like who the fuck is there no you look at this running away let's throw bread and then stop all we clipped him with that uppercut again again with the uppercut to it left get out of there there you go he doesn't attack the I'm not mad to stack thick clover swinging for the fences - OH back kick we have five rounds of this boys I love this fight man that's been John - are you kidding me - this I'd love to see Gus and John - I know I'm saying dumb shit there but listen again Gustafson thirty years old he's still young man a lot of fight left hand Joe we've had a lot of fights too though yeah he has had some Wars - yeah but if you're on his way DC was award John was a fucking war and he got a beating from Rumble yeah but I'm that kind of oh you just fakes the takedown this is an interesting fight the weights playing out Glover is chasing him down man globe rascal hope he can get him pinned it's gotta get inside I really that there it is ago that carburetor sews not wonder if clovers going to time that with an overhand right it's got to try but you got to remember his right hands the ones fucked up his shoulder runs right it's fuckin sorry kid I get mr. hard I love this cop guys that's for me to help you out this I are your giant I secure this is just for you how about this fucking going state Cavs I don't have to find us about though you guys are smart yeah yes I saw how I saw a throw up on this table I will watch that basketball fuck you guys it goes in the net and I get so excited have a good piss body it's crazy when the ball goes in the net I've never seen anything like it Jamie gets mad Oh some what it's about it's part of the things but more important things but athletics it's both bits per best players in the world coach you know which one it feel Kochi it is a great sport but you know know which they're making Lana life I make a bad Jamie impression I'm not out of Jamie's sneakers and he makes fun of Under Armour's which you weren't OD rumor like so what's wrong with Under Armour like in the world of like sneaker sneaker dorks God welfare Under Armour like jammer shops got 200 pairs of sneakers yeah and the rank rank it close yeah what's it like it's like number four or five in the list of hierarchy hey we're the same dog trainer Ryan yeah yeah we'll talk yeah here we go round dos doo doo doo doo double jab by Gustafson a very interesting fight how's your dog great okay you got a German Shepherd I had a German Shepherd girl or a boy Carl it should cool your kids yeah the best I'll never have another dog besides German Shepherd really yep a working line Shepherd there's nothing I've had dogs my whole life they're just different animals they're soaked eating you they listen you in there wary of strangers man they don't fuck around yeah amazing watch dogs but they can descent they can not dog aggressive they stay with you the best I love him why mr. shops gonna get one I like German Shepherds to what I don't like is ones that don't get trained well any bite kit no they you don't that's that's why you get a dog with stops talking about dogs you got my mouth Malinois mounted a l-jamaa yes today train today whatever I thought it's Monday I'll let you know a lot of people don't like Belgian Malinois scuzz there they're almost a little too gay are but he's got he's got to see this one I saw the picture you sent make sure you saw it pick this thing's gonna this thing will inhale an intruder yeah those one of the fuckers you don't play look at that now pay cut again pop-pop what cut is I what happened head but I don't know yeah but Gus since playing now look at this look at this look at this Brian was talking about working dogs and llama I'm obsessed with a to where Brian's a shot I'll give him that he does a little too in the dogs beats here in the Dodge in the country in the fighting is about cars and turn the poof yeah what's have so much of my brain brothers you know what it is man you've never driven one probably yeah that's all I need right no what you need oh hello careful with that run away closer I'd rather have time up and fucking glory in the face he's bleeding bad out of that nose impact apart instead in the middle the Octagon yeah what gets to the cage it's fucking oh oh beautiful I got ya got your bed - Oh son Oh globe is in trouble big trouble when's the last time you saw that last time I caught that Nate Marquardt tyron woodley course oh boy wow what a combination boring elbow kid kid kid good I seen that on dunno Gustafson coming alive cough sicinius Tony man the real fuss like hey let's just I was saying it a long time ago let's give that I give him that the one thing he's right about with fighting was cops look at his face Glover's face is a mask it's a mess right now but again glows I got here so much knockout Pirates like one shot oh great body shot yeah very good Carlos me an issue form maybe I remember okay nose Brennan you trained with cuffs and you spar with drew both these guys yeah I remember you saying that way before you're like he's the real deal best I've ever trained with hands down Joseph soon yes mylar really gets freaked I've ever seen it comes a bit men like house just is it he was so good at everything like I you know I knew he was really good his size I watched him spar with a you know world champion boxer it literally eight rounds and just do work on the dude straight up boxing a world champion who was the world try forget the guys name you know I'm a belt sir some grimy you know but he already went in there did work get him and jumped out with three rounds with me I use I was I mean how so he's boxing sparring with him just bashed it up box oh shit and fucking him up god blower Teixeira is still in this fight guys he was straight up boxing the streams going don't knock him out Alexander do not knock him out Wow yeah it was crazy I wonder if Alexander ever thought about actually just boxing I don't know nice front kick to the thought of that oh Jesus you gotta put the left lover is doing works but you look at his fight with that Jon Jones fight to me that's a great greatest light heavyweight fight of all time I was fucking so thrilled with that fight man amazing because I was finally John Jones kinda met his match granted John pride had two hours of sleeping doing bunch lines of coke so who knows now but still at the time is great I don't like this running away cuz clovers gonna time the shit man you think I think so and worries me and all you use is fighting have you ever seen that happen yes without a mr. Oberon with mister overing I don't think um I I don't teach my students we plan to do all the time so let me ask you guys this while we're watching the fight what's the best setup to do a fight companion because I'm building a fight companion studio in the next place I feel like we Chef I watching bags that we can hit out of frustration or anxiety well what I'm thinking is with the way we're sitting here across from each other and watching the fights is no totally ideal I'm thinking round table yeah more like a semicircle like a Halfmoon that's cool yeah almost like a analyst desk yeah and then the TV there but this way we'll all be like that's cool other that's what I've been a great idea but we should have a desk right it's good to have a desk you drink so sure stuff yes so I'm gonna set up a second thing just in front of a big-ass TV and I'm thinking of putting a big-ass - you look even bigger than this mud like a good idea no no no no like 110 inch LCD yeah I knew what's the nucleus combo beautiful it could also be we could have a big couch I wear would that make us too tired that's what I'm going to do I think these chairs are the shit yes these chairs these uh these are people keep asking also there's not a sponsor ergo Depot sent me these they're from of them there they're called capisco Zin there are ergonomically buns as these now Tom Segura has these in his podcast I go there ergo what do depot chairs of our crgo t depot.com and these fucking chairs are excellent because they're comfortable but they're also economic so like you sit up straight yeah because you sit up straight after the end of the show your back doesn't fucking not at all definitely don't do a couch for the like no no no couches I think these chairs are it for podcasts I think I found the Holy Grail chairs I great they're amazing the quest so the question was what kind of setup should we have like side tables and I think no I think I think a table in front of us is the lesson move is Brian's always bringing wine and cheese and shit and yep yeah we're always going to want to slide things down to each other and then you should have like it's just a area that it looks like a like an old school telephone booth in some conspiracy theories and then fucking Eddie goes in there now what I'm going to have is a second thing with experts on skype on standby waiting every time Eddie says something crazy I'm going to press button and Neil deGrasse Tyson you're on the line do you know what I think we should have a grill and somebody should be cooking oh oh oh my god oh my god love isn't snow larious trouble serious trouble letter my friend no no no but Glover's in some serious here man with unit cover she mites Ori Mikey ground it out where you got a posture up and oh it's good like oh my god oh my god I have a Washington odor fifteen hundred which is a huge commercial smoker for the studio what I should have yes well it should be a cooking show we should have somebody cooking shade I'm Way ahead even listen to my podcast or something no I'm doing cooking shows thank you I'm gonna do cook oh the last one I did with Tom papa we talked about we're gonna sit down and eat dinner I'm gonna cook it on the show right we're gonna sit down eat dinner on the podcast yes and you can hear a lot of this norm that drives my always going for the are bar it will drive you nuts but you will know that it's going to be happening so hopefully it won't drive you and also it'll be it'll be a fight companion so we'll be eating game will be eating Manmeet drinking amazing wine come on don't be a party pooper Brendan well what I'm thinking is we're not gonna do that during fight companion a kitchen is too much going on so even more talking no it's gonna be like a show we sit down have a meal hmm you know you watch those Anthony Bourdain shows he's talking to some fucking lady in Sardinia you don't even know what the hell she's saying and it's interesting yeah right like I love a good meal having a good meal and I'm gonna bring guys like Hank Shaw have them cook for us a whole nice trip I saw some things you but I love Hank Shaw who's a world-class game chef oh and a hunter really yeah know what bill about this what if is it like some hooter girls to like refill our concert sir oh I'm sold oh we got this back we back well Bryan's doing all the meat and cook and you're all about that and I wanna get a couple of smoke show to fill up our coffees and all of a sudden I'm fuck yeah so here they get away bro no no they do it wow they're paid with last time in Broadus girlfriend over money it be coming to pay to shut the fuck out and they don't get paid enough thats not even pop I'm a feminist I'm offended if you see Wonder Woman oh we haven't seen it women only I guess he went to me I went to the big screenings with just women I like I like Amer anyways let's get back these hooter bitches every feel a pop you guys hit or not man I want something to do to stay here hey pressure I guess I am no they just feed us like beef jerky beef jerky feed it to you that's weird something wrong with your hands but I'm definitely to bring in some chefs and have some food cook dude that's a great idea Jamie pull up the yoader 1500 you show these motherfuckers well his landing all day long and it comes from behind the jab so he's like blinded by the jab so long yeah with it yep blind blind him and bring him up Gustafson looks fantastic he beats dammed everybody do you think he beats John Jones I do really if Jon Jones fought him with this long of a layoff like let's say they were gonna fight in Italian I thought o SP yes he gets locked up oh look at this look at this creative you really think so that's interesting oh shit tell you what he looks outstanding here tonight Oh glory with the lover is still in this fight in every way clovers a fucking animal he's fighting for his life man it's night in first-graders what he's doing I mean he's 37 years old he doesn't have much time left and these are these opportunities are few and far between headlining a major card like Oh rusty can take a shot and he's go over saying come on come on they're both fighting economy on us you lose this one come on to clover so aggressive it's crazy even getting tagged like he's getting he's still in this see that baby right there damn see that's a sick that's a

now it's turned in now it's got what point in life you just said we're fuck you money you say fuck you life we just let your body go and see what everything is I'm sure a lot of people are doing things but when you're in the public eye like holy clipped them with their right hand over the top when you're in the public eye like a David Letterman like most of your life and then you decided you decide to not do that anymore then it becomes kind of interesting you can relax what do you have to be disciplined about your look and make them look it's that on your screen look is that kissing fire somewhere I do not I was so much you look exactly the same on did I appreciate Rob he's 30 to 40 that's where you really dropped off but 40 to 50 you've you're maintaining that kind of maintain in mind seems like you work out more now I do work out every day and doesn't do much you hear someone's alarmed well my god yeah I do good ears I think I have bad ears by the way you probably do that's aged son yeah get them dick I'm always asking my wife to turn that it's all the boxing you do yeah yeah well the years of getting boxed in my ears you getting boxed up Broome do clovers fucking just over it not go away game he didn't get the menu the fuckin memo yeah good kick to the body there we're good though we're still looking for that knockout punch man that's a fact always there the scary thing is if oh shit if Alexander slows down a little bit it gives clevis for me oh yeah oh my god oh my god that combos did he needs to stay in the middle of the hot gun gossip Stern yes looks as good as he's ever looked at us fight yeah really does good like being a matte light heavyweight it was so fluid and this movement is excellent this is a big fight for him Oh for both of them it's kind of career-defining to be yes yeah I hate - oh Jesus - good how many can you take of these you so extreme Christ what's going on beautiful it's a artistic performance man it really is the way he's been hiding that uppercut this is my favorite taller than that jab pop wop is he your you have a unique insight knowing exactly how good he is haven't trained with them you know I've trained with both of them with globo I just you know yeah I understand what he's doing in his pacing he's like the Terminator he's very similar that's why I'd love to see him in DC fight because I've trained with DC nm they have very similar styles was just this relentless relentless forward pressure you're like goddamn relaxed slow down speaking of relentless - you're running like eight miles I see you running like some long distances where you running outside my crib you just run the beach or something like there on concrete or concrete in those campaign shoes but my knees fucked up so I'm suing cam why are you why are you running on concrete when those sand is right there uh I don't know it's like the run but isn't like sand better for you well because the I've run the San Marcos so I do is I run one San Marcos stairs and I run a mile to say like stairs run a mile three centers run a mile that's what I'm doing that's crazy so the stairs always a sprint yeah the mile is yeah but my me yesterday was like now let's take a break bro way too big dude you're a heavy guy what do you weigh like 240 is she forty at 238 yeah it's a lot of weight to put on the knees I know man I got figure it out I gotta do some if you guys know what to do it's that inside my knee but okay let me ask you this I'm dying what do you think about this UFC training facility like who's gonna go there I was certain his goodness and they're gonna pump Bain like products into the body just been crying a fucking in between a great division in between rounds he steps in a crunch oh by the way I'm sorry but look at Glover and round four after all that punishment keeping his head he looks very fresh the one of the problems would go over is he's so boxing oriented in his attack and with a guy like Gustafson he has such a large reach disadvantage so he's like constantly moving forward but he doesn't throw kicks oh look over there just one stop kicking because he attained down early on but his kicks - I don't I just abandoned it keep on way with a buckle over like Glover has always got to move into bottom Jesus again boy I got oh my god sorry my god oh my god what a fuck gonna win shit Gustafson zombie Oracle overall Jesus crisis so long I don't like seniors at all I don't like seeing that at all I don't like seeing that resistant is a fucking beast that was brilliant god damn that was brilliant that with young man and holy shit this isn't sweden stockholm stockholm oh come on it down in stockholm he's a fucking hero he's a hero he's a legend they're the heartbreak he went through we lost a fucking Johnson there man I was there man feel like crying he's a lot like crime he said walk like that they were walking out of the arena with her head low it was rough well it was a what ad beating too you know there's the example fuckin Redemption what a Viking what a fight here's redemption redemption is John Jones beats DC in a lime they do John Jones alexandros in Stockholm title right sure fuck you and me you're not gonna do it in Stockholm they do it in Vegas the real moneys in Vegas unfortunately that's our bolshy that's just how it goes buddy that's reason why we haven't been a Dublin yet for a Conor McGregor fight Bing we could do a soccer fuckin stage being Oh Janney keeps doing the same combo and that right-hander oh oh how many work was that ran way right here hey stupid FAST yeah douche a dude he's like not enough huh there you go check out ah Oh timing see the way you swung that right hand into look how he swings the right hand in over the left guard look at this watch this see look who swings that right hand over the top clovers corners like do you think you want to kind of avoid the poor guys like nah what keep doing this there's nothing we can do it's just it's hidden hit by Scott you're so calm what are you gonna do God that was brilliant brilliant performance put coasters like when you were saying how glower just missed the it a little bit like that baktun with his wrestling style via rampage you'd been champ inverse rampage in the prime that's a motherfucking fight yeah he could have won he could have won but you know what's interesting is that he just because he doesn't throw very many kicks I mean he might throw in ten kicks that whole fight he's always moving into boxing ranches getting chewed up on the way in and as tough as he is he's still getting tagged over and over what's 2017 if you're just boxing out you're screwed man they've got who's just boxing to LA you'll see yeah you're right you're right you really I'd like the highest level you just can't do it anymore like guys figure out yeah you really have to be able to do everything so this UFC training facility like how much did that fucking thing cost I was looking at that when they were showing the athletes retreat crazier I was like how much do you think that cost 12 million performances always saying it twelve million dollar performances - that's a bargain I've seen some that's a good deal but that seems very one in Vegas that's like the size of fucking Lambeau Field like that's shoe yeah still though and what's it made for it's made for like when they're in town yeah everything is there they have bags on douche and doctors and they have those aquatic that's what was going to bring up they have those underwater treadmills yeah and I've seen Beezus I have not done that that is what you should do it for your big ass bro I'm trying to run outside man let's run run underwater like it.why fucking why project I shot it right outside you know what man rocky for yeah I'm not doing it because I'm trying to fucking scientific experiment and Augustus man do you see them making a 225 division they are yeah that's a good idea also gonna do a 10

yeah that's it America beef or shrimp what's going on here is he asking her to marry him don't do it Oh in every point they're gonna have a nice kill on them though they hearts good that kid's gonna be off doing anyhow again why do I feel like they already have a kid hopefully they do she had a powerful Rolex on I feel like they already have a kid and he's just like making it a fish you know what that ring if you're gonna do on TV it better be a heater I like it I was doing it with the fucking gloves on he should just lift up her skirt and bang her hey this is a pro sacred Noah's got vibe JoJo's liking it you know imagine he did that just animal so that's awesome look at those two Vikings they're gonna have something fucking maybe shakes no Barrowman she knows how he is she just picks

right that's awesome that kid is gonna be good for him yeah mmm he put on a fucking performance of his career tonight I gotta move me to number two yeah no he's you know right now it he's number one for sure but that's just because John Jones is on the banned list uh my boy Vulcans like to say what hey everyone hey I'm number one Alexander ausdom here yeah volkens gonna move up to probably four now I was there with that one punch board clovers gonna go ahead jump back in line behind so on this UFC training institute that's what I'm so confused like what is any no one's gonna do their camp there well how could you how fair would that be if you find out let's say Michael Bisping students camp there and you else do this camp in Florida and you're like wait I won't do my camp I miss being big bang how come you I don't UFC cam okay Jesus don't forget Jesus please don't forget Jesus God they fucked up deal that don't forget Jesus and baby Jesus that's open to anybody you can start or end your camp here we have the best training facility it makes no sense it makes no sense I'm just confused as to what they're trying to do with it I just know a special train when I'm in Vegas you fucks you're gonna train there fuck yeah I bet you're not you don't you don't get it but they won't let I have time I will I don't you throw spells gonna make anything dude are you a celebrity not really them if I tell them I well that's like if you call the EOC and said I'd like to get tickets strong dude okay once I explain to them where they know me from what's that face can be tough my feelings are already sometimes a tight ship depends on how this this thing this pilot the Goldbergs girls that didn't go you don't find out no you didn't tell me now I can go it's not awkward but the Cobras got picked out for two more years by the way my water still yeah well how often do you want but I'll always be almost famous I've realized my partner sells out fucking theaters in Australia you know isn't that better though like it keeps you humble I guess as opposed to a guy like Shah was just rocketing up the charts he's eventually gonna get a big head oh my god yes I mean and it's also like you you'll have the fuel of being bitter because you are more famous when you guys started and then he surpasses but that's all that's in the case of money that's been the case of my career that's right here but everybody does that to me get the fuck out interview I'm not a failure what do you say well you're not a failure you're very successful god I'm being a super success I'm being dramatic you're very successful I've been your home the to it what year one the second one he owns yes I'm leaking out the address can I do that oh nice tell us about these very wealthy men some bullshit artist trying to say he's not successful just a bunch of look if you make more than $35,000 you're in the 1% of the world probably right no it is right I'd be correct that is a hundred with this combination spinning elbow right hook left hook right uppercut the division you know this pop that jab in oh for sure it needs it I emerged he emerged tonight is the most exciting light heavyweight in the world other than Daniel and John I can't wait for look at that - just fucking jab uppercut Christ it's so bad for your brain oh this is bad no reason I hate it god I just see his brain rattling around that skull amazing amazing most finishes in UFC light heavyweight history Jimmy manoa where's he at a Shogun seven gustafson seven Chuck nine John Jones nine watch that that Jon Jones DC rematches because to me is so interesting because I didn't think DC looked at great against robots as more of Rumble not showing up Kate I thought DC like probably the worst we've seen body-wise was that I'm getting that itch show these boys how to throw an uppercut the right way own you just waited like what yeah it was a great uppercut silly what that's silly ROM but what are you doing here he said he in an article to use once on retirement tires no chance well I see he sees Gustafson beating glover i don't you never saw these guys out you might think you could just jump back in there that makes sense how crazy is that I'm getting that itch so we I get the itch every now and then I've never tell anyone but how can you say that right when he just got done retiring after a world title fight you know why because your business manager goes up yeah so you're talking about shit listen the rambling p35 displeased tell you again 3/5 mascot up Ferrari costs and then check this out so the marijuana urine L it's tough business saturated saturated taxes so here's your taxes taxes are for g8 person so you make about 40 grand a when you do the numbers man when you like people make this mistake all the time they go to buy a bunch of stuff and they didn't do the real hard numbers yeah start talking to them it's like oh fuck yeah there's a lot of pockets got a lot of money yeah well what's really fucked up guys are amazing about this Porsche let's talk about that yeah I'm just kidding I'm not that dumb don't buy that old Porsche waken you know you're gonna love it waste II see it has the brand-new turbo rims on it it's ridiculous brand-new turbo rims you're hilarious why do you see this I've seen a lot of actors not do those numbers and and been in their house and gone you're on a series right now this house is a you're nuts about 40 grand a month and your your show is gonna go away and you're just an actor how crazy that for you now alright because you know as an actor you've had that's how many failures you know it's nothing cuz it's gonna end cause this is the once it's friends because it as an actor you go this is the job that's gonna push me over the edge I'm now famous and I'm gonna go from job to job and it never happens and I see I've seen it at too many times it happens or some people yeah were you always good with money Joey cuz you and I always made some business managers you have someone harping on you right away um I'm pretty good here's the thing I like cars but I don't spend like a lot of money on jewelry or stupid shit and cars you could actually sell like a pendant on the car yeah yeah my cars are worse investments but yeah some of them are bad investments with like my Corvettes worth a lot of money like those are like old car you could sell they're worth money I've made money though you always made more money than most people know when you're younger no and most of us as actors and stuff you're Royce hustle yeah I always do a bunch of different things that's one thing I don't all your eggs in one but I don't like having a boss and I don't like having to count on someone and I like when you have fuck you money if you don't say fuck you I think it's a fucking disgrace disgrace to the fuck you money if you don't say fuck but you have to get there though yeah you gotta have a say fuck you when you're making 70 grand a year no no but once you get fuck you money you have to know what it is like you okay now you have the opportunity you're in a fuck you position so you got to know when to say fuck you and when you're just saying fuck you because you have fuck you money that does happen to people too they get that fucking money and then they can't wait to say fuck you yeah and they pull the trigger on fuck you too quick yeah it's gonna be me oh that's not good if that happens okay sad I'm waiting cuz it does we know we know people will yes no because what happens is you got six million dollars in the bank but you start spending a million dollars a year I've seen that plenty of times what you say be a lot of guys get six million dollars in the bank and that starts spending a million dollars a year and I've seen that so you get six years ago out like a gangster yeah those six years are so fun though well my buddy my buddy was making a lot of money and he can't really look like I seen a ghost and he said my business managers told me I have to make nine hundred thousand dollars a year just to break even and I went what do you spend my chances yep and what do you spending money on he goes just stuff and I said like what he goes I got two nannies I got three cars I got a big house but I don't know just stuff and he couldn't really figure out you know until his business manager went line for line it was like this is what you're spending but you know what happens to when you start making money you start hanging out with other people that are making money you know I was talking to this pro football player who was telling me that he was saying that basically what happens is you around all these other dudes in camp and the dude shows up with a rolls and this guy's got a Bentley and this guy's got a giant gold chain and and he goes you start spending money just to keep up with these people help well Kevin Hart has a funny bit about that was hanging out with a Dwyane Wade and those guys and he they were talking and Kevin's like I'm making money and doing what was that you should buy a boat like what God and then they were balling they were out of club and he and Kevin let me get the check and Dwayne was like let me get it he goes now let me get it man let me get and he looked at the building it was so expensive he had to bring it in the light to make sure he had the number right he was like what like you guys this dog the others yeah Jim Hart now though if Dasom but if that's what you want to do if you just want to concentrate on money I mean the real problem is that requires a mindset of its own and a lot of the people that are just financial entrepreneurs and people that are like obsessed with making money they're not also creative geniuses they're not also pursuing a career in in the arts with an oddity yeah it's just you gotta you got to know like what you're getting into so if you're a guy that just gets wrapped up and hanging around with rich people and keeping up with the Joneses and if you're an ass shocked if you're an athlete it could want to fucking up your career because you get so wrapped up in that stuff that it takes some focus away tell you what else happens you did it you you're married to a girl she's hanging out with their wife and now she wants to get then that $10,000 handbag she wants that that Benz she wants that and and you don't want to make her feel like she's not so she's in session school is in session talk to preach both you older men tell the young fucks listen these bitches they get together and they start oh my god what you get those shoes I got them from this side that purse is so hard to get I know a place we can get it BB it's only 30,000 for a fucking purse oh my gosh there's $30,000 crazy yeah next you know actually

missing they hit him with a wet belt slap right across the ass if I water if I waterboarded him or some shit he probably just didn't know this Brendan Schaub retweet well here's the problem as your celebrity grows and as the fighter and the kid continues to grow it is going to emerge if it hasn't already gotten there as one of the biggest sports shows the world has ever known I mean you guys have millions of downloads when you look at the amount of downloads you guys have and you look at the influence that you guys have and how many people listen like they'd be crazy to not jump on board with you yeah I mean the big brown breakdown which is an all fight show is where I mean bigger than any show there as far as I made not-not-not the fight to paint as far as straight-up fight show sport shows it's the biggest one their last fight companion we did got 10 million down oh my god we taught you about fucking flat earth and yeah I got point wasn't in that one wasn't it that one mmm who's the fighter one is the one where you kind of got in daddy might have been like I found that actually variants the thing is what people think I like some issues I've zero issued you see I'm over

real opportunity for them to take take that market share to get rid of that lame named Bellator what's up Bellator I don't know why they well they keep get rid of that right what would they call it just spiked MMA but they're not gonna be spiked anymore it's gonna be something new I think 2018 they change I think Spike TV's changing its name just change the name yeah I think it's like the paramount station or something what is the ultimate what are they let's find out what they're calling it I think they're gonna change I think they're literally changing the name that is paramount Network around fight oh I got my thumb on the pawls of Hollywood pictures very few people that are in Hollywood that know less about Hollywood than me yes but you knew that I knew that I mean Brad I know how to do that paramount fight leaks pretty cool yeah um you know fire make of some kind just MMA just call it MMA just like when you go to see boxing you're not seeing like you know fucking but you can I've ever seen on Showtime HBO right right but it's HBO boxing Showtime Fight Night or paramount Fight Night compare well mmm pay-per-view to or whatever yeah an MMA has enough of a name now that I think you can like everyone know UFC is always going to be like NFL NBA it's gonna be behind yeah yeah it defines q-tips yeah right but I'll tell you what I do like what the UFC's doing I don't like that's on fight pass I think it's a terrible idea but the Dana White's contender says every Thursday night there's like 5 fight select upcoming guys to build up new guys yeah what's on fight pass where only the balls-deep hardcore fans see it that should be on foxsports1 they need content like a motherfucker I turn on Fox sport that the pregame they add Bisbing and Gilbert Melendez guessing the capitals of Europe for 30 minutes that's important this is like to freak the fuck out guessing the Capitol's that's what the fuck it work on this is the thing about live sports this the only thing that makes TV valuable these days the only thing if you take away live sports nobody is watching sitcoms anymore the numbers have dropped radically nobody's I mean there's there's a few people watching those cop dramas those CSI shows this is people's brain dead people in the Midwest just sitting from the TV I wonder if that's the bad guy yes you gotta get cotton hose donkey that's a terrible here - goddamn that's kinetic eerie look at that character this is my show this is my show see inside my show I'm all out of gate right where's my guy right okay babe is out of water drinking died rate happen chips and shit but I think that um those shows are dropping off like if you look at like HBO the the shows that they put together the show Showtime put together the shows Netflix put together their superior so on and not directed to commercial you're filling tube in there just Leslie the episodes and all that yeah so the big thing for television is live sports like a fight like we came here to watch television we came here to watch a live fighting event I mean the live sporting events are like in my opinion the premiere thing on television now it's really the only reason why you'd have cable to be honest you put a lot of kids everything else you can get Jamie's generation these youngsters they're all abandoning their cable they're all turning off their DirecTV and just watching their computers yeah they're just getting at Netflix and well YouTube led now has its own its own you know the TV shows on there they get movies yeah they're going to be able to air television shows are on television right now on YouTube my TV I got a TV at home and it plays Netflix from the TV without an appletini how about anything that right comes with Netflix it's in there so
