Jim so kings I fells the mark Munoz's Jim its Evangeline show gonna do their camp sir mayhem Chris sauces in ski mark mu√±oz Jake Allen burgers out of there dude made perfect sense to me I felt like you don't like we trained the hell out of that kid then he went in there and did his job yeah he he knew what was gonna happen he knew what she was gonna try to do yeah so he did opposite indeed well thank you guys for coming on the podcast there's a pleasure as always Kevin Ryan for participating was worried really worried you were gonna try to hit this out it was much more fun right we would have never had that fucking crocodile story wasn't irrational fear of animals because now he's never going to Florida Thank You mr. Miller and thank you very good and we're out Eddie Bravo on the podcast we drop some knowledge drop the knowledge my weed so you had to cure up some haters yeah we had talked about this unfortunately Eddie's got some haters online and people make some unfortunate statements and one of those statements was made about him wanting that would being a bad role model because he says that marijuana enhanced his life and marijuana helped his jiu-jitsu and marijuana helps his music and his creativity and somewhat jiu-jitsu got who we both respect amazing jiu-jitsu God but unfortunately he's just he's got a shitty idea about what weed is so I used to be just like you complete up I used to hate pot heads then I was the that was worse than you until I did some research and found out the truth you can find out the truth to come free though just buy it buy some books you go to Barnes & Nobles and they have a whole section on weed and it's not negative stuff it's a whole section one week but it's funny because when there someone makes a big statement like that and makes a big deal out of you you smoking weed and says you're an idiot man they do way more harm for the cause of anti weed than they do good you know because he calling you an idiot all it does is make them look silly and irrational and then it gives you an opportunity to defend yourself and then when you defend yourself fucking facts start flying out and information and an emotional testimony where you're talking about you're praising the positive effect it's way more advertisement for weed every time someone steps up and say something shitty about weed the the backlash is way bigger now than it's ever been before the weed movement actually needs people like concrete Oh to call us idiots because then we bring out the facts and then you know we the people that are on the fence about weed you know a good portion of them when presented with the correct facts they'll go oh shit they'll jump over people way on the other side of the fence we're never gonna get those guys not right now they're too caught in their way that's fine I mean I used to be there I totally understand what their feelings are about drugs fucking up your life and ruining and becoming a crutch I know exactly what you're saying you're absolutely right that for some people some drugs can be coming to crutch what what marijuana is to me and what it is to Eddie is not it's a spiritual thing it's it's an entheogen it's it's something that connects you to truth it's something that connects you to a higher feeling of understanding a higher sensitivity and I refuse to accept the fact that that's bad for you I think if used and harness correctly it's most certainly good for you and that if people learned about how good it is for you it can enhance their life including cops man including those people that think it's bad they think people should go to jail for it it can enhance your life too man there's there's a lot of shit that people should go to jail for you're right there's a lot of drugs that are terrible for you you're fucking right there's a lot of drugs that if you sell them you're a piece of shit you should be removed from society I agree with you but pots not one of a man thrown in there for all the wrong reasons and if you look at it correctly you realize that this is something that makes people happy and it's its nature and it's put here on earth people have had a symbiotic relationship with this plan for 10,000 fucking years and the only reason we keep talking about is because we can get thrown in jail for even though the state says it's legal the feds you know the DEA they they think they could just come in and just ignore state law and just put people in jail that's why I'm talking about it all the time I'm trying to do my part in the legalization process to open people's eyes once it once it's totally completely legal and everyone's cool with it and I'm not gonna really talk about it no more there's really no need everyone's gonna know it'll be it'll be knowledge it'll be something that's coming understood instead of right now it's commonly misunderstood that's the end of our marijuana program tenth planet JJ calm bitches represent that works that way that someone see the shirt and dope shirt like you're stopping a fucking rule yes because they see the shirt but it's you it's you it's don't undersell it you're the first one but you're being a regular gonna be mutants you gotta give me one ASAP like I want to wear it on fear factor I want to wear it on the podcast and it's like so we rush if you get it a couple sent to you a couple sentences like other people that we know that are poor to us and you wear it and it fucking blows up like literally blows up that's nice that I can do that but it's pretty easy so when you take it when you partake partake yes it's a cabbage it's a it's a bad massively different podcast yeah it's different yeah if you like it's cuz it you know well it's also the only podcasts are one the only one that I know of word they let you know if they're smoking weed Kevin Smith does - oh he smokes weed or soul pause really dude he's the biggest seller I've ever met he's constants what completely all he does now he smokes weed all day he's obsessed come on the first time I came in here though you guys were doing the volcano and I did not partake at all yeah but I still got high we got so lazy with that volcano volcano let's do it to work it's just way too easy to roll a joint I like the volcano though it's healthier for your body I really should go back to it but I'm sitting next to it I was sitting next to it it does go too weak too fast but that's not really a problem here in California at least we hope it's not this is in 45 days you're supposed to close all the dispensaries my guy says it's horseshit he says he's not going anywhere he says they only gave those things to 60 and different people and he said they already did to Michigan what do you mean they did too much they just cleared out Michigan all the medical marijuana out of Michigan close down all the fucking meth stores all of them that's what I've been people on Twitter I've been telling really that's crazy now I'm all they have over they have a very fresh program it's very young California is so deeply deeply ingrained I doubt that that can happen here that's like trying to close all the McDonald's you know one that we would find someplace we would find the place no but I mean think you say close all the mixology good there's wall on that corner - you fucking kidding me it's really gross man it's really it's one of the grossest things about our government the fact that they're continually going after marijuana and it's there's no evidence whatsoever that does anything bad and yet to let cigarettes just slide rather than the table the fucking the weeds of death these cigarettes are killing four hundred thousand-plus people every year and nobody says a word they're just sliding on through you know and everyone's sending jackbooted thugs to go raid medical marijuana dispensaries and take all their profits and take all their pot and make them go to court for it never give take millions of dollars from them it's amazing it's amazing that these are these are basically thugs for pharmaceutical combination so speaking of getting high and looking at ridiculous shit this is a documentary called Kubrick's Odyssey by this guy named Jay weed nur who believes that's down the kubrick faked the moon landings granted he also believes there's an alien base on the moon he believes that's the reason why they faked the moon landings is because they didn't want to go the moog there's aliens there what's the lesson is your believes tear solvent to come the good one the McQuaid also believes well what's fascinating about it is the theory is interesting well what's what's fascinating about it is he points to the symbolism in the jacket the shiny the symbolism in Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining and how that symbolism directly relates with along with numbers and all sorts of things that he changed that directly relate to Apollo to the Apollo moon landings including the room the crazy room where everything happened is the exact amount of distance between the Earth and the moon you know and that he changed it from what it is in the book and dated the distance to the moon you know so and there's all this symbolism like the boy is wearing an Apollo rocket sweater in this one particular scene like I'm not doing it any justice it's very very detailed but it also has detailed about the way that he believes they faked the videos of people on the moon by thing called frontscreen projection which was a technique that Kubrick used in 2001 and if this technique is not perfect but it's basically the beginning of green screen it's what they did before they invented green screen and this this technique has a telltale like serve a line between the boundaries of the real front the real screen or the real stage rather and then the screen behind which is an image which tries to make it look it's a vast distance when in reality it's just a wall and this telltale line he shows it all his Apollo photos I mean it's really kind of crazy if you if you look at it you you look at the videos look at the photos and you know the stills of the astronauts around the moon this is it yeah a couple that with the fact that the same background exists in different Apollo moon landing missions in their background when they were supposed to be miles away from each other they're supposed to be in a completely different place yeah they have the same background discrepancies about when it comes to the imagery he believes he believes that people actually went to the moon but when they got there the problem was there was aliens there and he points to the Clementine lunar orbiter which took photographs of a crater and this crater had a very distinct like blue dome in it you know did you say just to watch people go deep into the rabbit hole you know I mean this guy must have spent a giant chunk of his life trying to prove that Stanley Kubrick faked the moon landings and it's pretty interesting man it might be a hundred percent worship but it's daily keep interesting here's the whole thing I was thinking is at home every time it's kind of Cooper you faked the moon landings do you think he'd be pitching so much other fake shit like guys that's also fake this isn't like why would he go to make movies um I think what the idea is is that the government according with his hypothesis is that the government wanted to fake the moon landings and what they did was they came to Kubrick they explained to him why they want to fake the moon landings and they gave him access to all sorts of scientific information of cubic as a mathematical genius and he was such a space flight it was really like really really into that shit and so what they did was they gave him access to all NASA's different studies and NASA's different you know technology and allowed him to have like basically an unlimited budget to produce this and to produce 2001 a Space Odyssey so you could do them sort of in conjunction with each other and the technology that he could use in portraying 2001 he can use basically the same stuff in faking the moon and they would help them and get enriched and give them access to information and his this guy's take on it is the access the information was the elites of society the hidden you know culture that runs the hidden societies that run our government for real and you know the privileged feel like an Eyes Wide Shut yeah and we know that sucking the skull and bones and all these weird fucking groups that some of these shitheads get into it the Bohemian Grove you ever seen that stuff all these elites from all over the world me the fucking sacrifice and effigy and they think worship this Molech the owl God Alex Jones has a whole video we're smack in the Bohemian Grove film dollar shit it's pretty interesting what's up what else is interesting is that when he made the movie Eyes Wide Shut that was his last movie that movie was sort of about a lot of it was about like hidden societies like secret societies shut up yeah so he's kind of he was a brilliant brilliant guy and he was also a brilliant chess player and what they think is that he did is like he hid a lot of things symbolism and and you know and different imagery in in the movie to sort of tell a story and this guy breaks it down of course it's just his hypothesis it could be 100% horseshit yeah but it's interesting so see it or not ah Bert Bert Bert comley's gentleman BER T three times with the need ridiculous yeah follow him on Twitter powerful Ari Shaffir I'm done with doing the podcast good times as usual we've done hundred and how many 140 but if you early on to we're just doing on the couch right we've hole eight a nice active pretend were comfortable to touch socks it's totally cool it's just like so much smarter to use office chairs you think about who sits up straight all day for office people yeah his office chairs and that old couch you're headed to my room now she's ham yeah we recycle here at death squad it was it was blocked my other cousins that recorded it just blocked my other couch for like a year really I just put it in front of the other couch and then what you do eventually you got rid of the old couch you know I moved them so the space for long oh no haven't been to your place cool with it okay my leg or arm was it arm yes you got to vaporizers I got through I don't get it yeah thanks you want a charity I think I'm gonna go into the loo economics door prizes those attachments you don't break those photo breakups don't break them I no one will ever tell me to do ones Fox my son Diego they mind you might say like oh we're down here let's get another with your San Diego semi real proper right now they're closing down all the pawn shops from San Diego it scares me well San Diego super Republican Donald Rumsfeld lives down there apparently this a Corona this is the city of Corona so I got Rhode Island it's like a little Peninsula it's like one of the most wealthy towns in America and Donald no one was there they don't want no pot anywhere near San Diego a lot of Republicans in here a lot of military - really yeah everybody loves pop OH you can down there especially unless they do of course they do this is this conservative people down there they just don't want to you know there's a lot of those fucking guys are their mustache Fridays at my fucking neighborhood you know you know sit there was just progress I get that I get when there's a dispensary open in their neighborhood you buy some you won't like go on the corner smoke haze yard sure this is the problem yeah that is the problem yeah that is the problem the problem is was too near residential or two-year school some people want to argue with either you're close to the drugstore to a school yeah but also not really that close and people aren't doing stuff there yeah exactly very few people or in a drugstore like anywhere on Ventura Boulevard I shouldn't say that because they might it's probably a lot of people to give their prescriptions and just fucking jackhammer in the park environment yeah maybe yeah you know failing an oxycontin thing probably yeah but anywhere I met her Eddie's busy street like yeah that's fine that's totally fine but malls should have punch-ups hey shit yeah those fucks somebody's gonna make a fortune putting it pops up at the mall do you is already gonna make a fortune of that well someday do you worry about this backlash all the shit that's going on right now they're trying to close pot stores a lot of times it gets the gets to be really um inflammatory like people think of closing shop lets him write a mic hold on the only news I really heard is they're sending out 16 letters right and they're shutting down giving those 16 stores 45 days now making arrests 45 days shut down only 16 out of thousands that are you know that story when they came to me there was no one way yeah absolutely like I don't know exactly why or what they mean they say not operating in the state laws right yeah well you're you have a real good point about people reactionaries well more like the end is near yeah the worst that not to but also when you were talking about how they're supposed to be nonprofit uh-huh but none of them are nonprofit they're making crazy cash yeah they have employees that you like that I get that but it would the real change position if you know pause function free would be the real change or if you you only paid and blew my mind yeah yeah I was free that would be the real change it everybody just had pot and you just gave people things for pot I was like some sort of a weird barter system or you got paid to grow pot just enough so that you you know would just be able to get it around what's up it's really good the supermarket why not why not why not just come by but the idea that you could get paid just enough to justify you brilliant but you couldn't get any money you have to get someone's gonna run the whole dispensary yeah pay them more they don't just get just enough to get by well that's turning this whole thing that's a grand a year that's a business that's the person that's running it right what about the profit for the actual business itself pocket how much whatever you want to make with the regular business I don't know how much to make the president making me a shitload yeah he should she starting Nike go ahead you making sure that is a slippery slope right once you give up anything when it's really not for profit what for what purpose anyway but the way it's written it is any medical drug is for profit right so like what cuz why is this not profit I guess the idea is to protect the tomato in the first place yeah but the art yeah but tomatoes aren't like profitable the way marijuana is problem now and it's not patentable yeah and since it's a psychoactive substance I think they feel like anything psychoactive they have to control yeah filling you know if they have some things that are psycho after that they control if other ones they don't control them I think everything a little testy about that shit and then I think pharmaceutical companies would get testy about it I think they put a lot of pressure on politicians and that's where all this shit comes from it's in to reconcile a result of the people there's a White House website we can ask in you know what emotion questions are most sport quit number one by far is why is it marijuana legal that's number one it's like quit oppressing me you know this bothers nobody this bothers nobody around me so like stop leave me alone I'm not doing anything anyone yeah meanies government meanings cut that shit out yo we're hip to you we know what's up man hold on it we're all just people stupid get it together pitch then something in ice water it's stay black stay buddy Duncan Trussell to fisting with flashlights no dose one of them is going to stuff up his butt now that's not the proper use of these things these are sex tools not sex toys yeah we got over that sex sex tools they have a purpose they do something just don't do when you open up for me to kill my flashlight material I won't all right which one is that ten minutes on the floor slow though you do oh yeah what's this what happens women throw them out that's what happens yeah flashlights laying around your house chicks behind them and they go fuck Duncan you need to make it they need to make it safe a special flashlight say the code yeah it looks like a golf club you know yeah it's like something that not it wouldn't throw out you need to put a Pocky in its at the pocket and it's he put Siri in it and then that being a voice to your room flashlights so you talk to your flashlight so how about I tell me I'm good Oh baby I'm sucking your cock I bet they will have that I bet they'll have I pray they don't leave an iphone sleeve yeah for your fleshlight I can't believe it he doesn't put headphones on you know yeah and you can actually even watch a video too you can have it hooked up to an iPad as well so you're watching a porno video and I've have do you know they have a Chinese dick sucking robot they came out with a robot no yeah they call it like a seaman extraction device but it's essentially like this tall to go with a tube yeah like sucking your cock that's probably horrendously rude Dean I feels terrible but they have it of course I'm surprised they don't I'm surprised that blowjob robotics hasn't isn't like a huge industry well the Siri things gonna change all that I don't think I think so you know everyone wants to fuck Syria like so many of my friends want to fuck this Brian wants Syrian bill it's his voice yeah no Kate Steve Jobs I think I think the logical thing is to change the voice of Steve Jobs since he died like one week before Siri was announced and released yeah well I just have to be a robot boys can you adjust the voice oh here he died the day after it was announced yeah the day after he missed that was the first speech that he never gave you know keynote speech or whatever it was whatever big announcement speech Kim Tim cooked it and then he died they have different voices in different countries though they have like an Australian boys in the Bridgeport but you kept those yeah but I guess they don't work as good like because in your accent yeah and words like languages like Australians like say pubs and or whatever it is right right rather they have a bunch of different shit going on oh thank you you're obsessed with that huh you're obsessed with Syria it's fun to play with okay I want to get it I want to but you haven't they'd love Detroit Duncan yeah what happened so you're telling me it's the most amazing phone of all time I did when I went around and I fucking grass died phone owners the droids better

and the camera holy shit dude the camera has so many different options tomorrow no new iPhone beat them all where's better right No everything really has radar detects on its face detection it's cropping it's got doesn't have that 4.5 inch screen though son yeah so you know why they did a report of why you know the iPhone isn't gone to that yet is that the screen there's a certain size of screen that once it gets too big you can't do it one-handed anymore you have to hold it with two hands and that's the size of the iPhones to actually beat the biggest that usually can get for the average person that makes sense that totally makes sense i I think it's also a battery life issue man those bet those droids of battery life totally atrocious always out of juice my droids totally

problem yeah stretch problems right out when she has an accident okay launching out how's the new things that's pretty good the new thing looks alright looking for a movie tonight I just have you seen Drive yes you like it I liked it sorry mrs. Rowe we know she has a little bit of a problem with extreme violence that's a tough one to watch in the mix come yeah if I was with my friends probably enjoyed it more what did I see last night I saw the the Tower Heist with Eddie Murphy how was that who's okay I had I had pretty next to nothing expectations and I enjoyed the movie like I enjoyed it it's Eddie Murphy back to dropping in bombs of being Eddie Murphy and dead still are not playing Ben Stiller he's playing a little bit different of a role which is nice and and it's a lot of corporate Greeks about the corporate guys funny little suckers and then it turns into like a family-friendly comedy at the end but other than that it's pretty sweet Kevin Pereira joins us from the podcast freshly from one of our best podcasts I gotta say thank you we've done two so far and they're both fucking awesome man you got such a wide variety of interest and a few points and you got a little bit of crazy conspiracy theorists in you but realist along with it it's not that you're not reaching a healthy dose of a tinfoil hat is sometimes a good thing have you ever sat down with Alex Jones have you ever had him on your show I you know what I tweeted out I wanted to interview him and I tweeted out one of his articles and and he was such a polarizing character that the backlash from tweeting that out make people not want to listen to the message I was trying to give so I'm a little reluctant from that but but what I have seen from him at times is so far pretty interesting to me what about if I had him come on as a podcast I think you would be the perfect counterpoint would you sit in have us form an podcast I love to Alex Jones here with Kevin Pereira Kevin is from g4 attack of the show attack of the show is a new world order device what they're doing is softening up the idea it's attack it's a to the show we're all friends here why we are owned happily by NBC by Comcast so General Electric they're shootin fucking bombs he's amazing I'm happily chat with he's awesome I'm not with him in Texas he came to the fights we we had margaritas during the day with Alex and then we went to the UFC that night I didn't get to hang with him but Joey Diaz gave him a pot cookie and put him on the fucking moon oh and it alleged allegedly he actually said on a show the next day that he has smoked pot with me once a year just to try it out and see if I'm and a decriminalization it's true it's true once a year I come in town and I get we believe we smile our way I love it does it that's the polarizing nature of his character concern you and turn on the lining yourself no no I'm pretty it much Who I am I don't think anybody has any questions you know I mean anybody who knows me they know me from the podcast right you're not gonna I don't think it's confusing I think I find a lot of what he says fascinating I don't buy into all of it but I do plan some of it he's got a great video on what we're talking about tonight about provocateurs oh yeah who's talking about the the protest WTO protests in Seattle and how it was set up where these military people would come in and cause violence and they were wearing like ski masks and shit and breaking windows they were wearing fucking military issued boots and they wound up getting they wound up going into a safe house and then they get the the cops negotiate with them and they let them all go yeah man it's like it's so gross he documents it in great detail there's videos from Occupy where where people are in the crowd they're screaming they're trying to rile up the people on the front line as they're approaching the riot cops the riot cops step aside after telling people you cannot go down the street and a line of eight of them walks right on through the police line then they close up and they're not arrests in the dudes that walk on by but they look like plainclothes protesters that's already happened at some hey it's already happened they what is the justification how do they sleep at night knowing that they're doing that kind of shit I just do that side that's like Nazi Germany shit man that's like Orwellian it'sit's it's creepy that you can get an Americans to sit the citizen to trick other Americans like that right but again there talked about the sensitization they don't see read they don't see Americans they don't see you and I
