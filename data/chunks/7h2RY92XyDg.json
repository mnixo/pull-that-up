hello freak bitches there's nothing reason to going on right here there's no reasonable consideration of the pros and cons of this issue and no one's there's no one's stepping in the middle all right know what it's like it's like the FBI and Apple dispute that's what it's like right same thing you got it all on one side you got all on the other and the reality is you know what we could have found a solution here somewhere if you know if we'd been I don't know I although who knows I don't know Apple seems to be inclined to draw a line under this particular issue so this particular issue is they're trying to get into that guy's phone the killer who killed those people in San Bernardino they want to get into his phone and the FBI wants Apple to engineer some sort of a backdoor well here's here's what it is so this guy cited for had he had three phones at least that we know about two of them II destroyed he completely destroyed him and and the the Bureau has been looking they think that nothing recoverable off those systems and they've asked a lot of people for assistance so they had the other phone which was in his truck which is his work phone it was belonged to the county and so they went to the County Bureau did they went to the county when they pulled this phone out of the truck and they said we need to get the information off of this thing because you know what a phone a phone nowadays everybody keeps everything on their phone right right and so they they got the support they pulled and they found out that he had shut off the function that uploads data to the cloud in October and so they were able to get everything up to October but then that's two full months prior to the attack so they said okay well we can't get this and then the the the phone has you know this default position where if you try the password ten times and it raises everything so they took the phone the bureau took the phone to Apple this was but well before they had to go to get a court order well before it became public knowledge they actually went and had numerous quiet conversations with Apple and they went to Apple and they said literally said you can take the phone keep it on your campus keeping your facility put it on we don't you know wherever put in your lab all we're asking is for you to create a systems information file that you can force on that phone that one phone and pull the tech which then allows you to brute-force the password right and get the texts off of it get the data off of their own exists and then you can destroy thus if the system's information file you can keep the phone we don't even need to touch it we could you know whatever you just give us the the shit that's on the phone an Apple has been helpful in the past they've been they've been helpful in the past and this time for some for whatever motivation they've decided to draw a line in the sand and say no we're not gonna do this and it's not as if they haven't been helpful and there's an ongoing dialogue and so it's it's disingenuous to say that Apple you know is now you know the bulwark for privacy because they have been helpful in the past and they will continue to be helpful I suppose in their own way but for this particular phone for this one time where they could have held onto the phone created that sip destroyed the sip at that moment that they've pulled the text off said that's it that's done so now what Tim Cook is saying is not that it's creating a backdoor he's not saying that he's saying it creates a precedent but the precedent was already that if the bureau goes through the the the process the Congress is set and then goes through that process and gets a court order because Anna Court then it looks at it and says yes you've got probable cause you've got reasonable you know concern here they provide a court order then they go and they make this request for assistance they're also talking about a dead guy talking about a guy who shot 80 people whatever it was killed 14 people I've heard all sorts of things I've heard people say to me and I and again I understand don't get me wrong because I understand fully the importance of finding the right place on the pendulum for security and privacy I get that I get that and that's an important discussion I'm not saying it's not it's you should always have that conversation but part of that is then during the course of that conversation Congress the courts they make those decisions where does that pendulum you know settle between security and privacy and then it settles here okay fine then that's what the bureau or whomever has to go through to get approval to get some assistance and that's where it stands but you know to say that because now you've got all three brain the government have said yeah we think that really we could use this information off of this phone but I've heard everybody tape why don't they just do the rest of the investigation well of course they fucking done the rest of the investigation they've done all the other investigative steps so what are you saying in a situation like this you just want them to do 80% of the investigation and if you've got you know that you've got material on here whom which may lead to operational activity in in finding other people who were involved or finding people overseas who were and somehow assisting or whatever it may be if you're saying well just now you know what for the sake of this and we're not asking for a backdoor they're asking for that that one phone that's where this whole thing is really headed south and it's become this idea that you know which is erroneous but I understand what Tim Cook is saying about the precedent although not really because again they've done this before for some reason for this one they're drawn a line so anyway I bet I've heard that why don't they just do the rest of the investigation and skip this part what I don't I don't follow that logic train and then the other people other people say well why do they just get it off the metadata and and that's another one of those things where people never believed what the government was saying but the meta fucking data was numbers and volume that was it there was no information to be had there you could sit in the fuck in a room full of metadata and not know what the hell you're looking at you have to go through the court process to then get that particular numbers information so here's my question because this is what came up with the Edward Snowden thing they were saying that the government is monitoring all cell phone data constantly and they can get information all the time well this kind of proves that not to be true yeah but people don't look at it that way they don't they don't they don't make that leap back and say oh well maybe that was a fallacy yeah it sure the metadata was sweeping up all that those numbers and volume but again it's not enough to what end yeah and so some people would say once they realized what it was actually doing then they'd say well but that's so what so they're just collecting this shit in the basement it's not doing any good so they shouldn't even collect that information so what Edward Snowden was talking about is essentially just when it pertains to email I mean he said they're collecting all this information that the NSA is collecting all this information in regards to cellphone data they're recording every phone call recording all these text messages yeah is that not true well no I frankly I'm here question nobody's gonna again this very emotive right so there's always people out there they can say fuck you you don't know what the fuck yeah no there is nobody right now unless you're a terrorist a terrorist suspect or a criminal there's nobody in the government who so fuck about you on his pics are safe ladies and gentle apicture 'he's that you've been floating around throw your boyfriend okay go secure nobody's gonna route those around anybody who would rat you out for those is a piece of shit and unamerican in the first place yeah yeah so that's a that's a really eye-opening thing though because this case kind of throws that all into jeopardy because everybody was like concern like hey the government can check in on all your phone calls and all your text messages well this would clearly be a case where they would want to do that so I don't they can't do it here without the the judge granting this order and what so tell me why did there was a recent court order that ruled in favor of Apple they did and that was in New York and that was an interesting case as well and that's probably going to set a precedent for the maybe maybe we'll see because it's a little bit different what the judge essentially was saying in that case and it involved a narco trafficking investigation that was going on and and by the way this isn't just for terrorism imagine what if this was for pedophilia imagine a large pedophilia ring what are you gonna say no we don't want to catch those fucking douchebags that are involved in that because privacy you know I understand the privacy aspect but each case has to be looked at on its merits and and if you say through the courts and through the through the Congress that these are the hoops that the bureau has to jump through and they jump through those hoops then then what then it's up to each company to decide whether they want to support it or not I don't know that that seems strange but anyway the point being is that the one in New York the judge essentially was saying well look you want us you want the courts to make a decision on this for something that Congress should really make a decision on this and so he was in a way his decision was a push back against the concept that the the Bureau was basing this on which is a very old law and so the judge is saying look you relying on a law that's a couple hundred years old or whatever maybe instead we should be having this looked at in through the legislature and so there was a there's an interesting sort of legality to his his response to this but it definitely favored apple and and and and sure that's great let's legislate it but do you think that just maybe there are times when from an operational perspective you might want to move a little bit quicker then asking Congress to take up an issue and debate it and then maybe eventually come up so maybe occasionally you're gonna have moments like this the San Bernardino shooting where you've got a phone in your hand and all you're asking Apple to do is take possession of it and and who knows maybe their problem is they're worried that if they create this if at that moment someone's gonna steal it from them mmm one of their employees so maybe we got an internal security issue because then they can destroy the bureau's not asking for that phone back they're not asking for that sift they're not asking them for to do it on any other what is a sip he says systems information flow okay so you just force it onto that phone that bypasses the pass so essentially what the court has done is made a very conservative conservative interpretation of the law right and basically saying that this is musically this is a place where the court should be decided we believe you should be taking this to Congress and so therefore I don't see why you're legislating or asking us to make a decision on this see I understand the common person's perspective they don't trust the government the whole Edward Snowden thing like it makes thing everybody's freaking out about that and then they look at this saying well this is the slippery slope again this is the thing that if the government has access to your phone but we're talking about a fucking mass murderer and a guy who's already dead and we have one phone yeah yeah it's and and and so to say that you're going to only do a limited investigation even though you know you've got potential information right there's a way to do it like on an individual basis just one phone only that's what their ever that's what they're asking but can it be that you could never grant act I mean it's it doesn't make any sense to me well I wouldn't want to get access to that guy's fuckin data and here's where and I think going back to that overriding theme which is nothing resides in the center anymore you're right we do have to be concerned about privacy and I agree okay what happens if you Big Brother but there are times when you know operational concerns probably override at least an element of this where you a common PR reason two people can exist in the comment in the middle and say yeah on this occasion because you've gone through all these these orders and because we've set up this protection now meaning you know Apple holds on to it but you know it that's not the way it works and so therefore Apple comes out and says and then the misinformation ah they're trying to create a backdoor to all our Apple devices by the way what do you think Apple does with their devices that they sell in China you think the Chinese government would allow Apple someone got to talk about this in the media do you think the Chinese government would allow Apple to sell devices that they can't get into I we could ask [Music]
