David Sinclair lifespan why we age and why we don't have to I'm so happy there are people like you out there because I don't want to age I'm aging clearly but uh I'm not interested in it I don't like it yeah well I don't know anybody who does Joe Rogan thanks having me back on thanks for coming back the first one was a smash hit man people loved it all my friends were very excited but I had a question for you right off the bat regarding metformin there was actually an article I'm sure you saw it recently like within the last couple of days that was going around through all the mainstream papers it was talking about how for the use of metformin DHEA and was there something else as well that was taking two years human growth hormone taking two years to biological years off of people's lives in terms of their their age which are natural eight which actually I'm 52 it would make me 50 right even 49.54 yeah that was act 2 the good study you know it's only nine people so we have to repeat this will they studs did you get like nine super athletes or did you get like schmoes that don't exercise I as far as I know these were just regular Schmalz yeah which is good news like me yes good news yeah I mean that's what you want you don't want like some people just respond better they have super bodies you know look what great thing about that study is first of all I was with the first the main author on that paper while it came out I was over in Israel as part of my journey up the the great rift of Africa ended up in Israel anyway the guy there Steve Horvath is his name he and I and a couple of other guys are trying to figure out not just why we age why we don't have to but is aging truly reversible and that's what this study suggests is that it's not just about slowing down aging but one day we could be 80 but biologically 30 now when we're talking about the biological age how is that measured this is measured by the length of the telomeres is this measured physical performance is it mentioned by a combination of these factors it's none of that not something brand-new most people don't know about it so it's called the Horvath clock and what Horvath and others have discovered is that if you read the DNA and you don't just look at the letters ACTG if you look at what's on the letter see sizing is called there are chemical modifications and those chemicals change as we get older in very linear and predictable ways and if you use a computer ai you can say if I took your blood sample right now I could read your DNA look at those chemical groups on the C's and I could say you are ok 52 you might be 46 according to that clock and also I could predict when you're gonna die whoa scary thought right yeah like a fortune-teller yeah but the good news is well now that we know what's not just measuring aging we actually think that clock is part of the aging process we're learning how to reverse it - hmm now is this just one modality this this combination of growth hormone is this one way of going about it are there other ways of going about it growth hormone DHEA metformin is there anything else well that's the first that's a vengeance just those three things but I'm sure there's gonna be many more discovered we've only had this whole Dethklok over the last few years in humans being used widely but I think as we use this clock we're going to figure out that whole bunch of stuff that we do and things that we can do and combine will not just slow aging but reverse it and not just by two and a half years eventually and some of the technology that I talk about in my book we think could turn the clock back by a decade or more whoa now what things are you talking about that could possibly turn it back a decade or more well so the and who do I have to blow sorry yeah you can blow me but yeah you may have to do it a few times but the amazing thing about where we are now today with aging and we're right on the cutting edge so it's great to be able to share this with your listeners is this clock it's changed on the DNA right what I'm saying in my theory of of aging is that it's not the DNA that we lose that's the old theory you know the old idea that antioxidants hurt the Dean yes just throw that out for a while maybe forever what I think is going on is that the DNA is getting modified and the cell can't read the DNA the way it used to okay that's really important and so the clock is not just a clock it's not a clock on the wall it's also if you move the hands of the clock time changes that's what I think is going on could we pause right here for a moment and explain what you were saying about antioxidants well antioxidants have been the biggest disappointment in the aging field doesn't stop you know forty million people every day buying drinks with antioxidants in them but antioxidants have with very few exceptions failed to extend the life span of any organism but you are a proponent of resveratrol at least you used to be are you still I still take it and we still study it in my lab but what's you brought this up is really important resveratrol was originally thought to be an antioxidant and it is a mild antioxidant but the way it really works we know this is a fact from my lab is that it's stimulating the body's defenses against aging and disease because it's it's binding to these enzymes that we work on called sirtuins and these are the defenders of the body and you were saying the if I remember correctly you take resveratrol you take a powdered form actually bought exactly what you take and you mix it with yogurt in the morning is a how you do it yep what's the dose that you take well it probably comes out to about a gram in a gram yeah okay so if someone's taking capsules what depends if it probably capsules at 250 milligrams that'd be okay before yeah you know I'm still alive so that's its look good oh thank you do you um is it important to take it with fats is that why you take it with yogurt yeah yeah either high protein which is Greek yogurt surfaces or fat but water ill it's like brick dust it won't dissolve and absorbed but a glass of whole milk maybe would be okay yeah that's great it has to have something to bind to is that the deal for sure yeah in in our studies in humans and in mice if we didn't give them high-fat food it barely got in it was fivefold less now this study of metformin DHEA and human growth hormone does not include nmn right so but nmn is also effective well let's delve in a little bit please if you read the paper and I have turns out one of the effects of this treatment was the reduction in the levels of a protein called cd38 cd38 resides on immune cells and it goes up as we get older and what they found one of the biggest effects of the treatment was the levels of this city 30 a protein went down so what is the CD 38 this is the main enzyme in our bodies that degrades nad nad is required for the sore - and defenders to work so one possibility is that and I'm sure it's complicated but one way this could be working is by allowing your body to make nad and store it rather than degrading it as we get older interesting so would supplementing with nmn which is a form of nad correct a precursor yeah precursor would that enhance the effects do you believe like if they try to do a new study it could could it could potential each of these patients cost ten thousand dollars for the treatment so it's it's not easy to do these studies ten thousand dollars for the entirety of the treatment and the treatment lasts how long I don't remember how long they treated the patients for but I do know that it wasn't cheap that's why they only did nine because I've first I said to my friend Steve Horvath nine patients you kidding me why didn't you do fifty and I went well we didn't have the money that's the that's the plan anyway my point really is that we need to test a lot of different combinations include anim and include there's one called rapamycin which is a little bit more risky and toxic but there are better molecules in development the question is what is the best combination and do you use it with exercise and fasting or is it bad to combine them all together we don't know yet that's a good question to that I wanted to ask you because one of the things that came out of the podcast was input from some other people that I know that are nutrition experts and performance experts that were skeptical about metformin and they were saying that metformin although it may have an anti-aging effect it actually decreases physical performance and athletes well that there is a study that shows that and resveratrol to actually real can prevent the great gains from hard exercise so here's the solution that I think is worth trying a solution and that is a theme that I have in my book and in my research and that is we don't want to be doing everything every day necessarily we want to pulse it we want to shock the body and let it recover we know that you can't just exercise I mean some people have been on this show run 100 miles every every weekend but generally you want to hit it hard and let it recover here at hardly recover so what I am planning to do and actually started doing is on days that I'm exercising and recovering I don't take Matt Foreman and then when I'm just sitting around or on a plane I do and that way I think that my body can have the best of both worlds so when you are not exercising and you take it you feel like it doesn't have a hit when you are exercising and not taking it so it somehow or another whatever performance hit it has its temporary yeah right so well this is all just theoretical it is we're right on the cutting edge of human knowledge we don't actually know what the best thing is but my best guess is that we want to allow the body to recover so I don't take my Foreman on those days rather than taking metformin every day like a diabetic would mm-hmm now what are what is the what's that hit like what is happening what's the mechanism behind the performance hit from taking metformin oh we don't know but I can tell you the best explanation that I can give you somet Foreman is a derivative of a plant molecule the French lilac so it's not a crazy molecule it's pretty natural but what it does is many things in the body scientists will quite annoyingly argue about it for they have for the last 40 years so there's no correct answer but what I think is going on is that metformin is interfering with the mitochondrial mitochondria in the cell mitochondria that we call the battery packs they're basically making chemical energy without that chemical energy we'd be dead in about 20 seconds so we need that for life so metformin interrupts that energy production in the mitochondria but you need the mitochondria to amplify after you've exercised so they're they're antagonizing each other so why does metformin work by inhibiting the mitochondria the body gets a signal that it doesn't have enough chemical energy it's not making enough so it expands the number of mitochondria these are ancient remnants of bacteria that entered ourselves and we have less if we sit around and like we are now and we have more if we exercise in metformin by telling the body shit we're running out of energy the body responds it makes more mitochondria just like exercise does but I think if you're taking metformin and exercising that inhibition is preventing the benefits somehow of what you get with exercise perhaps preventing your house so like what what did the study or what studies have been done and what did they reveal I don't remember the precise details of the study it was it was giving metformin every day to people who were in a controlled exercise I think was treadmill a few times a week but then what they measured was the mitochondrial benefit now that and I think they measured a bit of strength so confusing that there's a Mitel mitochondrial benefit but a performance hit well no they actually the metformin prevented the mitochondria from amplifying up oh all right so then it must be interfering with the signal that you get from exercise whatever that is we don't know exactly what that is so you'd really have to be some sort of a guinea pig to try to fuck with this stuff to go back and forth from taking it and exercising not taking it yeah and I'm sorry I'm one of those guinea pigs yeah and what do you no disrespect but how hard are you working out not enough yeah I'm saying spend three hours a week in the gym that's not bad it's all in one day that's maintenance oh one day yeah really one day three hours yeah that's ridiculous that way cuz I miss Maura but you're so smart that drives me crazy when smart people do dumb shit like I had Peter Hotez on the podcast who's a brilliant man in from the University of Texas he's a researcher in tropical diseases and he's obsessed with diseases and the importance of vaccinations all these different things things talking about how his diet is terrible junk food it's constantly jackin the-box and shit I'm like what the fuck man you're so smart and you're a guy who works on diseases what's the number-one cause of diseases oh yeah I don't get that some of my clothes I ate the worst food and they studied longevity crazy it's crazy it's like they can't help their impulses it's like there's so many people like that that are obsessed with various aspects of health or performance but they just they just can't get it together well I would work out more if I had time I'm usually working till midnight and after that I'm not really you do have an excuse you have a crazy work schedule you do have an excuse yeah well I'm on planes Fitbit so I try to exercise on the planes pretty hard do you really want to do um you guys a trash room you know squats so no he thinks you're crazy yeah I've got a pee lottery doing blow in there or something yeah people think you're in there doing meth yeah doing something in there once yeah um so what do you do when you work out I lift weights for an hour then do a fair bit of stretching and then and then actually do some hot and cold treatment oh okay yeah you remember we did the cryotherapy last time yes yeah that was fantastic yeah you won't do it again today yes I do fantastic Amanda yeah no planning on doing it today I did hot yoga earlier so I like to do hot yoga in the morning and then cryo after a podcast that's how I like to mix it up all right let's do it all right I don't have a cryo handy at my place but I do the sauna and then cold tub and you should get a cryo setup they're not that expensive you get one what about these infrared boxes are they any good Oh first saunas I do not know but um some people swear by them Laird Hamilton who were talking about by the way huggers are coughing his Fantasticks my hand will tompa superfood coffee well we'll get you more Oh Jeff is going off to pick up our Pablo Escobar mugshot picture I'm obsessed with mug shots for some strange reason we can collecting new mug shot pictures we've got a giant Pablo Escobar it's very nice the Laird Hamilton stuff is that's got turmeric it's got a coconut milk it's organic coffee I'm so addicted to it I drink that stuff like water yeah I'm gonna have to get myself some yeah it's delicious he saw me he could just you don't need a machine either you can mix it yourself he has all the stuff you just pour it into coffee yeah I mean he's he's a hero of mine he's a stud he's 50 something there's a thousand years old guy runs mountains fucking surfs things hauls the Empire State Building he's a very interesting character the last I saw him I was watching something on Instagram I saw him in a sauna with oven mitts on riding a bike like one of those eco bikes like those rogue you know those aerosol bikes riding one of those fucking things in a sauna I was doing his sauna routine I did not like it I was cranking the song up to 220 degrees and I think I cooked my lungs a little bit not bad but people who listen to the podcasts afterwards my apologies because I was I was coughing like that for like four or five episodes and then I had decided okay this is fucking stupid like I don't think this is good for me right well you know hormesis yes what doesn't kill you make sure you live longer that's not exactly true booze booze doesn't kill you but it definitely doesn't make you live longer that is true have you drink how hard every night kills me yes if you look at two people one that drinks hard and their brother who drinks water and runs all the time boy that water drinking guy looks fucking fantastic doesn't he a comparison well yeah that's probably another one of my vices I gotta lay off the all goes yeah well how much do you drink I'd probably have one or two a day when I'm on vacation like you I overdo it I just got back from vacation it's my body's way out of shape yeah I get fat on vacation man last time I was on vacation I was doing this I was grabbing my size girl in Italy I went hard I was drinking wine ever I was drinking about a half a bottle of wine every night I was eating pasta all day long but I when I'm on vacation I just go fuck it and also it kind of gives me a little project when I come back you know like all right now it's time to get serious right right well look I was in Africa recently and I got to tell you one of the when you see a wildebeest get attacked and chewed on for forty five minutes by a crocodile nothing better than going back to the camp and having a beard or to calm down so I do a lot of that so when you were on safari how did you when when are you in one of those open jeep deals yeah a lot of that we did also some hiking we had Maasai leaders that would go out and with a federal officer with gun to protect us oh Christ oh it was fun it's so much so different than being in a jeep to walk among the cats oh yeah man you got a sure you're almost dead yeah it's like you're right there you feel like you're alive you know how you get the feeling of what it was like to be an early human I've never encountered anything other than bears in the woods that are terrifying I've never seen a mountain lion while like hunting I've only seen two mountain lines ever one was from my back porch in Colorado and one was in the street in Santa Barbara I was driving and I saw one run across the street right I didn't realize it was a mountain lion until I saw the tail it's like oh shit I thought it was a coyote or something and I saw that long tail but while hunting I've the only thing I've ever seen is a grizzly bear so our grizzly bear once I've seen black bears black bears are unnerving grizzly bears are terrifying they look at you like this you could shoot them and they'll still go they just look right through you they look like am i eating you what's going on with you I'm gonna eat you like they're trying to black bear so like oh should I get out of here should I run am I the boss or you the boss like they're not sure grizzly bears are fucking sure that the boss who's trying to figure out whether or not they should eat you right and actually one of the things you realize when you're amongst these animals it's a huge privilege for us to go for a walk without getting eaten yes yeah we don't think about it that way because we're so used to being in parks and oh I'm out in nature the fuck you are you're not really in nature here and some weird sort nature preserve that we've sort of set up inside cities right and people ask me about my work Oh isn't what you're doing unnatural fuck natural what about our weld is natural anyway brushing your teeth isn't naturally they're stupid right yeah what you born with a toothbrush in your hand shut up right right well blue over here what it at 30,000 feet drinking a cocktail surfing internet I know it's so natural that's natural you're getting bombarded by solar radiation yeah you're boozing it up you're also somehow or another online no way than anybody's ever gotta be able to explain to me that my puny brains can understand right yeah exactly well yeah don't give me the argument that aging is natural therefore it's acceptable lies I don't buy any of those natural things because everything on earth is natural even chemicals there is we're not getting them from the stars we're not pulling them out of other dimensions like what are you talking about it's all from Earth everything right even politicals most of them derived from plants sure in Africa is hanging out with but what tribe these are the pygmies they used to be in the forest and I had the chief take me through the forest and he was showing me all the drugs they used to take there's this cluster dean 'i'm i think i'm saying it right it was a leaf they used to chew on they'd smoke a bit of weed they'd go a little dizzy they'd crouch down after about 15 minutes they'd stand up and they felt invincible they'd go kill one of those elephants in the jungle Jesus he's killed elephants yeah many elephants oh the smaller elephants yeah but now that are smaller people right sold me out they can't except the worms the worms were about this long oh well my buddy Justin Ram we're a big supporter of fight for the Forgotten charity it's a charity that my friend Justin Ren set up and they build wells for the pygmies in Congo and through this application called the cash app and I personally don't need it too and we also were doing benefits for them we're doing a big benefit in LA coming up soon that'll be announcing soon but he goes over there all the time and he's had malaria three times and just recently has acquired some unknown parasite that is just devastating his health he's trying to figure out what it is so he's got to go through a battery of tests and they've got a you know examine him but the next time he goes over there apparently bring his own food but I mean the fucking poor guys got malaria three times yeah well you should be taking his medicine nor often I think but oh no it recurs does it really uh well it's it becomes systemic right it's horrific man and the way he describes it and he's a gorilla I mean a fucking gorilla he's a huge man he fights for Bellator he's one of their heavyweight contenders contenders so he's this you know 250 pounds stud of a guy who goes over there and catches he's horrific diseases and just like barely survives when it comes and gets the medication and comes back but then when he gets sick sometimes it'll kick back in again it's kicked back in there twice another reason you don't want to go back to natural way of life but you're a good man Joe for supporting the pygmies I was Justin is such a fucking angel when you you talk to him and you you see his documentaries that he's put out in his films that they've done with water for and now just with his organization fight for the Forgotten like he can't help but help help gosh I was in on the Ugandan side of the volcano Rift and the way they live was was just it was shocking and we're gonna help rebuild a school for them but they need help and they're right on the edge of civilization that the bat or tribe the pygmies are in the worse situation than anybody and they're they're the lowest of the low they're picked on racially they were kicked off their land yeah our to save the the gorillas and these elephants and they don't know what to do they've got they everything they knew how to live is gone and that crazy they're kicked off their land to save animals right yeah well yeah but there's note that there's no way out you got to do that well isn't there a way to not kill the animals and have them all coexist I guess you could have kept them in they were it's a national park so you can't easily have humans living in the National Park I suppose you could but they they are trying to modernize them so they put them on this small few acres of land which they're trying to learn how to farm and the way they subsist is through tourism so I would recommend anyone who's interested go see them support them buy a lot of stuff we I think we bought up a quarter of the village they love that but we're gonna go back and do something meaningful that's awesome that's awesome natural so we were taught we got wit off sidetrack so you were in Africa which is the most realistic environment if you want to really know what nature is all about you were in the most realistic environment it's all tooth Fang and claw it's like whatever survive survives and whatever doesn't becomes food and there's just this constant cycle going on and you're walking around yeah now when you walk it will you walking when you saw the crocodile eat the wildebeest no you're in the Jeep I was in the Jeep for that how does a jeep thing work why don't they just jump in the Jeep I don't understand that oh good question and I ask myself that as they're walking by uh-huh same with the gorillas that being habituated to humans they they literally don't even see the Jeep well the gorillas don't they're you know they're not aggressive unless they think you're a threat they don't eat meat they're just eaten plants all day yeah there's still pretty dangerous one swipe from a gorilla oh my god gray back with silverback yeah it's interesting that the jeeps have been around for so long they just go under the Jeep they're going to earth yeah yeah that it's as though that jeeps aren't there you might have six jeeps looking we saw some lines rip apart Impala right in front of us and they're just going about their daily lives you see it catch it just missed that we saw them running away whoo God if I saw them running in real life I'd shit my pants without running towards out camp so we were running the other way I heard a horrible story about these people that are on safari camp and this person went to use the bathroom in the middle of the night apparently you know there's cabins and you have to leave the cabin to go to the bathroom and the cats went in the bathroom and got them and drag them out the kiddin no that's the worst way to go yeah it's the hyenas you gotta watch out for because that'll actually eat you alive oh fuck yeah but the locals don't like the hyenas they don't have respect any animal that eats another animal while it's still screaming oh yeah they don't give a fuck they don't try to kill you they just eat yeah that wildebeest had a broken leg it got away from the Croc but it was it's it's bush meat at that point yeah but there were there were people in the Jeep some other Americans cheering it was like sport for them oh no I didn't appreciate fucking a man it was a solemn moment this animals gonna die and they're like oh yeah no chasing it must be men right uh it was mixed it was girls I'd be super concerned though I think it was a few but girls were cheering yeah fuck him I didn't know I think was the guys cheering but hard but they were chasing this poor animal it's Fulford being broken off and it was running on a broken leg and now chasing it the people are the the Jeep and the people in the back of the Jeep yeah my kids with me they were screaming and crying it was it was emotional I don't want to see that yeah yeah I I've never seen anything take anything out in the real world it's shocking you know you can see it on BBC or whatever as much as you want when you see it live my friend Johnny Hamilton he works at a ranch in Colorado shout-out to Johnny he was following the trail of this gigantic elk they had seen all these footsteps and then they'd seen mountain lion footsteps and then there was no more mountain lion footsteps and then they followed it about a hundred yards or so and they found the cat the cat on top of the elk it had jumped on the Elks back and killed the elk it's a hundred fifty pound cat a 900-pound elk a big bull and it just leaped up on its back and just yeah like and got ahold of its neck and dragged it to the ground but it rode it for like a hundred yards yeah the croc did this to to the wildebeest yeah so elephants are interesting we saw a lot of those and what we learnt was that their old elephants because they've run out of their teeth their teeth wear down and at some point they just can't chew anymore so they have to find really soft stuff eventually they die and that gives rise to this legend that there's this graveyard for elephants not a graveyard it's just where the soft food is but I was thinking if elephants had technology they could easily solve aging they just get dentures and yeah why can't we just tranq them and give them some implants yeah well they do it with people right and I think in the zoo they might do something like that no my ID might they do a dog bite III bill they're wearing out yeah I've seen that before with people it's cool it it made sense they gave my daughter's teeth and but I said to the dentist I know changing topic here but with it's funny I said to the dentist can you fix my teeth you just did my daughter they went oh no you're you're almost 50 we don't fix teeth at 50 excuse me do you feel like you're on your way out exactly yeah someone said that to me went in terms of meniscus I had a meniscus tear and they said well when you're younger you have more blood flow to your meniscus and we would just surgically repair it and hope it would fix or perhaps today you stem cells but most likely because of your age it's not gonna heal correctly and I'm like okay I'm confused cuz you're talking about blood flow like blood flow like what is happening that's different I don't I think this is like some old medicine nonsense like is blood not flowing I mean I well it's flowing and someone with your fitness is flowing probably as much as a 30 year old anyway I'm in better shape than I was when I was 30 I do more shit I do more running you know I'm like mom I got a lot of blood flowing around man I'm I think they compared you to sedentary people for sure they do that's the problem with most medicine is that it's tailored to the average person yeah we got to fix that it's got to be personalized tailored yeah measured I think if I wanted to go on safari like that like you did I'm have to make sure that I wasn't around any cheering assholes like that I got I would have to take some sort of a solo trip and not have to be heavily armed right and then wearing armor some sort of armor well so that wasn't Tanzania and a flamethrower yeah wearing that with me right right fuck those things man you ever see survivor man do you know survivors yeah sure yeah less is a great guy but he's committed to finding Bigfoot now that's always doing these days right yeah but anyway less did an episode where he did survivor man in Africa and the scenario he would create these fakes and arrows you know just man-made scenarios like what if you were in a hot air balloon and the hot air balloon got a hole in it and crash-landed in these lion infested territories so he literally did that that's inside in the basket so you had a few items in the back get and the the flamethrower for the for the hot air baloon with him to ward off the fucking lions so here he is it's nighttime in Africa and by the way he self films everything you know the reason why they came out with that other show with that who's that other dude the other dude that that got busted like sleeping in the Holiday Inn he got just cook he was going to the yeah Bear Grylls he was going to the Four Seasons at night it's like this is how you could do it but I'm not gonna do it he would show you how to do you could sleep in an igloo but meanwhile he'd fucking he was getting room service and eating steaks and shit yeah that's why I did but Les Stroud really does it I mean he brings a series of cameras so this is him and last went and he saw that it pretends the thing crash-landed so this is his scenario that he's created for himself but the reality is he really is surrounded by lions and so he has a limited amount of propane and he would fire out look at look look look he would fire up that thing which is what you use to get in the hot air balloon and scare the shit out of lions so through the night here the fucking zebras and shit so he'd hear it in the middle of the night and you have to fire that thing up to see everybody the fuck away and then after an hour so they fuck time to fire it up again and so he was out there sleeping in this basket trying yeah so crazy he's so crazy and he would also do these things where he would have virtually no food for seven eight days you know and just really just get super super skinny and almost starved to death that's the opposite of being in a Jeep he's got like a bottle of water I got a pocket knife I got some rope like this is how you do it I got a stick what is that oh so I'm sort of a machete type thing fucking crazy yeah we we went up in a balloon which was beautiful by the way it's fun isn't it I did that in Italy recently Wow yes anyone who's afraid of heights don't worry it's beautiful but we had a truck underneath us with people with guns just in case that happened oh that's good yeah so there's people yeah oh there's a whole industry in keeping people alive that want to do stupid shit yeah right you can imagine oh sorry the Serengeti burnt down yet with some kind of balloon how many different right how many days did you go there for we traveled for 16 days I took my whole family marlott brother his kids how old is the kids two nephews and my kids are 16 14 12 perfect age for this and the they don't recommend you being under a certain age if you're gonna take malaria medication right they'll did whoops really I don't I don't I think 12 might be okay if I think it's like under 10 or something like that well they's you know the stuff is heavy-duty like did it fuck with you did you have crazy nightmares I took the one that doesn't give you nightmares but my other siblings had that my father came so he's 80 and that was actually the reason we went his 80th birthday present oh wow that's cool what a cool present 16 days it was it was awesome we went Kenya Tanzania Uganda what did you like best Tanzania is supposed to be gorgeous yeah Serengeti well it was all good I really liked hanging out with the with human beings too they're interesting species all for sure yeah I enjoy humans yeah I saw was the origins journey I called it and so he went to we started in Olduvai Gorge which is where humans the the original fossils were found going back a few million years Wow and started there and then just went through looking at the various animals we saw the gorillas and we ended up few days ago I was in Jerusalem looking at where we come oh wow a real origins tour yeah up there I think that's exciting wow that is so cool so what was the most unusual thing besides Jerusalem is that the most unusual thing that's the most insane thing where all the religions are on top of each other touching rocks and blessing is spring and humans are crazy they'll worship anything well I'm sure you've seen I was in Germany once and were there for a UFC and I was flipping through the channels of the television and there was this live feed from Mecca and this was pre Instagram I was not on Instagram I would definitely would have because watched it for hours I just sat there in my room drinking a cocktail with my feet up watching this these people circle around this what is that square shaped thing in the center of Mecca yeah it was a religious object that I believe I think says something to do with an asteroid like there's a piece of some find out that makes sense this is important to people but the the watching people circle they're all wearing the religious garb this Islamic garb that they have to wear and they're all circling around this thing like for hours and hours and hours I'm like it's oddly appealing like part of you wants to go I recognize that there's got to be a very strong sense of unity and community and everybody agreeing that we are all going to treat this this is a sacred object this is a sacred place we're gonna wear sacred clothes we're all gonna follow this this path and this and we're all gonna be together in this like this like super reinforced sense of community that's actually ordained by God himself well we all need that feeling for me of science and the fossils that I and my colleagues believe with the origins everyone needs an origin story here it is how would you say that kabaah kabah it's built around a sacred black stone a meteorite that the Muslims believe was placed by Abraham and Ismail Ishmael in the corner of the Kaaba a symbol of God's covenant with Abraham and Ishmael and by extension with the Muslim community itself hmm okay yeah that this so it is it is actually a meteorite which how incredible right like a little bit of science and a little bit of religion all wrapped up together there's a discovery so this this is what it looks like so you're watching this the channel that I was watching in Germany again this is probably like more than 10 years ago 12 years ago perhaps and watching this circle around this like religious spot it was very very captivating yeah the one that I remember from I think was Jerusalem yeah was people touching the stone where the crucifix was thought to be and there would line up for hours to just touch it for a few seconds meanwhile you know the origin of humans the fossils there's maybe two or three people hanging out no one really cares admittedly it is out of the way it's not in the middle of Middle East but still it struck me that humans are more focused on these icons of religion rather than where I believe we really came from Africa yeah I mean if you look at it and you see it you touch it you feel it it's the only sensible explanation I mean you can still have religion that's fine but you know don't tell me those fossils were put there by somebody no I mean obviously not but it's it is that the idea that a human being came from some lower hominid which came originally from a shrew is so so hard to follow like if you go all the way back to 65 million years ago to the asteroid hitting the Yucatan and you're like wait what happened okay yeah big rock smashed killed everything except like these little rodent things and they just eventually evolved yeah but that's what I love about science it's amazing it's not only amazing it's actually true yeah we can prove it yeah me musically you could really follow the fossil record that's one of the funny things and when people go oh what about the missing link there's missing there's holes in the fossil record well these holes in your education just got holes mean they got to Australia Pittacus explaining Australia Pythias extreme explain explain the various other human beings you know explain explain homo florensis explain the Neanderthal explain all these different there's a whole slew of different fucking things that were human like what was that God's experiments was God fucking around yes I was like let's try to make them super short and why and thick and heavy like a five foot seven 200-pound person that's way stronger than a person to add those are no good listen let's get a taller skinnier one but with bigger brains uh-huh right and let's have them breathe that's what we did let's bang them yeah everybody bang I don't know if it was marriage or rape but something happened I think most rape the most breeding was rape until about like 500 years ago I agree with you do you know that to this day there's a country is it Kurdistan what is the the country that 20% of all marriages beginning kidnapping no so there's a shame to the the female being kidnapped she ultimately has to marry her captor not find out that is it Kurdistan Kurt Kyrgyzstan I'm not saying it yeah how do you say that Kyrgyzstan her good and I think it's Kyrgyzstan yeah one in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage in Kyrgyzstan how fucking crazy this is 2019 religion yeah shame but the fact that you could kidnap someone rape them and then they get shamed into marrying you well I was shocked in Jerusalem I'm gonna probably have a lot of hate mail for saying this but it's a fact that when you go to the Wailing Wall as I didn't put little note in the wall which was a great experience by the way there there is a space for men and women they're separated but the space for men is four or five times bigger than the one for women good yeah it's all this disparity anyway so so as a similar amount of women that are going to this wall and they're just kamd into a smaller area yeah still 2019 is this some ordained is there some sort of a religious yeah the Orthodox it is parently behind that I checked it out so there's there's an actual scripture that says men are supposed to have this oh I doubt that so it's just ancient sexism well yeah and even the wall is just tradition yeah but anyway the history of humankind is interesting and I did that this wall right there was all the black spots that's like holes grass that's like plant material I think is it yeah yeah yeah that plants growing out of the wall well oh it is okay they're not black we're just looking at low resolution that's the women's side that's the men's side do you remember the scene in what is the World War Z when all those zombies climb up the wall they pile on top of each other like uh do you see World War Z no fuckin great movie I gotta say there's a crazy scene it's a Brad Pitt zombie movie or although all the zombies pile up on top of each other and make it to the top of the wall you got it James gonna pull it up huh so they get to the wall and look at these fucking zombie people are climbing up yeah oh yeah oh it's it's pretty gnarly man you've never seen this movie I've wanted to does the novel's are supposed to be excellent weren't the novels written by some famous guys son who's who wrote them now but this is a great scene like see they're all piling on top of each other and they're they're just reckless they they have no concern for their health or well-being because they're you know look they're dead so they're just making this human thing and then the soldiers are shooting into the pile trying to knock them down but they get over the top of the wall and they start infecting people that's pretty wild ass movie yeah who wrote that movie it's a wild movie man this is well it's one of those zombie movies where the zombies move fast there's slow zombie movies which come on man like that's why Walking Dead like I feel like you could fuck those things up I mean they can only last so long they don't move fast like how are they surviving they're just kind of like shuffling towards you I feel like if you just have a big sword you can just start hacking away yeah so there are zombies cells in the body and I that segue because people are gonna say why the hell aren't we talking about aging no we will okay we're here forever max Brooks the son of Mel Brooks aha there you go shout-out to Max Brooks and Mel Brooks sorry aging well we don't have to zombie cells yeah so what are they I'll be done talking about Africa and your trip oh sure cuz it's pretty exciting uh well it's your show too thank you when you're on it you're a pisode uh well somebody else I reckon everybody go to Africa not just to come back a different person a better human being but also to support them they really need our help over there when you were in the area where the oldest human like fossils were found what's the feeling like when you're in this area like you you really are where the origins of humankind are from I mean there's got to be a pretty profound feeling yeah it was spiritual unfortunately that the people who drove us they were saying hurry hurry you have to go see some zebras this is more important than the zebras but these are the people that are the guides yeah yeah they don't know what was important to us fair enough but I would have loved to have spent whole day there they apparently there are still fossils sticking out of the walls of the core really yeah so the reason that it's a view allowed to do anything with them I don't know what happens if you find a fossil yes it can University and you just like shut the fuck up well actually I I probably shouldn't confess this on don't live me don't do it bro tell me later it's not so bad okay you can actually find a whole bunch of stuff in Africa that's interesting if you look down rather than out and my oldest daughter our oldest daughter Alex she looked out she's a scientist and so she 16 year old scientist she found a whole bunch of stone tools whoa not there not not in Olduvai Gorge that sacred but you know just out on the Serengeti or wherever did you get them analyzed not yet they've recently found stone tools in the United States that they've brought back to 16,000 years ago the oldest known stone tools of any human being and it's sort of there they're slowly but surely pushing back the dates of human civilization in America and one of the more recent discoveries with stone tools that are from 16,000 years ago so people had made their way over here or here it is about this yeah so you never saw it I don't know if you saw it yet they said it there's I don't know if they have video of it but they said they saw this monkey sharpening that stone before it was actually breaking the glass with it glass was sharpened stone impressive Prison Break attempt man fuck keeping monkeys in a cage that drives me so crazy I I hate it I went I took a pot edible once but a real wrong one and I went to the zoo it was so depressing staring at the chimps I've sat across and watched the chimp caged I'm like oh my god these things are in hell yeah they just imprison even keeping little birds in cage okay just like this yeah but the monkeys are waiting for us right there wailing Wow they had some some type of monkey it was in a smaller cage than the chimps and was just wailing Wow just in hell yeah it is it's brutal actually that the the stone tools are interesting because again getting to what's natural what's natural for primates is to change their environment to take tools too yes so what we did what we're doing genetic genetic engineering well I want say engineering but we're using genetically just and why we are the agent why we don't have to it is natural of course that's what we do all of even all of science is natural you could even argue that an iPhone in your pocket is natural sure humans have created it they exist all over the world right I've argued that the cities are natural it's a completely normal thing for humans to do to create cities to say that cities are unnatural well why are they everywhere and why are human beings mango I st. beehives are unnatural to write clothes yeah unnatural well animal habitat I mean animals like beavers create beaver dens and they're they're very uniform they're real similar everywhere they go exactly yeah yeah the other day someone said humans tamed fire 500,000 years ago and I said that can't be true 500,000 years ago that's not too long ago I checked it out it's true and these weren't even humans these or pre human I think it was probably one of the two species back we've been doing this we didn't change the environment using tools using fire for that long the fire when it's crazy right because it's not just manipulating a physical thing it's changing the state right you're you're doing something whether it's with flint and stun you know some something to spark and some tinder you're really creating changing the state of matter well we are and will continue to do that will continue to evolve and one of the that the reasons that I wanted to see human origins is in my book I talked about we've evolved to our natural lifespan we're now at a maximum 122 is the longest lived human that ostensibly is on record the so without intervention we've reached our maximum but why not now give us what evolution failed to give us why can't we be like other species that are at the top of their game are there any factors when you look at the oldest people that are alive are there any common factors actually not really that they do seem to have a collection of gene variants that predispose them to get to that long there's one called Fox o3 that if you've done your genome we can ever look 23andme they've done it I have we should look at it I just tell you you need an A or a T at a certain position I've got one of them out of two my kids got two of my kids out of three have both so they if they look after themselves might have a better chance of living longer but anyway these long live people they tend to live a long time no matter what they do often they smoke till ninety years old really yeah they quit at ninety there's a few cases of that and they live another 12 years right right for 22 years right you said 122 years old that's one one lady in France but one of my friends here's his name is Nero Barzilai he was with me in Israel he's got a story of when he asked the centenarian lady lady that lived over 100 that he knew why didn't you quit smoking and she said oh oh four doctors I went to told me to quit smoking and they've all died so I go that's hilarious what did she do for a living John Coleman I forget the French lady I don't remember what she did I would imagine that would play a part like how stressful your occupation is and yes she had a great sense of humor that was probably part of it I used to make jokes with her reporters all the time one was a how many wrinkles do you have she says I've only got one and I'm sitting on it big the the other one I think is even better as a reporter who was young said you know you're 116 I hope I see you next year for your birthday she says I don't see why not you seem pretty healthy to me Wow and she made it to 122 now if there been any anecdotal reports of that live longer well Methuselah and biblically know yeah but not biblical like no I not unsubstantiated reports because I had heard of there's some people that claim to have lived like ridiculously long but they've never really figured out whether or not it's accurate sure there's there's a few of those but even even Jon comment at 2122 there's a big argument now between us researchers whether that's even true oh really yeah it's a massive debate I've got an inbox full of long angry emails from scientists what's the evidence point to the contrary that - so the the hypothesis is that she her identity was subsumed by her daughter to avoid paying taxes and there's photos of them and there's a blotch on one photo that matches the daughter so there's a lot of forensics going on and people want to subdue the grave and the French government's not or French researchers aren't giving up the blood samples they don't they don't want to know so it's probably horseshit well probably like a hundred years it could it could be bullshit I would say it doesn't actually matter goddamn French it doesn't matter people have lived 117 and that's still pretty good that's what we know you know if it's in the Rican Oliver live that long who's gonna complain wouldn't you like to get one of them old old old old old people and start doing work on them yeah just pump him up with nad get him on a drip well my dad's remaining on himself so he's not even hundred yet but he's 80 how's he look well I wouldn't say he looked young but his fitness is like a thirty year old and really he's stronger than me we tested out in the gym the other no way that's embarrassing he can lift more he's fitter we're going across the Serengeti and he was leading the charge if you saw him if you didn't see his face cuz he's got grey hair and whatever physically he put a bag on his head you just you'd say his thirty the way he moves people vary where to put a bag in your dad's head yeah I shouldn't do that sorry dad but you think he's thirty really well he's he's reinvigorated in life so you know in my family we've got some Ashkenazi bad genes we tend to die young and my grandmother died my grandmother is actually only 15 years older than my dad and she died a few years ago last 10 years of her life horrible so we know what's gonna happen in my family probably to all of us so your mom your grandmother had your father when she was fifteen years old right whoa yeah back in the early days of World War two she apparently was playing around with her boyfriend she claims to be a virgin but at that point what something got somewhere that shouldn't have and she suppose during high school right so I was raised by my grandmother she was in her 40s when I was a kid and she was the one that taught me to always stay young keep your you know adults ruin everything that's probably why I work on aging adults ruin everything well how was her advice like in terms of like why how do you avoid what adults are doing wrong well you know she she'd grown up during the Depression and then World War two and then the Communists came into Hungary and raped it a lot of people she had no she had had no respect for Humanity so by the time I came along first of all she put all of our energy into to me and I'm I was a spot bride as a kid so that that was wasn't helpful to me I think now as an adult but more importantly she wanted me to do the best I could with my life she said David do what you can to make this world a better place make sure that you leave this place better than you found it and that's what I'm trying to do wow what a pro founded piece of advice for a grandchild she was a rebel she taught me forget the rules right kind of like you do I'm going my own way and we'll see how this goes she so she went to Australia she said fuck Europe I'm outta here she went to Australia the furthest place she could find from Europe never went back she went on Bondi Beach in Sydney in a bikini which was rebellious notice she got taken off the beach pipe by the police would you have to wear back then are the full little British thing deep dandy nice what it down to your knees I think so did they look like maybe it was a full one-piece but hard to show your belly that's what I think but she was a rebel she went to New Guinea by herself in the 60s what year was this where she was wearing a bikini that would be t6u couldn't wear a bikini in the 50s Wow well okay like those pinup girls right when you see them they always had one-piece suits on like a yeah so imagine you Guinea in the 60s as a woman on a run up in the highlands she claims to have eaten human flesh and she spent most of the time drunk as well did you see that article that was yesterday where they were interviewing an Australian a guy who was a doctor or scientist who's talking about climate change and he was saying that we have to start eating human bodies and that human bodies are very nutritious and that we just put them in the ground and it I was reading it I was like okay it's this guy trolling like what is what is he doing here is he a completely insane person but his advice was our dependence on meat is ruining like in some places where they're you know they're stripping the rainforests to make room for cattle grazing he was saying that we are getting rid of perfectly good meat every time we put someone in the ground well we are but but to suggest that it sounds insane to me yeah because it was we throw away half our food anyway at least in this country it was a mainstream publication but this guy was talking much like the last thing you want to encourage is people getting used to eating people he's been watching World War Z maybe yeah I mean it's just one of those like come on I was I was going is this guy just trying to get attention like this seems like such a or is it did he was he joking and it's hard to tell in text you know yeah well yeah not every Australian is sensible I'm the article but I don't see anything about him saying wasting human body is there meat there's been of more than several articles written on it maybe someone extrapolated but the idea was he was saying that people should eat meat and if they want to eat meat they should eat human because well maybe waste animal rights activists might be just an idiot ate your relatives yeah yeah but just last thing you want is people getting the taste of people you know right no do not need to go that far not yet speaking of the food supply one of the things people worry about if we all live longer is we're gonna run out of food and run out of space yeah and one of the things I address in the book is what really will happen if you do the calculations if you look at human history that is not going to happen I'm of the strong belief that we can engineer our way out of just about any problem probably the only thing we can't engineer our way out of is if we get hit by a five-mile wide Meteor right but everything else I think we're gonna be you think climate change we're gonna be able to engineer our way out well I don't that we can stop climate change at this point it's definitely happening you can see it all around but will it wipe us out no it will it cost us trillions of dollars yeah and so I I don't think it's gonna be the end of us but it's going to be a challenge to to continue to survive and and proliferate as a species in the face of all of those costly things and that's the biggest problem of climate change besides species losses the expense in Europe there's only certain amount of human capital that we have to spend and we call that money and that's one of the reasons that I'm excited about extending people's health and lifespan is that that'll save tens of trillions in the club each year and that's money that can be put to combating global warming saving species besides you know wonderful people who donate their their earnings as well but really to solve the big problems in on the planet one of them is to solve what we can do with all the frail elderly people that are coming run every year more and more make them productive like my father he could be in a nursing home like his mother was whereas now he's hiking in the jungles looking at watching gorillas with these five grandkids how cool is that that's pretty cool no what kind of protocols here are pretty much the same as me although he does more exercise so it's a combination of nmn metformin and resveratrol and what kind of exercise I'm not sure if he's protocol we're going to post that on on social media once we're sure Eden but I know it involves a fair amount of aerobic exercise he does rowing and and walking up stairs so he managed to climb I think it was 40 stairs in 1540 flights of stairs in 15 minutes which for an 80 year old was was quite a 40 flights of stairs and 15 minutes holy shit yeah the guy's a phenomenon what what has happened though is that his outlook on life has changed he was depressed not not just because he was fearful of getting old and my mother was sick at the time but now he's looking forward to another 10 years of vigorous life traveling and it you know when you're healthy you're happy so when he was depressed was he sedentary no no he was depressed because he was worried about his health he figured he's gonna be like all these other friends getting frail can't can't walk losing your mind and it hasn't happened to him so he just a few years ago he went back and started a new career whoa oh we talked about this last time I believe what what's his new career again he's on a committee that evaluates clinical trials for ethics Wow which is what you want older people to do use their wisdom and knowledge to excited about something as well right something that stimulates you and keeps you going and gives you something to be interested in and talk about wasting human flesh what a waste it is for someone with that knowledge to die prematurely right that's the more interesting thing to me about longevity is look I'm so much wiser at 52 than I was at 42 I just am I make less mistakes I'm more aware just across the board and I'm wiser at 42 than it was at 32 and at 22 I was basically a chimp so it's like as time goes on you understand how you're interfacing with the world you you communicate with people better you know how to get by you know what you have to do and what the consequences are of not doing what you have to do in terms of being disciplined and being healthy and just meditation and making sure you you you understand the consequences also of not doing the work that you're supposed to do in terms of like the way you feel about yourself your self-respect and the way you just feel about like your sense of self-satisfaction it's it to me takes a big hit when I'm lazy takes a big hit when I don't get things done and I don't expect everybody to do the same things that I do or have the same sort of work ethic or didn't uh need now I don't say work ethics that implies like some sort of superiority it's more of just the idea of what you want to accomplish like your tasks everyone has their own idea of what but if you enjoy doing something and you're working toward something I feel like there's more purpose to life you have more satisfaction in accomplishing tasks and that's one of the things that's been highlighted when you read books on happiness and studies on happiness one of the things it seems to be most important is goal setting goal setting working towards those goals and achieving progress that these are critical components to happiness for human beings and without them with is this aimless sort of drifting of life people for the most part obviously everyone's different but for the most part people don't find satisfaction and just an aimless sort of drifting existence yeah 100% I'm I just turned fifty while I was over in Africa oh just before that you know imagine being 80 and healthy that like my dad ninety or hundred yes of course I'm so less stressed than I was in my 20s and 30s and anyone who's listening who's in their 20s and thinks that they're you know way better than a 50 year old I can tell you from experience like you Joe when I was in my 20s I thought I knew everything or at least I I looked at myself as as a fifty year old and I thought what an old fart yes yeah it's not like that at all especially with today's you know health and you know 50 or older just like they were like a 30 year old was you know 52 year olds like me when I was 20 they didn't exist maybe Jack LaLanne right well that it's be talked about a thing was in The New Yorker that this movie cocoon I don't know if everyone's seen it but it's a it's a pretty interesting movie where these 50 60 or were given the Fountain of Youth and they still look old but it was really supposed to be quite funny to see these older people with gray hair jumping in the pool and acting 30 years old but a 50 year old isn't old anymore 50 year olds just getting going yeah that's crazy about it you know I mean if you see old movie stars from like the 1960s when they were like 50 they looked like they were dead men you know like we were we were looking at I forget what the movie was but it was a movie where I was like how old was he when they made that movie and turned out he was 44 I'm like that guy looks a hundred years old looks like he's never worked out he probably smoked cigarettes all day long never exercises never it drinks constantly this looks like a dead man it's crazy right so in the future 90 will 90 will feel like 50 info well we were talking about Laird earlier and Laird I think is 55 years old and just as fucking fit as a human being can be and he's doing crazy shit where he's he's got this whole exercise routine that he does inside the pool where he brings like 70 pound dumbbells and he carries it with one arm and swims across the pool and the other you know he does two-handed dumbbell things the bottom of the pool and leaps this surface catches a breath of air drops back down to the bottom again leaps the surface why is carrying these dumbbells I mean just ruthless rigorous exercise at 55 years old well there'll be a time when you can't really tell how old somebody is especially when we figure out how to reprogram the body to be young again yeah and it's gonna be such such a great world when people with 80 years of experience can continue to run companies and be teachers and educate the young people now that there's a bias though against the elderly we've always had this in society and we have to overcome that my dentist was biased against me as a 50 didn't want to fix your teeth you're dead bro I'm not fixed no way the money screw it I'll pay for it just do it so it says a 20 minute argument do it do 20 minutes it was a lot in fact the time ran out and she said fine I'll do one tooth just to check because she was had all these reasons why she shouldn't do it'll break off I have to polish back your original teeth and I said look I'm not gonna get angry if it doesn't work just just try it and she did it first of all she said I have to eat crow after it and then my wife came a week later and she said man your husband's a pain in the ass but he's on to something and actually she's offering this as a service now to people our age yeah she's trying to make money I guess it hasn't cracked off and I'm pretty happy with teeth if it does fix it again right why not yeah that's everything and we should do live yeah but here's the problem with with some aspects of medicine when we're young we don't get the medicines that will prevent us getting sick when we're old yeah so drugs like metformin you're not gonna give to a twenty thirty year old right but when you get old you don't get the medicines that they give the young then everyone should be treated equally in my view as long as we know it's safe for sure oh you know there's the cost but some of these treatments like metformin that's probably less than a dollar a day a cup of coffee and might extend your lifespan where you got a cup of coffee for a buck I get free coffee from here haven't Laird Hamilton super food machine like coffees even more expensive than that yeah it's some the the limited idea of what you should or shouldn't do to fix people as they get older my friend God is ACL torn and he's 60 and they said his doctor recommended he just rehab it and don't get it fixed what the fuck are you talking about get it fixed man you want to have a bum knee that just buckles on you all the time go get it fixed six months later it'd be done like you'll go through the rehab otherwise six months later you still have a shitty knee it's like your your call man but I just get it fixed bite the bullet go fix it right but his doctor was like where come on Bruce come on Bruce let's be honest we're we're at the end of the movie know what 20 anymore yeah yeah that's that limited tank limited thinking is so frustrating to me yeah I first encountered this when I was 29 actually I reckon you at 29 it's a wrap they well they were I don't know actually this is the problem with the other end of the spectrum which is I was too young to get a medicine that could help me when I get older oh wow was cholesterol medicine the statins and my doctor said why do you want to get on this drug I know you've got high cholesterol but you're only 29 and come on and I said look why wait till I get the disease to treat it but you know now people use statins more but in those days and statins very controversial though they are they apparently have a huge health hit well I haven't noticed and I've high cholesterol and I think it's worth it but yeah if there's nothing else wrong with you you wouldn't take them but do you have arterial plaque no not yet I'm perfectly clean right but shouldn't isn't but isn't there some there's there's doctors that are arguing that the idea of high cholesterol the higher its LDL HDL with it's good cholesterol bad cholesterol that's like this sort of uniform approach people with high cholesterol need to take something that lowers their cholesterol and you know doctors that I've talked to are saying well not necessarily at all it you could be incredibly healthy especially if you're not sedentary with with relatively high cholesterol if everything balances itself out if you have the appropriate ratio of HDL to LDL right do you have the appropriate ratio or is it out of whack now I do but when I was 29 I was off the charts right I had a blood that looked more like cream and that's where one of the things apparently where dietary cholesterol does make a hit it does have an effect on people with genetic predisposition to high cholesterol in certain ways right is that correct right yeah right but changing my diet had a big impact as well what did you do to different that was different I went more well I ate less I lost weight that helped do you do intermittent fasting yeah as much as I can one of the other guys that was on this tour of Israel with me is Valter Longo and he's the arguably the world's expert on this what a great name isn't it he's an Italian guy Walter lungo Longo yeah like the coffee guy Colin when you got a real problem yeah yeah well he's uh he's written a book and he is the probably world's expert in human periodic fasting his but everyone who wants to know about what the best periodic fasting protocol is there isn't one we don't know yet we're right on the cusp there haven't been enough studies but there are a few types I go through them in my book so because oh we won't have time to go through all of it but there's the what is it the 18 18 hours yeah is it going if you can go skip breakfast have a late lunch that's a good start that's what I try to do every day it's not always possible like when you're in Africa and they're feeding you massive meals three times a day but the that's what you wanted to be hungry for part of the day or you can go a little more extreme and skip two days and what's that what's the benefit of being hungry great question and this is what my lab and others figured out in a year - you know first few years of the 21st century we figured out that these genes that extend lifespan these sirtuin genes are activated by being hungry in part by raising nad levels which you we any men will mimic the effect of so being hungry actually raises your lifespan in some sort of way right so caloric restriction is what we used to talk about a lot if you restrict the calories of a rat wasn't actually discovered back in the early 20th century we'll make them live up to 30% longer not in an old state but it prevents them getting old so the rats don't get cancer heart disease and all of these other good things and that was the only thing that we knew up until about twenty years ago even ten probably and so we used to think you I'd be had to be hungry all the time and there was a still is a society called the calorie restriction Society and they were hungry all the time that very small meals which is pretty tough I tried that and gave up after a week but this new paradigm is that you don't have to always be hungry similar to you don't always have to be on a treadmill you can do it for a short time make it intense and then you can let your body recover and go back to a normal life for a little bit and that's great news that means that we can have the L cake and eat it too so to speak as long as the cake doesn't have a lot of sugar in it now when you are on this protocol of restricted eating plus metformin when do you take what and when do you exercise and how do you balance it out like what when do you know what to do what oh I use my body as a guide you know now that I'm fifty I have a pretty good like you you know you know how your body feels and reacts I'm also measuring it a ring that that matches my pulse in my sleep is that the aura yeah yeah I spelled that a oh you oh you are a yep that isn't Kevin Rose a part of that company is that is that it yeah Jamie says yeah okay from dig you know dig calm you don't know dig no how dare you sorry it's a good place to go find cool shit okay okay dig calm shout out to dig yeah I go there every day because real interesting stories on the Internet you're always finding cool weird videos and just fascinating science stories human nature human interest stories sounds good I have a watch what kind of watch you're using the Apple watch okay how does that measure by the way they just really set up a watch five today Oh apparently it's better you might want to get it was it do what is though Apple watch - yeah how's it well I change your songs and in my head tells the time occasionally but yeah what's useful with it is a pulse and activity mm-hm and if I haven't moved enough during the day I've got a standing desk and that's been helpful to make move around a little bit more but mainly it's a no seduce occasional blood test to make sure that my body's optimized as best I can personalized and usually all those measures you read the data off your watch like how do you read it what what application are you using nothing special just on my phone have a look okay so you just have a look like what your resting heart rate is how much activity how far you're walking how many calories you're burning that kind of deal yeah yeah pretty simple and I'm happy to say my resting heart rates really low which means you know things are going okay so far for me even though I don't do enough exercise as you rightly point out I think my resting heart rates 46 that's very good it's pretty amazing for a guy that barely does exercise yeah you must have good genetics well obviously do your dad's in phenomenal shape at 80 ah no we have terrible genetics oh well how's he in such great shape at 80 well we don't know but but it could be that he's been exercising and he's also been on this paradigm so one of the the effects in mice at least of an MN which is what we're taking is improved blood flow you get the benefits of exercise without having to exercise yeah if your mouse and those mice they're running on a treadmill for 50% further because the blood flow and the lactate was reduced really so maybe that's happening that's incredible now what is the difference between the effects of nmn and IV nad which is very popular there's people that take IV nad and I've never done it but we've talked about doing it many times and having it brought in here and sometimes people do it and they do it very quickly well you do it it only takes 10 minutes but it hurts like hell apparently it gives you like stomach knots and you feel terrible right all right it's not done it I haven't admitted publicly that I've done it do it but I but I try everything once love that microphone I try everything once yeah and so last time I was out here in LA I gave it a gave it a shot so to speak yeah how was it uh it was fine it was fine now let's get to the science in a minute but what I found was so was a shot in the butt with Heidi so why didn't they do it intravenously I thought that was the move they did intramuscularly right right this doctor is experimenting oh yeah it was it was a friend of a friend so I had a there I got an idea came here yeah but here's the thing it felt I had tingles in my legs I felt a little different for a few minutes maybe 10 minutes and they don't went away hmm but the science we don't know yet we're still trying to figure out if that actually works or not so instead I'm taking the molecule that we've studied in my lab which has taken as a pill now there are a lot of people that swear by the IV version of nad and when they do it intravenously apparently you feel phenomenal and there's quite a few people I know my friend Kyle Kingsburg has done it several times and he's very big on the latest and the greatest of health crazes well I know it's being used widely especially down in Florida to treat it action nad interesting IV and I get emails all the time which is best but you know I'm a scientist I'm at Harvard Medical School so I have to always be based on facts and the fact is we don't know if it works yet right anecdotes are anecdotes my father's story it's not a clinical trial right we need to do more but what's interesting about this field is that because people have access to information through podcasts like yours and through the internet now that papers you can go to what's called PubMed Central and find papers people are educating themselves just like scientists used to and they can go to the doctor or go to the Internet and try experiments on themselves now I don't condone that I can't I'm a researcher not a doctor but I find it really interesting that were in a new phase of society where people can learn more in many cases than the doctors actually not sure in particular when it comes to nutrition because that's one of the things that I found it's shocking when you talk to some doctors and you talked to them about nutrition particularly supplementation and they'll say things like well you can get everything from a good diet Mike can you really can you really like how much time did you spend school motherfucker like how much time did you study nutrition this is nonsense talk you can get everything from a good die what's your good diet tell me what a good diet is what are you getting from that good diet how you getting that vitamin b12 and high doses what do you get where are you getting your C where are you getting your d3 what are you what are you getting huh what are you getting your essential fatty acids what's the what's a optimal level of essential fatty acids and they don't have a fucking clue they're talking about you know they don't they there's so many doctors that go through their entire medical you know in fourth exogenous or what have you they go through their entire medical school with like maybe four or five hours of nutrition research right I have to be careful what I say I work at the medical school but I do love doctors don't get me wrong all right we need them but we we're not going to do surgery on ourselves right that said some doctors will listen to their patients and do research those are the great doctors that actually stay on top of things but it's really hard right they're already working 12 14 hours a day so let's you're fair to doctors plus they have to work within the insurance system I understand that there was their only problem that I have is when they say things like you get everything you need with a good dog you remember our three square meals a day yeah bullshit make sure you follow the food pyramid and eat a lot of grain right right remember that well and don't eat eggs don't drink milk awareness yeah eight margarine yeah hilarious what milk is a sketchy thing yeah quite honestly because you're drinking this dead liquid it's been homogenized pasteurized and I find my body reacts very differently to raw milk than it does to milk that has been processed well you I wonder if anyone studied the microbiome that might be helpful to but just makes sense that it's got all the enzymes in it it's all that's how the human being or a body any any animals supposed to naturally process that milk yeah I guess it's mostly sterile yeah but yeah I use whole milk in my day it's surprising right because I'm I'm trying to avoid calories but the benefits in a taste and how I feel that yogurt I make myself out of whole milk that you make yogurt yeah what are you a wild man why don't you buy it you're so short on time what are you doing making be making your own butter - you got one them Turner's yeah well you know we all have our hobbies one of my hobbies no he's the problem I got so hooked on this type of yogurt which I first made for my son trying to help him he has a weight and eating issue I was thinking that would help him but I got addicted to the yogurt and so is everyone in my family now so if I don't make the yogurt they're like dad where's the yogurt oh no kid and so how do you do it oh it's really easy that you get packets there's three different packets you rip em open put them in whole milk shake it and stick it in the the oven on defrost for 24 hours really on the in the oven so what is defrost like what temperature's out of 35 Celsius whatever that is a 91 Zen 90 95 so you're using like a Dutch oven or something like that that's regular ah yeah I mean but I mean in terms of the pan that you put Oh what you mean what's the bottle yes that's just a large mason jar okay and just heating it up with the probiotics inside of it your bacteria inside it it just starts to coalesce yeah and I affected the first few ones were were not great but now it works every time and actually the protocol on the internet said you have to boil it measure the temperature to get it all right sterilize it and I just pour it straight in shake it stick it in it's fine really yeah so far huh did you ever get it analyzed no you're a scientist you want to send it a little cup of it to somebody go hey man take a look at this hey what are you worried about I don't know I'm not worried area I'm not worried at all I'm just curious as to whether like how potent it is you know there's various levels of you know acidophilus that you're getting from from yogurt yeah I researched it before I started and this is a company that makes a yogurt that it that matches a healthy microbiome mmm nearly what I'm aware of that's great and you use whole milk you don't use raw milk right but I didn't have good access to raw milk where'd he get it like Oh health food store like sprouts or you know something like that yeah I think they have it at erawan maybe Whole Foods has it it's a it's really tricky because you it's not even legal in some places to have whole milk in fact people been arrested and and just locked up for having whole milk yes Google that because it's pretty preposterous when you think about how easy it is to buy whiskey right and then think about people buying whole milk that whole milk is apparently for some people I mean it might have just something to do with skirting FDA regulations and yeah things along those lines it gets very complicated for sure and then those are the reason for homogenous ation and pasteurization is obviously health right we're trying to protect people in also its shelf-life it stays on the Shelf longer mm-hmm but I've definitely bought it yeah there's a small what does it call it a small group food group raw food club they had they were raided in 2011 mm-hmm for sharing raw milk or something the latest raw milk raid an attack on food freedom federal agents organized a sting operation against a tiny raw milk buying Club and ignore more serious food safety concerns yeah like Twinkies I mean how hard is it look you can i'm sure get food poisoning from spoiled milk right but isn't spoiled milk yogurt ultimately right well here's what i do with food if it stinks i don't eat it good move bro yeah i think milk you smell pretty quickly if it's going bad this involved unwashed room-temperature eggs the other count unwashed room-temperature eggs a storage method Rossum members prefer by the way when we had chickens for these nasty coyotes killed all my chickens we would store our eggs at room temperature we put him in a bowl we would wash the outside of the egg and put him in a bowl and they would sit on the counter and I was eating them all day long nothing happened healthiest fuck agents dumped gallons of raw milk and filled a large flat bed with the seized food including coconuts we seized your fucking coconuts watermelons and frozen buffalo meat what the fuck like what is this agents who are these assholes that are getting paid government money from our taxes to steal frozen frozen meat jesus christ christopher darden who helped prosecute oj simpson appeared at Stuart's arraignment just in time to lower his bail alright so Christopher Gardens out there helping people whatever gross just to grow I mean I don't think you should you know we should somehow or another find out whether there's a way to test if this raw milk is fresh enough for people to eat but if it is people live on farms have been drinking raw milk since the beginning of time it's normal and healthy it tastes better it's it's way easier for you to digest like I get a little weird when I drink like straight like if I have milk and cookies which I love um I don't know what me it's a cookie so milk hmm I might be full of shit here now I'm thinking about it the cookies might be what's messing with my stomach I don't think so though cuz you get this feeling from the milk like the bull it's probably both another thing about it's both well in France you get the the unpasteurized cheese yes my friend jean-marc used to bring it back in his luggage he would smuggle back for a rock lot you know what that is yeah it's like a dish that he would make with meat and cheese yeah that's good but I don't hear the French dying in droves they seem to be healthy as fuck and then I was fat right yeah their bread is better they have bread that is not from their there they don't have modern wheat so the wheat that they have is not engineered to have more complex glutens and and higher yield like we do so we don't vibrate in my family my wife makes it oh nice yeah and so weird oh yeah a lot of sourdough the yeast is even wild she got that from Belgium a friend of ours hunger hung some semi is what is it some some stuff in a tree collected the yeast brought it back to the US and really shared it with us caught it like caught some yeast well he put some dough wet dough up in a tree and left it there for a few days and caught this wild yeast up in there well Jim forest or apparently it only occurs he he claims but we have the best bread at home it's crunchy you know you thought you break it open I mean I'm trying to avoid carbs and this is the hardest thing when you get home and the breads just come out of the oven and why are you avoiding carbs ah well I'm trying to keep my blood glucose levels steady not spiked too much that's pretty clear that that's not healthy and just eating a bunch of braids will be a good way to spike that one of the things that I've heard about the French and the Italians in general is that they eat their bread with either butter or olive oil and that these healthy fats that you're getting along with the bread is one of the reasons why it doesn't have the same sort of health hit and then just the complex glutens you know the the engineered week that we have it when you eat pasta in Italy it has a different effect on your body just feels different yeah exactly so there are number of people that I know maybe people you know to who are putting glucose monitors on their arm here mm-hmm to see what foods they react to Radha Patrick's been doing this for a while and actually I asked her what what about what's the worst food you've seen in your body to spike glucose she said grapes avoid grapes really yeah avoid Gramps yeah I wish I had an Alistar that so now more counterintuitive right you think you're eating healthy when you have me some fruit as I said what was the biggest surprise she said potatoes on so bad well there's a thing that you could do with potatoes right where you boil them and then cool them off and then reheat them and apparently has a profound effect on the way it impacts your blood sugar levels that it's far healthier when you there's some sort of process see if you could find out what that process was who explained that to us do you remember was it Rhonda probably was 99% of my nutrition knowledge I get from Rhonda Packer Patrick but I believe it's something to do with the way the potato reacts to being boiled and then chilled and then reheated again there's something about it so the starches are less yeah a label somehow somehow and it has a much more healthy effect on your blood glucose levels and doesn't spike you in the way that just a straight-up baked potato would this would be coming from Chris crecer aha even that's the other 1% of my nutrition knowledge it's probably not even spry like 60/40 potatoes for gut health and weight loss the potato hack says the potato intervention of the short-term tool to check the reactivity of the gut to resistant starch reset the hedonic system create metabolic flexibility resolve inflammatory conditions and provide the patient with an empowerment tool to increase the fat loss of their dietary plan it's not meant as a standalone diet but rather a dietary tool to decrease hunger blah-blah-blah-blah-blah scroll up there so we could find out what the fuck the potato hack is explanation poor potato has been maligned did here's an explanation functional medicine Chris crasher on the Joe Rogan show ha right here that scroll up magic of this plan release its clinical effect efficacy is the amount of resistant starch resistant starch as a type of starts that is indigestible to us but feeds our microbiome on a potato is heated and then cooled a significant amount of its starch is retrograded into resistant starch this means that the effect on blood sugar is greatly dampened the potato can be even be reheated and it will still retain its resistant starch content the nourishment to our gut biome and the subsequent metabolic benefits cannot be overstated I've seen this be crucial in some patients who have stalled on a low carb or keto eating plan but still have significant body fat left to lose historically resistant starch would have been present in most roots tubers unripe bananas plantains etc but is often devoid in our current diets mm-hmm Chris crasher in the house yeah well you go so what when I was in Africa you reminded me they eat a lot of blueberries and so these colored foods are also good to eat so resveratrol comes on when yams dark things right well yeah leafy visuals but also fruits that are very colored colorful so why why is that why is a well I'm glad you asked the so we have this idea called Xena or hormesis and that's a terrible name for something that's quite simple and that is that these molecules from plants are produced to make the plants healthier these are stress response chemicals and with your stress plants they turn colored turn on a UV lamp or put a plant in a Sun it'll turn reddish you know mm-hmm those are stressful chemicals to survive and I believe that we've evolved to sense those chemicals in our food supply oh so we're attracted to juicy red tomatoes or as opposed to pale Tomatoes well not just a flavor to it I think we're attracted to it because they're colorful but what our bodies get out of it is that these chemicals go into our bloodstream and they turn on our defenses against disease and to survive why is that good why did that evolve or potentially evolve it's I think because when our food supply was stressed we need to get ready for adversity because we probably run out of food and if you're a bird or some other dumb animal dumb or animal or even a yeast cell how you gonna know if your food supply is gonna run out you've got it know it chemically so these chemicals are our heads up that adversity is coming so if you eat a lot of these chemicals through say red wine which is stressed grapes and other things like that blueberries these chemicals they're not probably not working mainly through antioxidant activity they're giving us this stress heads-up isn't there there's that's a controversial thing the red wine thing correct like whether or not red wine the the actual compound of resveratrol is where we're getting our benefit from because it's apparently a very small amount of resveratrol and what red wine yeah sure it's not really controversial except when people exaggerate and say that it's all resveratrol resveratrol is a component of dozens of healthy molecules in red wine quercetin which is good for a number of things there's a whole bunch of polyphenols they called and so resveratrol is part of that cocktail was a fermentation process because we're talking about grapes themselves with the high sugar content actually being something we should avoid right so don't eat the grapes but but wine if you don't have too much of it will have a concentrated amount of these xeno hermetic molecules like resveratrol and corseted is this a parent in red wine it's really only in red wine white wines just for chicks right not as healthy actually looks right that's a joke for my friend bud yeah you'll get in trouble everyone no it's just for my friend bud he loves white wine I'm like that's for chicks bro I'm joking folks just jokes don't get it touchy yeah so you don't need to so that when we treated mice with resveratrol they were immune to the effect of high-fat diet Western diet and we've traced this down to a single genetic pathway that we work on these sirtuins I talked about these nad responsive pathways really so they were immune to eating shitty food like the negative aspects of eating shitty food yeah that this was 2003 that's why it hit all the newspapers because it was the first molecule that was safe and could mimic the effects of fasting or caloric restriction without actually having to be hungry Wow and what kind of dose are you giving these mice it was the equivalent of about 250 milligrams a day in a human okay so is 1/4 of what you recommend people take right I don't recommend people take anything but okay what you take right let's just say that yeah I don't recommendation sorry folks yeah I'm taking a higher dose because I've looked at human clinical data and I think that a higher dose may be required to have an even better effect on longevity but the the results are very clear when we opened up these mice maybe I shouldn't have said that when we examined those mice carefully uh put them to put them to sleep for scientific purposes it was clear that they they were healthier now they were still fat that was interesting that was still fat so we figured the experiment didn't work but their arteries were clean their livers were like a healthy lean young Mouse and when we looked at their metabolism it was like a younger Mouse so let me ask you this then because you're you take statins if you are fairly convinced because the research of the positive benefits of resveratrol in healthy aging and healthy metabolism and their arteries why you take in statins because you know that there are some negative effects of statins right well if I had five lifetimes I'd probably try that experiment okay I don't want to you just don't want to risk it yeah is there enough I mean have you looked through the papers the the research papers on statins and a little bit there is some correlations with dementia and the brain does need cholesterol so that that might be one of the problems is your dad on statins yes really we have a whole bunch of genes that predispose 23 mate said basically give up now Wow it's pretty horrible so yeah if I make it to 80 I'm doing pretty well Dean interesting cuz um Bourdain when he was alive he had made a decision to take statins versus change his diet this is before he got into Jitsu when he was traveling the world and eating the finest foods and drinking wine to excess every night and join the shit out of it you know we had a conversation about it's like I would rather eat well said I'd rather eat well and take these drugs because I know the side effects another dangerous so then we have a conversation maybe two years later he gets really energy to his wife at the time was into jiu-jitsu and you know she had convinced him to try it and he went and tried it and immediately got hooked and he has or he had a addictive background you know first was heroin and you know some other unfortunate substances and then you know cigarettes for a while he quit that and then jiu-jitsu became his new addiction and he got ripped I mean he really at I think he started training at 58 or 59 he started and then by the time he was 62 you know like a full six-pack it was crazy to see like I'm like look at you man this is nuts like there's an image of him walking down the street and I mean he has no shirt on and he's fucking shredded got off all the statins got off everything has changed his whole his issue with cholesterol yeah good on him just through daily exercise yeah I should try oh yeah yeah a little bit of shame that I haven't been able to get off the statins but they just scare me man I've just read too many things well you know I could have gone off them when I was on a really lean diet I tried this Okinawa diet from Okinawa okay now yeah so just fish mostly in and and tofu mmm yeah how'd it go I was great but then I had kids oh you can't feed tofu the kids everyday right you can't have separate food just for yourself not gonna know I understand yeah well you're yeah that's the thing is like you're so limited by time you know you're such an involved research schedule and life schedule and travel schedule I'm a pretty average guy I'm not militant about what I I try my best every day data to do what I can but they statin thing I just haven't had the chance to do it but resveratrol I don't think is sufficient to keep these cholesterol levels down so combination so far when you first got on the how long you'd be on statins since 29 oh wow so you really have been on them for 21 years not only that's super high dose so he's eighty milligrams what's a normal dose ten huh that's crazy yeah my doctor one of the best at Harvard looked at my genetics and said you're fucked Wow yeah I've got all the wrong genes these tiny little lipoprotein particles the ones that oxidize so the fact that my arteries apparently cleaners is good good news for me well that's good news like I said look good no thanks I mean obviously there's a lot of biodiversity when it comes to human beings and some things that are bad for others yeah good for some well I'm not losing my mind yet it's still pretty functional when it starts slipping away what you gonna do ask your wife or your friends or what you gonna do yeah what am I gonna do what your dad's want to tell you yeah that could have walk right he's 85 so yeah my never changing diapers yeah David you asked me the same question three times in a row the way it's going that could definitely happen well do you get a lot of sleep I do now now that I'm wondering it yeah what's a lot of sleep for you between 6 & 7 hours oh that's good dr. Matthew Walker was a guy that I had on my podcast who studies sleep and he was fascinating and it changed my entire opinion about what's necessary there's a direct correlation between limited amounts of sleep and Alzheimer's direct correlation he's like it's one of the most established links that you can see between a disease and a cause I'm yes quoting it's an association I mean I always wonder you know I'm a scientist always have to be skeptical sure as to whether if you're predisposed Alzheimer's you have trouble sleeping oh and you start taking ambien now people say well ambien and Alzheimer's are correlated well yeah that maybe it's the other way around yeah a me and scares the shit out of me you don't take that do tiny bits Oh that stuff's nuts because people take it and they say things they don't know what they're saying right well the recommended dose at least it used to be for men is 10 milligrams which is massive i nibble on I take maybe a milligram just to nod off if I'm desperate with jet lag hmm but yeah I peek doctor as many I know say the 10 milligrams is probably too high but check with your doctor yeah well Matthew Walker says stay the fuck away from that stuff period he said you're not getting real sleep anyway you're not going in through full sleep cycles you're just drugging your brain into a state of unconsciousness probably with 10 milligrams that make sense for me because I'm monitoring it I know that I'm getting good deep sleep have you tried other like melatonin things along those lines I sure sure not effective uh not as much sometimes melatonin with milligram of ambien is necessary but what a big change for me has been just don't stay up watching TV get the screens off with your glasses they really help yeah the screens watching those goddamn screens before you go to bed I love doing it though I love watching TV show before I go to sleep it's probably the worst time to do it though right yeah it is it really uh I mean you can watch the shows just put the yellow glasses on oh you know the lue light-emitting yeah blocking glasses one of my sponsors movement watches they have they have blue light-emitting glasses need to get those on blocking or emitting block blocking blue like blocking yeah yeah not emitting how kind of glass I meant you know blocking blue light emitting signals yeah well you can have blue light-emitting glasses - that'd be good really well for the middle of winter oh we're getting depressed yeah well where you live has no real middle of winter here buddy why you said you used to live - yeah 95 escaped yeah it's it's pretty tragic I mean like winter I want to kill myself so it's that seasonal affective disorder sure yeah yeah yeah because I'm working indoors at CSUN for months well that gray sky when it's every day is gray over and over again you see no real sky for so long it's so weird it yeah I miss Australia for that reason mmm I get reinvigorated if I come out to LA and it's blue sky you really feel different oh for sure there's a reason why this is a fucking billion people out here but what is your strategy for mitigating the impact of seasonal affective disorder what I do I try to go outdoors and get some some Sun in my eyes when I can take vitamin D I'll for sure very different I seem so help make a difference yeah yeah so yeah vitamin D it's it's questionable whether it's as healthy as people thought it was that said I think it at worst doesn't hurt you some people do Sun lamps for that reason they'll go into a tanning booth for their reason right they will actually found this season I went to the sauna in the cold shock bath and that really helped a lot I don't know if it's related but I needed to shock my body in the middle of winter if you're just sitting by a fire and barely moving around I just felt like it was a sack of shit and so you know a lot of people get fat in the winter too that's another thing they just they get indoors because it sucks outside and they never wind up doing anything and then you dealing you're dealing with the depression of being a little bit heavier to officer and then you drinking like kind of stuff but it's all about shock your body get your body out of complacency and our lifestyle everything we do everything we buy everything on TV that's being advertised to make your life better is shortening your lifespan by making it easier for our bodies to exist you don't want that you gonna stress it yeah what other things do you think that people should be doing on a daily basis that most folks aren't well we covered a lot so there's the the be hungry get the exercise there's all sorts of exercise which are good but the main ones are stretching in and running and lifting okay cold and hot we've talked about and then there's the supplements that mimic the benefits of those plus probably more things that's my that's my regimen there's some other little tidbits that I put in my book which it's a laundry list of things that I found work for me but those are the main things we've covered this is Alan's probably pretty boring but I'll say it again wear sunscreen for two reasons I mean you look better anyway not that probably young people care but it'll make a difference by the time you're our age but also because DNA damage does age you we think that it's breaking the chromosomes and that's the major driver of aging that son will do that x-rays will do that maybe even airport scanners certainly I'm not a real a devotee of getting scanned I thought there were radio waves are the millimeter and they don't penetrate very deeply so they're probably not too bad but I've looked into it's about the same radiation as you get on the flight and given that I'm doing probably a million miles a year I don't want to double the amount of exposure so when you go through that radio scanner then the more modern TSA scanners they give you the same amount of radiation as a flight because a flight gives you the same amount of radiation as multiple x-rays right is it that I don't think is that bad I believe it is well let's find out how much radiation do you get on a five-hour flight and is it comparable to multiple x-rays because I believe that's what I read well the x-rays I can say definitively based on our research would aid you age your tissues and what's it doing to you well it's breaking your chromosome and causing that clock that I was talking about earlier that biological clock to accelerate is there something you can do to mitigate that if you know you have to get an x-ray should you do something right afterwards potentially potentially you could take in a man which we've shown in male in mice protect them against the effects of radiation and that's one of the things we've talked to NASA about for getting to Mars and back safely so when I'm on a flight I take so many men in the expectation that it's gonna boost my body's ability to prevent those changes to the clock now is there a commercially available MN that you would suggest if someone wants to purchase it somewhere well so I don't divulge company names and there's two reasons for that one is I haven't tested them so I actually literally don't know but the other is that um you know I want to stay above the fray and I understand not yet involved but it but there are if people want to go google and go look online they can find commercially available nmn right so yeah again I've got number of pages in the book on that so it's it's all laid out but in summary this all right here ladies and gentlemen look at life span why we age and why we don't have to thanks Jeff that's my NPR voice yeah you can donate if you enjoy programming like this putting me to sleep that's made a vamp he's something happened with people they thought to be intelligent you have to talk like you're ready to put people to sleep it's time to get sleepy anyway so the enamine yeah so there were people who's selling it on the internet just just to get the facts straight I don't sell anything I understand my name's all over the Internet if you see my name with a company it's be us uh-huh beautiful that's good anyway so the nmn there are companies that sell it's more expensive than another molecule that's related called n R or nicotinamide Rui beside which is also what the body can use to boost energy levels and that's a little bit cheaper and they've both been shown in animals to be to boost the sirtuins and help those animals be healthier in old age and reverse some aspects of aging like endurance loss of endurance that kind of thing protect the eye protect the hearing as well so that we don't know if it works in humans that let's be honest I don't know if these things work but let's also be honest we know what's gonna happen if we don't do anything and that's not pretty either do you have any high hopes for things like CRISPR things where there's going to be genetic alterations and they are starting to do some experience you have a big smile on your face right now so I'll let you talk tell me what's up well so I'm a geneticist and I'm just down the hall from George Church he's in my department at Harvard and I'm a big believer in CRISPR in the sense that it will revolutionize medicine now right now explain it to people who don't know which means so CRISPR is an acronym for basically a system that is from bacteria that they use to kill and destroy the DNA of invading organisms like a virus but we can now use that system to cut and change our own genomes it's basically a DNA cutting enzyme that doesn't cut randomly you can give it a barcode in the form of what's called RNA molecule that tells where that enzyme will cut in the genome let's say you Joe Rogan have a terrible gene that's causing heart disease we take this CRISPR system we say here's where you need to go to cut we can tell the enzyme to go and cut it put it into your cells it'll go cut it and destroy that enzyme and delete it and you can also use it to cut the genome and insert new pieces so you can both subtract and add DNA at will now not just randomly but what's important is you can tell it where to go and that's the big breakthrough and they're doing some experiments on human beings I know there was something that they were doing believes but somewhere in Asia if I remember correctly I believe was China where they had done some manipulation to people to help prevent AIDS and in the process of doing so they may have boosted intelligence or the potential for intelligence which was so convoluted that my puny little brain can't understand the study I was just I had to go over the same paragraph like four or five times just try to figure out what the fuck they were saying am I making any sense yeah you are you are and that was a study that that I don't believe it's been published but it's been reported right that he is his name his last name is he he took embryos and engineered them to delete ccr5 gene which is required for HIV to infect cells now that was we can we most of us scientists think that that was reckless for the fact that first of all HIV isn't a huge risk in China to one in a thousand chance of getting HIV there are plenty other things other things they that you could do that could be more helpful let's say why not mutate what's called PS k9 to prevent heart disease which would probably have 50% to kill the boys a boy so anyway it wasn't the most risk benefit ratio modification that that's one thing but the other is we don't know what happens when you cut genes in embryos does it have changes to the DNA clock did it accelerate their aging did it mess with other genes did it cut in other places and screw up those genes we don't know that yet and so that's why the scientific community had a negative reaction to it but what's interesting is that the scientific community and the press has pretty much gone quiet on this imagine if this happened during the Bush era we we'd have protesters all over the place and be outlawed and that hasn't happened and I think it's because we live in a world with a 24-hour news cycle though but isn't that also because it's being if it wasn't during the bush world I mean where the protests would really take place if it was done here the thing about things that are done China or overseas like huh it's like it's so far away like wow let's keep an eye on them yeah that's true there is the fear that that some countries gonna engineer an army of Solomons I mean know we have the technology to do that right now yeah we believe we understand how to slow aging there are genes that predispose you to too long life we could make offspring a family that would potentially live a lot longer but it's just something that can only be manipulated in embryos or in fetuses nor now we can do it in adults actually there's there's a there are drugs that are in development to actually correct genetic diseases such as vision loss really do my eyes are gone I can barely read like print on a laptop i I need glasses to read my laptop alright so so we just put up a study online on a site called bio walk I have anyone can go there and see it just google my name and bio archive VI o R X IV reason that's interesting is that what we're showing is in mice at least we can reverse the age of the retina and restore the vision of old mice what do I have to do well I think you have to blow me a few more today come on man well lose your job let you gotta let me crack those kind of jokes sorry Howard I was joking I started it folks yeah it's not his fault but so what would someone I mean is this gonna be available to the general public anytime in our lifetime I hustling my best we're hoping to do clinical trials starting in two years from now really and what would you do in those clinical trials also we'd reprogram the AI to be young again so we now know that there's a set of genes called reprogramming factors also known as Yamanaka factors that are from named after this Japanese fellow who won the Nobel Prize in 2012 these factors are used all over the world even probably in high schools to reprogram skin cells other cells to be what we call pluripotent stem cells these are cells that can be used to make new organs or new blood cells mm-hmm but what people hadn't tried until recently was can you do this in a living animal or a just gonna mess it up and what we found out is that if you do it the wrong way you mess up the animal and it'll die but what we've shown for the first time in this paper is you can do it in a safe way and not only that reverse the clock make the cells young and restore how they work and get back vision and what's the methodology right good question so that the the current method is using a virus that's on the market these are called a AVS at denno associated viruses you put them in the eye there are already patients getting this in on the market really yes SPARC therapeutics is an example of a company that is curing genetic diseases in the eye with viruses we're in a new world most people don't know about it Wow so what is the company again Jamie we have this spark genetic enemies already got it look at that BAM motherfucker Jamie Vernon in the house so these folks are already doing this to people so is this for people that are sort of desperate and they'll try something experimental right well they're desperate in the sense that there's no other choice no other cure I mean we're now curing genetic diseases someone was just treated and cured of sickle cell anemia that's phenomenal and that you know I learned that that comes from malaria right that was the idea that people were the resistance to malaria it was that trait from people that evolved in the area where they would get malaria was also what led to people getting sickle cell correct correct so that I learned that from Tiffany Haddish by the way amazing Tiffany shoutout to Tiffany that Lux turn of stuff is this something that someone like me could take right now no not easily your doctor would need to prescribe it and so if he did prescribe it I could literally get vision back well this is not the same technology that I'm talking about it from my lenses inherited retinal diseases our commitment to our IR DS this is gene replacement not not reprogramming the body to be young but it's the same virus that we'd use to correct so they're using this for certain retinal diseases or they're correcting it now how is this bacteria fixing your vision well the viruses are just our age to get the genes into the cells that's all and that these are benign viruses they don't hurt you but they're a carrier and it may be eventually we'll have other ways to do this but right now the virus is the best way and in the mice to restore the vision we have this three gene combination of these Yamanaka reprogramming genes we put them into the eye and then we turn them on with a drug in fact the same drug that I took when I was in Africa called doxycycline is the same drug we can feed to the mice turns on the reprogramming genes for a few weeks restores their vision back to a young Mouse and then we just take away the doctor cyclin an antibiotic and the mice have their vision back and how long does it take for it starts deteriorating we don't know yet but a longer it's permanent because the age of the cells has gone back those are young eyes again so you might have a whole full cycle from like 20 or 10 to 40 years old again that's the future that you'll get a delivery of this virus you'll take the antibiotic for a few weeks be fully rejuvenated and the doctor says come back in a couple of decades we'll fix you again we'll give you some antibiotic in a couple of decades but then it gets really weird if you have a if you engineer your children to have the system if that ever happens let's imagine it could we could do this right now with technology and you have people engineered to be able to be reversed in their age or let's say they have an accident and their optic nerve gets damaged or they lose the hearing from a bomb or something that spinal injury give him a dose of an IV of antibiotics and they become just like an embryo they can rejuvenate they can regrow the optic nerve regrow their spine fixed back back like new the the vision thing do you think that we're gonna see that in our lifetimes I mean is this something that you're gonna see that's gonna be available to the general public well so so I've got I'm an entrepreneur as we discussed before and also one of the companies that I've started is exactly that raised money to be able to make this virus we're making it now takes a few million bucks and will hopefully with the FDA's approval injected into people's eyes now first it won't just be guys like you first of all we have to go into an area where it's FDA approval which is a disease like glaucoma which is pressure in the eye or macular degeneration that's our first goal but then if it's safe why not do old eyes what about people with injuries yeah well yeah you could theoretically put it into the spinal cord or give it give an IV but people with eye injuries oh for sure it's so one of the things we also did in this paper that we've put online is we pinched the optic nerve and what normally happens is it just degrades I mean nerves don't go back right unless you're a baby mouse or a baby human but we made those cells so young that the optic nerve grew back to the brain Wow first time that's been able I know a guy from fighting he's got a detached retina detached so bad that his vision and his right eyes extremely poor shout out to Michael Bisping do you think that that's something that inside of his lifetime they could see something the use of this technology that could regenerate his eye well you know I get a lot of email so I'm not really trying to over promise anything what I what I think is possible is that initially will be used for disease a chronic disease then it'll be used for injuries like like that but fresh injuries I think it's probably to work better if it's fresh hmm I don't know where this technology is going I can imagine a lot we can all imagine that you could get vision back and people walking again but that's where this technology is going we only but so I described the discovery in the book as actually what happened while I was writing the book is were making these discoveries and they were remarkable and so we wrote them down in the book as we went along so people can see how it feels to be a scientist to make these discoveries but it's only been a year or less that we've known about this so imagine 50 years from now what we can do even ten it's gonna be a remarkable future it's very exciting now what kind of a timeline are you anticipating for bringing this to you know people with injuries well injuries already we have a study plan for spinal injury in mice and that we'll probably know the results in less than a year and then we could you know as fast as the FDA allows us go into a clinical trial now is the same scenario applicable for people with spinal spinal injuries as vision like people that have a more recent spinal injury will be more likely candidates than people that have had older spinal injuries I think so that would just be my guess that it's easier to fix a recent recently damaged system anything in the body that's fresh but I wouldn't rule out anything when we when we first discovered this the experiment was to have a fresh injury the pinching of the optic nerve but then I said to my student why don't you just try old mice and he said come on old mice you kidding me how's that gonna work just try it just try it so he did it and in collaboration with another lab at Harvard so that they're the experts and so bruce cassandra is his name so Bruce called me professor at Harvard it's 10:30 at night I just got off a plane he said David you won't believe it I didn't believe it I just looked at the data it frickin worked old mice is sing again he said I want to go down to the FDA and tell them about it because right now I diseases typically all you can do is slow them down and he is actually a reversal of lost function now this apply to injuries as well do you believe old injuries or just old macular degeneration we haven't tried old injuries but now Michael we've done glaucoma which is an old injury okay so theoretically what we could do is at least with the existing nodes if they're still attached we should be able to rejuvenate those and make them work better because he has some vision in his eye so yeah so that's possible that that makes more sense but very little very limited in what I yeah well we'll have to see interesting because you didn't think I was gonna work on the old mice I did but he jested Wow crazy well we're literally reversing not just the effects of aging but aging itself so if I gave you those retinas very little retinas here you go John and you're a scientist you could look at that retina and analyze it molecularly measure its clock and you'd say those a young young eyes and you wouldn't know the difference now do you feel like this kind of technology is also going to be applied to people's skin because you know one of the things that for women it's devastating when they develop wrinkles you know they fucking hate it men get a few wrinkles they kind of look distinguished you know but man when women get wrinkles they freak the fuck out they don't like it yeah we're gonna try it on on aging on the skin though you know when I talk about making people walk again potentially mm-hmm it's probably a higher prayer oh for sure but I think it's feasible so there's a lab at the Salk Institute Juan Carlos Belmonte who may win the Nobel Prize for his work on this in 2016 and a couple of years since he's been showing that it doesn't just rejuvenate old mice it actually is also rejuvenating the skin if he puts it on a wound that's in an old mouse that Mouse would hit will heal better now that doesn't prove wrinkles but it does prove the skin can be rejuvenated as well so there could be possibly some sort of a treatment into skin maybe a reinjure in you there's this thing that they do I think it's called a vampire facial have you ever heard of that they take platelet-rich plasma and then they micro needle your entire face and then they somehow or another apply this platelet-rich plasma to the areas that have been micro needled and it has some sort of an effect and increasing collagen and elasticity of the skin and tightening of the skin have you heard of this I've heard it for hair loss I didn't realize people get it all over their face for hair loss is while they're doing that it sounds painful so to me it makes sense that it might work the plate the PRP is as it's called is full of factors that we we we know some of these are rejuvenating in mice you know this the system where you can hook up an old mouse and a young mouse circulation yes and you get rejuvenation there are factors that many of which we haven't discovered or identified that exists that you can rejuvenate and I would bet that they're working most likely through this reversal of the clock and so one of the things we're doing in my lab is taking what are called exosomes which exist in these preparations and seeing if they reverse the clock I've had exosomes shot into injuries for stem-cell procedures yes yes did work that make sense yeah I had a full length rotator cuff tear that's completely gone yes so maybe what's going on is you're free programs your body there yes well there's it's a weird thing the exosomes and stem cells and there's a new product called Wharton's jelly that's also very effective and potent because there's no papers on these things it's all you know the research on is some of it's a little shaky but the efficacy at least anecdotal efficacy is pretty substantial and I'm one of those pieces of anecdotal evidence I've had a bunch of shots I just whenever I get injured my shoot it up yeah well your listeners may not know about exosomes so exosomes are little compartments that are pinched off from cells and put into the body and communicate between cells across so your liver can communicate with your brain you know for exosomes and within these little cargoes there are things that we're just discovering little proteins RNA and they're full of goodies and frog companies are being built on these X's ohm's yes I'm glad you brought up the study of the old mice and the young mice where they put the blood and the old mice and then the old mice started behaving like young mice and the blood of the old mice the young mice and the young mice started behaving like they were tired because there's a company in Northern California that's supposedly doing this with humans where they're injecting people with the blood of old people's or young people rather some sort of transfusion not anymore not anymore they out of business well my understanding is the FDA sent Bellator uh-huh I said stop it that's it just a letter it's all tanks oh yeah you don't want to go to the mix down the street and change your name oh I got another way down the street change my name I think that's risky is it check to see if that companies under I'll I do not remember the name of it but I remember they were erroneously linked to Peter teal and then Peter denied that he's ever used that you know the billionaire founder of PayPal who I've met it's a wonderful man they erroneously someone is some story linked they said that he's at getting it he's like actually shut the fuck up no I'm not don't say that I've never done it not doing it so it was one of those things where there was a lot of legend to it because of these my studies these my studies got people super excited about the idea that all you have to do is get young people's blood so you get a bunch of people with healthy disease free drug free donating their plasma doing their blood for X amount of dollars a quart right you have a blood boy okay yeah blood boy hey man when I was young I needed some cash I was healthy come on regenerate that shit yeah you know take a quart of blood I get it back in a couple of hours I think it might work it's just that we don't know the consequences and the FDA's job is to protect us yeah just like they're protecting us raw milk bunch of pussies just recently shut down about a month ago I missed the boat could have been in there man but if you did that that's something that you'd have to do on a routine basis right it's not like something you do one one shot probably give you like a little boost for a short amount of time yeah well that's what's different about this reprogramming you do it once you come back in years yeah the eyeball thing is very enticing to me because it's so weird watching my eyes deteriorate like slowly but surely I'm watching it happen it's really it sucks and it's a sure sign you getting older too man yeah age-related macular degeneration just seems pretty standard except my friend cam Haines that motherfucker he's 52 years old he could see like 2018 vision of 52 it's crazy see anything I dropped my phone on the ground he's like I you got a crack he saw it from like a where where's the crack I'm trying to look at it in lights like right there and I put reading glasses on like son of a bitch like how the fuck did you see that he saw it from like where you are like looking at the phone like that is crazy well said so let's keep in touch we will and yes if we get this on the market then uh-huh yeah yes it turns out he has started up again as recent pretty recently but it's not being sold as Youngblood for plasma it's just plasma so just a shot bro is here some just uh no promises what you think want to go in there with me right after we do the cryotherapy treatment let's get some blood some young blood doctors behind failed anti-aging blood clinic tries again we tried to ask him some questions but he was very evasive good for you sir duck and move do the old Muhammad Ali rope-a-dope be like Pernell Whitaker sir yeah I hope he stays evasive I mean it's also like maybe it's nonsense maybe it's not would you like to do Studies on people that are doing that and find out I mean well what they should do is measure the clock now that we yes right yes that would be interesting but based on what we know about how it works with mice you think it's likely that there is some effect it's possible it's possible I like a very cautious you're a real professor I like that's right you know you're the real deal I'd like to keep my job Diane you should just stop making those blowjob jokes funny that that is actually controversial two friends can't just joke is there anything else that you think is promising that is on the horizon or that's being discussed or its theoretical at this point yeah there's something that is really interesting and that's called sena lytx Sano Linux yeah so Senna lytx are drugs that kill off cinesín cells so what our senescence cells these are often called zombie cells and what I think is - World War Z yes a lot of zombies this podcast so senescence cells we've known for decades exist in the body but what was not clear was whether they cause aging now it's pretty clear from animal studies at least is that we get lots of these accumulating and that they do cause aging and one of the best experiments that was Donna from Mayo Clinic was to genetically delete the senescence cells that accumulated in an old mouse and it became young again or at least a delayed its aging by fair bit now senescence cells are pretty rare though it's not a lot of them but they cause havoc because they don't just sit there in the body but they send out these inflammatory markers and they cause cancer we think so you want to get rid of these just I want to mention that in the biological clock when I was saying that the the clock is part of the aging process what we think is that as we get older that and it's it's detailed a lot more in my book so if people read it they'll understand a lot more what I'm saying but this this clock is messing up the cell's ability to be what it used to be what I mean by that let's take your eye in your retina your nerves are getting older but your nerves we think are losing the ability to read the nerve genes so they're forgetting that their nerves so now they're starting to behave actually more like a skin cell and having a skin cell in your eyes not going to really work very well so that we call that epigenetic noise epigenetic aging reprogramming resets that so why is that interesting we think that the ultimate problem for the cell when it loses its total identity or gets a long way towards that is it shuts itself down because it says fuck I don't even know what I am anymore I'm not a nervous element of skin cell I'm not a liver cell sin s sin s means stop dividing just sit there and tell the body come kill me mmm so now they're putting out these panic factors there's a problem you get inflammation the problem is that as we get older the body's not very good at clearing out these cells they sit there and they wreak havoc yet inflammation we think you get aging so getting back to analytics these drugs are designed to be a pill or an injection into your joint to kill off these zombie cells these senescent cells and theoretically rejuvenate the tissue and reverse that aspect of aging and that's another treatment like reprogramming that could be a one-shot delivery and take you back a decade Wow and how far away are we from seeing those much closer actually there's a few companies there's one called unity there's one that I'm involved with in full disclosure called Sena lytic therapeutics in Europe and they're in at least unity is in clinical trials right now for osteoarthritis really now what about the company in Europe preclinical still Mouse Wow so we're looking at like a decade from the general public or well the unity they hope not usually when you're in a phase two study which they're in it's a few years away if it works oh wow amazing stuff it's such a cool time to see all this medical innovation and technological innovation well my head spinning yeah as CRISPR and then the reprogramming which is new stuff this is stuff that we dreamed of yeah thousands of years and you know I don't think it's a dead end and it may not be as you know we're not gonna go back to being 20 anytime soon that said I think we've we've had a major breakthrough the equivalent I like to use is we figured out how to fly where the Wright brothers the right sisters we've got got include basics is now my daughter will tell right non-binary people yeah so my daughter changed her name by the way - what - Alexander she was Madeline she didn't think that was appropriate why she's a tough chick uh she's a day and so I'm not allowed to call her a she I don't think she doesn't want to be identified as one or the other interesting she's 16 if she changed it at 11 whoa she's a tough girl you know in my family we tend to be rebels and unfortunately it passed along I'm getting everything back fortunately or unfortunately well I guess I'll be proud of her but raising her the last few years have been pretty annoying I can't say anything without the PR police she's that's hilarious it's a PC police or PR did I say PR I made a PC yeah that's interesting uh what was I saying about my daughter Oh about the the name change yes why was it talking about a name change I don't know you tell me Jamie's you remember people screaming at us yeah well you were talking about so many exciting things on the horizon yeah true yeah and so that it's it just head spinning and so much is happening in our lifetime that I thought was just imaginary or the future now the question is are we gonna reap all the benefits of this or we're gonna be the last generation to lead a normal human lifespan and not anything we are I think that we already have things we can do in our daily lives just in lifestyle and in molecules you can take that give us a very good chance of living beyond what's naturally possible this is amazing man such it's it's so exciting and the last time you here was about a year somewhere around that range yeah yeah I mean and think about how many new things you have to discuss now versus then it's really interesting man and I'm so happy there's people like you that are out there doing this it's just it's so it's just so exciting and it's so it makes me very happy to know you're out there Thanks so thank you and your book people can find out all this stuff in detail much more detailed you can get a two-and-a-half hour conversation life span why we age and why we don't have to David a Sinclair PhD thank you brother always a good time we'll do it again next year deal yes bye everybody [Music]
