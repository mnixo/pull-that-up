[Music] it's that and then the next pay-per-view is Holly Holm vs. Germain to Ronda me which is it's a tough sell right I would buy it as a hardcore fare I'll buy it for sure for sure and we'll probably but the bottom line hundred thousand people well yeah yeah it ain't gonna be Conor McGregor numbers right bottom line Connor when she lost and I'm sure he likes Ronda by but business-wise he's like yeah that's when she now with the marketing campaign the dummy WME WME put together for this that was so wrong too heavy and then Ronda gets smashed and now what are you gonna do for you gonna like the girl who smashed Ronda is that what Amanda gets for her next title you do a press tour world press tour with her like let's let's introduce you the girl beat the shot around and now she's not lying let's do this press tour that she deserves how they'd all this stuff piggyback on Ronda again yes and show the beating well you know she sort of retired to legends in the sport that's why she's my fighter of the year she retired Misha and then she retired one if Rhonda retires that's huge she retired both of them all of a sudden Amanda is Nate Diaz did you see how cat Zingano posted on Instagram that Amanda blocked her cuz cats in Ghana stopped Amanda and Amanda was hurt and cat Zingano bad around real bad cat was in big fucking trouble but she survived and went on to stop Amanda and I love cat but all fucking Amanda could do is like you lost the chick I just beat in 17 seconds but she got caught an armbar I mean I don't remember she beat her down she beat her down the third round cat got on top and started blasting her she kind of gasps no well she kind of gasps but that is ferocious cat zombies Amanda yes you know that scream there's a there's a recording of cat Zingano screaming after she won that fight and it's so primal dude it's like an animal scream I think you played it before in the podcast yeah because it was it was like she did it wolf there's some shit you hear that's it that's her God come on man that you can't you can't fake that that's in your bones after all that darkness she dealt with her husband can be a suicide just all this darkness was out that was after them again listen to this shit Brosius but right now and him to answer your question from before not to interrupt you this sitting on a fucking goldmine William Morris now with this fuck of the man that known as I told you last night she's probably LBGT community jack great stories fucking pockets okay excuse me LTG it's lbgtq a now what does that got to keep up lesbians they just hit the fucking lot everything in there did Liz Carmouche before that wasn't the champion look once you're the child feed the champion it's everything and when Liz Carmouche fought Ronda she fought her at the first fight when no one knew who Ronda was so Rhonda has all this height behind her she wins that fight and then goes on and you know Liz has done well in the UFC but having that it does it's not the same yeah that's her Victor she's awesome have you ever seen her fight Tony Evan girl very tough I don't think she is bad she's in a victory super tough she's really good and she's openly gay - and what weight is she she's hilarious man I love that chick she's like 135 135 145 she's good there's gonna be more it's the same thing we were talking about like when Anderson was in his prime when he was just a lighting people on fire the division was like there wasn't you know you had like Patrick Cote he had a couple of fights for the title Palace latest real like there's no one Frank there's no Bob Richmond was a champ but there's no overwhelming need to see that fight you know what I mean like you want to see the fight cuz I'm interested in see Patrick's got a great chin he's got power let's see what happens but it's not like oh here's the next one it's like Cody gar Brant fighting Dominick Cruz you were like oh let's see what happened - yes there was no one like that for Anderson for a long-ass time and I think in the women's bantamweight division you got a kind of similar situation now it's like now you have Amanda Nunez who beats the shit out of me Shanice is gonna step back she's gone now she beats the shit out of Ronda Ronda steps back Holly goes up to 145 remain at random you got to change that shit why to save that card fuck yeah I mean it make some moves cuz if you seen the card window the column and card was the headliner that's what I'm saying Holly's fighting Germaine to random e for the 145 I think they should Germaine de manager may already beat her you know known as beat who I thought you know Nunez I beat her and jamayne Duran yeah she yeah she beat her in the UFC yeah Germaine is a wicked kickboxer her she's a world world-class multiple time world champion kickboxer I think she's I think she won the muy Thai world Muay Thai title several occasions she's like really elite as a muy Thai fighter pilot but they gloves stand up always stand up there's no ground and as soon as she got in the UFC you could see like that transition between learning the striking with with with takedowns versus just fighting in kickboxing bout it's a big transition takes time - yeah but you're also going to people who aren't gonna give you the time exactly they're just fuckin shooting in arm beating her up and taking her down and just it's just a difference on that card I thought the card is pretty good it's in Brooklyn yes Travis Browne is fighting Derrick Lewis that's an interesting fight mm-hmm but what's you know I mean what is track where's Travis's head at right now he's training the same camp isn't he yes god damn it Travis yeah Holly Holm vs. Amanda Nunez that's the fight right there yeah I agree with you I think of 135 lights oh fuck they should do for this card no make it make a man of the two belt champion but then you have to remember the Valentina Shevchenko just beat Holly and be analysis yeah and Valentina beat her up stand up yeah they need help with this card the problem is most people you know Valentina won they don't know who she is yet even though she won I mean she needs a few more victories inside the US in order to get people except this paper yeah Brooklyn the only reason people know Holly too is they don't know that her past losses really big ranter fight was on Fox but all they know is she's the girl that knocked out Ronda that's what's selling them Eddie probably you trying to say that this isn't gonna get you last sixty bucks I'm just saying that I will illegally stream Amanda Nunez just fought for 45 seconds she's fresh have her headline that car hey man let's build her up with you yeah weekend is in Houston different card yeah it's really change anyone I don't think they have that card locked up either by the way I think they're still moving fights around for that Brooklyn card because I think they recognize it did need a little bit more juice on so I think it's in Houston this year and the Superbowl yeah Bronk you know Dallas I thought its down is it Houston I know it's Texas Texas so that's uh they'll have a big card for for the UFC there that's a Bermudez and chance on John that's a good fight but what what day is that that would sell seven paper February fifth fourth supercells on the fifth this is the fourth yeah so I'm not there for that you need a fight that's a Super Bowl card and it's a Fight Night 29 the game is on the fifth yeah that's the night before it's a free free fight night because Super Bowl weekend it's always been a pay-per-view UFC it's usually been in Vegas Vegas yeah I wonder what they're doing man [Music]
