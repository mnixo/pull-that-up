I think we sold so many flashlights that does it was impossible for them to sell more because everyone who listens the show is a perfect no way they tap the market so what I mean you can only advertise with someone for so long I mean everybody listens to this show has heard about the fleshlight by now it makes sense that they discover the relationship yeah yeah yeah well they it's not that they backed out it says they we ended it we did it for a long time totally amicable they're very nice coca-cola is but you keep advertising yeah I don't I'm not running any companies well don't go fuck my tweet them still I talk to them there's a good video that they just posted that's crazy they just couldn't keep up with the first product everywhere they stopped advertising because that people they couldn't keep up with the demand I don't know just joking around about that I mean I mean oh you think it makes sense the only the only product ever is a fake vagina that's the only one that they'd have to they'd run out of materials I don't know that skin is rare you know how they make that skin yeah yeah it's actually a food based product I'm chewing on one right now it's like it's not really like a plastic it's almost like you could almost like digest it with your body it's really weird you got to check out that they just posted a video what did what did we watch it looks not this isn't even our real sponsor we were actually sponsored by on it comm makers of alpha brain shroom tech shrimp tech sports room tech immune and also we've recently got hacked ladies and gentlemen yeah we got hacked they got and got ahold of some encrypted data and that you could it's all explained at on accom forward slash breach and because of that they're offering an eighteen percent discount off of everything for the next couple of days so you just use the code name got your back people are very bummed out over there that someone hacked into the system but that's just the way it goes man if you're if you're online someone can get you those little script kiddies those bad motherfuckers apparently it wasn't the best setup at on it radically improved it because that and they feel terrible about it she said they just didn't know it's a fairly new company but I've been hacked three times that's just a gas station this year yeah I mean I've had to change my all my shit ass stations all the time something happens when you run your car through that thing and they can you just stick it yeah when you slide it through they when you run your card through and then you put in your zip code yeah apparently some of them are rigged and some of them just copy your information like and then they have to figure out which gas station it was where were you when it happened which machine did you use and then they find out and go in the machine and find out who rigged it yeah it could be that it could be a third party that transmits that data it's really pretty sophisticated stuff it's it's really nuts really but there's a lot of money in organized crime and stealing credit cards is a big part of it and so it's just fucking super common if you're online people are gonna go after you that's that discount also works on kettle bells and battle ropes so all shit to become manly go get some all right and thanks to Alienware MMA for hooking us up with some dope laptops

it's kind of a Paul Stanley ish that's my grandmother Wow that was three years ago yeah something like that that is my what I think is the most impressive style of artwork that reproduction portraits yeah yeah yeah I saw this girl last night they had her father on her arm as a child though and so this little child on her arm and I'm like has you know anyone ever tried to like it is that messy is it weird when people are like you know like I try to make him blink you know like as a baby and like fucker with the face and it's like is that weird to you she goes no this guy's come Don it before and I made him lick it off and I'm like what like that's just crazy like there's realistic tattoos okay bro Helly decide I think Brian easy you need to go take some magic for a second that my damn I smoke too much way no I think Brian did you just went too deep right you just got you know I just I ran up a ramp covered and Vaseline I thought that's definitely said to my tweeter class me yeah I have to deal with him by myself sometimes I was trying to remember this yeah I'm crazy I was trying to remember the story that happened last night but then I was too stoned to remember it so then I was like trying to stumble while telling a story you just got a slowdown son and Crazy's gonna be okay the crazy thing about how this tattoo came about was her shop there's one was one block away from old legends remember that yes I passed by legends is an MMA gym it was a kickboxer right down the street from your shop so I would pass by to go home I lived in West Hollywood I would pass by to and from work all the time and always here too I never saw your show but I knew who you were from the billboards around Hollywood and shit but I never ever not once thought about ever getting a tattoo for me I just didn't think about it I have no what happened my god Carson Hill you know I just have this tattoo artist who's awesome name is Carson Hill is in LA fucking amazing but I was I'm cool with him I'm only gonna let him fuck with my shit now that's what I was thinking but then after like a year of just passing by your shop I ended up in the you at the UFC in Dallas we were in Dallas and that wasn't shit to do and I used to work for the UFC and I'm sitting there in my hotel room and Alma show comes up at all my Awards yeah it's like yeah yeah my mom yes I'm watching this the Alma Wars is that the Latino celebrity Awards or whatever and I'm watching that you know me being Latin you know I'm like oh shit I didn't know that white dude was fucking half Mexican like actors are coming up and Rocco you're talking about me no no no no and then and then and then Kat Von D comes out and I'm like oh shit she's Mexican holy shit I was born in Mexico but my family's from Argentina so I am Deena but I'm Alma yeah so your family's from Argentina yeah wow that's cool yeah so at that point so at that point now she's in my head I might think oh she's Mexican so that was Friday afternoon Monday first class after class it's 11 o'clock at night I'm driving past her shop it's closed up and I'm thinking a wild hare just a delusional thought hey maybe I could get her to do a tattoo on me and film it and put it on my show but me thinking like like she would actually do it I'm thinking for 10 seconds I'm thinking that's a good idea but then as I made her write on Santa Monica Boulevard I'm like she's so famous she would never do that I'm like there would a crazy dumb thought I go home take a shower to get a late-night bite to eat at kitchen 24 by myself I just walked in I'm pretty good yeah i sat there and this girl comes up to me that I knew from a long time with Jason's ex-girlfriend Jason chambers ex-girlfriend comes up to goes Eddie what's up and she gives me a hug is oh shit she looks at me and goes you should that kept on DTaP to you I'm like that is crazy I was thinking that an hour and a half ago that's insane or whatever I'm like that's a pretty crazy lesson ethic and then she goes no but I'm serious I can actually get you on the show like what goes yeah I work on the show they hired me shit ain't real that you came in riding on that vehicle because like my way was it really honestly would have probably worked more against you than for you but somehow what happened she was bruised with a director and she was the casting director well she did she did get me on the show yeah yeah yeah and for that thank you she's funny when shit works that way when you have some weird idea and all of a sudden it becomes reality next morning I meet the casting director and he said let's do it cuz he's a big UFC fan and I was just right there on the show and you know what they originally should they go cat is very picky on who she does tattoos it so if she doesn't pick you would you go with the other two and I said were you on the fence at all um well you know it's when we would film the show there was like a screening process so like I would get these like lists of different ideas and people people requests I guess and so I would based on the artwork I would filter it through and do the ones that I knew that I was capable of or I'd be excited about but they wouldn't really tell me much about the person come in because they wanted to be all natural on camera and stuff so I didn't know I don't I think a very minimal other than your name I didn't know she didn't know she just didn't know very strange I said I wouldn't do it I felt it was so crazy that I thought of it that night an hour and a half later some chick makes it happen I thought it was so crazy that I said no I won't do it unless Kat does it I'm not interested yeah that is really odd when things like that happen cuz that's no denying that that like statistically put that shit on paper how crazy would it put the thought I'll store into your head on paper and then meeting what are the odds of that that's like fucking millions to one it's almost like they're the story of your life is like the dud the writers are working on it less and it's just getting shitty ER and things to happen it's like it instead of being some complicated fucking war and peace' epic of you know complicated eight to twenty personalities no I just think about some shit the next day you get a phone call it's like well an hour hour and a half late imagine if you had hey imagine if you had like a bunch of magic gifts and you didn't know about them and you were just you using them on tattoos and shit when you could you know maybe fly or breathe underwater or something like you might have had a magic gift and you you made it happen you're like maybe get a handful of those in your life I told them and you just decided actually when you think about it and saying it's it would even if you had like a little magic like the ability to make something happen a few gifts like that in your life you're really not gonna be able to do anything that's truly supernatural I mean that would have already been done already so like when you look at someone who's got like that tattoo is actually one of the best things you can do you know get something that's permanent artwork on your on your skin that to you I know means an incredible amount and to get it from someone like her and to get it all like one bit that really is better than like most magic tricks yeah you know right incredible I was trying to tell the story to the producers they didn't want to hear that shit cuz they didn't want to hear that one of the chicks that worked on the show like pulled strings they don't want to make that part of the show yeah it breaks yeah they so they I was telling that story I'm like I got an incredible story but they go oh that's a great story wouldn't they tell us to because then it shows you that someone got dragged in and pulled but you know it's true - I think it's smarter on the I mean you know the relatability on that in comparison to your actual story you know like what you do and what it took to get you there and with the meaning behind the tattoos a lot more I guess you know it resonates with the viewer much more than saying oh yeah this is a Hollywood moment I was at fucking you know right well I wouldn't think of it as a Hollywood moment I think for him it's just a crazy piece of synchronicity yeah and I think we ended up actually talking about that kind of stuff anyway like throughout the yeah yeah I was I'm a you told you that story before you fight are you a big fan of synchronicity do do you experience in your life yeah I'm a big fan of being the master of your own reality I think you know it's not so much about wishing your way through something or manifesting it but you know I think certain mental attitudes or mentalities that are are more productive than others well we know that certain attitudes I mean you you've talked about it like that Jon Sarno back thing like if you have like some sort of a like you you could be upset or angry at things and have a bad back and think that you're bad back is actually like an injury so it's not even an injury it literally is your own brain causing your body to not up and some sort of a crazy way that it deprives I don't know the exact science behind it but when you have some serious stress in your life somehow this is a theory that I heard I didn't make this up your body the pain is real your body will suffocate you're deprived oxygen to the your back muscles and then they get really sore and tight that's what happens when you get nervous or stressful that's the theory I don't you know it kind of makes sense because I have I have a backstory as well but I don't want to get into that but that's a long story we're here to talk about yeah but might might think it was that you know you really do change a lot of shit with your mind I mean your mind just in the things that you come up with like your artwork do you did you it doesn't doesn't ever feel like sometimes like where the fuck is this coming from this is almost like like it's coming out of nowhere it's coming out of your creativity you know it's coming out of this weird place in your mind then all of a sudden it's manifesting itself in this beauty does it ever like freak you out um I don't know if it freaks me out I just get excited about things you know and I mean I don't know I'm in love with my job I love I mean I can't even call it my job that would be so weird to say that you know I guess I'm the luckiest person on the planet but yeah I think it's just more perspective really I think four year well you know I've been tattooing since I was 14 years old I got into my first tattoo shop when I was 16 illegally obviously and I never went through like a traditional apprenticeship or anything like that but then this this funny idea for a TV show happened when I was like 21 22 and it changed the dynamics of things you know at the time I was drinking and partying a lot and so I'm sober now but um it was like I almost had resentment towards people you know after doing like a lot of the same stuff over and over again and the expectations that come in it kind of like rapes the art at times you know because you just want to I mean for me I just wanted to create I just wanted to draw or tattoo do my best and then you know the story behind the tattoo and all that it just it gets pretty heavy after a while but then you know something flipped and I saw each opportunity or each tattoo as an opportunity to connect with people you know and I think I think I'm always looking for that you know I I sound like a hippie but like I like making people like feel good about things and about life whether it's about death or whatever it does sound hippy but it's beautiful but you know it's like it's a weird thing that we mock stuff like that I don't I mean I just I'm locking myself more than anything I do as well yeah I catch myself sound like a retard what are you talking about idealistic fool but but that would be the best way to live if we all could figure out how to tune in like that and everybody could I feel like I'm always at my most creative when I'm being like generous and kind and nice to as many people as possible I experienced a you know a good connectivity with all the human beings you interact with totally you feel better you feel like something it's working better though yes what did you recognize your power as an individual you know and I think like intentions are really important you know there's like this this little thing that I do and I think I've only told like like one person about it at the end of every tattoo you I put this paper towel on the tattoo and I I put like witch hazel which is like a natural astringent and stuff and it's like I always like hold my hands over it for a minute and I think that the client most the time thinks I'm just like cleaning it off or something but in my mind I'm thinking like several words then and it this is really gonna sound like a crazy like hippy thing but I just think these three words and and it's like a transfer of energy and whatever the three words you can't tell me the three words really were they secrets they're just words it would be poetic why would you know it's impossible magic it's impossible to I said something like rainbow chicken salad why can't you tell this it's just words well I mean you guys help people you fire them up whatever they start doing that with their life well I mean they want to try to cap on different roads it's so successful what's on t-shirts then forget it when maybe you have some magic no the purpose being is that there's like intention behind every every everything you do and and I think that's really important because there is like a physical aspect of energy you know people like the vibes and all that stuff there's actual energy that you're putting out into the world so and focus I mean we all know when someone's not focusing on us when you're having a conversation and when they're looking at their phone or doing something else yeah or you know like when you meet people and they're just like they're just dickheads or they're angry or they're having a bad day or it's hot or whatever and I've like witnessed it before where I can like bring presents or positivity into a situation you know or it's like I recognize my power to do that and it's like I remember one time I was driving down the brand like I got the chick behind me wasn't paying attention and she totally crashed into my car and then the guy behind her wasn't paying attention to heat crash into her and his airbags went off and all this shit you know and I'm like my car is like pretty stealth is not gonna get I don't even think I got a ding on it you know in the cars behind me were just like tin cans and I just remember going getting out of the car now I mean I'm wearing like full leather and just like yeah and just like wow you know and I'm like that could be pretty intimidating I'm like okay I'm gonna consciously like make these people feel okay you know and like she rolled down her window she's like and are you okay and just like looking at her eye and like asking her if she's okay she she's just like softened and after don't kill me lazy gangbanger chick yeah you think damage yeah if I was a chick I would be so bummed out if I rear-ended you know and you know after we were all laughing about it I think most people get all like up in arms about things I just realized I read something is when I was a kid nothing has any meaning other than the meaning that you give it yeah totally and you could force things to be positive you could force all negative situations to be opportunities for growth you know you can you can it's a way you can live your life like that totally well it could be a fuckhead just slamming into walls everywhere and never figure it out you forgot your first tattoo when you were 16 I got my first set she was 14 actually holy was it good yeah I still have it it's like a Little J on my ankle it was for my first love ever and we did it for like three years and wow that's intense yeah I ran away like who lived across the country in a Greyhound bus how old B when he did that but then I was 15 when I'm a ho and then I was already tattooing instead of Jesus Christ yeah you can put now you could put a Z under it and put 99 problems in quotes I don't know that but I just tell people it stands for Jesus or just kidding wow that's a really young age to be traveling I know my poor parents man and I had a hard time like I think forgiving myself for a long time because I'm really close with my dad and stuff he actually like lived with me up until recently and he got his own place and I was pretty bummed about that but yeah at the time I was like oh you know I never wanted to hurt anybody's feelings I just really felt like the need to do this this thing that my family didn't understand you know and they're from a different culture like I said and stuff said they weren't really prepared for it you know they seemed liked at dealing oh my god you're like a hoodlum or a gangster a drug addict or a hooker or whatever you you know I was none of the above so they never put in their head you're doing tattoos boom you're gonna be some crazy famous chick no I mean you know and we were we really isolated world like you know the way we were brought up was not very Americanized at all so like which I'm glad because I feel like that that's really honestly the one of the things I credit to like being able to do all the things I've done is just like the discipline and you know the three of us my brother sis and I were all like classically trained on the piano since I was six and you know two hours a day we had a practice and when we would rather be like hanging out and stuff and we were like waiting order like afford like video games and shit like that so so I drew all the time and and spent time with my family and stuff and so for that I'm grateful I feel like that discipline really plays into like executing ideas you know I have idea millions of ideas at all times you know and just like I think a lot of people have ideas and they just think it's I don't even programmed to think it's not like attainable or something or just silly to me yeah well there's that hump that you have to get over in associating pleasure with getting things done yeah and also I think too it's like people's idea of success is so warped you know it's like they base it on money or status or fame and and and to be honest with you when I started tattooing I didn't even know it was a job I just knew it felt organic and it felt like natural that not he didn't come to me naturally I worked really hard for it but it felt like this is where I was supposed to be you know and ever and this is granted before like a television show and stuff it was you know I just came from Disneyland it was like if I would have gotten to design back then like you know you don't get happy smiles and stuff you know I had so many Julia Roberts moments going into stores it's like can't we help you you know and I'm just like I could buy this place so they just immediately judge you that's not a common thing I think when I was younger yeah I mean nowadays it's so like embraced you know I mean if my dad who was super anti tattoos and doesn't have any or anything you know it took ten years of me tattooing because I started tattooing on that TV show when I 10 years of tattooing so it took a television show for my dad to actually you know acknowledge the fact that I wasn't like not a loser but you know like that I wasn't throwing my life away there he's like oh and sometimes it takes that I don't hold that against my dad I don't blame him I'm really you know you've influenced a lot of chicks and like how they look like you you were the first one that like popped through and boys Joe the FIR one who was like a really hot chick who just tattooed herself to fuck up like well this chick went for it and and and guys were like I like it I like it and then BOOM then there was a wave of them it was you and then it was like everywhere you look this is crazy tattooed up girls like the percentage of it I don't know what I don't an umber on it increased by like 34 percent it went from however minimal amount of women tattooed to like one out of three women had have tattoos in America and that was like back at sea uh I remember that stat when I did The Ellen DeGeneres Show which was like years ago I said that's where do you look at the stats like we're winning we're taking over no no no because I remember I actually you know I mean I have friends I have no tattoos and they're like feel the need to get one I'm like I don't I like you the way you are you know that's good I mean I get tattooed for myself personally you know it's if anything it's kind of it's kind of a drag so I don't like you know always talking about my tattoos like it when I'm going out and stuff but it's also a positive thing I can't complain you know I love art so yeah yeah it's it's a weird thing with people if they either have them and they don't have them if they don't have them they could never imagine I could never imagine yeah I have imagined drawing something it's just society forever suicide girls they owe you big time you blew that that company HUF right well that whole look yeah they need a worship you know do you know what that dude the guy who brought it came up with that whole concept but a while ago do you feel weird about that I'm like that you've I mean that's gotta be a strange thing to have so much influence um you know I think I may not have recognized it when I first started you know being in the public eye or whatever as as that until I got sober I think I really started recognizing that and it became important to me you know I'm pretty pg-13 just but by nature you know I'm pretty squeaky-clean I don't you could take my phone and go through it and find pictures of my cat and stuff probably not anything incriminating but um I like the idea of like putting that good good stuff out there you know like all my books and everything it's it's really easy for me to talk about my downfalls or like my issues or not struggles because that sounds like I'm a murderer or something but like you know the this should I have experienced in hope set I don't know people would feel less alone because I know what it's like to feel that way so you know I don't know that's what a lot of people say about people that are covered in tattoos and if you never I have two sleeves if you in case you think I'm being an asshole they feel like a lot of people don't have tattoos feel like you're covering something up oh yeah I remember doctor drew nigh a conversation about that because he I loved this book that he wrote and in it talked about how tattooing is like a form of narcissism not unlike a level of oh I think I'm awesome but the opposite which is narcissism just the same but you know like it's it's a reflection of what's on the inside and I don't really necessarily see it that way because that to me yeah there's some tattoos that hold meaning like I love my dad I got a portrait on my arm that's self-explanatory but there's other stuff I'd like my friends who don't know how to draw like tattoo me it looks like a drunken three-year-old did something I love it because it's just fun and it's cool you know you let your friends draw on you that's why I let him tattoo me yeah but dr. Drew's a silly bitch he really is so silly I love him too but he's a silly bitch I saw him the other day at the gas I'll get him on I'll get him on I you know he's been involved in that scandal for a influencing the idea that people bought some certain drugs off-label like saying touting their sexual benefits and stuff and then he'll talk crap about marijuana or people smoke pot and he'll say silly things like the how horribly addictive it is and it's all just nonsense not so I don't you know I haven't like I said earlier is I haven't owned a television in it was 16 years in March and I'm pretty a dime about not watching television my point I don't know but but but you know I get what you're saying that I can't tell you why you're gay you can't say that you're just not enjoying the art you can't I know people love their tattoos they love it for all yeah it's the person and you know yeah like I'll have issues and stuff I have no problem like wearing my heart on my sleeve and I mean I've actually got a lot of shit for that you know I mean in the past and stuff with relationships and I just so I don't really live in that world of regret we're really giving a fuck yeah I just hate absolutes like that like it how you have to be fuck them you have to be this you have you that it's it gets silly with certain things yeah I mean I think no one's perfect either so I feel like you know I could see the goodness in everything even the stuff I don't necessarily agree with you know I guess I tried to at least right yeah yeah I just I would I would like to look at things that way I would like to look at people with tattoos and just you know I don't know why anybody got him but I look at him and go wow I hope you like it I hope it's something that means something yeah I hope it's something everybody had for whatever reason wants to immediately try to figure out what was fucked up with you that made you like totally corporate and working in a cubicle it's miserable and there's like suppression of like of creativity like man that's such a waste of life energy you know like God imagine if everybody was free to do things like as they you know like like I was talking about earlier people's idea of success it's like imagine if you didn't you weren't bound by like everybody else's idea of that you know like if you could settle for a job that paid less but you were completely happy I mean my dad and I we used to argue about this all the time because he's like you know you didn't go to high school and it's like yeah I know dad I know but check it out look you went two years of school and you don't like what you do and you're struggling so hard and you know my dad comes from a medical background and stuff but um and I was sold on my way to work every day and I walked down like the tarnished fucking Hollywood stars you know like just walking I'm like oh my god there's like a bunch of punk rockers there and it's like God like it's just life is good like I love it you know and and if I wasn't getting paid I'd still be happy there's a documentary that Werner Herzog just put out it's called the happy people a year in the taiga it's these people that live up in Siberia and how happy they are and there's like no depression everybody just does their work and all their whole life is struggle their whole life is all they live off the land almost completely entirely trapping hunting and they're there in fucking Siberia there's only one way to get there you have a couple months we could take a boat that's it otherwise you got to get flown in there's no roads to get up there and these people are happy as fuck they're just up there you know like shooting animals living off the land growing their own vegetables where they have to work hard in the spring and summer to prepare for the winter yeah and then they prepare for the winter like smoking fish I mean every day no one has a job every day they're working like securing food for their families and storing it up so they can make it through the next winter it's fun it's amazing it's not really that different than living in Hollywood and people who do that in their own ways it's just yeah it's just more I feel like it's more what that yeah it sounds so much more simple and like less thought about like here it's like the stress of getting to work and fighting three hours of traffic to get to a job that I don't respect or love and you know yeah it's there you're still suffering or whatever for for something you know I mean well something happened somewhere along the lane somewhere along the way in society and our culture moved way faster than the human body did and all of a sudden jobs required you to sit still they required you to stare at fucking unnatural light they required you to enter in things and your fucking back hurts and you're doing it all day every day like the body's not designed for that the body's designed to do with these fucking people in Siberia are doing it's designed to go out and kill caribou and and you know have dogs chained to trees and they keep the Bears away I mean that's these guys are happy as fuck yeah and this is the real way we're supposed to live it's crazy they hate it well they don't go see what I'm saying is that like all of our little receptors I think are set up for to reward us for certain experiences and I don't think we're set up any different than the people that lived when you had to live like that so I think the only way to really not feel lost is there's no fucking movie star status when you're in Siberia there's no front of the line of the club there's no bullshit there's no nothing there's no ahead of 10th planet jiu-jitsu there's no stand-up comedian there's no nothing there's get a fish you got to get a fish because we're gonna fucking die in the winter if you don't and everybody does that but yet they're all happy and shit they there's even when you're a kid and you like you like thought of like were you were like well we'll never never live there I'm never gonna move there I'm never gonna get out of this class and they're never gonna get out of this situation this is where I'm at well for them it's a reality where they're surrounded by nature and woods like there really is no alternatives yeah so they have no delusions there's no ridiculousness in their life and they're truly in the moment living like people were living 10,000 plus years ago yeah that's how we're supposed to live if they had teach any bullshit how long do you think it would take one generation TV they'd be out of there in a minute the kids were like what are we doing out here yeah TV Kat Von D would change the way they all look I want to mommy in one month they don't want touches they'd be making homemade tattoos of beaver teeth and shit yeah we were at the the coffee place and we're having small talk with the nice lady behind the counter and she said oh I had a house-sit this weekend it was terrible they didn't even have cable no internet and me and Eddie were like well we were being serious whoa no cable what the fuck so what do you use in tan that sucks and then and then Eddie goes well at least he got the Internet and she's like no no they didn't even have the Internet he's what what fuck TV these guys don't even watch man they don't even have electricity and they're happy yeah they don't have electricity man they just don't know they get a little bit of gasoline that they use for their snowmobiles and their chainsaws and that's a wrap that's it they probably think they're ballin like the lower class of them there's no class man that's what's crazy they all live in a exact same houses they don't even use windows man they don't use windows because windows are too hard to carry around so they build these houses that'll logs and then they cut holes in the logs and put plastic a nail plastic in place all you need was a good ears yeah Bears rip them apart so often those lamb bears I swear where are they gonna get glass anyways it's hard to transport yeah it's well they can get it you think I have chainsaws they did then I'm making their own chainsaws there's somehow or another got chainsaws either taken to them on a boat or flown in somebody gave them a few tools but they like make they make boats with a fucking big piece of wood they just drop it down and hollow it out and make this canoe and let's like it's that's how they live every year it doesn't never change and yet they're happiest fuck it's really weird because to us it would be hell to the lady who works at the coffee place she was bumming out that she didn't have cable you know these one of the fuckers are fighting mosquitoes like you've never seen because the mosquitoes are only alive for like a couple of months they only got a couple months in Siberia does to live so they go gangster yeah shiet swarms like you've never seen anything like that and they don't have any raid or any shit like that so they have to the off they have to cover themselves in tar they make a tar with bark they cook the bark down to a tar and then rub it all over their face with like oil fuck that fuck that I'd be gonna fuck this magic shit they've never seen mosquitoes like this that's hard well that's one of the beautiful things about LA so we're not supposed to be here so life doesn't like it here either there's not so much here yeah us some of the much water yeah very few bugs like in the summers in the East Coast it was fucking terrible you know especially like in in Boston if you lived anywhere near a lake anywhere near body of water Oh mosquitoes were horrendous man they would fuck you up nothing like Siberia dude shit get they're so happy yeah but then again you wouldn't be happy that way you wouldn't be happy no you wouldn't not if you know your life now you love tattooing you love you know you define me I mean that's true you could adapt yeah of course you can do you think you could be a Siberian princess I don't want to be a princess but be up there beaver dragon and shit a warrior yeah a couple months a year fuck it you don't live with them until you realize they have no cigarettes like shit that's so bad like that for two days and so it'll give you some rolled up bullshit that he tries to claim as a cigarette what one issue of Inked Magazine would destroy that culture yeah Oh anything would destroy it access to some other things are destroyed the idea is that it takes the body somewhere between 10 and maybe even possibly 20,000 or more years to completely change like to completely change as far as like for you to have a like a genetic response to and to adaptation to change so like ten thousand years for us is not is a long long time to a human being but to species it's really not that much so in order for things to like decide that they're moving in a certain directions then they start changing and that's one of the things that like the really controversial ideas behind autism is that autism is not necessarily a benefit but that autism might be a new possible way that the brain can operate you know with so much really high functioning autistic yeah it's like what they're showing is like even though it's coming through in a disease and even though it brings with it debilitating social issues and show like that the positive aspects of it like a kid that can look out a window and then draw the whole fuckin like yeah that what that is it's representing the next stage of human evolution and that all the information that we're getting from sitting from computers from interacting with each other in a way that no one has ever been able to do before the brain is just going we're just red line in that motherfucker I can't wait to be able to buy that upgrade can you imagine that that's gonna be available it's gonna be like oh we're gonna fuck up your brain a little mostly most likely if you listen to like the real futurists it's gonna be some sort of a hybrid between a human and a computer it'll be something where you think so but I don't know about that what am i doing pills I don't think I don't think you'll be long gone I think you might experience that and I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing I think everybody's worried about every new possible technological thing as being something that separates us from each other or something that I'm worried about it just seems like a lot of a lot of energy to waste on things about I don't know I mean and then again you know I'm not like a big fan of like reading fiction you know I guess I mean you're not a fan of fiction you know you don't even have a television right no I'm gonna have like movies you watch movies but no sometimes yes I like documentaries and stuff like that but you try to avoid TV no I do avoid TV I don't like forced out of retirement and I don't like well no I don't want to complain I just think that you can tell you what you're on it I mean no I mean I like uh me you could mean I mean I could easily I could more it's easier for me to talk shit about like point out all the downfalls of my television show versus anyone else so like in vague terms I think that my problem with it or my the reason that I stay away from it aside from just being I got too many ideas that I want to do it on time but like is that I am too sensitive so like I I get like I get heartbroken by billboards like there was like a movie I remember there was like a movie and added billboards everywhere I remember the movie it was like you know Ashton Kutcher and some like hot chick or whatever and he's like putting on buttoning up his shirt she's like buttoning up and she's wearing his shirt and she's like getting out of bed and it says something about like no strings attached or like friends with benefits or some shit you know I was like like that's so sad to me like it's like the hablo like you guys just like I have sex with each other and there's no like I could never Wow and you almost cried looking at a billboard I mean if I think about it too much yeah I do so it's like I watch if I were to sit there and watch these television shows where the premise is to like you know there's a rich guy and a bunch of girls are fighting over this guy and using like their tits and ass as qualities it's it's it's disheartening so I mean I sound like an old lady cuz no you don't I get it and if I see a Circuit City I feel that way like a banded circuit see it's depressing to me I get sad there's just an absence of true love and I guess the romantic and me get saddened by that same with music I can't listen to music that's too you can definitely get affected by some shit especially if you don't know it's coming like any flipping through the channels there's some intense fucking movies on like that you know you just flip into it like I watched Straw Dogs last night do you know what Straw Dogs I haven't seen it it's a this is insane rape scene in this movie where I turned on the movie right when it was going on I was like what fucking movie is this but for the rest of the night I was all fucked up I mean it becomes I don't say anything about the moment the movies very good but it gets really fucking intense whereas like the rest of the night I was fucked up and I ordinarily wouldn't have watched it but I I didn't know what it was I was just pressing buttons and then boom it came on yeah and fuck my head for the rest of the night yeah and it's weird and I think it's like we just kind of like we and I think it's like people become so desensitized and I guess that's the part that I have a problem with you know like people you can see it on Twitter you said on Instagram so ever so negative it mean and take any opportunity to like knock people down I've never been from that like train of thought you know and because my parents just raised this a lot differently and stuff and so it like I get like I get butthurt really easily that's better though you know you'll you'll attract better people that way and you'll figure out a way to get away from the people that oh yeah I mean it's like yeah giving that any values just as bad I think but I just want people to be nice that's all I think almost all really expressive people anybody who's artistic or very expressive there's always some extreme sensitivity on the other side of it this is just you're intense about everything you're probably intense about love you probably intense about yeah I mean that's why you cry and see an Ashton Kutcher thing it's your intensity you're you're you're you you take shit up to a higher level quicker than most people that's probably what everything's a symbol and then I get sad about that so yeah but I've been sad I've cried during previews depressing movies what like good burger what I don't know signing over don't encourage [Laughter] well you know then there's like those like moments of brilliance and people are inspiring and great and do awesome shit yeah well that's that's what we get off each other the most that's the most beautiful thing that people get from each other is we you know we were inspired by each other like I love going on music because I'm not musical I kind of anything so I love going and watching cuz it feel I feel like it fires me up I get done oh you go to musicals no no no no no I love to see music okay watch for ya bands perform I love to see them I love to see people do things that I have zero skill in I was impressed with with our last exchange of emails with when we were like going back and forth on band recommendations and stuff because I had no idea that you were into this bet kind of stuff well the funny thing is he emailed me and he's like hey I want to know like what are you what are you listening to you nowadays oh I want to get some new music oh my god man like where do you start give me a genre you know and turn me on to so many good so I was like all right here's like 10 and then tell me which ones you like and then I'll know what kind - I'll be your like genius playlist wow that's cool and are you using Kat Von D for you genius playlist she's got some great shit she's I'm gonna tell you my my Kat Von D music story most people most people don't know that she has an amazing voice she can sing her ass off and she's really shy about she's crazy shot about we are the true look let me let me turn this chisel-like talking about it no but we on about it I just can't say like oh yeah we're both working with the same producer which is also her best friend Danny is producing my stuff and he's messing with her too musically as well so I'm at Danny's and we're working on some stuff and he goes me and me and Kat and wes borland from Limp Bizkit he's the guitar player for us because me and Wes are going to do a little benefits oh yeah he really helped me out like Hoffman they put together this they're putting together this song last minutes a cover and she's gonna perform at this benefit yeah it was for the for Linda Perry's evening with women it's like awesome yeah so Danny's telling me and Danny he's like man we're trying to put together songs cuz it was like less than 48 hours to learn this song it was like that Bronski beat song I LeBron Stevie and like and I mean I ended up just like reading it from my iPad has travelin totally fucked it up but it was fun and it was great and stuff but then I think I had been recording that night at Linda's and you were at Danny's and I was really excited because it I had because I had like gnarly stage fright issues like for the last year and stuff just whatever and so finally three balls I guess to get over them and and so obviously Danny's my best friend and I'm gonna be working on music so I was like aha hey I want to come over it was the late I think I was like what like almost midnight or something yeah me and Danny are working a Cepheid and Linda Perry for those who don't know she was the lead singer for four Non Blondes she produced Pink's second album which went fucking skyrocket so Linda Perry is a massive well I mean just like Christina Aguilera to the big up you're so beautiful Linda Perry right right so she's working with cat now they're writing some shit together I'm at Danny's she's all excited they recorded a song they brought it over yeah and then Danny's like text me is it cool Eddie Bravo is the monkey I don't care I just just don't say anything about it and then but of course I had to be in the other room cuz I was like I'm not gonna sit there go like you know hey what do you think yeah she had to go to the next room it was just like vocal there wasn't like a produced track or anything and then Danny was dead but he texts me their names like man he's still talking about it he'd like loved it but I'm like oh Danny said yeah so what anything I told the story I told the story a bunch cuz like the next day at school I said you can't tell most you guys don't know this but I was so impressed with her voice and the actual song her and Linda Perry together I feel with the right marketing of course it could it could you know it could it could I think it could be huge could it be bigger than Paris Hilton single I like that song a lot I beg you did you get that shit tattooed on your dick and well anyways the song the song the first one yeah you can't talk about it son she's trying to send you here well the bottom line is she's actually a great singer yeah when I see your artwork I think you'd be good at anything you wanted to be you'd be amazing if you think if you can draw that well I mean that's like some really high level shit you could do that with anything I really believe that how many I believe that with anybody who's a super awesome at anything how many bad tattoos do you see a day of people just coming in with like I mean do you have you ever seen one that you're like wow that's the worst tattoo I've ever I mean it's there's such a big difference in like like personal preference versus technical aspect of things so like I mean there's some stuff that's not necessarily technically it's a it's like everything else like music it's like technically might not be the best singer but the charisma is behind it and you know I mean well there's that style that the the what was the teacher ed hardy that ed hardy so style yeah which not that artistic but that's all it's kind of like that one art for a long time my ex-husband was like really into doing that kind of artwork and he's really great at it there's an art behind that you know I perceive not inclined to do that kind of stuff but but I appreciate for what it is so I don't know I mean I think I see um a lot of great ideas you know in people often and then you just see kind of a poor execution or or an inexperienced execution as a but yeah I mean I don't know I see so many amazing things now that like blow me out of the water it's like fuck there's so many great artists nowadays so I'm permanently scarred from ever getting a tattoo again because of my tattoo because it was a free tattoo is somebody practicing for their first time it took seven hours you shouldn't take one hour yeah and then I found out it's not even supposed to it like supposed to be an R for my last name and I found out it means waterfalls and a so now it's like the ugliest tattoo ever with this Chinese letter that means waterfalls but it's probably small you can cover it up yeah you just get that shit lasered off son they could do that pretty easy now especially like like it's not red red is apparently the most difficult color yeah yeah red it's got red in it have you got oh is it yeah they could work that red red is the easiest to get out yeah red and black and then purples and greens I think both those greens are a little harder but it all depends on like how have you done it have you done the lasering off yeah yeah anything yeah these are a couple like this whole arm lasered it used to be I got like this tattoo I was like 15 or 16 it was like the New York Dolls like cowgirl with a gun and then there's like a flag coming out her says bang and at the time I thought was cool I'm like man I have the word bang on my that's better than a waterfall how long did it take well with laser you have to go for such as it's like super painful and stuff but more painful than tattooing fuck yeah Wow well I'm a wussy so I don't know I can't and what did you yeah yeah you have tattoos all over your body and you're telling me that your oh my god ask anybody at much like 15 minutes then I tap out I can't do it those are all 15 minutes had to know this was all a lot of them was under the influence of alcohol oh do I remember just just you saying that is hilarious yes I can just go through a rolodex in my head of any moment that sentence could apply to I he wrote a blog about my alcohol problem no no I don't have a knock off I'm not an alcoholic but no I will drink a lot on special occasions and when I pass a certain point the Indian comes out as Joey Diaz says and when the Indian comes out for sure I'm not gonna remember any of the night he blacks out no he's like oh no there's like oh he's a great he's a great guy the problem is he he completely checks out and he doesn't know where he is and he's mean literally is like a third of a mind-controlled by like a demon from another galaxy he's like totally different one third Eddie and two thirds some demonic alcohol sucking demon from another planet but weird but you could always like no no never even I don't mean that I mean demonic I mean like possessed by the alcohol yeah it's like just wandering around he doesn't know what happens until the next day when he Sobers up you have to tell him what happens like I I can't i-i've had to like get his hotel door opened by security banging in German or in Germany well we were supposed to be banging on his door finally the door opens okay you get the door open Eddie is lying in bed there's cowboy boots on the light is a house and the smile the light is on is completely I just completely out cold oh go Eddie we got to go to the fucking Airport he's like what's up he just looks at me and the security Rose hey what's up it was I got the worst story that's not even the worst story the car want yeah the car one is the worst I talked to him it was like I was having breakfast it was like seven o'clock in the morning and the car was gonna come at 9:00 and he calls me while we're having breakfast he still fucked up I mean he is fucked plan was to drink all night and walk on to the airport and stay up all night right yeah so so you know I go are you fucked up did you stay up on I say yeah fuck yeah man I'm a power through I'm a power through and so I go okay well we're leaving at 8:30 alright you got it you gotta be down there for the car at 8:30 no no problem no problem so I eat breakfast an hour and a half later I go out for you know wait for them once hour and you know and a half sitting here ten minutes later I'm like okay what the fuck is going on so I talked to the guy was the valet I go hey um is my car here and the guy says what's your name I said Rogan he goes oh rogon or he left I don't know Rogan it's me you guys know Rogan already left I go what did he look like he said well he had long hair at the time it's a long hair tattoos I'm like that motherfucker so I call him up and first of all he answers the phone then just hangs up realize he didn't even know what he did thank God and I see it's Joe calling I'm like what I go what's up he goes you took my car and I hung up and I we're on the Autobahn and I tell the triangle where are we going we'll go to the airport oh shit that was the Autobahn I don't know what it was but we're flares just a regular tire well yeah was referred to us yes so then I woke up in the kept car ending it my message my answering service or whatever and I gotta figure out what the hell was going on and I finally answered he's so fucking mad I'm like holy shit I'm sorry I have no idea what happened I just woke up in the back of the car I don't remember the whole night I must have passed and just just jumped and jumped in his car this is like total like if Eddie there's a certain number of drinks where he goes over well just disappear and he's gone the Aubrey story the Texas was don't am I brought that laughs man I wasn't I was just gonna bring up the end no you know what else I found out I found out my cat in Japanese means waterfalls like somebody's fucked up with waterfall what are you talking what can Jackie in Japanese means waterfalls I found out the other day fine then you should you should be celebrating your test I don't want to go chasing waterfalls this much for some note I need to know why what's that song from what was that band TLC TLC that was a sweet song I'm never gonna walk in the ocean cuz I might come out of blob Brian you need to go outside and get some air so what are your plans for your music what's the plan well you know I think the coolest thing I think what Linda's like we're just kind of we're moving forward without any deadlines no it's not the deadlines we have goals obviously but it's you know like by summertime I think it should be done out which is exciting but I think it's like we're not really congesting our thoughts with anything right now we're just writing music without outside voices no reference just you know so you said you got over your stage fright are you gonna start doing live performances oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm putting your band yeah yeah you gonna go on tour yeah yeah holy shit Wow she's gonna be a rock star watch you gonna be a rock star that term is so weird to me it seems like you can sneak it through from the back door just from just from having talent and being on TV it's like you just just you know every through I don't know I just I want to do everything with even small things with a lot of quality and so I think like with the music stuff I just want to make it as you know as good as possible for lack of a better description but yeah so I think people will probably be pleasantly surprised in the sense that they're expecting me to fail as usual so I like it people are expecting me to fail I think people always expect you to feel like you know I think going yeah I mean other than your friends obvi I'm time out like you know yeah I think so especially me because I was on TV so it's like oh you're just doing that's definitely true but you have some success they want it to be in it's hard to get into music after you already famous with for something else it's tough yeah Oh has anybody ever done it well Jamie Foxx Steve Martin sort of Steve Martin his band's pretty pretty big for a certain kind of music oh does like just plain music shows right yeah yeah he doesn't even plays like banjo and stuff bunch of like you know it's a certain style of music but he's doing six he's successful and had you know hmm anybody Audie Murphy oh that's right [Laughter] what kind of shit deal sound like what is he so on you know what Linda and I have both have like tried figuring it out and the dark Sarah McLachlan kind of why does a bad no I do I could never compromise to anybody but ya know it's just she just calls it a powerfully pathetic which is good power powerfully pathetic I think it's very sad and tragic and romantic but there's like elements of classical music and stuff and some electronica so there won't be any Sheryl Crow type all I want to do is have some fun but we're so manly we take it in the other direction we're not scared to talk Sheryl Crow it's a great fucking song you don't like that kind of music I know I don't I just don't know what do you listen to personally Kent Kent is one of my favorite Swedish I like a lot of Scandinavian music I like a lot of metal and I like a lot of like love Depeche Mode in the Cure shit like that so a lot of obscure shit that people wouldn't be aware of and then a lot of like classic shit like Siouxsie and the Banshees yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't even listen to anything that's made before 1980 anymore I've given whack Sabbath no black I listen I listen to some Black Keys that's the only modern should I listen to and then everything else is old stuff Alban this is like Allman Brothers and Oh after 80 okay let's say before I might say before I'm sorry anything after 1980 I'm like done I'm done except the Black Keys the Black Keys seem to have kept the soul employing honey and honey honey yeah that's right they're my friends oh yeah the eighties had some of the best shit ever but I mean like modern bands are like you hear in the radio that are like big hits like I can't get in I don't and tell you I met a supermarket every now and then that's the only time I hear music I'm shopping and I'm like what the fuck is this is this something new let's do some we know it'd be some weird fucking auto-tune bullshit that's repeating itself over and over again I'm like is this the new shit is this is this like is this popular right now I feel like I'm some dude who's like an outlier like comes into town every now and then to find out what the folks are up to feels like and as I get older and older I can understand like it's like I mean I like some like pop music I guess but I think it's it's it's hard for me to wrap my mind around certain things like how does that resonate with people because for me I'm always I love poetry and I love things that are so much more profound and and I think people are hungry for that you know I think yeah even though like a lot of the stuff that's like really big right now is very superficial in whatever but like I feel like there is definitely like I think people are hurting and they want to relate it somehow so I don't know well I yeah I definitely think that but I also think there's like a lot of music that some people just aren't even aware of there's a lot of young kids today they don't even know what a whole lot of love sounds like when you hear it through like really good speakers yeah but the other day man I was driving down Hollywood and I seen these awesome fucking metalheads and they were like Karen skateboards a young kid and they had like went at like a death shirt on and then I'm gonna had like a Motorhead shirt on I was just like I said literally rolled my window down my friend Allison was and I'm like hey I love you guys and they're like I love you too metal will never die so cool yeah I thought metal was gone in the 80s it's like you know that'll never die it won't that feeling will never die because there's always gonna be shitty parenting you're never gonna get rid of metal cuz you're never gonna make people become good parents you're always gonna have people just fuck they just wanna pound on the wall fucking scream and just curse their circumstances and turn crosses upside down yeah you're always gonna have shitty parenting so you're always gonna get all that shit I bet that shit is on a computer I wrote satanic lyrics like every song had a bond either it either had to be about when I was in 14 15 16 all the songs I wrote were nuclear war anti religion demons killing priests no no not until like I was 19 in your defense though when we were kids we were growing up you know we're older than you probably don't recognize that Soviet Union threat feeling did you ever have that threat when you were a kid did you feel that see when we when Eddie and I grew up we were really worried that we were gonna get in a nuclear war with the Soviet Union everybody oh yeah Brad bro everybody did was so close that look so close dinosaurs roam the earth look it's possible today but back then it was it was not just possible it seemed probable 70s like late 70s late 70s early 80s everybody thought we were going to war with Russia that was a fact until Ronald Reagan and Chernobyl effective effectively bankrupted the Soviet Union that's one of the big things that brought it down but when the Soviet Union fell apart then everybody took a deep breath and relaxed but until that happened there was always this constant threat that they were gonna take us over war 3 we're gonna go yeah they were in Cuba I mean they were 90 miles from our border setting up missile silos I mean there was a lot of shit that went down during the Kennedy administration so there was that feeling as especially as technology increased and then there was that Star Wars program that came on where they were developing these fucking things to shoot missiles out of the sky they'd be like satellites that were launched up with lasers to zap missiles out of sky that's like a significant part of the budget and a significant part of like what Ronald Reagan was talking about when they were talking about National Defense so we were worried about going to war with Russia it was constant were kids very popular song topic seems fucked up right it doesn't even make sense to you there was a band called Nuclear Assault I was bad the song's called nuclear death nuclear death nuclear dick-suck yeah nuclear well oh there's a crazy I'll have new Holocaust often put it up later did you have you seen that video Brian that the Holocaust survivor or excuse me the the Hiroshima survivor made now he the cartoon you got to pull it up I forget the guys name something Ben is he gonna be sad oh it's crazy well it's a cartoon that was written by a survivor from from Hiroshima and it depicting how it was like what the experience was like for the people on the ground it's fucked man because even though it's just a cartoon I mean you just watch it when you can't handle it you don't want to watch in front of us really sometimes I don't know I'll get sad yeah it's kind of crazy there's like 10 different countries or more that has nuclear weapons I mean how many have them I don't know you're just taking guesses over this yeah I mean we know Pakistan India the UK certainly you know the Korean War we made 18 Korean cities disappear we did 18 that's why they fucking hate us man they're like no more no more this bullshit they just shut the shut themselves off from the world can you imagine that 18 cities disappear just and it was no nuclear it was all like what hydrogen bombs and shed I don't know the bombs they is but they made 18 they've leveled 18 cities in Korea during the Korean War Jesus Christ raised a shit we don't talk about that too much yeah wrap your head around that try thinking about 18 American cities just disappearing yeah yeah it's the whole game changed when you can fly when you can fly and shoot shit from the sky that's the game changer and it all happened all at once fly shoot things from the sky and then almost right after that nuclear bombs it's pretty nutty when you think about that because there was no fucking airport or airplane wars just a hundred years ago you're in the early 1900s were there they weren't fucking flying here and wearing dropping bombs on each other they started doing that in the 30s and the 40s that's when like they started getting better at rocketry and then BOOM 47 nuclear bomb complete GameChanger the whole thing takes less than a hundred years to go from the airplane being fucking invented to dropping nuclear bombs on people is a hundred years that's nuts I've never tattooed a nuclear missile I didn't even thought of that I think I've really never even thought of that until just now that is a crazy number that the invention of the airplane it goes invention airplane all the way to nuclear bombs and it's in less than a hundred years so in essentially one lifetime we go from people stuck on the ground or in boats to someone who can drop a fucking nuclear bomb on your country that's amazing what a fucking weird jump in history that is that might be the biggest jump in history that's ever been recorded that and I never even thought about it man there's nowhere to go is there only crazy crazy nowhere to go what it's easier to go to Alaska probably it's so much cooler Alaska's gorgeous we can make Alaska cool yeah I'd have to have more cool people move up there you're friends with the singer from him right yeah you're totally into them right they're that they're uh are they from Finland yeah they're finish they're like a it's almost like a satanic love man how would you describe him that it means his infernal majesty oh Jesus Christ someone needs to hold that dude down hold that down make him take his pills he's spotting all over my couch like satanic love suicide I actually like it he'll sprints yeah maybe a sandbag workout would be good dig a hole for today I want you to be happy you're alive I want you to dig a hole when you're done we're gonna give you a cold drink it's not bad why Finland why would you escape to Finland I love Finland they said there was a year if this shit hit the fan in America is that what you would do oh no I was just saying saying it's like there's not really anywhere to go really what do you think about it I think Canada is a move at least you would find out what the fuck is going on for a little bit maybe a couple years of safety before you how to escape yeah but let's go back to the Siberians like do they even know about it no and guess what they're just happy they are happy but you wouldn't be happy doing I mean you say you might be adaptable man you would remember the internet you'd remember driving around your badass car listen you a favorite song when I was on my book tour last year halfway through that my house burned down and and it demolished you know just gone down the street from Danny I remember I went I went on the rest of the book to her you know I was like I think I'd like a month or two after and went through Canada and and I just didn't tell anybody just kind of you know hey I'm here I literally had was it and then when I came back you know I told Katmai the other cat my assistant like I don't really want anything when I get back I'm just gonna live it I have a gallery next door to my tattoo shop it's like an art gallery and we had like an upstairs area that was for stock you know and like probably the size of your bathroom or something and like she she went and got like an air mattress from Target which I was like I know it's too much it's too much you know but it was so weird having to or it's too much yeah just it was it was easier just being as simple as possible you know and you don't even want to air mattress you're going so she got it so I got it so then I slept on the air mattress and yeah it was it was was this like an exercise for you like I started letting things go and no I mean I didn't I never struggled with it like from the minute I got the news but um I mean I was in a clear place even when I say exercise I don't mean necessarily like a strain but like a direct path that you chose to take a direct path of much animalist yeah yeah and I mean I've done it like in other ways too it's not a matter of depriving myself but punishing myself you know like right I was like celibate for a year or like oh it's like he leave he's gonna go beat off no oh you don't know him he's crazy he's quick with it - celibate for me back in before we even need them yeah that's great ridiculous I love you when I was at the time they were like like I'm purpose I'm like well first of all I think that's way easier for a woman to do not just physically but psychologically because there's more dickhead dudes and dickhead dudes are dangerous whereas girls that are paying the ask you date them they're not they're very dangerous it's not like the weird feeling so much more emotional get emotional that's for sure but it's not a it's not like like you you've been you beat up or anything like I know women who've been hit by men and then they're done with men for years I mean that that makes sense though to me whereas a guy taking a year off of sex my wasn't you can't find a nice chick it wasn't about like reactive like to something like oh I got hurt no it was just more as making a conscious decision at the time magic yeah just have one year yeast infection that was a mother that wouldn't even go out last we lost you totally man no but you know it was just it's just like I don't know celibacy bores me yeah just checked out Teledyne he's thinking of his new song he's working on jujitsu moves is that naughty show thing I was probably looking at that girl's boob this entire - pretty nice right it's pretty nice for a monitor i'm mannequin it's about as hot as it gets yeah she's pretty sexy she's Brian's all this stuff is Brian's this is nothing to do with me I I don't want to be judged by this he's a silly guy a lot of weird shit really because I said no no no no no no no he just has to probably smoke a cigarette or something he's an odd duck but we make an interesting combination it's good he's a strange fucking dude it's hard finding someone that strange that also is kind of funny and know how to run things so we've got a weird little relationship me and that guy yeah but going back to the Siberians like what about nuclear war we'll get a pass right okay I think I think the Sumerians like we were saying I think they're only happy because I don't know about all the groovy they don't know about iPhone they don't know the iPhone 5 iPhone 5 is gonna be on the weak they don't know about that shit drove yeah it never drops yeah see you're all excited well you're thinking I'm gonna get my assistant to go get me one you know fucking Siberian dudes they'd never drove a nice car never listened to a good stereo they're only they only think they're happy found they're chasing mount beaver pills the shit's ridiculous I think you'd be way more happy like in a way higher peaky or sort of a way but there's a lot of crashes today there's a lot of what does it all mean but then there's like wow it's the most awesome time because we're not ready for that yet there's too much work well it's an amazing amount of work the whole species are lazy it's that and they're also busy you know people have to feed themselves and pay their bills and get caught up in that sort of a work cycle where you're doing something with your time every day just in order to stay alive and it's real hard to get on another path once you're on that path because you said it's just bad habits that's right it's not even bad habits it's almost just necessity if you want to get by in life and you're a person who's you know you you have a degree and then all sudden you have a job and then also then you have a mortgage and you have a family or whatever the fuck it is that you have is it X Y or Z the beginning or is it the full morning money what do you have that's holding you back but when you get to a certain point when you've accumulated like a mortgage and you community a car lease and insurance and all this different shit that you have to pay for constantly it's very very hard to break free and get your shit together it's very hard to do what you're doing right now you got on the right path from you on this like hell-bent for leather thing like it's either gonna work or it's not gonna work but it's pretty good boom it just you just went out there and it worked it worked fantastic and amazing but the reality is for a lot of people then they got on the wrong track and then they got to change tracks that's what shit gets hard the key is you've got to get on that right track from the get-go it's like doing repair work on your life you think so yeah I think you can always if you're willing to just go for it most people are not really financially able to do that it's too hard it's too hard if you have obligations hmm and be hard to live a life that was dictated by it I guess financials yeah it sucks it's nothing never gets done that way you know especially creatively that's like the worst possible reason you could be creating art is like just thing and I'm I get paid just just make you know all your illustrations to be about how much money can I make off of this I wouldn't even work no they come out all clunky and shit and and insincere hat yeah like music or bad comic-book artists right why does he laugh I'm talking about you don't have your own microphone on some comic book artists yeah do you remember when you're a kid you'd get comic books and every now and then some new idiot was like drawing the Hulk and you're like what is this guy doing like the Hulk doesn't even look like this I thought it was worse playing like Pete they they like remember spider-man when MacFarlane used to draw it and it was like really cool and then I guess McFarlane wanted to like leave or whatever into his own thing so they found somebody that just copied his own style is that Todd McFarlane the spawn guy yeah yeah yeah you want to do well we got to get Michael Jai White in here man yeah yeah I got a I think I have his number but let me check it with you yeah make sure it's the same one I ran into him at a pool hall recently yeah he'd be great on I love that dude and he was spawn if you don't know who that was that movie he played spawn which is a fucking bad ass moving but those spawn comic books are perfect example it's like that's just so outside the box like in comparison to like the shit that was around just in the 1950s in the 1960s the really dark storylines and insane artwork know that guy that guy did some wild shit and then it just went away whatever happened that dude I love it she's gonna get set well I'm sure the guy's riches fuck I mean I think if he's gone away it's on purpose you know I don't think it's at all yeah do you know who I'm talking about the guy made spawn did you ever see the spawn comics hogging fire man it's all before your time you know I know it's Geary comics um I like Terry in the fire you're in you're in Tony Hawk's video game art she has an unlockable character he gave me an ass cuz I don't have an ass and I was like I remember they sent me like the the CGI whatever thing and it's like because you go in and they did a little scan thing or whatever and I remember going like whoa you guys give me like oh that's good I usually played you as your character cuz I like playing girl characters for some reason you have to give me like my wristband my hair is all round like it's cool you played me yeah they had that skateboard where you step Darla I don't know isn't my favorite Tony Hawk game but it was that was cool seeing you and that oh man that's awesome there's a weird emotional connection when you tattoo someone like you were on them for life you know I know like for Eddie I mean that that thing is that's very important to him he's talked about I mean he tears up when he talks about his grandmother what does that like for you to have all these people running around there that you have this like intense emotional connection with something that you've created on their body it's awesome I remember one time I was driving to work and this guy was crossing the street and I just he's really really tall and I remember he looked like a businessman with a button-up shirt and he's just walking across the street and like kind of curly hair and I was like staring at him like know what that guy's deal is you know I mean does he do and I could totally draw those like interesting facial features and then I go in to tattoo that day and he was my appointment and I tattooed him and it was the most what it was the most intense story of like living in fear and regret and just making closure with all these with with death which is I think one of the harder or subjects I think for people and and then I remember being done with it and driving back home and seeing him cross the street again to go to where his car was parked and I was like ah it's like every person could be that guy I just always think about that people especially people who pissed me off or annoy me or whatever minds like ah like you just don't know you know so it's a cool connection I think you might be the crazy link to the other dimension it might be you it might have been your magic that you used on Eddie there that's ridiculous you're connected to another of course synchronicity like that all the time that's so bizarre you tattooed you could get a talk into the micro you covered a tattoo once I you talked about this before on a different interviewer you covered a tattoo of a dude on his dick it was so funny because I think it's true when I first got on TV you know like they always ask you like the first I have like elementary questions it's like what was your first tattoo what's the weirdest tattooed and they're always like pussyfoot around like that question like so have you ever tattooed you know like a weird area I'm just like just say it you know butthole have you done bubbles that's very recent the girls are starting to do the Budweiser yes that's awful yeah I mean that's like sacred ground no it's physically you know we take all the funny stuff out it's like physically a very unhealthy thing to do like the amount of the toxins and whatever but anyways maybe wipe so the actual the the the more sensitive tissue it probably give you hemorrhoids immediately I would imagine you know you're gonna have problems dude and then you know that area is really hard to keep clean for some reason you know I would have to go with a doctor drew one on this one yeah I would think about are you crazy pictures of Kat Von D is disgusting but there's no aspect behind that well maybe it's a beautiful job maybe it's like you know some roses in the center of Maral scrunchie and shit and maybe it's just done to be like the most amazing rose like your asshole it looks like a rose now for the cock one did you have to have it hard the whole time when you're tattooing it or do you know what I mean like we were talk to a woman you shouldn't make that jerk off in your face you were you were you actually doing that well I could I could explain the situation because it sounds so much more perverted than it was but like it was there's a guy who you know had been through some times and had gotten a lot of ghetto gang tattoos and stuff at all like homemade like dad you know like guitar string tattoo collection he had and so we went through over the years and redid all of them you know and he had all these brand new tattoos of them covered and improved or whatever and then I remember I mean we became I become friends friends with all my clients cuz you spend such intimate like times like it's like three hours of intense we're not talking about like butthole tattoos we're like talking about like you know life and death and stuff right and or whatever we talk about and um and always I'm always so heavy I hate that but uh he was cool and then he came to me very respectfully with his wife and was like you know I have this one tattoo and now that I'm remarried and stuff I no longer with Linda and like I was just you know I understand if you don't want to do it it's fine but it's just you know it kinda bothers with me why she was a name on the deck Linda won Linda is no so like so she just said la what did you change it to no man it's cool you know it's so like you can't come and so I was like yeah you know like I'll put up like the partition errs you know that you see at the hospital and stuff so the writers can't watch whatever and no you don't get an erection during that time I don't think you unless you spread it out like a butterfly so so Adam lay down and then he whips this tremendous thing it's so crazy like it was like oh why and da apostrophe s it was like ours and apostrophe s Lindos yeah I wasn't hours of tattooing I was just basically saying about a large tattoo his Lodge PS took your time on it as well just to clarify the penis and the tattoo of both Lord I mean it would be like you talking to an OBGYN about you know eight inches she you to you it might have been like talking to an OBGYN to a dude who's got a girl touching his penis even under such inauspicious circumstances and there's like hovering over you know in these whatever it's not that way I mean it's like oh that's so silly it's always that way no it's not there's not ninety percent of it maybe only 10 percent that way but ten percent it's that way they're probably you go to your doctor and he touches your wee-wee 20 but my doctor doesn't look like you if my doctor looked like you and touched my penis I'm sure I'd have a problem yeah well I might have to beat out before I got to the office that way oh my god so glad why don't you go online and look up dr. dr. porn like doctor the female doctors who make out with the man and have sex I know what you need you don't need medicine you need sugar no it's not sad it's just reality there's nothing wrong with that doing reality is very sad it's not sad dudes would be massively attracted to this idea that a beautiful doctor is gonna get intimate with them I'm not gonna but it's but even just touching their intimate parts you know some sort of a doctor sort of a thing like so what's wrong with your penis John alright brought this up all I'm saying is you're a beautiful lady we're a doctor a certain amount of your patients would most certainly love it if you examine their penis you know I don't think it's that way here so much anymore and remind you that this I did that tattoo when I was like you know when you're even hotter everybody's retarded today Jesus Christ Eddie doesn't help your point it doesn't help your point this is when I were you it was when I was 17 drunk back then and I was totally out of shape versus now yeah what you saying this you saying she looks worse no I would never say that to a girl I wasn't saying that ok so I polish so what did you turn it in I was trying to be funny it said at the time he just wanted to get he said Linda's apostrophe s like Brenda's dick Wow she's this Linda's Eve not anymore I wonder if Linda's still alive fuck yes alive Linda's she took Griselda Blanco's place in Colombia Linda's down there running shit Kapaun motherfuckers and drive around on a ten-speed so what did you turn it into I mean I think it was it's a biomech on that it's crazy all my oh my all my work goes down to this some Giger shut our 700 would not listen we're definitely not saying though you should have just did the portrait of his new wife now top of that shit with a chainsaw cutting Linda up if you chainsaw hitting linen and blood splattering all over so it's not Linda's fuck that bitch why didn't he ops to get the laser on the penis you know I don't [Laughter] like scanning my brain for any other tats here everything works out burning laser needles are you are you like you have to like pull on it and snow how did you make a butterfly yeah well a frog no I mean like if somebody was sitting like if he was sitting here then I would get dental bibs around all of it and then I would just god this is awful no it's not no I know there's no there's not it's in no way is it sexual core for sure no we're not saying that we're not saying you got off it is a very extraordinary time in the moment it was it was that's like one of those Daniel Tosh I'm sorry with the moment it wasn't forever he's ridiculous yeah look it's it certainly was not sexual I mean it has to be insanely painful you'd have to be like a really sick but then there's a lot of sick fucks who look really into pain right no I think he was more embarrassed than anything and he's really again like yeah I think you I would have made sure it was him to have sex right before just in case do you think that's Linda's go to shit then Linda just you gotta tattoo my name on yo dick the only way this kind of work she's like she's kept like a headboard with like notches and how many dudes have tattooed her name on their deck chick is what a gangster chick that chick must be maybe it was his idea to get her back don't doubt it we need another story you guys are so friends right no dude I'll email them no you don't know but you dick just curious you don't have to answer have you ever been in the middle of tattooing someone and for whatever reason you just told them to get the fuck out of there like I can't do you you're giving me bad energy you're annoying you're you're crying too much have you ever had like the stop a tattoo hmm probably cuz of stench a couple times no Bo or anything um bad wiper no I don't know um there was one tattoo that I have fuck these don't sound like interesting stories to me but they probably are oh yeah twice there was two different people that like their wife went into labor during their their tattoo one of them was probably because they knew the wife knew that you were tattooing the husband and to know it was so awesome like what Trevor was like Mira tattoo chick oh no I this is a great story because it was it was very sweet actually it was Mira Sorvino husband and she he was getting a pin-up girl version of her tattooed on his leg and then halfway through he got the phone call and were like aha we'll just finish it another day yeah that's sweet I thought that was nice oh that is sweet for sure yeah is there an interest does anybody ever come to you with some like crazy demonic shit and you're like I just don't want to get into this I mean I don't do any tattoos that really go against any of like my moral I mean you know the crazy thing is nowadays it's so different than it when it used to be like I used to I just tattoo a lot of the people who are getting tattooed by me now are just more serious collectors so I'm not really dealing with a lot of riffraff or weirdness so yeah but in the past I'm digging deep into the past right now so yeah I mean there's some times people would come in and wanting to get tattoos that I don't necessarily agree with or like I don't I don't need the money so I don't need to that to you if I don't feel good about it you know if it's something creepy yeah even though it is my gift to the person it's also a collaborative experience so I have to feel good about it so it also goes for like things that I don't think I'm good at you know there's certain things that are I'm not I'm just not good at that I would bet that you would be really good if you wanted to do like some call booth type shit evil shit I like stuff like you do that kind I mean yeah I like just all kinds of art you know I mean I think some of the creepiest stuff is a lot of like the old Catholic artwork and it's the reason that it's so striking and it's so you know it affects and moves people's because there's like it's very it gives you fear it's amazing it's powerful so I love that stuff you know I wear a lot of crosses and stuff and it may not be for the meanings that most people assume I just friend of mine went to Italy and while he was there he took a photo of the ceiling of some religious place that the outside edge of the photo the center is heaven and it's like and the outside edge is all these demons and they're shoving like pitchforks up dudes asses it's crazy back really intense just like I think painted in the 15 1600s isn't like the Danish I think he was I mean that shit was so ahead of its time oh yeah it's crazy scary and back then I mean they really believed that - I mean when you were drawing those paintings of the that demons skewering dudes and their assholes like people really thought that that was gonna happen to you if you died and you went to hell well I think a Caravaggio is one of my favorites you know from that era I think he was one of the first more influential painters of the time that started doing renditions of biblical stories and stuff but painting like Jesus and painting Jesus more than like a very human-like fashion so it was even more real do you know what I mean it was like this you know gold and like aura and rays and wings and all that stuff it's like even made him look like you and I and so you would see like crucifixion pieces and stuff that I mean you feel it it's like it's fucked up when you look like all the old crucifixion images evictions are crazy just to begin with straight up it's a crazy way to kill someone I mean yeah it's nuts but but in the old pictures he was always like in pretty good shape except for the holes in his arms I mean he wasn't all fucked up he was body fat was he was okay it wasn't all fucked up be like the Mel Gibson movie yeah but you like the interpretation of it now it's like if you go to see that Mel Gibson movie if that's our version of what would have happened when he and that was horrific I mean it was really scary shit like the the beat that they did to him in them say it had to have that fake body that was like bleeding in all these different areas I mean it's like a fake like the medieval torture devices that have been made and it's crazy that people even like invented or thought of things that yeah the racks and just horrifying yeah yeah no have you ever seen that what does hitchers of the cat piano they used to have this is not only like a hundred years ago nowhere they had like a bunch of cats lined up and had these things that poke the cat and make them meow and you played the piano well yeah they didn't give a fuck about cats back then yeah the mortality rate for people I do too I love my cat more she would stop peeing in my fucking house little bitch I only have one I'm not a crazy cat lady I just love my cat another one it's the opposite he's got full hairy because your cat would just kick his cat's ass whole time this cat's a fluff ball that's cute I can't stop my cat from peeing in my fucking house sheis likes to knock people where the litter beer boxes just be the most boring interview you guys like talking about well I don't know I thought we always go there what do you listen we go within here we might be talking about this seriously no it's not boring to us you're not boring at all don't even say that that's not what it is cuz we just would talk about anything and everything there's the cat clock yeah the fucking thing goes off every hour meows yeah real cats in ten minutes what the fuck there's cats all over the desk clearly the guys obsessed with cats oh yeah you something wrong with him I don't know what it is I just think the lucky cat I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him but he's okay do you ever do tattoos I've done done one yeah a couple back in the day yeah what did you first start off practicing on Jews pigskin no I just had two people but I was underage so I had a plethora of friends that were under agent couldn't get tattoos that they were just Oh while she tattooed them where'd you get the needles um well at the time I had a friend that believed in me and he worked at a shop I mean you know I was this was in the ghetto in San Berdoo you know so it's like things were a lot different than they are now and so like my first shop that I worked at I remember it was called Sin City tattoo at the time it was like on Highland and East Street which is like such a really gnarly part out there I don't know if it's cleaned up but I know there's a jail right down the street but um that's never good yeah there's like people getting robbed all the time except us because I think we were tattooing all the thieves and stuff but and and back then like the wars between tattoo shops are so different and there's all bikers you know like my my boss come to think of it like probably that probably wasn't even is in real name I mean I don't you know like he was gnarly I mean there was wars between tattoos oh yeah like if you opened up a shop in a mile radius that you would get I mean we I remember we'd get shot at what is it called something cocktails with the fire in each Molotov yeah we get those through the window really oh yeah it was crazy it was while you guys were working this would happen it was half the time I mean I think my first yeah I mean it was pretty brutal there's reasons for my I feel bad for my parents but they're like oh my god Wow and I was 16 when I first got into that shop and I remember going hey man I'm underage and he's like he looked at my shitty portfolio of Polaroids that were blurry and crappy and he's like yeah and then oh I should have my drawings and he goes ah okay yeah you could do it and he used to say you're gonna fly far far away what I'm like no I'm gonna stay here forever like see you later Sam you know but wow you sold them down the river you know it was such a rough it was such a rough place too you know it was just a rough place for a 16-year old girl to be at but Bernardino's rough 460 yeah totally it's rough for everybody that's a that's a tricky area yeah and I lived right down the street at this with the prostitute at the time it was rough you know I mean she was awful we buddies no no I met her because I had been working at a movie theater before that passing out popcorn and like she worked there and I needed a place to stay next to the shop and so I would pretty much take care of her kids while she would go in and out of her drug coming to us so sad it was very sad really hard but I knew that if I could be close to the shop I could tattoo every day and practice and I would literally go in and open the shop and stay till midnight like you know it was like 11:00 to midnight every day I tattooed so much back then how long did it take before you were comfortable with the medium of skin of like moving it around pulling it to manipulate it yeah yeah I was be comfortable from the beginning but that was because when tattooing I'm professionally outside of a shop not I didn't know what I was doing so it there was no bar to I was like oh cool you want to get a misfit skull it's awesome and like I would just tattoo it and it'd be like yeah I was like eight hours later like but then once I got to my first shop I had unlearn a lot of things and I was like what there's more than one kind of tattoo machine and different needles and the cleanliness and the sterility aspect of it all the important stuff and so I'm just relearning it but looking back you know it was actually awesome that I was brought up in that ghetto upbringing because it definitely is the reason why I tattoo the style that I do because you know gangsters get cool tattoos day I'll get all the fine line black and gray stuff and then I did a lot of names and memory of x' and all that stuff and Old English lettering and lots of high nose and gestures and all this I wanted to be a comic book artist when I was a kid so yeah I drew a lot of really good different wild shit one of the things that I did is I drew on my friends I would just draw on them like I would draw fake tattoos on them really intense detailed fake tattoos it would take like hours yeah and I did that because I was thinking about getting a tattoo ah oh yeah yeah I still draw yeah yeah I'll show you I'll send you some shit but my best stuff was when I did it every day and that's when I was in high school when I was in high they had one kunti teacher in high schools and our teachers just so negative yeah I want to have anything to do with art anymore I was like this guy's just a downer he's always I failed my art classes in school a lot of visitors because I was too punk-rock to follow instructions but I want to draw things the way they are I don't I don't I mean yeah let's learn about like the history of fucking cubism or whatever the fuck you know but like when it comes to drawing stuff I don't want to do two point perspective I just want to do it as it is and like I'd rather draw this stapler like as it is versus like you want to do what you want to do as well yeah like you can't you can't teach in spirit like you know I mean right you can teach technique but anyways I've failed I would fail all this these these classes and I'm like I don't need this shit yeah it's like you you have an idea that you want to get out you have your expression that you want to get out and the problem is when someone says no I don't want you to get that out I want you to work on that it's like you you have these brief moments where these doors are open where this creativity wants a run-through when you're sitting there I mean one sense it's good to be disciplined it's good to be regimented and it's good to have good fundamentals but it's also good to just let it go when you want to let it go like you could learn all those things in your own time as far as like perspective I think there are and I think there are some good art teachers out there but I think that would be such a tricky thing to do because it's such a personal thing too you know yeah it would require a person that was well you know Doug Stanhope and I we've talked about teaching comedy classes that you could never first well you could never charge like there's a lot of people that have like these comedy classes where you you know you they charge this ridiculous amount of money go through all this crazy bullshit with them and they pretend to turn you into comedian you're like it should be free you can't charge and you really can't give him any fucking advice because he's almost nothing you can tell him yeah that should be what the comedy club I was last one of the last comedy shows that came to us right here oh really yeah you're here all the time and matter of fact we're here Wednesday night is Joey Diaz Bryan Callen Duncan Trussell and me anything maybe Bryan if he's talking to my sweetie it's a long story deep story okay we won't go into that but um yeah it's um just awesome planes come when the ice house comedy club has been around forever it spins here 1961 I think that's when it first was opened yeah it's like 50 years yeah I did my first set here in 94 really yeah I want to first moved here from New York comedy's hard man there's like well I mean I just think it's like it's it's not anybody could just go up there and tell a story I mean some people are really good storytellers but I think there's like a whole thing to it you know well you know how for you when you sit down and you draw you know you're the you know it's like you know you know you know how to fucking draw you've been doing it forever but if you had never done it before I practice it before really forced your hand to move in the way that you want it to in order to create this image it'd be almost alien almost impossible for a lot of people they look at the artwork that you do and it's almost incomprehensible to wrap their head around how much how someone could recreate something like that how can you do that how can you do that it's the same thing with comedy you do it enough times or Jujitsu you door music you do it enough times and it just becomes it becomes you it becomes yeah but yeah it's hard to get there but not really I mean it isn't it isn't it's like Joey Diaz said it best he said comedy is the hardest easiest thing you'll ever do because it's fucking really good at it yeah to get it to where it's easy I just can't imagine drawing without an eraser for a tattoo artist that just seems to me like the scariest thing in the world because I've never drawn something that I didn't erase something on or change or wish I did something different and it is there times when you're tattooing oh shit I have to now work around this well you also got to think about the time you're putting as opposed to time she's putting there when she's doing like you know you probably tattooing 810 hours a day right how many hours a day you're doing this nowadays were you so many hours I never I didn't have a day off until my first days off I started like three or four years ago I started taking Sundays off Wow did you ever have any idea that you could have some sort of reality show type success like TV I mean was there any idea that you could have this kind of success I mean did you ever think that did you have this in your head like things and like I see things differently some I don't know I just see things like like oh there's an opportunity or oh that you can make this out of that you know and I think a lot of people may be just blind themselves to that so I don't know I never wanted that it's not that I actually was but it didn't exist before well it didn't exist celebrity tattooist didn't exist I mean there ed hardy type dudes there was a few names yeah you know the poles I never I mean if you knew where I was born and how what I you know where I come from it's like totally different than its opposite of this stuff you know but I don't know it's not I don't know I'm not that impressed by that stuff it's cool it's cool and I'm very appreciative it's like awesome like oh I get to do more of this stuff you know but well when I talk about it I'm not saying it in terms of like your your your common perception of how people view success and look at her she's on TV yeah that's not that what I mean is how receptive people are and how much resonance your work is having on people never in a million years imagined that yeah I mean I was like you know like I was like the weird girl you know like the fact that maybe that's why I'm bad at compliments and stuff so you know it looks like I'm just not used to that still yeah that's gotta be kind of awkward right it's a it's a really fascinating but not that I'm not like how he thinks I used to be I guess oh that's when you were hotter back oh oh see dude I told you she's still riding on that we let that joke we let that joke fly over our hands but she's still holding on to it laughs it's like a hot lava rock in her arms burning her soul by the way look how beautiful her shoes look today Joe there's such a stigma even I'm guilty of it to you growing up you think tattoos like for me tattoos look my uncle's had tattoos that you know I'm sure that influenced me but you know generally girls that got tattoos they generally weren't haut-brion generally yeah and I can imagine the amount of guys that like damn she's so hot she's ruining herself with the tattoos or something and now look at her now you know what I mean most guys wouldn't think that them that's an illusion that girls have I think you know it's most guys you'd be amazed at how little we give a fuck about like guys shapes you change the perception single-handedly though oh yeah we without a doubt you definitely threw a monkey wrench into the whole idea of what's hot and there was there was one movie because you took it deep there was a movie with Will Ferrell I think it wasn't like an extreme comedy but the love interest and they never really addressed it in the movie how to sleeve right love interest had a sleeve and I think it was fake or whatever but they never talked about it she was just a chick who worked at a bakery and Will Ferrell I think that's it was like fell in love with her or whatever and that never existed yeah and all the movie offers I've ever done are like hooker drug dealer vampire zombie random goth chick yeah that's never club scene the key yeah it's weird how the the perception of what tattoos are over the last couple of decades like when I was a kid no one had sleeves my friend's dad's never had you know that's weird but then you know but today it's so common it's I mean what are the how much more common are tattoos today than when we were kids huge and you know Victor a really good friend friend of ours has a son his name is Tory and Victor has sleeves he has a lot of tattoos and his son is 11 or 12 now and the last time I hung out with the Mis son was drawing on himself for the whole night he had like just marked he felt like really cool cuz he was like his dad so that would be a key for sure he's gonna get tattoos it just seems like he is yeah kids are always more open-minded and stuff because they're not like but he were he would get the tattoos because he thought it was cool cuz his dad because him and his dad have an amazing relationship there's there's there's no lack of love in that kid's life yeah you know it's true though his dad's awesome oh yeah yeah that kid probably mom it's a weird rite of passage thing too for a young man it's like when some young kids want to smoke there's you know they're not around their parents gonna have that cigarette pretend to be an adult and if they have friends that smoke like older friends or something yeah that or if they see their parents do it they sneak him out and they get him together you know that's what I did when I was a kid we sneak out booze saw our parents drinking so I'd find booze my parents house and sneaking out into the woods and we would do it because we're pretend to be like adults you know installing really like we wanted to get drunk we're like 11 you know you know kids do that they what the hell's wrong with me man my parents are so square and like it sounds like your parents are just super discipline yes where did I get it from maybe it's just a reaction to that the fact that you had a practice all the time and you were very very regimented and disciplined and and you just became a wild sort of thing because of that because the fact that you were so boxed in by a rigid sort of but it wasn't wild I mean mom and just looked crazy but I was I just loved punk rock it surprises music the influence of music I think it was I was like there's something there's more out there yeah if you're totally into punk you're gonna get some tattoos eventually you're gonna get something something yeah if you're really into punk that black flag thing you might get that I just barely got those bars to a boy like last month that's like can't believe having the Black Flag bars yeah oh really just got them all that's cool yeah oh my god I forgot that one shit how do I not have that already do you uh I mean you said you covered up some that were on your left arm are you done covering up or do you look at your old like like one on my leg that I started lasering would hurt so much else I just again time consumption it's harder for me to get tattooed because I'm busy they're doing them or doing all the other stuff I do so it's like but yeah there's a few I think I would I mean just for the sake of making more room or something like crazy maybe just spend doctors will become popular again do you have any bands that are just like totally whacked at a tattooed on you but I mean at one point in time you loved them and now you're like a tattoo those guys on me I think I've always liked rad music always been cool you've always had good taste so with the ones that you were you're thinking about lasering off you just have some ideas you need some space for it no I mean I there's just something that like I don't have regrets like I can live with them or without him you know but I think like I it's not I don't know like I haven't had that many boyfriends in my entire life you know because I'm to the q-tip Island you got to be quicker with that Brian like I've gotten tattoos for maybe the whole oh that's what it was well that's a terrible you know the end of this sorry I'm just hearing you guys I'm sorry so you don't have you haven't had that many boyfriends yeah and I mean I think I've gotten like some tattoos for whatever those relationships and passing I like my first tattoo was a J and whatever I still love it but I think there's like two portraits I'd like to get lasered off you it seems like for you I mean it seems like at least if I had a guess it's probably very difficult for you to enter into a relationship because you seem to be like one of those all in sort of girls like you follow someone and yeah yeah yeah so you're ready right away all in all or nothing and then it doesn't work it's nothing and then it's like it's hard to make that it's hard to pull that trigger we what do you mean what's hard to pull that all or nothing trigger I don't know any other way that's what I'm saying I mean it seems that that's your style you're yeah no no it's but it's hard it's not bad which is you look if you break a connection with people that are like true or true to themselves and like most of the time people when you meet them they're putting like putting out like a perception of themselves as how they would like to be seen so you're already going through like two layers right there of what the person really is or sometimes they might even be bullshitting themselves yeah so like whereas I'm not by any means perfect but I pretty much like I talk a lot I talk about the same stuff like this is the same conversation I'd have with like my homie it's like right I mean like it's kind of what you see is what you get you know and I've only met very few people that are that way and and so I think that often times you tend to fall in love with this perception versus the person and so in my case sometimes I feel like it's all its it tends to be intense in the beginnings and then I'm on continue being on fire and then maybe it's not so much that way but I'm also a very emotional person I'm like very you know till the bitter end well sometimes people can bullshit you for quite a long time before you really get used to what they're really like yeah yeah it's three or four months in you like it is a short amount of time yeah it is but you could find out everything about someone three or four months of constantly being with them they can only hide there character for so long which is I think but I always wonder about like dudes like Paul McCartney Paul McCartney's a bad motherfucker but then you'd hear that ex-wife talk about him and taut you ever heard it the one the one who would lost her leg in a motorcycle accident no she's demonic I mean he would talk about Paul McCartney was like the most terrifying thing like she's ridiculous I don't want to hear about that super negative if we want to hear super negative about if anything ever happened to her she has information hidden to protect my husband she was like just a crazy evil person who wanted stacks of cash from him and his dumb ass didn't get a prenuptial and he got roped in by a woman pretending to be something she wasn't and then once he had a kid with her she just turned on the hooks and fucking ripped her chest open and a monster flew out and that was her and that was all the interviews after that you would listen to the interviews and you know how did he not see this common man how did he not know that he was with a crazy person of this sometimes you want to believe in I think people's ability to be something you know yeah for sure but also he came out of a long-term relationship with Linda McCartney who was supposed to be an amazing person like a really nice sweet woman by all accounts they got along great so he's probably his ideas of what relationships were like he really thought that's what you did you know you find someone you're just nice to them they're nice to you and this is just the way she really is he didn't even look for all the clues of crazy maybe I mean who knows you know I mean I always think it's like unless you're in it you really don't know what's going on you know and I mean right that's why I speculate it's fun and you talk shit at the same time great it's good times speculating and talking shit and how Paul McCartney got roped in yeah I don't know so you haven't had that many boyfriends because of that because no no no I just I know I think I haven't had that many worries because I'm always in long-term relationships I think that's what it is so you haven't had any boyfriends what did he come up with thank you Brian thanks for getting come on our tattoo again it's really story you're the most ridiculous yeah it's hard as fuck but you gotta fight the right person that's what it is I mean the right person for you might not be the right person for somebody else and fine finding that perfect interaction with people it's almost impossible so hard it's so hard to line up especially for a chick like you because you have to have some like some serious bad motherfucker you can't just have like some regular tude when it comes to like the amount of like solidness that I guess yeah but for do to not be tweaked by you being all hot and famous covered in tattoos and all wild crazy famous tattoo later you got it obstacle you need like a brave heart dude yeah you know maori warrior - yeah it's like it's just scene I think I would just want to be with somebody who who can get it you know and like I could relate to or understand he's putting himself out there that's what he's doing is my creepiness yeah like a woman like Jennifer Lopez she's doomed to a life of betas she's gonna have to date these beta men and buy them cars and they'll be younger than her and that's it that's just the way it goes from now on there's just no way because should be a batterer motherfucker than Jennifer Lopez good luck good luck fella who the fuck is is there it's like this little you got like Brad Pitt and a couple other dudes the only people who can date her her dating pool is down to like five people and most of them are married already it's like good luck but she's got to go the other way I think I'm gonna have to have to go that way too you're gonna have to get some beta manservant type dude telling you that's why I want to bring Brian into your life shit would be perfect would worship you set up set up your website [Music] he could really spice up your Twitter background it's the fucking that's the the big mean if you if there is one dilemma that people find in life that's most prevalent in our society it's finding the right person it's like probably the the biggest dilemma that anybody ever faces when you're growing up especially I mean you know you're always like man if I could just find the right girl if I can find the right guy for everybody that's like that's the number one delay like it's more just like working on yourself first and then then you put yourself in a position you know I mean because I know that like in the past where you know it's kind of like the hippie stuff we talked about earlier it's like you know water seeking its own level and I feel like like I look back at like my last you know the relationship that was an awful mess it's like part of me feels like oh my god I got duped or something but then another part of me is like I created this to a certain degree to if it's like if there's like there's red flags that I failed to see because I wanted to believe that it was something else and and people do that all the time so it's more like okay well at the end of the day like what's wrong with me you know what I mean like what what was my part in it what could I have done to not you know obviously that does not discredit people's like shitty behavior you know obviously some people suck and stuff and some people are really good liars and whatever but like I think but do you have to grow as well yeah I think it's I think it's more important to put yourself in a situation where you can be receptive to a healthy relationship like you know when I was depressed I like kind of gravitated towards other people that were also sad and and that doesn't help you know I mean so I think as far as like what you're saying is like finding somebody a level or whatever yeah there's that nice understandability like you know I can talk about things that bug me that may not bug like a regular person or whatever but it's more like the connection of the mind you know I want to be inspired by somebody who's equally has driven it equally like wanting to create and like that shit drives me crazy like when someone's into it you know whether you're a busboy or if I couldn't famous yeah what I'm saying is you're fucked you're never gonna find it dude like yeah yeah so I read poetry I think that crazy thing is the C word earlier Jesus did you really dare you anybody dating like a Jessica Alba that dude has to deal with the fact that she's really good friends with a lot of a list celebrities right so that's what this is the Siberia thing because it's like all those things are mentally generated ideas of what's important or what's good like stat like it like I don't see it that way you know I mean like I'm not saying I could fall in love with with anybody but like if if it's your mind or your soul whatever you want to call it like I could fall in love with that it really does not have to do with what the world's perception of you is yeah you say that but you know find out how much that Gardner makes and like [Music] do you really yeah I think it's probably cuz I was with my own set of issues is like you know I'm not a feminist or like I don't consider myself anything but like I think you know just growing up or I'm always like oh I can do it myself don't write Thor for me okay yeah no that makes sense I would hate to be a girl and have dudes buy me dinner and then expect something from me no I did since your gift is such a difference you know but I also like oh yeah you gotta be single for a long time kid it's not gonna work out damn I'm just saying you too too much of a bad motherfucker it's really gonna be hard how many was rock star friends she's like really good close to yeah get those guys alone they all fall apart that would intimidate some guys those guys would be like damn she's she's a mess friends with ham ham you know that would be the most saddest things if you look really into a rock star and then you started dating him and he was just a whiny bitch you feel like really man you stopped liking him like your fucking music was awesome you imagine if you started dating Mick Jagger just found he's a cunt just Mick Jagger's are fuckin dumb cunt you're like what god damn it that has to be the hardest for a girl date a rock star fine he's a dork that would be the hardest shit ever breaking up rock star Mick Jagger that would crush the rock star fuck yeah rush him yeah Wow yeah that would be devastating rock stars don't get broken up with they do though they get dumped yeah especially in this day and age you know I think in the protected days of the 60s and the 70s like I've read some shit about Hendrix man I got so bummed out because I'm a huge Hendrix fan and I was reading an expert expert excerpt from this book about him and one of them was like about Jimi Hendrix beating the shit out of his girlfriend they like Jimi Hendrix would just smack around but again we weren't there that's the thing it's true you know you're right standing up for woman beaters I like it Jamie kills teen no no you're absolutely right you're the guy was a band member he could have been a jealous bitch he's the guys in the band with one likes lasted as coffee no but I mean who knows what really happened but reading about that it was like wow that's so like you read like some tweets that like Chris Brown makes and he's a fucking moron he makes these tweets and everybody hates I'm gonna go after him then he deletes these tweets what is he just really stupid shit about well he's you know after the whole Rihanna thing he would like getting arguments with people about him beating up women yeah they were they're like really he's a moron so there were like really gross kind of tweets but this this that didn't exist like in the the Led Zeppelin days you know there was no Twitter if they had a podcast or internet radio show we got to hear them argue about chicks on the road you know and you'd be like oh you guys are gross it's like the mystery was so much better than you know it's like Robert Plant the mystery of Robert Plant I remember growing up being a huge epilim fan I mean I barely knew ten words at Robert Plant said in an interview I know I think I heard any interviews I just knew you know I just knew Black Dog was the shit you know I just knew a whole lot of love is like the greatest song in the history the well that's all I knew I didn't know anything about Robert yeah it might be annoying as fuck would you imagine you've dated Robert Plant it just turns out to be a total prima donna it's annoying and stupid and always insecure and once everybody kisses ass like yeah fuck really damn that's like when Mel Gibson was screaming at that ex girlfriend shut up and blow me he's like yelling so much I'm sure she was I'm sure she was but it was like we never got a chance to see someone so human before that was like a fucking Mel Gibson me he was Braveheart and then all the sudden he's screaming to some scammer some Russian scammer chick who's robbing him and recording all of his phone calls shut up and blow me Wow like this is Mel Gibson man this is a weapon dude what the fuck kind of kind of just like that character and Lethal Weapon wasn't he like a crazy you know yeah but he was kind he was crazy but kind to women with the crit the wrong what was wrong was wrong with the crazy first of all this is scary as fuck to a woman who had his child like he couldn't even keep it together to this woman who had his child that was a scariest thing it's like he had a baby with this person she's watching his baby and he's fucking screaming bloody murder at her that's a he's a scary dude you know didn't I freak you out the Mel Gibson shit no no no I just it's like you didn't hear that that thing was in the new now I really don't watch television I'd like I like knowing the human side of people I love reality shows I actually do Mob Wives and ma and mama drama forget about a watch my wives the one with the little girl the mama drama they take they take six sets of mothers and daughters like that party together they're like 43 and 22 51 and they put six couples half of them black half and white in a penthouse in Vegas and they get drunk every day it's hysterical Wow that's great that's genius yeah there's some fun in reality shows but you know it's it's it's really like mindless distraction that's the problem you don't get anything happen times you need that sometimes you need to do you like that I like not thinking about shit and watching South Park or watching some Milan I want to be mindless it's like meditation hmm I don't mind my own sense of its in the form of comedy like South Park it's nice knowing how people really are holy shit mob lives Oh Chicago season like you won't really like that they're not know I mean I think you're put in a hyper it's such a yeah alcohol they make them live together I totally believe it not really however but really are people that are acting like that on camera because that's that shit somedays Mob Wives comes out are you kidding me that's so stupid the the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills I watched The Real Housewives of Miami ad the other day just the ad and I cringed and I just grabbed the remote control I shut it off quick like just thinking that these women could enter into my life somehow or another through me watching them on TV but somehow another they could make their way into my life and be annoying and yapping at me and they were hitting each other and screaming each other you know in Miami you got to do this and you do that oh come on I don't watch that show just I don't watch all reality show it's just a couple but is it oh my god there's got to be fighting and violence if there's not fighting I don't to watch is that a weird position for you to be in a reality show when you you know you you're you're you got a very different sort of a reality show because it's obviously a reality show about your artwork I mean it's about your expression it's about let me know originally we had a docu-series it was a very formatted show was like we're you you that the premise was like you would learn the story about the TAT like the story behind each of the tattoos and the interaction between tattooing a client and then that and then like it was 80% of the show and then 20% of it was our own personal life stories you know that were somehow connected to tattooing and then as the show went on I can't mean I can't believe we were on for so long you know and how many seasons we going for it's it's it's weird because contractually it's different we were basically on for 20 so six or seven years wow that's incredible yeah what's a great premise for a show yeah but there's so much story morphing into more that it flips so it's like 20% art and 80% drama and most of it was produced hence that girl got on the show I don't know it was fake yeah yeah well why do that see that's that's Hollywood idiots because I think first of all I'm a fan of tattoos and art yeah of course and I'm just having a show where it was just you produce it you dictate what's going on about an art that seems like you could do that though yeah and people would enjoy it and it would be pure I mean I would watch a time-lapse of oh my god that's all why shouldn't why should you do it that way I mean it seems like someone would be an idiot to try to do it anyway other than your personality why would they deny well you know I think sadly it's the way it's not it's not it's the demand you're I mean it's not the domaine it is the demand because what it is it's like it's it's all based on money and numbers for the network so whatever the situation's and drama show Peaks and they have these tests that they run that's what they and I don't believe in it I can't disagree more with you well this is why listen I would III I'm on your I'm on your side I know you are I know you are but the way that the network sees it is what's gonna generate more money and it's gonna be viewership because they can sell advertisement they're wrong about that I know they are of good strong that's why they've killed I mean yeah well what they're doing is they just go with the box they go with what's word with what's work before this is the formula you know here's the wacky neighbor Shh go you know I mean that's the formula I mean they don't it doesn't have to be that wacky neighbor who you're wacky neighbor Brian you want to be a rocky neighbor he would be awesome at it give you the whacky he's a breakthrough talent I'm telling you you could really knock you guys over the top bring to bring the ratings to the top um it's just people enjoy people who are really good at things I mean that's really what it is it's what people also enjoy train wrecks which is why you love the Housewives you don't only enjoy I don't think they only do but I think that there is definitely oh people that in some piece not everybody but some people get lost in situ but it's not like look there's a lot of dumb shit on my DVR there's plenty of dumb shit I mean I I do i watch dumb shit both for escape and for material because there's some funny shit in it yeah but it's also like a lot of like really intelligent shit on my DVR to like documentaries that Morgan Freeman show through the wormhole amazing show but it's like the same people watch both things and I think that a well produced version of your show that's you decide what the fuck goes on you decide you're the artist yeah you you talk to these people about their their ideas you create their tattoos and stop fucking around with all that fake shit okay they would be beautiful those dumb motherfuckers I'm Kat Von D alone you stupid fucks no I just think Hollywood hacks you just got to cut out that middleman you've cookie cutter cunts you don't know what you're doing leave her alone yeah yeah that's it you tell them yeah those fucks creating some fake nonsense silly silly bitches yeah I ended up just filming like I secretly filmed the documentary for the last three years and we actually finally pretty much done with it and and it's it's awesome it's so freeing you know to be able to do it that way and having the control and stuff and I I wish I could have given as as much as I gave in my documentary to the show but I really couldn't cuz it wasn't mine you know and I should totally have your own show for the Internet it'd be fucking gigantic just just film while you're working you're gonna do it anyway just film while you're working loosely edit it you know throw a little bumper in the beginning throw that shit online I get a million views a day everybody wants to see good stuff I know but I want to create things with a lot of qualities I'm not I can't just like half-ass I have to get like my friend who does you know classic oh sure I'd like to you know you're kind of a control freak too no no I just have an excellent I just having creative intentions right so uh whatever but I mean an excellence freak you want it to be a yeah yeah but I think now nowadays just with everything I've going on it just it's so time consuming to do television do you take on apprentices or do you have assistants or people who ever work with you who want to learn how to tattoo said overhead we kind of like don't let our shop you know I have 20 guys that work with me and I love them we're like we're brothers and sisters funny guys yeah I mean you know this is includes like our shop managers and stuff like that you know and and like Dennis he's like my first guy ever hired he's like still there everybody's we're so close like what you see on television those were you know like the cast members that they didn't work at the shop with the exception of Dan Smith like everybody else kind of just kind of they weren't really the true hbt crew you know I mean right but um and we love each other we love the way it is and I feel like when you have an apprentice that changes the dynamic because it makes somebody better than somebody else in the way that we work is that we're all good at what we do in different ways so we're all better and not as good as each other and we inspire each other and keep each other you know I mean so it's a collective it's totally collective and it's awesome that sounds badass it I mean it's how does someone break into your fold how someone that's the hardest thing is that we've like we've never every time we've let anybody outside the circle and it's never really worked out the way we need it so it's always you know it's it's basically just who we know and were there any people that you were growing when you were growing up that you look towards for for inspiration that that inspire you and and and and like just give you gave you momentum to create or um yeah I mean I think like when I was a kid I used to look at tattoo magazines and when I say a kid I mean like sixteen and stuff and like I remember looking up to Jack Rudy he was like oh yeah the black-and-gray Godfather and all this stuff and amazing work that guy yeah yeah and so the day I turned 18 I beforehand I made an appointment with him and really advanced I was so excited about it and I went and got this tattoo and and I sat there for the fucking six hours it took her whatever and it's one of my favorite tattoos it's so beautiful I still love it but I remember him sitting there going like I you know you guys don't have any business in the business and all the sudden I was like eighteen year old kid back then and you know he's very old school and like sees things a different way and at the time I was like heartbroken you know it was like oh my he's a hero but like he was somebody I admired his work just like shut me down but then at the same time like ah it's cool like I'll should watch this but you know I mean and then and now you know fast forward now I mean we've we know each other and you know he's did you tell my story no he knows it he doesn't remember yeah I bet he doesn't remember yeah but I remember like one of the cool days yeah when I was tattooing unprofessionally when I was like a mature like 16 year old I went into I had heard that there was this girl who owned a shop in Culver City it was like the only female artist that own shop was like whoa and her name was Erica Stanley she was badass and so I remember going down national and and I go in there and I was like oh my god were here and it was just a tattoo shop whatever and I see her and she's like really beautiful and like she's just like a power like she's like a force of nature and she's like can I help you and I'm like yeah you know and I was just probably being over over the cock here thinking that I gained a place in the tattoo industry when I was just a 16 year old little punkin with a bullshit bang on my arm I'm just like oh man so do you have any advice for me and I remember she's like yeah but the best advice I could give you is a run while you can fuck you you know and I'm left and then years later I understood what she meant by it you know it wasn't that she was saying oh you're not good enough it's just like ah like if you got the eye of the tiger you're gonna do it in your figure out yourself there's nothing I could tell it's gonna make you badass you know if I were to sit there coddle you like it's called good as that and she she she saw tattooing as sacred and I remember I went to my first tattoo convention I was 18 I was like Inc sling or don't even have to still it was still around but um and one of these guys that I tats you to vargas portrait on entered it into the contest of best black and gray and she was the judge and you know she never knew my name at the time when I was 16 and I got first place and she voted for me and I remember it going up to check Oh congratulations really beautiful my hey you know what's funny when I was 16 I went to your shop and you told me that I should go run while I can and she goes oh my god you know well you accepted that inspiration the right way yeah yeah and she's still badass it was it was cool you know she still I think a pioneer as far as la goes you know and it's cool the comics and tattoo artists have a lot in common in that it's a very much an outside chance well success we're all fucked up yeah we're both yeah we're both fucked up we both have too much expression and it's a it's one of those things where like you know if you say what does your daughter do oh my daughter's a tattoo artist like oh Jesus your picture in fucking biker bars and I'd be scared if you told me your daughter's a cheerleader because oh yeah football players ridiculous but you know you say all my daughter's Kat Von D it's like oh she's a famous celebrity tattooist I've seen that show she's beautiful she's different sort of you know it's like as you you tell you if you try to tell your parents you want to be a comic they'll look at you like good fucking luck like you need to get a job that's gonna work that's not a what do you really want to do exactly well you know you need to have a back-up plan and you know I don't think anybody before you that's the the nuttiest thing about what you did is you became like I mean ami I guess his famous - but he's not famous in the same way you know that show was that the first show Miami Ink was that the first of those Inc shows he for whatever reason it just it never it wasn't yeah I think some people I mean a guy with the shirt off and I'm not saying that he's not I don't know him anymore I haven't seen him in years since those times and back then I was a drunken mess but you know people can I think he looks get you so far you know and after a while you have to actually care about what you're doing and and you know I mean so I think at the time it was probably hard I could only assume how difficult it would be for something so new like there's a sensation of a new tattoo show and being like the the frontman for that it must be sidetracking at times maybe I'm right and then you can make mistakes that if you could go back and do it again knowing the reaction to all those different things yeah yeah yeah I know what you're talking about it's that you know sometimes it's hard when there's no one fucked up before you know one fucked up before you could watch and learn from they and they you know and that is the case I mean you know we don't live in a vacuum we all need those assholes to show us what's what it feels like to watch someone be an asshole ya know I think it just as much as you need inspirational people yeah I guess we need them all we need everybody right Brian oh yeah over there drinking coke Sarah chugging well listen Kat
