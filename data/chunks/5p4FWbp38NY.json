hello freak bitches what's the turtle thing what's that's a that's a a jocular expression I got some of Stephen Hawking book it's it's a it's like an old comedic reference to the infinite regress problem in cosmology which you know the basically all the shit we were talking about earlier and there's a story I guess there was some professor at Oxford somewhere giving a speech and explaining how the universe works and and and in and everything else and some little lady stood up and said you know that's really clever I know you think you're smart but but you're wrong and I he's like oh yeah well what's what's what's the truth and she's like well the earth sits on the back of this giant cosmic turtle he carries it through space and he said well what's carrying the turtle and she said oh it's very clever but it's another turtle and he's like what's under that she's like you might as well you're wasting your time as Turtles all the way down and so Hawking referenced this and brief history of time and he's weird because you can look back Hindu cosmology and a lot of some Native American tribes they all held these like earthly turtles and high reverence in the symbology of it all and you find that story in different cultures throughout you know space but thousands of years where there's this weird weird reference to this cosmic turtle and now the Indians or the Hindus thought there were these four elephants standing on the back of the turtle and the earth was a flat disk resting on its back whoa and it just cruise through space there's a lot of artwork you can find associated to this I just thought that it was really the the record at its core is about love you know being like this one universal truth you get a lot of people look to religion a lot of people look to drugs I'm not saying you can't get really spiritual experiences from all those things but I mean love at the end of the day is the one thing that really I've ever found forced me to want to wake up and really try to be a better human being every day you know so that was the main point of the album and the turtles thing was just kind of like it's it's a way of saying if you get into an argument with somebody and you realize it's just pointless and you're going back and forth it's Turtles all the way down because like no nobody really no shit you know and we're all just trying to not kill each other so I don't know I've decided it would make a good country song maybe you just need to talk to Kirk Cameron you know you're talking a lot of shit that you don't really know until you sit down with Kirk Cameron mm-hmm I've ever seen his buddy that shows that banana is proof of evolution that was the Ray Comfort yes this dumb fuck who doesn't even understand that we changed the way bananas look like this guy he calls a banana an atheist nightmare have you seen that video it's beautiful man yeah I'm sorry that video is beautiful yeah it's in him and Duane Gish and the Gish Gallup or you're just like throwing a word salad at somebody's like oh well evolution isn't true that's right dude shut up they're all just gay that's what it is that's that's fine I'm racing oh it's great nothing wrong being gay but I really believe that that's what's going on with most of those guys they're the reason why they're so hog wild for Jesus like Kirk Cameron that's a gay man I'm not a gay man but I'm pretty good spotting some things in this life I know what a gay man looks like I don't know what all gay men look like I've been fooled before but you know what I'm saying it's like you put a fucking lizard outfit on Dawg I'm gonna go something's up with that lizard what is this that's him with the banana oh yeah that's there it is yep yeah yeah oh wow man goof bag he doesn't eat but he never even bothered doing the work to understand that we used to have different looking fucking bananas yeah within you know within a written human record like that I think that long ago stupid yeah it's and and somebody brink once somebody brought him an actual non like an original natural banana he's like what's that it's a banana you dumb fuck yeah sorry because he knew that part of his brain it's all just for fighting off cock fighting off the love of the cock so he puts that just I don't have any room for that I can't do that kind of research I'm busy fighting off the gay so I'll just sit here with this banana and just pontificate I mean he could if that if that if as any way shape or form great offices or true it's my thesis why why use such a phallic symbol why did he yeah but for all the same reasons I really he doesn't understand what it's doing it's it's wrong - it's the transference yeah you know into the symbol so it's it's actually giving him power and makes him feel comfortable but the it's it's such a ridiculous proposition that God made a food that we could hold perfectly yeah like what tomatoes are no good like why can't you mean a fucking tomato is pretty easily held - like that's really stupid why isn't it banana shaped which tomato that's true right now you've got cherry tomatoes cherries hothouse great you know all these different ones because we've you know modified that we modified them we got involved your life do you find it really rewarding to be out in this incredibly wild environment like when you come to a city like you go from that to New York City is is New York City just like a cool little vacation for you and then do you do appreciate the wild or do you appreciate in New York because of the wild or both some explain you you know my lifestyle the challenges I face and overcoming that there is such pride in yourself that oh my gosh I did that how cool is that in being such a really little I mean I I terrified of the dark but now I live in a place that's dark for nine months out of the year you know I mean there are always challenges know yourself better yourself you know when I go to a city a bear I know exactly what he wants from me you know pretty much he's either gonna eat you or he wants something here just passing through but it's a pretty honest relationship he wants to eat me I don't want them to you go to a big city and I'm used to seeing my horizon I'm always checking things there's no trees there's no buildings there's nothing tomorrow my horizon I go to New York and you can't go eight feet and you've got a 60-story building how the hell do you check your verizon how do you know what's coming at you you see people but you cannot be guaranteed when I see a bear and he's charging I know he wants to attack me you see a person walking down the street you don't know whether he's going to pull a gun out of his pocket shake your hand pinch your ass or wave goodbye you don't know so that's a predator that I'm pretty impressed people want to be wrong I know when I got here I look at all these lights and all these people I'm like oh my god and they're here on purpose Wow what's weird and so I always wrestling with this whole time because when I go to these places I love the culture I love the people even there I was trying to learn Swahili with some of the the trackers that were working with me rashidi awesome guy speaks only Swahili but so I really invest myself into the culture and I just want to learn and I want to sort of get I want to see things through their eyes well I saw these grass shacks and all these people and you know every grass Shack had six little kids running around it and it's just like I'm thinking this is awful I mean is no hope for six kids at every grass shack that seems I don't know it just seemed very sad to me but we were there getting ready to cross this river in the truck and the river was high so we were kind of out Ryan Shalom is the he's he owns Greenleaf Tanzania and so we're there and we're kind of seeing what's going on and there was a village about a quarter mile away and as we're looking at the river and trying to make a game plan there was music and just people singing and I'm like is it happy hour oh yeah what is going on and it just that really just hit home it's like you know I see him and I think there's no hope and they must be miserable but they're laughing and singing and dancing you said maybe maybe they're okay I don't know I mean are they happy they seemed happy to me so I don't really because so it's weird it's you know I don't know I can I can look at it from the outside and judge and say oh you know you you must be so depressed maybe they're not I don't know
