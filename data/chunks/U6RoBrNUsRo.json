hello freak bitches good Joe Rogan's hmm you have everything go away your kids are fine you hate your relationship school whatever let's take that element out of it let's just take the house the cash the bows and arrows it's all gone good Joe Rogan go live in let's just pick New York this is not a city question but let's pick New York could you go live down by Washington Square Park in a studio apartment have your act have your fans go do your thing and kind of be okay with a low bank account or have you gotten are you at an age now and you've you've had stability do you feel like that would freak you out well it would definitely freak you out if you all of a sudden like one of the things that I've sort of relied on is not needing anything right so by not needing anything everything I do I do because I enjoy it right so if I do stand up I do it because I enjoy it and if I do podcasts cuz I enjoy it if I do the UFC's because I enjoy it I enjoy the money is done don't get me wrong sure but I'm not neat I'm not needy I'm not in a position where I'm like worried about my next check don't leave that stuff so if I got to that yeah I don't even need that stuff like me this stuff is kind of look if you have a car and you can get around you've got food on the table and your family's taken care of everything else is kind of bullshit yes nice it's nice to have a good couch like look we have a 70-inch TV this is nice it feels nice but watch West world on a 70-inch TV it's nice look how big it is yeah but ultimately what really counts is are you nervous are you nervous about your bills because like do you remember that feeling yeah that's a terrible feeling I'm now worried about what that's where that's gonna come from and what you're gonna do but you still have your act you can still go make money but you we're gonna put you back at square one we're gonna put you in that studio apartment could you would you be cool with it studios kinda small what like a four bedroom house in the yard somewhere no but yeah honestly the the big thing and this is such a cliche but the big thing is do I still have my friends do I still have all the same friends because if I lived in an apartment building an Ari Shaffir lived next door hey Duncan live down the hallway and Joey was over the other side yeah I'd have a great time yeah we've all lived on the same floor in the same building I would have zero problem with that if they knock the door hey man you got any weed I'm gonna weed come on yeah that would be no problem at all it's like how much different is that then when you stay on the road in a hotel right cuz a hotel is like a studio apartment yeah and you're right good percentage of our lives we stay in a CEO a lot I know that I really and I bring it up because I really I was thinking about it and it's like if it all fell apart like Ygritte you grab on to your lifestyle and what you're doing so hard but if at all for whatever reason washed away and you still go perform and you still had your friends at this club you can see with it it's it's I could totally do it I could totally go back to I have clothes to fit in this big of a closet yeah and just and just keep doing what I'm doing but in those circumstances a hundred percent in some ways I think you're you'd be lighter you'd be right a lot of people do believe that and a lot of people do go towards that minimalism life where they give up everything yeah my friend Steve Maxwell he's a really world-renowned fitness trainer strength and conditioning coach for a lot of pro athletes a lot of fighters he lives out of a duffle bag oh I saw that guy so you never yeah he used to have a big house right and he had a gym in Philadelphia you'd like one of the very he's one of the very first American Brazilian Jujitsu black belts and he had this gigantic gym where he's teaching and he said you know he's an interesting guy and then he just decided he got divorced right and he decided you know what fuck this he goes I'm gonna live out of a van and he got like a camper van you know yeah and he lived out of that and he's like fuck this van I'm getting a I'm just gonna keep traveling really now he just stays in hotels everywhere and it's amazing and that's what brings it up it's the divorce I see it yeah I I don't think I don't think willingly I would do it but if something was thrust upon me got divorced divorced yeah or some something I would I could go back I could be like dude but you're thinking about it so much you brought it up as a subject some you wonder yeah not as far as the divorce part of it because life yeah yeah because I've built a life that's bigger and more complicated and I you want to know what you want to know what it was last time I was in here I had I had this back issue it was like shooting pain down my arm mmm yeah you had a cervical issue right yeah and I was going to this really great Cairo guy I was doing cupping I was doing all of this kind of stuff and it was just making it worse I was just in worse yeah I was in I was in pain for a like a year I was like in pain Greg Rogel you know the comedian or go he tells me he had really developed debilitating lower back pain and he read sorry yeah I read sorry he's like just read it and I got into this big fight with him in the Sun and know I'm who owns the Comedy Cellar he's calling him a crack and it's a crackpot and it doesn't work and all this stuff and Greg is like just please read it just read it just read it and it's you know what it is it's just basically about that you're carrying your brain wants to go to work on something simple like pain in your body rather than deal with issues of stress and anxiety and anger that you carry all the time and basically just realizing that that's where the pain is coming from don't have to solve the anxiety or the pain or the anger you just have to be aware okay brain I know what you're doing I know what you're working on it just kind of alleviates that stress and then the physical manifestation of not having oxygen go into your into your muscles and stuff starts to slowly release and just it it's gone it's gone it's I have no pain I have no how long did it take after you read the book and adopted the principles like a month and a half really yeah so a year of pain a month and a half of adopting these principles and like what does he tell you to do like what are the exercises that he tells you to do he says just live don't just live your life exercise whatever you were doing do it don't live timidly don't think I can't run now I can't do yoga now because I've got a neck issue mm-hmm do it live your life don't live like in this preventative way if I can't move or I'm gonna mess up my my body so what does he tell you about like physical issues like what if you have a herniated disc and it's pressing against your nerve and it's causing your hands to go numb and your arms atrophying he says there's those are very rare cases that's not that rare my world I know well yeah you're right but he said he says it's very rare cases where there's like a real pinched nerve kind of a problem that seems like crazy advice I know a lot of people that have like real issues like real physical issues it's not a rare thing I don't think to have like disc issues are gigantic yeah cuz people they don't strengthen their spine enough they don't drink in their core enough and they wind up doing something they yank it and they heard it and then they try to work around it and they wanted to reactivating it and then it gets worse and worse he was saying that a lot of times you'll have you'll have like your disk will be bulging a little bit or whatever these little imperfections are and we all have these imperfections in us but when you are stressed and the muscles are tightening around you and becoming inflamed because you're carrying this stuff that you're not working through everything's constricting around and so then it's gonna a great that and that's gonna become a bigger problem I definitely think that's true in some cases but there's like there's legit like I had a conversation with a friend of mine about this or the same sort of a thing and I was like that that's all well and good but I know people who are very light and happy people who develop a legitimate back issue and there's nothing to do with stress that they're carrying around it has to do with the soft tissue that protects your joints bulging out yeah and contacting a nerve look there's a zillion of us out there and I'm sure there's all different issues for it but back to your original question of why am I thinking about simplifying and all this kind of stuff I am a pretty light positive person very optimistic very I kind of live in that world but when I just started reading the book I'm like are things really pissing me off am i stressed do I have anxiety because I live in this house because I'm trying to do these things with my career because I'm trying to always do this because I'm carrying children and parents and all of this stuff I'm trying to make everybody I don't know maybe just realizing that and thinking about it no heavy meditation on it no just being aware that maybe that's where it's coming from I'm telling you over a month and a half the pain slowly went away and I don't have it hmm yeah that is interesting so what like what was bothering you before like I know that you're you know you're successful and you had a television show for a while and you've got a bunch of projects going on you're always doing stand-up in specials so you've had a lot of success you've got a lot of great stuff going on what was what was kind of chewing at you I don't know I'm not really a hundred percent sure of what the source is but I do feel like I have a lot of people on my back and it's all up it's all quiet it's all in my head you know what I mean a lot of people on your back yeah I've got a wife I've got I've got kids I've got pets I've got family I've got in that you feel that there's a weird weird way to bring bring this up but is that how much of that like having a wife and having kids obviously there's going to be compromises and there's going to be stress that comes along with any sort of relationship but do you feel like it was tipping more towards the negative then towards the positive I don't think it was I think I just the whole experience to me seems positive my relationship with my wife is great the kids I adore I feel like it's all positive but I do carry the burden of everybody's worries and everybody's well-being all the time I was working on this acted this joke in my act before I started thinking about all this stuff I had this moment when I was standing in this house I moved to this bigger house it's a really nice house it's a bigger a bigger home and I was shutting off all the lights this is what I was working through on stage and I was turning off all the lights one night and locking the doors for all the bad people that are coming to get us and everyone's in their beds and the cat's asleep and the dogs asleep and everybody the lizards asleep and it just all my responsibility washed over me like everybody every living thing here is is depending on my success if I don't keep going if I don't keep succeeding this everything here changes everybody's little life everybody's perfect little existence it's all washing over me and I can't tell anyone about it I can tell you the audience but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed at 2:00 in the morning when I have that feeling honey do you ever do you ever feel like you just can't do it anymore you ever feel like you can't you just want to stop you just want to take a break think about my daughter with my fears I can't do that I don't tell my wife that stuff I don't tell my kids I just carry it so when I started reading this book I'm like maybe I'm just taking all this really seriously and feeling like mmm extended with the new home is that it because a lot of times I have a friend of mine I did that recently bought a big place and he can afford it but kind of you know it's like okay think about this now yes I'm a I'm a big advocate in never doing that yeah I don't think you should ever buy a big place unless you're like hey we can get a nice place now I'm not even think about it it's no we're totally cool we can do it and it's you know I had a really small place for a long time and did all the right things so it's the outlay isn't no different from my little place before it's all cool but when you walk into a place like that it just feels bigger engine you know the first time I bought at home ever I had this little place in Studio City it's a little you know I just I remember laying on the couch like I don't know if I can do this I got a sign this paper and every time the mail came for the first year that I owned a home I thought it was gonna be a notice thing you've got to get out of there now you know what I mean yeah I just was fearful about it mortgages are weird man it's like you here's a bill for 30 years right yeah that's heavy that weighs on you yeah so that's what just brought me to the feeling of like well maybe just going back and live with my wife in that little studio apartment in New York again wouldn't be so bad kids a freak out the kids would freak kids would hate it the kids are happy go dad you need to be more successful yeah just take your pressure like a man bitch right why'd you downsize who cares if your next crisp as if your arms go numb I want to go to Berkeley everything's your teeth so I don't know I mean cuz it's it was a little self-aware moment because I do like I said I'm I feel like I'm pretty carefree but why the hell was my neck so [Music]
