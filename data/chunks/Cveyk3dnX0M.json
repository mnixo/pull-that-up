the Joe Rogan experience are you from military background my dad you know my dad was so that's what my parents met my dad was stationed in Germany my mom was fleeing Thailand um to her her first husband was like physically abusive to her so she was leaving Thailand and she came to Germany to find her a GI and then found my dad she came to find a GI specifically well you know I think she was coming to get away but right now it she wanted to she wanted a better life for her at the time and my dad was in the hospital and so my mom was taking care of a man oh wow look at him food and made him fall in love there you go and my dad always jokes he says he tells us a story all the time he's like yeah your mom's taking care of me and then she told me that you're pregnant and then twelve months later you were born oh that's funny but now they fell in love it was just a really long pregnancy just weird just kind of weird I don't know why what a carriage a red fox dead boy he wouldn't pay his taxes so the government came down one night when he all the people in the room just took everything everything which his house took everything he took a ring off his finger he took his shoes they took him hello never my chicken raw to cook in the oven and so he they shut him down his place he had I think I'm not cynical somewhere it was in LA in LA so he crying oh he called Sammy Davis he called Sammy called Frank Sinatra names everything I own I worked so hard to be Who I am I've named own I just Texas ain't that bad that they took everything so Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis jr. and some others if other friends went to his club and worked two or three weeks every night two shows sold him out to get enough money to pay get his taxes and get his club back he was so happy to everybody oh my god I won't thank you for doing with this me oh please just take my big mouth made my whole set me just hug you hugging everybody so they all went only separate ways with Fox still in peace fucking taxes oh come on lean on the dais you sumbitch you do day wake up franksen afternoon but I coming back now see will pay taxes again he pay no taxes was this before after Sanford and Son is before and I bet I don't think I mean you don't hit it to craft maintaining it is there's an art to that right because you work so freaking hard to get to where you're at and then you get there and it's like aw fuck what do I do like there's no rest there's no rest everything that was acceptable before becomes unacceptable because now you're up here you know I mean so it's like yeah you have to you have to you have to pick your shots and like you know I'm saying can't really like just go crazy like you did back in the day so there's an art to it you know what I mean and that's how you really maintain and stay in that spot and even level up so do you consciously think okay balance out enjoyment with things that I have to do to stay disciplined 100% yeah 100% that's a very smart way of looking at yeah yep 100% like those there has to be a balance of each because it's like all right now I'm at this new level like whether I want to behave like this or not I put myself here I worked hard now I'm with these elite motherfuckers so this is the this is how I have to act because I'm not down here anymore I worked from here to get here yeah so what happens you balance you put things into place you do a little bit of this and a little bit of that instead of a lot of that you know I mean and you just pick your shots and it's like you're gonna get everything in the end this is how it's just planned and how it's supposed to be but you just piece it together just a little bit differently like I just turned 31 well damn about to be 32 that's young too a lot of people that's old to some people as well but for me it's like there's a whole new mind state you know what I mean and I feel like through my 20s I was actually like a fucking teenager and like now I'm an adult so now I look at things a little bit differently as like you know I was really a kid this is how you behave as an adult for the rest of your life and it still involves a whole bunch of partying and having fun but the business gets handled and things get approached totally differently that's a balanced way of looking at a man I love it mm-hmm enjoy it this other think to like people have to understand to to be someone like you to be a very successful rapper mm-hm and to not expect you to live the way you talk about all the time right so ridiculous right all right like you don't think he wants a party he's talking about parties all the time I think he wants the party party this is just an act yeah yeah it's weird right it's crazy as fuck because people they want you to be you they want me to be myself right they want a party they don't want to take shots they want to smoke weed they want to stay up all night yeah why is that bad it's nice so many people want to do it but it gives this image in some people's minds and like frivolous life mmm frivolous thinking Marty mm-hmm what are you doing drinking and smoking and then they come around and do the same thing because they want it it's like I have like a weird place in life where I think I'm like the key to a lot of shit because it's like if you want to enjoy yourself I'm a guy you know what I mean it's like oh man I'm just fuckin gonna live through is when we're shows up he's gonna light the joint it's gonna be amazing if you want to fucking be professional like especially when will I do because there's a whole lot of rappers who like aren't business you know I mean they're not thinking like that mmm so for those guys I'm their guy like though they look at me like where's how's his shit together like he he handles his business he talks to people he shows up he does this he does that so to be the party guy and the business guy it's like amazing you know I mean it's a it's a lane that I kind of carved for myself but it's me in real life so it's like that's the only thing I have to do is really just completely be myself just be 100 fucking show up do my business thing tell people do the right thing and fucking lie to joy that's it that's a crazy business sir I'm good I'm straight like that that's amazing yeah people listen to this apart Wow mm-hmm you could beat yourself for a living for a show bro his blessing it's a blessing we were at you ever do a podcast and above the Comedy Cellar they've got a studio up no never Bobby Kelly started it and it's us I forget what it's called and um so I'm up there doing my podcast with Ari and it's an apartment it's like there's a there's a bedroom and a bathroom and then the studio and if we got to talking about torture and I go I go you ever been waterboarded he's like no I go there's a bathroom right here I go you want you want me to waterboard you and you know our he's like yep sure let's do it or sue it so we go inside and I put a towel over his face and he leans over backwards and his head is below his body in the shower stall the nozzle comes off the wall and I spray down his face and nothing nothing nothing and then all sudden his body's convulsing his legs are kicking he's fucking screaming water is shooting out of his nose he's choking and it went on for like a couple of minutes and I'm fucking dying and then he starts laughing and we were just on the podcast laughing without saying a word for probably five minutes and then he goes want me to do it to you I'm like fuck yeah and then he waterboarded me and the same thing happened Wow yeah the waterboarding is legit yeah yeah yeah yes that's real torture yeah but it's weird torture because you're not permanently injuring someone like you think it towards you think of like someone cutting someone lighting them on fire shit like that [Applause]
