ah ha ha ha 4 3 2 1 boom thank you thanks for doing this man really appreciate it hey welcome very good to meet you nice to meet you too and thanks for not lighting this place on fire you're welcome later how does one just in the middle of doing all the things you do create cars rockets all the stuff you're doing constantly innovating decide to just make flamethrower where you have the time for that well the flame I didn't put a lot of time into the flamethrower the this was an off-the-cuff thing and so we're sort of like it's sort of a sort of a hobby company called the boring company which started out as a joke and we decided to make it real and and dig a tunnel under LA and then they then people other people asked us to dig tunnels and so we said yes in a few cases da event and then and then we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time and we started off with a cap and there was only one thing on it was just boring company.com slash cap or hat that's it and then we sold the hats a little bit limited edition I just said the boring company and then I'm big fan of Spaceballs the movie and in Spaceballs yogurt goes through the merchandising section and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of space bulls and eat like the kids love that one best line when he pulls up claims they're always like we should do a flamethrower so we does anybody tell you know does anybody go Ilan um maybe for yourself but selling a flamethrower the liabilities all the people you're selling this device to what kind of unhinged people are gonna be buying a flamethrower in the first place do you really want to connect ourselves to all these potential arsonists yeah it's a terrible idea terrible sin by one I took I said don't buy this flamethrower don't buy it don't buy it that's what I said but still people bought it yeah there's nothing I can do to stop them it's you I said don't buy it it's a bad idea how many did you make you it's dangerous it's got it's wrong don't buy it still people bought it like I just couldn't stop them how many did you make twenty thousand and they're all gone in three I think four days it sold out in four days are you gonna do a another run no no that's it yes well I said we would do 20 but we did 50 thousand 50 thousand hats at and and that was a million dollars and it ok we'll we'll sell something and have for 10 million and that was 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each they went fast how do you how do you have the time to do that though I mean I understand that it's not a big deal in terms of all the other things you do but how do you have time to do anything I just I don't understand your time management skills I mean it didn't spend much time on this flamethrower I mean to be totally Frank it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover it's not a real flamethrower which is why it says not a flamethrower that's why we were very clear this is not actually a flamethrower and and and it also we're told that various countries would would ban shipping of it but they would not they would ban flamethrowers so we're very to solve this problem for all the customs agencies we labeled it not a flamethrower yeah work is it effective I don't know I think so yeah so far yes no but you do that you cannot refrain thrower but you do so many different things I forget about the flamethrower like how do you do all that other shit how do you how do you how does one decide to fix la traffic by drilling holes in the ground and who do you even approach with that like when you have this idea who do you talk to about that I mean I'm not saying it's gonna be successful or so you know I know it's like asserting that's gonna be successful but so far I have lived in LA for 16 years and the traffic has always been terrible and so I don't see any other like ideas for improving the traffic so in desperation we're going to take a tunnel and maybe that tunnel be successful and maybe it won't I'm listening yeah I'm not trying to convince you it's gonna work and are the people that you're anyone but you're you were starting this though this is actually a project you're starting to implement right yeah no we've dug about a mile it's quite long take a long time to walk it yeah now when you're doing this what is the ultimate plan the ultimate plan is to have these in major cities and anywhere there's mass congestion and just try it out in LA first yeah it's it's in LA because I mostly live in LA that's the reason it's a terrible place to dig tunnels this is a one of the worst place to dig tunnels because the there's mostly because of the paperwork you'll think it's like what about seismic it's like actually both tunnels are very safe in earthquakes why is that earthquake so what earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon it's like like waves on the ocean so if you if there's a storm you want to be on the on in a submarine mmm so bringing tunnels like being in a submarine now the way the tiles construct is it's constructed out of these interlocking segments kind of like a snake it's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals and so even when the ground moves the its able to the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake and it doesn't crack or break or or and and it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken and it's it's it's capable of taking five atmospheres of pressure it's waterproof methane proof or gas proof of any kind and meets all California seismic requirements so when you have this idea who do you bring this to I'm not sure what you mean by that well when you you're you're implementing it so you're digging holes the ground but you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it yeah so there were there were some engineers from SpaceX who were who thought it would be cool to do this and the guy who runs it like day to day Steve Davis he's long time SpaceX engineer he's great so Steve was like I'd like to help make this happen was it cool so we started off with digging a hole in the ground it's got like a permit for a pit big pit and just dug a big pit and you have to tell them what the pits for or you just say hey would just one dig a hole nice fill out this form that's it yeah I was putting our parking lot and but do you have to give them some sort of a blueprint for your ultimate idea and do they have to approve it like how does that work now we just started off with a pit okay big pit and that you know it's not really a you know don't really care about the existential nature of a pit you just say like I don't want a bit right yeah and it's all on the ground so then we got the permit for the pit and we dug the pit and we dug it and like I'd have three days to three days actually link to 48 hours something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the hype - he was going to attend the Hyperloop competition which is like a student competition we have four who can make the fastest part in the Hyperloop and he was coming the Swiss get the finals are gonna be on Sunday afternoon and so Eric was coming by on Sunday afternoon was like you know we should take this pitch and then like show Eric so we was like Friday morning and then yeah so is about blue over 40 hours 40 hours later we dug the pit there's like we're in 24/7 Oh 24 for 48 straight hours like that and dug this big pit and and and we're like showed Erik the pit like obviously is just a pit but hey it's hole in the ground better than no hole in the ground and what do you tell me about this pet I'm in you said this is the starting of this idea yes we're gonna build tunnels under LA to help funnel traffic better and there go and they just go okay that but that we've joked around about this in the podcast before to like what other person can go to the people that run the city and go hey I'm gonna dig some holes on the ground put some tunnels in there and they go oh yeah ok no no we're the hole in the ground but it's a people dig holes in the ground all the time but Mike my question is like I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla factory I know how much time you must be spending on SpaceX and yet you still have time to dig holes under the ground in LA and come up with these ideas and then implement I'm like I had a million ideas I'm sure you did no shortage of that yeah I just don't know how you manage your time I don't understand it it doesn't seem it doesn't even seem humanly possible you know I do basically I think people's like don't totally understand what I do with my time they think like I'm a business guy or something like that like my Wikipedia page says business magnate what would you call yourself a business magnate please change my Wikipedia page to magnet it's locked so somebody has to be able to unlock it and change it to magnets I'm going to be a magnet no I do engineering and you know and manufacturing and that kind of thing that's like 80% or more of my time ideas and then the implementation of those ideas that's like hard core engineering like you know designing things you know right structural mechanical electrical software user interface engineering aerospace engineering but you must understand there's not a whole lot of human beings like you you know that right - you're an odd isms yes - chimps like me we're all chimps yeah we are we're one not we're not Bertrand some of us are a little more confused when I watch you doing all these things I'm like how does this motherfucker have all this time and all this energy and all these ideas and then people just let him do these things because I'm an alien that's what I've speculated yes I'm on record saying this in the past I wonder it's true if there was one I was like if there was like maybe an intelligent being that we created you know like some AI creature that's a superior to people maybe they just hang around with us for a little while like you've been doing and then fix a bunch shit maybe that's the way my rotation or something like that you might do you think you do probably do you wonder like we around normal people you're like hmm like what's up with these boring dumb motherfuckers ever not bad for a human but I think I will not be able to hold a candle to AI hmm you scare the shit out of me when you talk about AI between you and Sam Harris consider it until I had a podcast with Sam wants everything right he made me shit my pants I'm talking about AI I realized like oh well this is a genie that once it's out of the bottle you're never getting it back in that's true there was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston dynamic robots you know like in the future it'll be moving so fast you can't see without a strobe light yeah you could probably do that right now and no one's really paying attention to much other than people like you or people that are really obsessed with technology all these things are happening and these robots are and did you see the one where it Peeta put out a statement that you shouldn't kick robots it's probably not wise for retribution if their memory is very good I bet it's really good it's really good I bet it is yes and getting better every day is it really good are you honestly legitimately concerned about this are you is like AI one of your main worries in regards to the future yes it it's less of a worry than it used to be mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude hmm so you used to have more hope and you gave up some of it and now you don't work as much about AI you're like this is just what it is yet pretty much it's no it's not necessarily bad it's just it's definitely gonna be outside of human control not necessarily bad right yes not it's not necessarily bad it's just it's just outside of human control now the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon it's gonna be very tempting in fact it will be use as weapon so the the the the on ramp to serious AI the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other I think most likely that'll be the danger yeah how far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not something's ethically or morally correct or whether or not it wants to do something or whether or not it wants to improve itself whether or not it wants to protect itself from people or from other AI how far away we something from something that's really truly sentient well I mean you could not argue that any group of people like it like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines that's what a company is and then there are different there's different levels of complexity and the way these companies are formed and then there are sort of is this like a collective AI in in the Google sort of search Google search you know the we're we're also plugged in is like like nodes on the network like leaves on a big tree or world feeding this network without questions and answers we're all collectively programming Vai and the and Google+ the older humans that connect to it are one giant cybernetic collective this is also true of Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and all these social networks they're giant cybernetic collectives humans and electronics all interfacing and constantly now constantly connected yes constantly one of things that I've been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy is how how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest greatest thing and I wonder how much of that is well a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and innovation and it almost seems like it's built into us it's like what we like and what we want that we're fueling this thing that's constantly around us all the time and it doesn't seem possible that people are gonna pump the brakes it doesn't seem possible at this stage we're constantly expecting the newest cell phone the latest Tesla update the newest MacBook Pro everything has to be newer and better and that's going to lead to some incredible point and it seems like it's built into us it almost seems like it's an instinct that we we're working towards this that we'd like it mm-hmm our job just like the ants build the anthill our job is to somehow know the fuel this yes I mean I mean that's current some some years ago but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI effectively we are building it and then we're building progressively greater intelligence and the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing and eventually we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence but the the AI is informed strangely by the human limbic system it is in large part our it'd writ large how so we mentioned all those things the sort of primal drives mm-hmm there's all old things that we like and hate and fear they're all there on the Internet they're projection of a limbic system no it makes sense then the thinking of it as a I mean think of thinking of corporations and just thinking of just human beings communicating online through these social media networks as some sort of an organism that's a it's a cyborg it's a it's a combination it's a combination of electronics and biology yeah this is it's um it's a measure like it's the success of these online systems is the is a is sort of a function of of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people the more limbic resonance the more engagement hmm whereas like one of the reasons why I probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter Olympic residence yeah you get more images more video yes tweaking your system more yes do you worry about or wonder in fact about what the next step is I mean a lot of people didn't see Twitter coming that you know communicate with 140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in like it's gonna Excel it's gonna become more connected to us right yes things are getting more more connected there at this point constrained by bandwidth our input output is slow particularly output awkward got worse with thumbs you know we just have input with 10 10 fingers and now we have thumbs but images are just are also there a way of communicating at high bandwidth take pictures and you send pictures to people what sends that's that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumbs so what happened with you where you decided or you took on a more fatalistic attitude like what was there any specific thing or was it just the inevitability of our future I try to convince people to slow down slow down AI to regulate AI this was futile I tried for years this you nobody seen in a movie robots could fucking take over you're freaking me out nobody listened nobody listened no one are people more inclined to listen today it seems like an issue that's brought up more often over the last few years than it was maybe five ten years ago it seemed like science fiction maybe they will so far they haven't I think people don't like the normally of the way that regulations work it's very slow very slow indeed so usually will be something some of your technology it will cause damage or death there will be an outcry there will be an investigation years will pass there will be some sort of insight committee there will be rulemaking then there will be oversight eventually regulations this all takes many years this is the normal course of things if you look at say water motive regulations how long did it take for seatbelts to be to be implemented to be required you know the water industry fort seatbelts I think for more than a decade successfully fought any regulations on seatbelts even though the numbers were extremely obvious if you had a seatbelts on you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured it was unequivocal and the industry fought this for years successfully eventually after many many people died regulators insisted on these belts this is this time frame is not relevant to AI you can't take ten years from the point which is dangerous it's too late and you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late if you have this fatalistic attitude and you feel like it's going we're in a almost like a doomsday countdown it's not necessarily a doomsday countdown it's it's a out-of-control countdown out of control yeah people call it the singularity and that's that's probably good way to think about it it's a Sinclair it's hard to predict like a black hole what what happens past the event horizon right so once it's implemented it's very different because it was out of bottle what's gonna happen and it will be able to improve itself right yes that's where it gets spooky right the idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation we're very very quickly yeah and then we'll be just ridiculous ridiculous we will be like this ridiculous biological shitting pissing thing trying to stop the gods no stop we like we like living with a finite lifespan and and watching you know Norman Rockwell paintings it could be terrible and it could be great it's not clear right but what one thing is for sure we will not control it do you think that it's likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology and it'll augment what we are now or do you think it will replace us well that's the snart the merge scenario with AI is the one that seems like probably the best like for us yes like if you if you can't beat it join it that's yeah you know so from a long-term existential standpoint that's like the purpose of neural link is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be somatic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem you just can't communicate through lingo that's too slow and where's neural link at right now I think we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months that's at least an order of magnitude better than anything else probably I think better than probably few anyone thinks is possible how much can you talk about that right now I don't jump the gun on that but what's like the ultimate what's what's the idea behind like what are you trying to accomplish with it what would you like best-case scenario I think best case scenario we effectively merge with AI where we a is serves as a tertiary cognition layer where we've got the limbic system kind of the primitive brain essentially you've got the cortex so you're currently in a symbiotic relationship with your cortex and limbic system are in a somatic relationship and generally people like their cortex and they like the Olympic system I haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex how everybody seems to like both and the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system people may think that that that their that the thinking part of themselves is in charge but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge and the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy that's what most of that computing power is aren't towards how can I make the limbic system happy that's what it's trying to do now if we do have a third layer which is the AI extension of yourself that is also somatic and there's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the AI extension of yourself such that the AI doesn't de de facto separate then that could be a good outcome that could be quite a positive outcome for the future so instead of replacing us it will radically change our capabilities yes it will enable anyone who wants to have superhuman cognition anyone who wants this is not a matter of earning power because you're earning power would be vastly greater after you do it so it's just like anyone who once can just do it in theory that's the theory and and if that's the case then and let's say billions of people do it then the outcome for Humanity will be the sum of of human will the sum of billions of people's desire for the future billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability radically enhance yes and that which would be it but how much different than people today look if you if you had to explain it to a person who didn't really not understand what you're saying how much different are you talking about when you say radically improve like what do you mean you mean mine read it will be difficult to to really appreciate the difference it's got like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without it's you're vastly smarter actually you know you can answer any question which if you're connected to the Internet you can answer any question pretty much instantly any calculation that your phone's memory is essentially perfect you can remember flawlessly your foot your phone can remember videos pictures and everything perfectly that's the that your phone is already an extension of you you're already a cyborg you don't even almost relearn rise they are already a cyborg if that phone is an extension of yourself it's just that the the data rate the rate at which the communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself that is your phone and computer is slow it's very slow and and that that it's like a tiny stroll of information flow between your biological self and your digital self and we need to make that tiny stroll like a giant river huge high bandwidth interface interface problem data rate problem so the data rate problem that I think I think we can hang on to human-machine symbiosis through the long term and then people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not I think they'll probably choose sort a novelette by electrical self versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer you will be essentially snapshot it into a computer at any time if your biological self dies you could just probably just upload into a new unit literally down the rabbit hole grab that sucker give me some of that this is too freaky see if I was thinking about this for a long time by the way I believe yeah if I was talking to one one cheers by the way chairs yeah this is great whiskey thank you I know where this came from who brought this to us trying to remember somebody gave it to us old camp whoever goes Thanks yeah it is good um this is just inevitable again going back to your when you decided to be half of this fatalistic view points so you warrant you tried to warn people you talked about this pretty extensively I've read several interviews where you talked about this and then you just sort of just said okay just is well it's just and you in a way you're by communicating the potential for you I mean for sure you're you're getting the warning out to some people yeah yeah I mean if I was really going on the warning quite quite a lot I was warning everyone I could you've met with Obama and just for one reason look just about a yes and What did he say so what about Hillary or no I he listened he certainly listened I met with Congress I met with I was out of meeting of all 50 governors and talked about just a a I danger and I fucked everyone I good it wouldn't seem to realize where this was going is it that or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taking care of it because when people hear about something like AI it's almost abstract it's almost it's almost like it's so it's so hard to wrap your head around it by the time it already happens it'll be too late yeah I think they didn't quite her to understand it or didn't think it was near term or not sure what to do about it and I said like you know an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee government committee to gain insight you know before before you oversight before you do make regulations you should like try to understand what's going on and then if you have a insight committee and once they learn what's going on get up to speed then they can make maybe some rules or propose some rules and and that would be probably a safer way to go about things it seems I mean I know that it's probably something that the government's supposed to handle but it seems like I wouldn't want the I don't want the government to handle this who do you want - I want you to handle oh geez yeah I feel like you're the one who could ring the bell better cuz if if Mike Pence starts talking about a I'm like shut up bitch you don't know anything about AI come on man he hasn't always talking about hey but I don't have the power to regulate other companies right maybe companies could agree maybe there could be some sort of a there's we have agreements where you're not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean you're not supposed to do certain things it could be terribly damaging even though they would be profitable maybe this is one of those things maybe we should realize that you can't hit the switch on something that's going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind as to whether or not it wants to survive or not and whether or not thinks you're a threat and whether or not thinks you're useless like why do I keep this dumb finite life-form alive why why keep this thing around it's just stupid it just keeps polluting everything shitting everywhere it goes lighting everything on fire and shooting each other why would I keep this stupid thing alive because sometimes it makes good music you know sometimes it makes great movies sometimes it makes beautiful art and sometimes it you know sometimes it's cool to hang out with all those reasons yeah for us those are great reasons yes but for anything objectives standing outside let go this is definitely a flawed system this is like if you went to the jungle and you watch these chimps engage in warfare and beat each other up short with meetings they're fucking real mean fucking mean they're real mean it's like movie chimpanzees yeah there wasn't really anything like cow what movie was that literally called chimpanzee whoo yeah yeah it's kind of like a documentary I was like damn these chimps or mean they're mean yeah they're cruel yeah they're they're calculated yeah yeah they sneak up on each other and like I didn't realize chimps did calculated cruelty mm-hmm yeah oh it's pretty I left that meeting kind of inking whoa this is dark right well we know better because we've advanced but if we hadn't we'd be like man I don't want to fucking live in a house I like the chimp ways bro chimp ways to go this is it man chimp life life right now but we in a way to the AI might be like those chimps I'm like these stupid fucks launching missiles out of drones and shoot each other underwater like we're crazy we got torpedoes and submarines and fucking airplanes that drop nuclear bombs and discriminately on cities or assholes yeah they might go why are they doing this it might like look at our politics look at what we do in terms of our food system look what kind of food we force down each other's throats and they might go these people crazy don't even look out for themselves I don't know I make how much do we think about chimps not much very little it's like these chumps are at war there he's like look it's like groups of chimps just attack each other and they kill each other they torture each other that's pretty bad they hunt monkeys there but like this is probably the most but you know I mean when's the last time you drove white chimps let me yeah all the time you do talk okay what caste okay yeah I'm obsessed I saw that David Attenborough documentary on chimps when they were eating those colobus monkeys and ripping them apart it's just wow that's many many years ago and just changed how I go oh this is why people are so crazy we came from that thing yeah exactly yeah there's the bonobos yeah I gotta like better philosophy yeah they're like swingers there they seem to be way more even than us way more civilized he just seemed resolved everything with sex yeah the only rules they have is the mom won't bang the son that's it okay that's it mom won't bang your sons they're good women yeah good women in the bonobo community everybody else just banging it out yeah I haven't seen the bonobo movie well they're disturbing just at a zoo you know you have bonobos at the zoo just constantly going Heisley fucking yeah and they don't care gay straight whatever this is fuck I haven't seen one of us at a zero it's probably like don't think not not on the PG section yeah I don't think they have them at many zoos we've looked at me pretty awkward I think that's the thing they like to keep regular chimps at zoos cuz bonobos are just always jacking off what's that they up in San Diego really interesting item yeah I mean how many other in a cage you know thing Brian it's gonna be pretty intense yeah yeah yeah we're we're a weird thing you know and I've often wondered if whether or not weird you know our ultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing and that's why we're so obsessed with technology because it's not like this technology's really I mean it's certain enhancing our lives to in a certain way but is I mean ultimately is it making people happier right now most technology I would say no in fact you and I were talking about social media before this about just not having Instagram when you're following and not dealing you feel better yes I think but one of the issues with social media that's been pointed out by many people is that I think may be particularly Instagram people look like they have a much better life than they really do right so by design yeah people are posting pictures of when they're really happy they're modifying those pictures to be better looking even if they're not modifying the pictures there at least selecting the pictures for the best lighting the best angle so people basically seem they're way better looking than they basically really are right and they're way happier seeming than they really are so if you look at everyone on Instagram you might think man they're all these happy beautiful people and I'm not that good looking and I am NOT happy so I must suck you know and that's gonna make you feel sad so when in fact those people you think are super happy actually not that happy some of them are really depressed they're very sad some of the happiest seeing people actually some of the saddest people in reality and and and nobody looks good all the time doesn't matter who you are no it's not even something you should want why do you look great all the time okay exactly so so I think I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because you just sort of you you people people generally could think of themselves relative to to others it's it's a will constantly re rebased lining our expectations and you can see they say if you watch some show like naked and afraid or if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while and you like the light civilization is quite great hazlit's lot of its people want to come back to civilization pretty fast on the head and afraid wasn't that a thorough quote the comparison is the thief of joy yeah of happiness is reality - expectations that's great - but the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to peep is it Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt fascinating in when you're thinking about Instagram because what essentially Instagram is with a lot of people is you're giving them the opportunity to be their own PR agent and they always go towards the glamorous you know and when anybody does show you know hashtag no filter they really do do that like oh you're so brave look at you no makeup no yeah they look good anyway you look great what you doing oh my god you don't have makeup on you still look hot as fuck you know what you're doing I know what you're doing - they're they're they're letting you know and then they're feeding off that comment section ooh just a little sitting there like like it's a fresh stream of love like you're getting right up to the source as it comes out of the earth and you're sucking that's a lot of emojis water Modi emojis yeah a lot of orgies my concern is not so much what Instagram is is that I didn't think that people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers and comments and and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are but I worry about where it goes like what's the next one what's the next one like where is it is it going to be augmented some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of Instagram type situation where you're not gonna want to live in this real world you're gonna want to interface with this sort of world that you've created through your social media page some next-level thing yeah go live in the simulation yeah maybe in the singular I'm ready player one type shit that's real that seems we have that HTC vive here and I've only done it a couple times quite honestly because it kind of freaks me out or my kids fucking love it man they love it they love playing these weirdo games and and walking around with that headset on but part of me watching them do it goes wow I wonder if this is like the precursor just sort of like if you look at that phone that Gordon Gekko had on the beach yeah a cell phone yeah if you pair that to like a Galaxy Note 9 how the fuck did that become that right and I wonder when I see this HTC vive I'm like what is that thing going to be 10 years from now when we're making fun of what it is now what is it how I mean how ingrained and how how how connected and interconnected is this technology going to be in our life it will be at some point indistinguishable from reality where we'll lose this we'll lose this like you and I are just looking each other through our eyes I see where you see me I think I hope you think so I think you probably over at regular eyes this could be some simulation it could do you entertain that well the argument for the simulation I think is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time any improvement 1% 0.1% just extend the timeframe make it a thousand years a million years the universe is 13.8 billion years old or would a civilization if you count it if you're very generous civilization is maybe seven or eight thousand years old if you count it from the first writing this is nothing this is nothing so if you assume any rate of improvement at all then games will be indistinguishable from reality or civilization will end one of those two things will occur although we are most likely in a simulation or we're ensuite system right well we could most certainly be on the road we could be on the road to that right it doesn't mean that it has to a pretty intense reality it could be in base reality we could be here now on our way to the road or on our way to the destination where this can never happen again where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level of sharing information but right now we're not there yet that's possible too right it's possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable that we're gonna have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality but maybe we're not there yet that's also possible when yes quite yet that this is real when I touch that feels very real maybe that's why everybody's like into like mason jars and shit amazing suede shoes people are into like craft restaurants and they wouldn't want raw wood everyone says everyone ought to see metal people it seems like people are like longing towards some weird log cabin tightness around reality yeah I like holding on like clinging just sure dragging their nails through the mud like don't take me it yes I want to walk but then but then people will go get a mason jar with the wine stem or a handle that's dark mist we lose faith in humanity wine stem and a handle they have those yes oh those dirty people oh that's just assholes that's like people make pet rocks ruff all right this is some people are just assholes they take advantage of our generous nature which was made with the wine stem I made with handle oh they made it that way yeah so the one way you've gone to the Mesa job you thought that would be fine if there was they glued it on or something right no mailers made that way white trash chic oh this is disgusting yep this is terrible yeah that's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard like fake breasts from the 60s it's like if you're really long for the ones with ripples here we go yeah it's almost what that is yeah what are you gonna do man it's not nothing you know something you do stop certain terrible ideas from propagating yeah anyway I don't want to sound like like thanks for too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimistic about the future there's no point in being pessimistic it's just too negative it doesn't help you know I think you want to be I mean my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic I think it rod I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right right at least or on that side right yeah is if you're pessimistic it's going to be in this rule yeah yeah and nobody wants to be around you anyway if it's the end of the world you like a folk told you bro yeah the world ending yeah it is great for all I mean enjoy the journey right if you really want to get morose I mean it is what it is for all of us anyway we were all gonna go unless some something changes yeah you know I mean ultimately you know even if we just sort of existed as humans forever we'd be we'd still eventually that'd be like the heat death of the universe right as well in years from now right now if we get it past the Sun if we can figure out a way past the Sun running out of juice eventually it's gonna end it's just a session of when right so really it's all about the journey hmm or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesn't worry about death the universe as we know it will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually and then someone's gonna bottle it and put a fragrance to it sell it to French people in another dimension it's just a very long time yeah I think it's really just about how can we make it last longer are you a proponent of the multi universes theory do you believe that there are many many universes and that even if this one fades that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now and there's an infinite number of them and they're just constantly in this never-ending cycle of birth and death I think most likely this is just about probability there are many many simulations these simulations are we might as well call them reality or you could call them multiverse these simulations you believe are created like someone has managed they're running on the substrate so that substrate is probably boring boring mm-hmm how so well when we create a simulation like a game or a movie it's a distillation of what's interesting about life you know like it takes take a year to shoot an action movie and then that's all distilled down into two or three hours so let me tell you if you see an action movie being filmed it's freaking boring super boring takes there's like lots of takes so everything's in a green screen looks pretty goofy doesn't look cool but once you add the CGI and have great editing it's amazing so I think most likely if we're a simulation it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make a simulation that's boring it makes simulation way more interesting the base reality that is if this right now is a simulation yes and ultimately inevitably we're if as long as we don't die or get hit by a meteor we're going to create some sort of simulation if we continue on the same technological path where we're on right now yes but we might not be there yet so it might not be a simulation here but it most likely is you feel other places this notion of place or where is is a flawed yes flawed version like that if you have this sort of that vibe you know that's made by valve and steam and it's really valve but made it HCC to the hardware but it's really a valve thing makers of half-life yes hmm valve great company great company when you're in the and that's in that virtual reality which is only gonna get better where are you where are you really right you aren't anywhere well where is in the computer what well you know what defines where you are exactly right it's your perception is it your perceptions or is it you know a scale that we have under your but you're right here I've measured you you're the same weight as you where when you left oh you mean while your experience I didn't think you're where you are right now you might not be i'll spark up joy if you keep talking your managers gonna come in here we might have to lock the door right now you think you're in a studio in LA that's what I heard you might be in a computer oh listen man I think about this all the time yeah I mean it's unquestionable that one day that'll be the case as long as we keep going as long as nothing interrupts us and if we start from scratch and you know we're single-celled organisms all over again and then millions and millions of years later we become the next thing that is us with creativity and the ability to change this environment it's gonna keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change reality to change I mean to almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into what what it wants it to be and create new things and then those new things will intersect with other people's new things and then it'll be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression all through technology yeah and then we're wondering we're gonna wonder like why are we here what are we doing let's find out well I mean I think we should take the actions the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better yes right Yeah right right and then we evaluate those actions to make sure they're there that it's true well I think there's a movement to that mean in terms of like a social movement I think some of its misguided and some of its exaggerated and there's a lot of a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there but it seems like the general trend of like social awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook or Twitter or what-have-you and that the trend is to abandon preconceived notions abandoned prejudice abandoned discrimination and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible look at this knife somebody gave it to me sorry yeah what isn't fuck you do my friend Donny brought this with him and it just stayed here I have a real samurai sword trying to play with that I know you're into weapons that's from the 1500s samurais at the end of the table yeah that's cool I'll grab it hold on that's legit samurai sword from an actual samurai from the 1500s if you pull out that blade that blade was made the old way where a master craftsman folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time and honed that blade into what it is now what's crazy is that more than 500 years later that thing is still pristine I mean whoever took care of that and pass it down to the next person who took care of it and and you know until it got to the podcast room it's pretty fucking crazy yeah one day someone's gonna be looking at a Tesla like that yeah he's fucking back doors they pop up sideways like a Lamborghini you should see what Tesla can do yeah you didn't you should I'll show you after quadrant one I love them yeah but most people don't know what it can do in terms of like ludicrous mode in terms like driving super fast and responsibly on public roads is everything the waiting car can do that yeah what could it do that that I need to know about I mean the Model X can do this like ballet thing to the trans-siberian Orchestra it's pretty cool where it dances yes yes duh why would you program that in the car seemed like fun that's what I get about you that's what's weird like when you showed up here you were all smiles and you pull out a fucking blowtorch and not a blowtorch but I'm like let's do the flamethrower not a flamethrower Mike here it's definitely not lately you're you're having fun like this is uh like this thing when you know you program a car to do a ballet dance very fun but how do you have the time to do that understand why are you digging holes under the earth incentive rockets into space and and and power and people in Australia like how the fuck do you have time to make the car dance ballet well I mean in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said you know what if we make this car dance and play music I was like that sounds great please do it let's try to get it done in time for Christmas we did does your concern about someone just losing their mind and making it do that in the highway no it won't do that what if it's in bumper-to-bumper traffic no no won't do it nope it's actually you have to just an easter egg oh yeah that's why people don't know about it including people have the car well it's like it can do lots of things lots of things once read it gets a hold of it everyone's oh you just have to it's everyone if you search for it on the internet you will find out but people don't know that they should even search for it oh well they do now yes yes there are so many things about the Model X and the Model S and the model 3 that's people don't know about we should probably do a video or something and explain it because I've have two close friends of mine and I say do you know the car can do this and they're like nope do you want to do a video that do you like the fact that some people don't know no I think it's probably not we should tell people yeah probably yeah that would help your product I mean it's not like you don't sell enough of them you sell almost too many of them right the I mean I think a Tesla it's the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever that's what it's meant to be well our goal is to make its it's not exactly a car it's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment make us maximum fun okay electronic like big screen laptop ridiculous speed handling all that stuff yeah do you you haven't got to put video games in it you are yeah is that's wise well what can you you won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game but we're like for example we just we're just putting the Atari emulator ROM emulator in it yeah so we'll play missile command and lunar lander and a bunch of other things yeah that sounds cool it's pretty fun I like that yeah and we improved the interface of Missile Command because too hard with the old track Bowl so this is this is a touch screen version of Missile Command so you have a chance do you you have an old car don't you don't you have like an old Jaguar yeah yeah that's that's that 61 series 1 e type dragger I love cars it's great yeah I love old cars the only yeah the only to get only 2 guessing cars I have of that and an old Ford Model T that a friend of mine gave me hmm that's my only two gasoline cars is the Ford Model T all stock well no there's your car convertible car that's a good-looking car yes is that yours huh that is it's not mine it's extremely close to mine that I don't have a French license plate of mine oh that's a beautiful car they need that but mine looks like that God they nailed that that's what mine looks like they're good it's mine there's certain iconic shapes yeah and that there's there's something about those cars too they're not as capable not nearly as capable as like a Tesla but there's something really satisfying about the mechanical aspect of like feeling the steering and the grinding of the gears and the shifting there's something about those that's extremely satisfying even though they're not that competent like I have a 1993 Porsche 964 it's like a lightweight it's not as in the RS America it's not very fast it's not like in comparison to a Tesla and that but the thing about it is like it's mechanical you feel it everything's like it's it gives you this weird thrill like you're on this clinky ride and there's all this feedback there's something to that yeah yeah absolutely I mean yeah my e type is like basically no electronics yeah it's just you like that but you also like electronics yes Tesla soup it's like the far end of electronics yes drives itself it's driving itself better every day yeah it's we're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on and it'll drive from highway on-ramp to Iowa exit do lane changes to overtake other cars choose go from one interchange the next if you get on say the 405 and get off get off 300 miles later and go through several highway interchanges and just overtake other cars and hook into the nav system and then you're just meditating oh yeah I was just traveling all right it's kind of eerie it's kind of eerie what did you think when you saw that video that dude falling asleep behind the wheel I'm sure you've seen it the one in San Francisco he's like right outside of San Jose dudes out cold like this the cars in bumper-to-bumper traffic moving along yeah have you seen it right yeah yeah we that's I think an old video we can software where if you don't touch the wheel it will gradually slow down I put the emergency lights on and wake you up oh that hilarious yeah that's hilarious yeah can you choose what voice wakes you up well it's sort of more of a it sort of honks honks yeah this should be like wake up fuckface well ringing your fellow humans we could we could gently wake you up with a sultry voice ah that would be good like something with a southern accent hey why can't wake up sunshine hey sweetie won't you wake your like pic could pick your right like what do you want yeah just the Australian girl for Siri yeah you wanted to seductive favorite Ian what flavor do what you wanted to be angry should be anything you want those Australian prison lady genes now when you when you program something like that in is this in response to a concern or is it your own yeah if you're do you look at it and go hey they shouldn't just be able to fall asleep let's wake them up yeah yeah we it's like you know we're like well you know people falling asleep we've got to do something about that right but when you first released it you didn't consider it right you're just like well no one's gonna just sleep people fall asleep from the cars all the time crash yeah at least our car doesn't crash that's better it's better not to crash man if I got fallen asleep in a gasoline car they do all the time for sure yeah I never crashing somebody yeah in in fact the thing that really you know got me to it's like man we better get water-powered going get it out there was a guy was in an early Tesla driving down the highway and he fell asleep and he ran over a cyclist and killed him and cycling man if we had auto pilot we're gonna run out of might have fallen asleep but at least he wouldn't run over that cyclist so how did you implement it like did you just use cameras and yeah programmed with the the system so that if it sees images it slows down and how much time do you give like yeah is the person who's in control of it allowed the program how fast it goes yes yeah you can program it to be more or less like more conservative look more aggressive driver and you can say what speed you want it to what speed is okay I know you have ludicrous mode you have douchebag mode ha ha well it just cuts people off well for for lane changes it's tricky because if you're in like LA like unless you're pretty aggressive right it's pretty it's hard to change lanes it's hard to be satnaam it's hard to be namaste yeah if you want to hit that Santa Monica Boulevard off-ramp I mean you got to be a little pushy you gotta be a little pushy yeah especially freeway angry yeah a little angry they don't want you and they speed up sometimes you know I think people like overall a pretty nice on the highway even in LA but sometimes they're not do you think the neuro-link will help that probably everybody been locked in together this hivemind tunnels will help but we're gonna have traffic that'll help a lot yeah how many of those can you put in there honey that's thing about tunnels is you can go 3d so many levels right so until you hit hell yeah but you can go you can have a hundred levels of tunnel there promise Jesus Christ I want to be on 99 1999 negative 99 floors oh this is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that there's not like roads the fundamental issue with roads is that do you have a 2d transport system and a 3d living and workspace environment so you've got all these tall buildings or concentrated work environments and and then then you want to go into this like 2d transport system where usually an officially low density because cars is per spaced out pretty far and and so that obviously is not going to work you're going to have traffic guaranteed but if you can go 3d on your transport system then you can solve old traffic and you can either go 3d up with a flying car or go through et down with tunnels you can have as many tunnel levels as you want and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic you can go further down with tunnels then you can go up with buildings you're ten thousand feet down if you want I wouldn't recommend it but what was that movie with what's-his-face Bradley Kuta Bradley Cooper Christian know what the fuck's his name bad like who was Batman Christian Bale where he they fought dragons him and Matthew McConaughey down deep into the earth how how far deep they go is that man yeah was yeah what that man four dragons no bail arena fire Rena fire okay I saw that no but good I wouldn't recommend something super far down right Moulton we're yeah earth is a giant ball of lava mm-hmm with a thin crust on the top which we think of as like the surface this thin crust and it's mostly just a big ball of lava that's earth but 10,000 feets not a big deal have you given any consideration whatsoever to the Flat Earth movement haha that's a troll situation oh it's not no it's not you would like to thank you because you're a super genius haha but I as a normal normal person I know there's people weigh down more than me and they really really believe they watch youtube videos which go on uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of fuckin fake facts very eloquently and articulately and they really believe these people really believe I mean if it works for them sure fine fine weird though right at this age where you know this ludicrous mode in your car goes one point nine seconds zero to sixty two point two two point two which one's one point nine that the next generation roads room okay a standard edition yeah I'm on top of this shit that's that's what the standard edition so it's about the performance package what performance package yeah what the fuck do you need maracas thrust upon it for real yes what are they gonna burn nothing high ultra high pressure compressed air whoa just don't call gas thrusters they do you have to have air tanks or they suck in the air okay yeah it's a electric pump well pump it up to like 10,000 psi and how fast are we talking zero to sixty how fast you want to go I'm gonna go could make it Justine why I want to go back in time could make it fly you make it fly sure do you anticipate that as being at when you're talking about the tunnels and then flying cars do you really think that's gonna be real too noisy and there's too much air flow so the fun relation with flying cars I mean if you get one of those like toy drones I think of how much how loud those are and how much air that they how much air they blow now imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier mmm this is not gonna be make your neighbors happy your neighbors are not gonna be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard it'll be very phallic on there or on your roof they're just really gonna be like what the data was annoying you can't even look if you want a flying car just put some wheels on a helicopter is there a way around that like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology like all those Bob Lazar type characters were thinking that was a part of the UFO technology they were doing at area 51 remember it didn't they have some some thoughts about magnetics nope no bullshit yes really yeah it does a fundamental momentum exchange with the air so you must you must accelerate you this this like this there's a certain you have a mass and you have gravity gravitational acceleration and mass mass times your mass times gravity must equal the mass of air flow times the acceleration of that airflow to have a neutral force so it's impossible so my own and then you won't move but if okay if mg is greater than MA you will go down and if M is greater than mg you will go up that's how it works there's just no way around that there is definitely no way around it there's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to technically yes you you could have a strong enough magnet but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble we just suck cars up into your car just pick up I mean you'd have to rappel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of Earth's gravitational field and somehow make that incredibly light but that magnet would cause so much destruction you'd be better off with a helicopter so if there was some sort of magnet road like you have two magnets and they repel each other if you had some sort of a magnet road that was below you and you could travel on that magnet Road that would work hahaha yes yes you could have a magnet rode a magnet Road is that too ridiculous no it's what work so you can do that dick ulis - right I would not recommend it or not recommend that not good not wise I think no no that no definitely not I think I was good I would cause a lot of trouble so you put some time and consideration into this other than you know instead of like my foolishly rendered thoughts so you think that tunnels are the way to do it Oh it'll work for sure that'll work yes and you're these these tunnels that you're building right now these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have you know it's just a hole in the ground right we plate videos of it where you just think you're gonna drop that hole in the ground there's a sled on it and the sled goes very fast like 100 miles an hour plus yeah you can go real fast you know fast as you want and then if you want to go long distances you can just draw the air out of the tunnel make sure it's real straight draw the air out of the tunnel yeah it's a vacuum tunnel because the then and then depending on how fast we're going to these wheels or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel or you could mag Leavitt if you want to go super fast so magnet road yes but underground magnet roads underground manga otherwise you're gonna really create a lot of trouble with because those metal things so magnet rows the way to go just underground you want to go really fast underground you would be in you would be maglev in a vacuum tunnel mag in a vacuum tunnel magnetic levitation innovation alters fun with rocket launchers now I would not recommend putting any company exhaust gas in the tunnel oh ok so we're saying come on right you have to pump it out and you probably have a limited amount of air in the first place like how much can you breathe if you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles in pressurized pod to be like it like a little tiny underground spaceship basically like a airplane because you have air in the airplane it's not getting new air in it is it is yes yeah they have a pump really yeah it gets it from the outside yes Wow I don't know and it's like it's at the eros airplanes have it have it easy because they essentially you can they're pretty leaky but Jesus yappity as long as the as long as the air pump is working at a decent speed that backup pumps have like you know three pumps or 4 pumps or something and and then that then there's like business it exhausts through the outflow valve and and through whatever seals are not sealing quite right usually the door doesn't seal quite right on a plane this is a bit of leakage around the door and and but the pumps exceed the outflow rate and then that sets the pressure in the in the cabin now have you ever looked at our engines and gone I could fix this as you make up a design for a plane you do yes a better design I mean probably I think it is yeah who've you talked to about this and I've talked to friends friends friends and I'm your friend girlfriends you can tell me what do you got what's going on well I mean an exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing supersonic of some kind for article takeoff and landing mean no need for a runway just shoot up straight on the air and then chop oh how would you do that when they do that some military aircrafts correct yes the trick is that you have a you have to transition to level flight and then you the the the thing that you'd use for vertical tip will take over landing is not suitable for high-speed flight so you have two different systems quite a lot you're saying thing about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy once you've overcome gravitational potential energy and you're out yet at a high altitude the energy use in cruise is very low and then you can recapture a large part of your the gravitational potential energy on the way down so you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel if you will because you have the energy of height gravitational potential energy this is a lot of energy so so once you can get hot high you but the like the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance so the force balance so a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance you have the force of gravity if the lift force with the wings then you've got the force of the one of the thrusting device the the propeller or turbine or whatever it is and you've got the resistance force of the air now the higher you go the lower the air resistance is air density drops exponentially but drag increases with the square annex beats of square the higher you go the faster you will go for the same amount of energy and at a certain altitude you will you can go supersonic with less energy per mile quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance it makes sense though no I'm sure it does now when you think about this new idea of designing it mean when when you have this idea about improving planes mm-hmm are you gonna bring this to somebody you just Chuck well I have a lot on my plate right just what I'm saying I don't know I don't know how you do what you do now but if you keep coming up with these but it's got to be hard to pawn these off on someone else either egg hey go do a job a good job with this vertical takeoff and landing system that I want to implement to regular planes the airplane electric airplane isn't necessary right now electric cars are important we solar energy is important stationary storage of energy is important these things are much more important than creating electric supersonic feet all also the planes naturally you really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft and this is improving over time so you know it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy that's why electric cars it matters whether electric cars happens you know later you know we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere of the oceans without taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this running this neat in the in the atmosphere this is crazy you should not do this it's very dangerous so we should we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy I mean this the bizarre thing is that obviously we're going to run out of oil in long-term you know we're gonna there's only so much oil we can we can mine it burn its total article we must have assisted a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term so we know that's the end point we know that so why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans this is an insane experiment it's the dumbest experiment in in human history why are we doing this it's crazy do you think this is a product of momentum that we started off doing this when it was just a few engines a few hundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world not that big of a deal and then slowly but surely over a century it got out of control and now it it it's not just our fuel but it's also the mean fossil fuels are involved in so many different electronics so many different items that people buy it's just this constant desire for fossil fuels constant need for oil without yet iteration of the sustainability the things like oil oil coal gas what's the easy money right it's easy money so have you heard about clean coal huh department's been tweeting about it's gotta be real clean coal all caps do you see used all caps clean coal um well you know it's very difficult to put that co2 back in the ground it doesn't like being in solid form energy that like some sort of a filter giant building sized filter Sox carbon out not here no you know it doesn't not possible no no nope definitely not fucked no we're not fucked I mean this is a quite a complex question right you know we're really just when were to the more cob when we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere and a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans the more dangerous it is like I don't think right now I think we're okay right now we can probably even add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow like that there's a vast base of Industry vast transportation system like this there's two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world so and and that the new car and truck production if it was a hundred percent electric that's only about a hundred million per year so it would take if you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all old cars and trucks electric it would still take twenty five years to change the transport base to electric makes sense because how long does a truck car truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed about 20 to 25 years is there a way to accelerate that process like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government financially well the thing that is going on right now is that there is a an inherent subsidy in any oil burning device any any power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere or do you say atmosphere for short so like you can say okay there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere and so there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon in the atmosphere things overheat oceans warm up ice caps melt ocean real-estate becomes a lot less valuable things underwater and and but it's not clear what that number is but it's definitely a scientist Woodall it's really quite the scientist scientific consensus is overwhelming overwhelming I mean I don't know any serious scientists actually zero literally zero who don't think that you know that but we will have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing and so there's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel-burning thing power plants aircraft car frankly even rockets I mean Rockets use up you know they burn they burn fuel but there's just you know with rockets there's just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately so it's the only way but with cars there's definitely a better way with electric cars and to generate the energy do so with photovoltaics because we've got a giant thermonuclear reactor in the sky called the Sun it's great sort of shows up every day very reliable so if you can generate energy from solar panels stored with batteries you can have energy 24 hours a day and then you can you know can send it to the poles or near to the north with you know high voltage lines also the northern northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well any way that all fossil fuel powered things have an inherent subsidy which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans so people tend to think of like why why should electric vehicles have a subsidy but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost the environmental cost to earth but nobody's paying for it we are going to pay for it obviously in the future we will pay for it it's just not paid for now now what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars and trucks and things like that is it battery capacity yeah I've got a scale up production gotta make the car compelling make it better than gasoline or diesel cars make it more efficient in terms of like the distance it can travel yeah gotta be able to go far far enough recharge fast and your Roadster you're anticipating 600 miles is that correct yeah yeah we what is it 600 miles is that right now like if you driven one 600 miles now no we could totally make one right now they would do 600 miles but the thing is too expensive so it's like the cosmetics more so well you know just have a turn two kilowatt hour battery pack and you can go 600 miles - here what do you have now 330 mile range let's be planning what is that in terms of kilowatts well that would be for a Model S 100 kilowatt hour pack we'll do about 330 miles maybe 335 but some people have hyper mild it to 500 miles hyper mild it well yeah I just like go on 45 miles an hour or something yeah they're like 30 miles an hour so it's like on level ground with you pump the tires up really well I'm gonna smooth surface and and you can go for a long time but do you like definitely comfortably do 300 miles easier is fine for most people usually 200 or 250 miles is fine 300 miles is you don't even think about it really is there any possibility that you could use solar power that solar powered one day especially in Los Angeles I mean as you said about that giant nuclear reactor a million times bigger than Earth just floating in the sky is it possible that one day you'll be able to just power all these cars just on solar power I mean we don't ever have cloudy days if we do this three of them well that the surface area of a car is without making the car like really blocky or having some like a g-wagen yeah like and just like I haven't look a lot of surface area where like maybe like solar panels fold out or something like your eClass ha ha that's what we needed the e-type yeah that the e Jaguar e-type was a giant long hood that could be a giant solar panel what the beginning of Tesla I didn't want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing they'd press a button and it would just like unfold these solar panels and like charge recharge your car in the parking lot ah yeah we could do that but I think it's probably better to just put that on your roof right and yeah and then it's gonna be facing the Sun all the time because likewise you're fucki be in the shade you know coming the shade it could be in a garage isn't bad yeah didn't a Fisker have that on the roof the fisker karma new generation 4 I thought believe it was only for the the radio is that correct yeah I mean I think it could like recharge like 2 miles a day or so did you laugh when they started blowing up when they get hit with water do you remember what happened they got that what yeah the one they had a dealership or oh yeah Fisker Carmen's were parked was that like that with a flood and yes yes when the the hurricane came in they got overwhelmed with water and they all started exploding this fucking great video of it did you watch the video I didn't watch the video but I did see a picture of the I beat my ass off they all blow up they got wet and they blew up that's not good yeah we made out battery waterproof so that doesn't happen smart move yeah there was a guy in Kazakhstan that I think it was Kazakhstan that he he just boated through a tunnel under an underwater tunnel if I could flooded tunnel and just turn the wheels to steer and press the accelerator and it just floated through the tunnel and he smiles steered around the other cars you're like that's a man it's on the Internet what happens if your car gets a little sideways like if you're driving in snow like what if you're driving if your autopilot is on and you're in like Denver and it snows out and your car gets a little sideways does it correct itself just oh yeah well it's got great tighter traction control but doesn't know how to like correct do you know how like oh yeah send kick-out you know how to counter steer oh yeah no it's really good it knows how to do it yeah well it's pretty crazy that's pretty crazy yeah so like if you go in sideways he knows how to correct itself generally what goes sideways it won't know why not it will correct itself before it goes sideways even in black eyes yeah this videos we could see the car the drive alone traction control system is very good it makes you feel like Superman it's great you like feel like you can like it it'll make you feel like this incredible driver I believe it yeah now how do you program what we do our testing on like an ice lake in Sweden oh really yeah and like Norway and Canada and a few other places Porsche does a lot of that to the ceiling as well they do a lot of their they do some of their driver training school on these frozen surfaces so you're just MacArthur is with you like it or not and you have to learn how to slide into corners and how do we test well electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast right so the gasoline car you've got a lot of latency it takes a while for the and the engine to react and for the you know but for elect electric motors incredibly precise that's why you like you can imagine like like you if you had like a printer or something you you were Tony you wouldn't have a gasoline engine printer that we pretty weird or like a surgical device it's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device on the printer gasoline engines gonna be just chugging away you're not going to have the reaction time but to an electric motor its operating at the millisecond level so it can turn on track on and off traction if you within like inches of getting on the honest like they say driver patch of ice it'll turn traction off and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice like there's a little patch of ice because in in in the frame of the electric motor you're moving incredibly slowly you're like a snake it's you're a snail you're just moving so slowly because it's it's it can see it a thousand frames a second and so like you say one Mississippi it just thought about at things a thousand times so it's realized that your wheels are not getting traction it understands there's some slippery surface that you're driving on yes and it makes adjustments in real time yes and milliseconds that would be so much safer than a regular car yes it is just that alone for loved ones you'd want them to be driving your car yes the on-board fuck regular motors that the SX and three are to have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government Wow this is yeah but it's pretty funny it's pretty crazy like we you know people still sue us like they'll have like some accident at 60 miles an hour where they'd like twisted an ankle and they salute what they sue like there would be dead in another car they still see us but that's to be expected it is to be expected do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic and you know undertones just sort of just go up you gotta just let it go this is what people do tell ya I've got what it is quite a lot of respect for the justice system judges are very smart and they see they've as like I haven't so far I've found judges to be very good at justice because I like like what like and juries are good too like they're actually quite good you know people you know you read about like occasional errors in the justice system let me tell you most the time they're very good and like they're you know the guy mentioned that crew fell asleep in the car and you he wrote over a cyclist and you know and and and that was what encouraged me to get auto pilot out as soon as possible that guy sued us he sued you for fallin asleep yes you believe I I'm not gonna keep blamed it on the new car smell what yes he blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell there's some ways I'm like this is a real thing that someone's as a lawyer that thought that through in front of his laptop before you wrote that up yes he got a lawyer and he sued us and the judge was like you this is crazy stop bothering me No thank God yes thank God thank god this judge out there with a brain judges our judges are very good some of them a lot of boys up the river in Pennsylvania who was selling those kids out you know about that story yeah judge was selling young boys to prisons he was like literally yeah literally under bribes for he was was this an elected judge or item he's like some people have judges like actually a politician no has elected judge this is a very famous story who he's in jail right now I think for the rest of his life and he put away he he would take a young boy would do something like steal something from a store okay and he would put him in detention for you know five years something ridiculously egregious and they investigated this history and they found out that he was literally being paid off was it by private prisons is that what the the deal was there was some sort of but anyway this judge is two judges four judges kids for cash scandal is what's called delaminate yeah Common Pleas judges so I think they are elected and who was paying them someone it was proven to the point where they're in jail now that someone was paying them to put more asses in the seats in these private prisons another payment to put them in the youth center a million dollar payment yeah I do think it's this prisons thing is creating a bad instant arc right yes but I mean that Judge is in prison yes but I for people who think perhaps the justice system it consists entirely of judges like that I want to assure you this is not the case the vast majority of judges of very good I agree and they care about justice and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer and instead they cared about justice and they made less money because they care about justice and that's why their judges I feel that same way about police officers yes like there's so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are horrific we we tend to look at that like this is evidence that police are all corrupt and that I think that's crazy no most most police are very honest yes and and and and and like personnel that I know of very honorable ethical people yes and much more honorable ethical than the average person that's my impression that is my impression as well but and that's not to suggest that we complacent and assume everyone's honest and ethical and obviously if somebody is is given a a trusted place in society such as being a police officer or a judge and they are corrupted then we must be extra vigilant against such situations yes and take action but but we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession I couldn't agree more I think there's also an issue with one of the things that happens with police officers prosecutors and and anyone that's trying to convict someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game and in games people want to win yeah sometimes people cheat yes yes I mean if you know if you're a prosecutor shoot you should not always want to win there are times when you should like okay I just should not want to win this case and then you know like just pass on that case sometimes people want to win too much that is true I think also the makeup becomes tough if you're if you're like a district attorney you know you use intend to sort of see a lot of criminals and then your your view of the world can get negatively yes you know you have a negative you know you have a negative view of the world because you know you're just interacting a lot of criminals but actually most of society has not consist of criminals right and how actually had this conversation at dinner several years ago with just tree of Tony I was like man I must sometimes seem pretty pretty dark because you know man there's some some terrible human beings out there and he was like yep and he was like dealing with some case which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money it was rough like wow that's that's pretty rough that's like it's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney but but you know it's only a few percent of society that are actually bad and then if you go to the worst say 0.1% of society or the worst one in a thousand one in a million you know like how bad is the millionth worst person in the United States deep damn bad like damn evil like you know the the million thing like the millionth or one in a million of evil is so evil people cannot even conceive of it but there's 330 million people in the United States so that's 330 people out there somewhere well by the same token there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings yeah on the other side but because of our fear of danger we tend to our thoughts tend to gravitate towards the worst-case scenario yes and we want to frame that and it's one of the real problems with prejudice we want and whether it's prejudice towards different minorities or prejudice towards police officers or anything it's like we want to look at the worst case scenario and say this is an example of what this is all about and you see that even with people how they frame genders some some men frame women like that they get ripped off by a few women and they saw all women are evil some women get fucked over by a few men all men are shit and in this this is very toxic and it's also it's a very unbalanced way of viewing the world and it's very emotionally based and it's based on your own experience your own anecdotal experience and it can it can be very influential to the people around you and it's just it's a dangerous way it's a dangerous thought process and pattern to it is it is a very dangerous build parent I really think you know people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're good until proven otherwise and I think really most people are actually pretty good people nobody's perfect they have to be if you think vast numbers of us they're just interactive you just cook with each other constantly yeah we have to be better than we think we are yes there's no other way I mean here are these weapons like but how many times like nobody's presumably try to murder you and you're nobody yes nobody's like rifles right they're fake flame throwers I'm not a flame thrower now we got a real problem I'm gonna put it on that side too I'm gonna leave it for the guests yeah Emily look man if I say something dad fucked up it's right there to liven things up for sure it's guaranteed to make any party better yeah well that's I mean that's the armed civilization Theory right that a an armed community is a safe and polite community yeah Texas it's kind of true yeah I mean people axes are super polite don't make somebody angry yeah I know don't know what's gonna happen yeah it's not a good mood yeah piss people off when everybody can have a gun yeah off to just let that guy get in your lane yeah yeah you know we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco oh it's beautiful yeah SpaceX in McGregor it's about 15 minutes away from Waco that's close to where Ted Nugent lives Ted Nugent okay cool yeah there's you know we have like lots of fire and loud explosions and things and people with that they're cool with it they don't give a fuck out there there's very supportive yeah you can buy fireworks we you know your kids go to school yeah it's you know it's dangerous yeah but it's free it's great there's something about that greatest that's very enticing because of that it is dangerous but it's also free right yeah yeah I kind of like Texas actually well I prefer it over places that are more restrictive but more liberal because you could always be liberal it's like just because things are free and just because you have a certain amount of you know right-wing type characters it doesn't mean you have to be that way you know and honestly there's a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open-minded and let you do whatever you want to do ryan's you don't bother them yeah exactly that's my hope right now with the way we're able to communicate with each other today and how radically different it is than generations past is that we all just the dust settles and we all realize like like what you're saying that most people are good most people are good the vast majority yes I think you should give people the benefit out for sure I think you're right yeah you know what could help that what mushrooms you think they're delicious Yeah right you know they're good for you too yeah what do you see in terms of like when you think about the future of your companies what do you see is like bottlenecks what's more I sure thank you what do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are that are holding back innovation is it regulatory commissions and and people that don't understand the technology that are influencing policy like what what what could potentially be holding you guys back right now is there anything that you would change yeah that's a good question you know I wish I wish politicians were better at science that would help a lot that's a problem yes there's no incentive for them to be good at science there isn't actually you know they're pretty good at science in China I have to say yeah yeah the mayor of Beijing is I believe an environmental engineering degree and the deputy mayor is a physics degree I met them and the mayor says hang high is really smart and you're up on technology what do you think about this government policy of stopping use of Huawei phones and there's there's something about the the the worry about spying is I mean from what I understand from real tech people they think it's horseshit oh I like phone I don't know I don't know like the government say don't you buy huawei phones is that are you up on that wrong no should we just plan in this idea well I think like I guess if you're if you're if you have like top-secret stuff then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use but you know like most people do not have top-secret stuff right and like nobody really cares what porn you watch yeah yeah it's like nobody actually cares you know so if they do that's kind of on them it's just like yeah like national spy agencies do not care do not give a rat's ass what porn you watch they do not care so like what secrets does a national spy agency have to learn from the average citizen nothing well that's the argument against the the narrative and the argument by a lot of these tech people is that the real concern is that these companies like Huawei are innovating at a radical pace and they're trying to stop them from integrating into our culture and letting this like right now they're the number two cell phone manufacturer in the world okay Samsung's number one Huawei is number two Apple is now number three they surpassed Apple's number two and the idea is that this is all have taking place without them having any foothold whatsoever in America they're in no there's no carriers that have their phones you have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party and then put okay so and the worry is you know that these are somehow another controlled by the Chinese government the Communist Chinese government is going to distribute these phones and I don't know if it's the worries economic influence that they'll have too much power I don't know what it is are you a you paying attention on any of this not really you know I don't think we should worry too much about hallway phones you know maybe you know our national security agencies shouldn't have how well our phones maybe that's mark but I think for the average citizen it doesn't matter doesn't just like no they're not - I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings-on of the average American citizen is that is there a time where you think that there will be no security will be impossible to hold back information that whatever bottleneck will will let go we're gonna we're gonna give in that whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate innovation will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency that we're just going to abandon it and there'll be no no security no privacy do people want privacy because they seem to put everything on the Internet well right now we're confused but when you're talking about your neural link and this this idea that one day we are going to be able to share information and we're going to be some sort of a thing that symbiotically create symbiotic and connect down I think we really need to worry about security in that situation and we're sure that's like a security repair amount sure yeah but also what we will be is will be so much different large our concerns about money about status about what all these things will seemingly go by the wayside if we really become enlightened if we really become artificially enlightened by some sort of an AI interface where we have this symbiotic relationship with some new internet type connection to information but you know what happens then what what is important what is not important is privacy important when we're all gods ha ha I mean I think the things that we think are important to keep private right now right we probably will not think our team right information right what do you what do you hide and most times what do we hide I mean I think like I don't know maybe it's like embarrassing stuff right there are some stuff but if there's actually like I think people there's like not that much that's kept private that people that is actually relevant right that's people would other people actually care about me think other people care about it but they don't really care about us and certainly governments don't well some people care about it but then it gets weird when you when it gets exposed like Jennifer Lawrence when those naked pictures or her got exposed like I think in some ways people liked her more they really like oh she's just a person that just a girl who likes sex and is just alive and has a boyfriend and sends a messages and now you get to look into it and you probably shouldn't have but somebody let it go and they put it online and alright she seems to be doing okay he's a person she's just you and me and it's the same thing she's just in some weird place where she's on a 35-foot tall screen with music playing every time she talks yeah I mean I'm sure she's she's like not if not happy about it but she's she's but she's clearly doing fine but once this interface is fully realized where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability our ability to understand irrational thoughts and mitigate them and that we're all connected and some sort of an insane way what do I mean how what our thoughts on wealth our thoughts on social status like how many of those just evaporate and our need for privacy may be our need for privacy would be the ultimate bottleneck that will have to subsea that will have to surpass I think the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future but there will be things that are important what was he more for things that only might be some war of ideas potentially I don't think Darwin's going away right no one's gonna be there no one will be there forever forever yeah it would just be a different a different arena different arena a digital arena deferred arena Darwin's not going away what keeps you up at night well it's quite hard to run companies yeah especially car companies how do they is quite challenging the car business is the hardest one of all the things you do yes because it's a consumer-oriented like SpaceX and not that SpaceX of SpaceX is no walk in the park but but a car company is very difficult to keep a car company alive it's very difficult you know there's only two car companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt and that's Ford and Tesla that's it yeah Ford rode out that crazy storm huh they're the only one I skidded their teeth shoutout to the Mustang yeah yeah by the skin of their teeth that is interesting right same with Tesla we barely survived how close did you get to folding very close we are two thousand a is not a good time to be a car company especially a start-up car company and especially an electric car company I was like stupidity squared and this is when you had those cool roadsters with the t-top yeah with a target op yeah we had like use a highly modified Elise chassis the body was all completely different but I was a super dumb strategy that we actually did was read um was based on two false premises one false premise was that we'd be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise and use that as a car platform and that we would be able to use technology from the slow company called AC propulsion for the electric drivetrain and the battery arm is the AC propulsion technology did not work in production and we ended up using none of it in the long term none of it we're to reason on everything and then the once you add a battery pack an electric motor to the cart got a heavier 30% heavier and validated the entire structure all the crash structure everything had to be redone nothing like that I think it had less than 7% of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything that's the 7% yes everything including tires and wheels bolts brakes yet even as hearing well see the steering wheel was I think the steering wheel was almost the same yes the windscreen went went skating right no I think it was clear is this the same yes I think I think we were able to keep the last one seven percent so that's right basically every body panel was different the entire structure was different the we couldn't use the H like the HVAC system the the view of the air conditioner was a belt-driven air conditioner so now we needed something that was electrically driven we needed a new AC compressor and all that takes away from the battery life as well right yeah we needed a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered not belt driven it's very difficult how much do those way but those cars the Roadster I think it was about 2,700 pounds I still very dependent which version 26:52 2020 750 pounds something like that and what was the weight distribution it was about 50 well they were different versions of the car so is about 55 on the rear because it was rigged rear bias right but not bad like considering like a 911 which is like one of the most popular sports cars of all time heavy rear end bias well I mean yeah the 911 like a joke is like the registered despite Newton not being on their side yeah if you're fighting Newton it's very difficult well it's like a you've got this the moments of inertia on on a 911 don't make any sense they do once you understand them once you don't want to hang the engine off fast because not a wise move you don't want to let up on the gas when you're in a corner the problem with up with a with a with with something that's where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear is that your polar moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed you cannot solve this it's unsolvable you're screwed pull them over to nurseries you're screwed right like essentially if you spun the car like a top that's your problem omote of inertia you're just I promised I wouldn't swear on this show by the way really my friend tell that friend to go fuck himself who told you not to swear afraid I'm not a good friend yes well I would realize you're fucking Elon Musk do whatever you want ma'am if you ever get confused call me elsewhere in private square up a storm just say frickin it's fun Wade there's like old house mom's have children yes freaking thing yeah anyway like like the Porsche it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handle is given that it's the physics yes the moments of inertia are so messed up to actually still make it work well is is incredible well if you know how to turn into the corner once you get used to the feeling of it there's actual benefits to it you know there are some benefits I enjoy I the car I had before Tesla was there 911 okay I was nine nine seven or six yeah seven yeah yeah great car man yeah I mean particularly with all the Porsche when they had the variable vanes the turbo and yet didn't have the turbo lag that was great yeah I was really great the typical AG was is like you know if you floor it like phone home call your mom about an hour later the car accelerates and super dangerous too because in the real world start spinning yeah yeah there's something fun about it though like feeling that rear weight kicking around you know and again it's great efficient how good feel to it yeah I agree but that's that's what I was talking about earlier about that little car that I have that 93 911 it's just there's it's not fast it's not it's not the best handling car but it's more satisfying than any other car I have because it's so mechanical it's like everything about it like crack holes and bumps and it gives you all this feedback and I take it to the comedy store because when I get there I feel like my brain is just popping and it's on fire it's like a strategy for me now that I really stopped driving other cars there I Drive that car there just for the brain juice just for the the inner the interaction I mean you should try model SP 100 d I'll try blow your mind up your skull okay yeah tell me what to order I'll order it one less P 100 d okay Jamie that's the desolate car that I Drive okay okay I'll get with the car you drive okay it will player might have our skull I believe you can I Drive a far greater miles that's good for LA regular days you'll never notice the battery never never how hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house that difficult now it's super easy it's like yeah it's like a dryer plug it's like a dryer Rutledge didn't you come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled yeah yeah we're have it on my roof right now actually I'm just trying it out it's like it's the thing it's it takes a while to like test roof stuff because roofs have to last a long time they're like you want your luffa roof to last like 30 years over a regular roof now that so there's two versions is like the solar panels you put on a roof so like depends on whether your roofs new or old so if your roofing roofs new you don't wanna replace the roof you want to put like solar panels on the roof right so that's like retrofit you know and then we trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice and then but then the the new product we're coming out with is if you if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're gonna replace your roof anyway then you make the site the tiles so have solar solar cells embedded in the tiles and then it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile so you have to really work with the glass and and and the land of the various coatings and layers so that you don't see the solar cell behind the glass otherwise it doesn't look right right so it's really tricky there is Jamie and put it up there yeah and that looks good see is there I see like if you look close you can see if you're zooming right you can see the you can see the cell mm-hmm but if you zoom out you don't see the cell right well it looks clean though like that's that's really hard because you have to have sunlight go through right but where to cut windows when it gets reflected back out it doesn't it it hides the fact that there's a cell there now are those available to the consumer right now well we have I think those on that roof right there yes that's amazing oh that looks good yeah ooh I like that one smart oh so you get that kind of fake Spanish looking thing I like that's French slate that's white people in Connecticut smoking pipes look at that one yeah that's badass dude so this will actually work I believe you so the the the solar panels that are on that house that we just looked at is that sufficient to power the entire home it depends on your energy on how pressure yeah yeah so generally yes I would say it's probably for most it's gonna vary but anywhere from more than you need to maybe half like call it half to 1.5 of the energy that you need depending on how much roof you have relative to living space and how ridiculous you are with TV TVs no problem and conditioning technician ignition okay air conditioning is the problem if you have an efficient air conditioner and you don't and depending on how like are you a conditioning rooms when they don't need to be at conditioned which is very common because pain in the neck and it's like programming a VCR it's like right now it's just the blinking 12:00 also people just like hell with that I'm just gonna make it this temperature all day long right I don't have a smart home where if you're in the room then it stays cool right yeah it should predict when you're gonna be home and then cool the room the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence we're not talking about like genius home here we're just talking like elementary basic stuff um you know like if you could hook that into the car like new as you're coming home like there's no pulling the home we're gonna come keeping the whole home really cool when you're not there right I can tell it you're coming home was gonna cool it to the right temperature right you have a net there that works with your solar panels or anything like that yeah yeah we do and we need to hook it into the air-conditioning to really make the air-conditioning work have you thought about creating an air conditioning system I know you have trick question I cannot answer questions about future pretend okay let's just let it go we'll move on to the next thing that would be an interesting idea yeah I would say radiant heating all that good ideas now when you when you think about the efficiency of these homes and you think about implementing solar power and battery power and is there anything else that people are missing is there any other like I just saw a SmartWatch that is powered by the heat of the human body and some new technology it's able to fully power that way I don't know if it's a fully or if it's like this watch right here this is a Casio okay it's called a pro tech and it's in like an outdoors watch and it's solar-powered okay and so it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar yeah so if you have it exposed it could function for a certain amount of time on solar yeah well you know like there's the self-winding watches where you know it's just got a weight in the watch and as you move your wrist the weight moves from one side to the other and it winds the watch up that's a pretty cool thing yeah yeah yeah it's amazing that like Rolex is that it's all done mechanically there's no batteries in there there's no nothing yeah you could do the same thing create a little charger that's based on wrist movement it really depends on how much energy or watch uses you know what's fucked up about that though we accept a certain amount of like fuckery with those watches like I brought my watch I have a Rolex that my friend Lorenzo gave me and I brought it to the watch door and I said this thing's always fast I said it's always like after a couple months it's like five minutes fast they go yep big yeah really it's just what it does hold on I go so you're telling me that it just is always gonna be fast these like yeah it's just like every few months you gotta like reset it seems like they should recalibrate that thing they can't they tried they say every few months with it's four months or five months or six months it's gonna be a couple of minutes fast okay it seems like they should really recalibrate that because if it's always fast you know delete those minutes you need to fucking kick down the door at Rolex I know you bitches are lazy it's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears it's amazing yeah I mean the whole luxury watch market is fascinating I'm not that involved in in in terms like I don't buy them I bought them as gift so I don't buy them for myself but when I look at them online with this million-dollar watches out there now that are like they have like little rotating moons and the stars and they they live like look at this thing how much is that one J these are fucking preposterous I like gears I just love them yeah I think they're beautiful but there's some of these people that are just taking it right in the ass they're buying these watches for like $750,000 Mike yeah that's a Timex son nobody knows it's not any better than some Casio that you could just buy on look at that though well here's the thing if you're a person that doesn't just want to know the time you want craftsmanship you want some artisans touch you want innovation in terms of like a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly to every time it turns over it's basically a second I mean that's just there's this art to that that's yeah I agree yeah it's not just telling time hey I like this watch a lot but if it got hit by a rock I wouldn't be sad yeah it's just a watch it's a it's a mass-produced thing that runs on some quartz battery but those things that's there's art yeah no I agree it's beautiful yeah yeah love it yeah there's something something amazing about it it's a because it represents the human creativity just it's not just electronic innovation there's something there's a person's work in that yes you don't have a watch on no ever I used to have a watch what happened Mike what phone tells the time so point what if you lose your phone do you wait hold on sure let me guess you are a no case guy that's correct Oh living on the edge Tyson Neil deGrasse Tyson was in here last week I'm marveled his ability to get through life without a case that's right you know he takes his phone and he flips it in between his fingers like like like a soldier would do with his rifle really he has roles that shit in between his fingers okay marvelous Wow he says that's the reason why they do it he said will you look at someone who has a rifle why would they do that why would they flip it around like that right so that when it goes to drop they have it in their hand they catch it quickly yeah it does with his phone he's just flipping his phone around all the time I got that in Mexico I was hoping it holds joints does it do anything it seems to open he just was a horse to hold good storage storage things in there but like try to put a joint in there close it you put like one one blunt one but seems pretentious you know that's the idea behind it I bought it when I was in Mexico because I figured it would be a good size to hold joints says that a joint or is it a cigar yes no okay it's marijuana out of tobacco okay so it's like posh plot Tobacco pot never had that yeah I think I tried one once come on man probably can't because stockholders right I mean it's legal right it's wholly legal okay how does that work do people get upset at you if you do certain things backhoe and marijuana in there that's all it is the combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful first turned on to it by Charlie Murphy and then reignited by Dave Chappelle okay plus whiskey haha exactly perfect balances it out all the holes are drug gets put grandfathered in well it's not just a drug it's a drug that gets a bad rap because you just have a little it's great fine yeah a little sip here and there and you just your inhibitions are relaxed and it shows you true self and hopefully you're more joyous and friendly and happy and worried is the people that can't handle it like the real worry about people can't handle cars and go zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds or anything have you ever considered something that like imagine if one day everyone has a car that's on the same at least technological standard as one of your cars and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device something some electro magnetic field around the cars that as cars come close to each other they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something well I mean our cars brake automatically brake yeah yeah when they see things yes but like a physical barrier like well the wheels work pretty well wheels don't ya know pretty well decelerated that's you know one point one to one point two jeez that kind of thing is your concern that one day all your cars will be on the road and then they'll still be the regular people with regular cars 20 30 years from now that'll get in the mix and beat them the main problem yeah I think it'd be sort of like it was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars in the road at the same time it's been pretty weird Oh that'd be the weirdest yeah our horses were tricky you know went back in manehattan had like 300,000 horses you figure like horse lives 15 years got 20,000 horses but dropping dead every day or ever every year should say every year 20,000 horses if there's 300 thousand horses in 15 year lifespan back in the gangs in New York days that movie yeah yeah that's a lot of dead horses and then you needed a horse to move the horse ryan they'll probably get pretty pretty freaked out if they have to move our dead horse do you think they know what's going on yeah I mean it'd be like pretty weird now my dragon is dead you know horse around and I'm a horse I mean do you ever stop and think about your role in civilization do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture cuz me as a person who never met you until today when I think of you you know I've always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit but there's not a lot of you out there like everybody else seems to be I mean obviously you make a lot of money there's a lot of people that make a lot of money you like that clock yeah right this is a great clock yeah you want one I'll get you one sure okay done I like weird things like this oh this is the coolest it's TGT promotion what is is TGT Studios TGT studios yeah to a gentleman who makes all this by hand yeah it's really cool my study is filled with weird devices well get ready for another one all right I'm sending it your way well you want to werewolf to hook you up alright I'll take one one a werewolf and one o'clock coming up do you think about your role in the culture because me as a person who never met you until today I've always looked at you and like wow like how does this guy just keep inventing shit like how do you how do you keep coming up with all these new devices and what do you ever consider how on you a dream once that there was a million Tesla's instead of like one Tesla there was a million Tesla's okay not chesley the car but Nikola oh yeah sure and that in his day there was a million people like him who were radically innovative it was a weird dream man was so strange and I've had it at once results in a very rapid technology innovation that's for sure it's one of the only dreams in my life I've had more than one time okay like where I've woken up and it's in the same dream I'm in the same dream and in this dream it's 1940s 1950s but everyone is severely advanced there's flying blimps with like LCD screens on the side of them and everything's bizarre and strange and it's stuck with me for whatever it obviously this is just a stupid dream but for whatever reason all these years that stuck with being like it takes one man like Nikola Tesla to have more than a hundred inventions that were patents right I mean he had some pretty great pretty fucking amazing ideas yes but there was early in his day there was very few people like him yeah that's true what if there was a million like what in advanced very quickly right but there's not a million Elon Musk's is one motherfucker do you think I'm about that you just try to not [Laughter] I don't think I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me well what's the worst part about you people would like it that much well most people wouldn't but they can't be you so that's like that's like some superhero type shit you know you wouldn't want to be spider-man was sleep tight in Gotham City I hope he's out there doing his job it's very hard to turn it off yeah what's the hardest part like sound great if it's done but what if it doesn't turn off now I showed you the isolation tank and you've never experienced that before no I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night yeah just give you a little bit of sleep a little bit of perspective this magnesium that you get from the water as well that makes you makes you sleep easier because the water has epsom salts in it but maybe some sort of strategy for sacrificing your biologic license in your biological recovery time by figuring out a way whether it's through meditation or some other ways to shut off that that thing at night like you must have like a constant stream of ideas it's running through your head all the time getting text messages from chicks no I'm getting text messages from friends saying what the hell are you doing smoking weed is that bad for you it's legal it's got me improved it's not you know I'm not a regular smoker of weed how often you smoke it almost never hmm I mean it's it's I don't actually notice any effect well there you go there was a time where I think it was Ram Dass or someone gave some Buddhist monk a bunch of acid okay and he ate it and it have no effect on him I doubt that I would say that too but I've never meditated to the level that some of these people out where they're constantly meditating all day they don't have any material possessions and all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset I would like to cynically deny that I'd like to cynically say hey just fuckin think the same way I do they just hang out with flip-flops on and make weird noises but maybe no you know I I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine but I don't find that it is very good for productivity for you but for me yeah it's didn't mean I would imagine that for someone like you it's not someone like you it would be more like a cup of coffee right you want your tay yeah it's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee it's like a cup of coffee in Reverse Oh weed is yeah no I'm saying you would like more more like will be beneficial to you would be like coffee I like to get things done I like to be useful that is one of the hardest things to do it'll be useful when you say you'd like to get things done yes in terms of like what are you getting satisfaction when you complete a project when something something that you invent comes to fruition and you see people enjoying it that feeling yes doing something useful for other people that I like doing it that's interesting for other people yes so that do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this I mean you essentially have a gift right I mean you would think it was a curse but I'm sure it's been fueled by many many years of discipline and learning but you essentially have a gift and that you have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology it's like you're just you're going at a very high rpms all the time what is that like this stuff I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank I was trying it sounds were concerning it's like running the engine with no resistance that is though maybe it's not maybe it's fine I don't know I'll try it I'll try it have you ever is finded experimented with meditation or anything yes what do you do or what have you done rather and we just sort of sit there and be quiet and then repeat some mantra which acts as a focal point it's dead still the mind I just don't mind but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than enlightenment and I or even the concept of whatever enlightenment means like what do you try to achieve when you're meditating all the time what view it seems like almost like there's a franticness to your creativity that comes out of this this burning furnace and for in order for you to like calm that thing down you got through you might have to throw too much water on it it's like a never-ending explosion like what is it like I try to explain it to a dumb person like me what's going on in her never-ending explosion it's just constant ideas just bouncing around yes damn yeah so when everybody leaves it's just Elan sitting at home brushing his teeth just bunch ideas bouncing around your head yeah whole time when did you realize that that's not the case with most people I think when I was I don't know five or six or something I thought I was insane why'd you think you're insane because it was clear that out people do not what their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time they weren't expressing it they weren't talking about it all day and you realized by the time we were five or six like oh they're probably not even getting this thing that I'm getting no it was just strange it was like hmm I'm strange what my conclusion I'm strange but did you feel diminished by it in any way like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with with other people they would they wouldn't understand I hope they wouldn't find out because they might like put me away with something you thought that for a second yes when you were little yeah and the other people away what if they put me away like when you were little you thought this yes Wow like you thought that this is so radically different than the people that are around me if they find out I got this stream coming in yeah Wow but you know I was only like five or six I don't really do you think this is like I mean there's there's outliers biologically you mean there's people that are seven foot nine there's people of giant hands there's people that have eyes that are 2015 vision there's always the outliers do you feel like you like caught this like you have got some you like on some weird innovation creativity sort of wave that's very unusual like you tapped into I mean just think of the various things you've been able to accomplish in a very short amount of time and you're constantly doing this that's a weird you're a weird person right I agree yeah like what if there's a million Elon Musk's well that would be very weird woo yeah I'll be pretty weird like right real weird definitely what if there are millions euro kids oh the probably is probably two million I mean I think that's the case with a lot of folks yeah I mean but like you know my goal is like try to useful things try to maximize it probably the future is good make the future exciting something you look forward to you know you know with you know with Tesla we're like trying make things that people love it was like not think I can't Howie how many things can you buy that you really love that really give you joy so rare so rare I wish there were more things that's what we're trying to just make things that somebody loves when yes when you think about making things someone loves like do you specifically think about like what things would improve people's experience like what what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy you really think like when you're thinking about things like that is that like one of your considerations like what what could I do that would help people yeah I'd be they wouldn't be able to figure out yeah like like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better like you know like so I think that a future where we are spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars this is very exciting this makes me look forward to a future this makes me want that future you know the things they need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning you wake up in the morning you look forward to the day forward to the future a future where we are spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars I think that's a very exciting that is a thing we want where as if if you knew we would not be a spacefaring civilization but forever confined to earth this would not be a good future that would be very sad I think want to search you sure of the the finite lifespan on earth itself in the solar system itself that even though its process you know I mean how many how long do they feel like this Sun and the solar system is gonna exist how many hundreds of millions of years well it's probably if you're saying that when does the Sun boil the ocean right about 500 million years so is is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens is that what you're saying no I just think like there if there are two futures and one future is we're out there among the stars and things we read about and see and science fiction movies the good ones are true we have these starships and we're we're going to see what other planets are like and we're a multi-planet species and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations and many planets and many star systems this is a great future this is a wonderful thing to me and that's what we should strive for hmm but that's biological travel that's cells traveling physically to another location yes do you think that's definitely where we're going no yeah I don't think so either I used to think so and now I'm thinking more likely less than ever like almost every day less likely we can definitely go to the Moon and Mars yeah and we think we will go to that sport belt and we can go to the moons of Jupiter Saturn even get to Pluto that'd be the craziest place ever if we colonize Mars and retie reformed it and turned it into like a big Jamaica I mean imagine great it'll be great it's patek what amazing all right we yes turn the whole thing into Cancun well I mean over time there wouldn't be easy but yes it's you could just want you could warm it up yeah you get a tear get some water there I mean over time hundreds of millions of years or whatever it takes if you're multi-planet species that would be amazing well you found a species that's what immediately like air-conditioning sad I'm pro-human me - yeah - I love humanity I think it's great we're glad as a robot that you love humans because we love you too and we don't want you to kill us and eat us and I mean you know strangely I think a lot of people don't like humanity gets hit as a blight but I do not well I think one of those that I think part of that it's just they've been you know they've been struggling when people struggle they associate their struggle with other people they never internalize their problems they look to other people as holding them back and people suck and fuck people and it's just it you know it's an Evelyn's never-ending cycle but not always again most people are really good most people vast majority this may sound corny it does sound quite love is the answer is the answer yep yeah it is it sounds corny because we're all scared you know we're all scared of trying to love people being rejected or someone taking advantage of you because you're trying to be loving sure but if we all could just relax and love each other wouldn't hurt to have more love in the world it definitely wouldn't hurt yeah it'd be great yeah we should do that yeah I agree mad really how do you fix that you have a Love Machine no but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media now deleting social media from your applications from your phones and that give you 10% boost to happiness was we think the percentages I think probably something like that yeah all right good ten percent yeah I mean I mean the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message out you know right well that's about it so far so good well what's interesting with you you you actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter yeah it's what percentage of that is a good idea haha go to questions in percent sorry it's mostly I think it's unbalanced more good than bad but there's definitely some bad so do you ever hopefully the good outweighs the bad do you ever think about how odd it is the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitty to you on Twitter and you read it the weird feeling there's a weird little negative jolt it's like a subjective negative jolt of energy they don't really need to absorb but you do anyway won't fuck this car welcome I mean there's a lot of negativity on Twitter it is but it's a weird it's in its form like the way if you ingest it as if you're like you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it you're like well weird is this and I'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me it's not even accurate I mean the vast number of negative comments so the vast for the vast majority I just ignore them the vast majority yeah particularly now and again get drawn in what good it's not good make mistakes yes you can make mistakes make some mistakes we're all human we can make mistakes yeah it's hard and people love it when you say something and you take it back no I'd fuck you we saved it forever fucking screenshot that shit bitch you had that thought you had that thought like well I deleted it not good enough you had the thought I'm better than you I never had that thought you had that thought you piece of shit look I saved it I put it on my blog yeah I'm not sure why people think that that anyone would think that's a leting a tweet it makes it go away it's like hello than the internet for a while yeah well it's even like anything is they don't prefer you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you don't delete it and you don't believe it anymore it's really hard to say hey that thing above I don't really believe that anymore I changed my way the way I view things yes because people go well fuck you alright have that over there I'm gonna just take that I'm not gonna pay attention that shit your rotors you know it's on your permanent record it's forever - we'll put this on your permanent record yeah it's like a tattoo you keep it oh yeah yeah well it's it's this thing where there's it's it's a there's a lack of compassion it's a lack of compassion issue people just like intentionally shitty to each other all the time online and trying to catch me it's they're more trying to catch people doing something that's arrested ball like a cop trying to like get you know arrests on is his record it's like they're trying to catch you with something more than they're logically looking at it thinking it's a bad thing that you've done or that it's an idea they don't agree with so much they need to insult you trying to catch you yeah I mean it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person yes waiter yeah it's weird so it's not a normal way of human interacting it's chilling they're not supposed to be able to interact so easily what people are not looking at yes you would never do that you'd never be so mean someone's looking in their eyes and if you did you'd feel like shit most people yeah unless you're sociopath you'd feel terrible yes Elon Musk this has been a pleasure yeah likewise really has been an honor thank you for having me um thanks for doing this cuz I know you don't do a lot of long-form stuff like this I hope I didn't weird you out and I hope you don't get mad that you smoke weed I mean bad it's legal weird California this is elite just as legal as this whiskey we've been drinking exactly this is all good right Cheers thank you is there any message you would like to put out other than loves the answer because I think you really nailed it with that yeah I think you know I think people should be nicer to each other and give people and give get more credit to others and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean you know just it's easy to demonize people usually wrong about it a little nicer than you think get people more credit I couldn't agree more and I want to thank you not just for all the crazy innovations you've come up with and your constant flow of ideas but that you choose to spread that idea which is it's it's a very vulnerable but it's very honest and I it resident wrote me and I believe it I believe it's true too so thank you all you assholes out there be nice be nice bitch alright thank you everybody thank all right Lana good night everybody [Music]
