the girag and experience and the one thing that I noticed and I've said it before is like and I feel like other people have noticed is that because I've gotten a lot of fights when I was young but I don't think I ever won one and I feel like I must exude this kind of waft of something that like I just am NOT a fighter but every time I've gotten in a fight it's been more that someone is I feel like it's taking trying to take advantage of me or has been picking on me for a long period of time and it's the only way that this is gonna stop or have been or been picking on someone that I I cared about and and I always got the sense afterwards that the person who beat me up basically knew it knew that they're like they I can draw Davidson into a fight and oh and and he'll he'll willingly go in he'll go into the bear trap and then I'll just be able to beat him up and the only good thing about it or ultimately is that they the the picking on stuff stopped you know what I mean but I had to take a beating in order to sort of affect that you know yeah that's a weird psychological sort of a relationship between the bully and the person who gets picked on yeah yeah but I feel like and I feel like the real true fighters wouldn't even do something like that they would recognize why you know with this guy I mean yeah I mean me I don't know maybe maybe those new fighters who like to beat the shit out of people or you see yeah yeah um you notice in fights sometimes I feel like that guy looks like he probably might have would be happy to be beating up someone with far less skill he taking as much delight in it as he is usually they've been abused is that so yeah yeah I believe that's a big part of a lot of what would constitutes a bully is physical abuse you know that they've been abused either at home or they've been abused by other kids and they're trying to lash out and get theirs now yeah they've sort of taken on the role of the bully because they've been bullied so much that happens a lot I could see that I actually here's the here's the sort of a story of my one of my my worst beatings I was at the YMCA me and my brother were playing basketball and I was probably like I sixteen seventeen eight times my my last year of high school probably and these two guys come say let's let's play two on two so we did and back then I probably weighed like 240 I was a I was a big fat dude you know I just turned 40 in high school yeah yeah maybe maybe maybe 2:30 like I was enormous but it was not it was not a healthy weight obviously what do you weigh now 175 180 so that's partly the whole boxing stuff and we do tree planting a lot up in Canada that's sort of like what you do at university you just go up to the woods and plant trees and that I shed a lot of weight that way during during university but so I was a big beast you know and I sort of knew how to use my body and the guy that I was playing against was maybe 1 1 60 so we were getting close to beat them and I turn around and I see the ball it's a whip and right at my face he'd thrown it at me and I turned my head and it sort of goes by the side of my head and just you know gives me a scalp burn basically and then he's then he's charging right at me like to get into a fight I'm and there was no propriety no none at all that's the thing I mean this guy just a basketball he's just a basketball game and and and okay it's in the Y so I'm like okay well we're not gonna have a fight right middle the Y I think I'm gonna be okay that's I mean I didn't really want to get into a fight but again this guy sort of basketball I mean it's pretty shitty move so anyways this guy comes out he's got to be like 80 years old he's like one of those guys at the Y that was like a retired gym teacher and they sort of said okay bill you can just start you hang out around here and keep order that's the be nice of you to do that so he comes out and he's got a whistle around like an old P whistle around his neck neke he says take it outside I'm like I told the last thing I want to do is take this outside but and and and he says that's it guys you take this outside so I'm like oh Sh I'm sort of like being shoehorned into going out to having a fight with this guy so I'm going down the hallway and my brother is that's like out of a rut he's massaging my shoulders cuz I guess he thinks that's what he should be doing you know that's how so little we know about fighting you know what I mean he's my brother's like well I guess I've seen this in Rocky I should keep him keep him limber you know he's like you're you're gonna be fine and if I but I had a chance to look in his eyes he'd be like you are you are you are fucked you know what I mean and I think I knew that too so we ended up side outside it's it's winter in Canada and there's you know ice on the on the sidewalk and you know I face up and what I assume is some of somewhat of a fighting posture and he kicks me in the head it's the first thing he does just like kicks me right in the head and I'm not even sure what the hell happened I'm still standing you know and then he does it again and then I'm like oh god this is not this is not good so he had martial arts training yeah yeah definitely and then you know there was a bike rack and I remember you like rang my my head off of it and I get him in a you know sort of a headlock and and I remember being like face down and there's like ice melts on the street you know that those blue crystals they put down you know and I my face is pressed into it and thankfully it goes on for a while clearly I'm beat and he's like are you are we are we add enough here I'm like yeah I mean I've had enough that's enough so he goes back inside chuckling with his buddy I'm sitting out there on the street bleeding I don't even want to go back into the Y you know what I mean I'm gonna have the people inside going what the hell happened you need help and I'm like I just want to crawl into a hole and you know not see humanity for about a month so my brother goes inside gets my clothes we go I find out later this guy we lacrosse is a big sport in our in our country and he was like the enforcer I'm across the lacrosse team like the Triple A lacrosse team so he was a tough guy like I didn't have a chance you know right from the get-go I didn't have a chance and then you know I discovered his name because we lived in a small town and you sort of these things sort of come to you as time goes by and then my buddy calls me up but a couple years later he says did you hear about so-and-so I said no I was away at University at this point he's like they went camping in the woods and hit him and his dad and this work gets back to your idea of abuse he stabbed his dad 44 times killed him killed him in woods and they caught him just walking down the street with a knife in his hand and and you know later on they interview his mom and his mom was like yeah he was you know he basically would sit out on the porch saying that he Bush was gonna come in Air Force One any time pick him up for some top-secret mission so he clearly had some some mental instabilities that didn't present themselves at the age at which at least they were maybe emerging but later who I mean that part had never been been into I can't really comment on that but I mean I I don't know but I think I feel like he stabbed the man 44 times it would have to be a really heated argument and if they had no prior sort of history with one another I don't I don't really know but first of all that he stabbed him and then he stabbed him about many times holy Sh yeah and I thought of thought later like man as bad as I got it I mean I could have got a lot worse you know what I mean at least he like let me off at the end he's like alright well I I always try to explain that someone who gives people the finger in a car like you never know who you're giving the finger to exactly my wife has a bad habit of honking the horn I'm like baby I love you but don't don't do it don't don't know who the hell's stepping out of that freaking car you know not only that you never know what state they're in there yeah be in the worst state of mind ever at the moment you lay on that horn you could have caught them at the breaking point yeah and that's what puts them yeah you pick fucking people especially in this day and age when you're dealing with cities and traffic and the unnatural stress of slamming 200 fucking million people together like this very so you're like holy shit I'm I'm up against a different breed of humanity right guys kicking me in the head I don't know where and you know you're just trying to play basketball your brother's rubbing your shoulders you either want to be able to do we're totally neophytes and and yeah and there was something you know this is probably way too like right early but there is something about the eyes of a guy like that just like I'm you know you know you're done before you're done you know you're done before hundreds of those dudes yeah there's just something clock working around in their eyes like and you're just like oh no no no I'm not I'm not built to this standard this is not gonna work out too well for me
