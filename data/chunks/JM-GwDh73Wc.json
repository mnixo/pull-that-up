last chance for romance here otherwise we're just gonna film and then put it up is it alive really i centered machine ice energy should happen we've been having problems with our TriCaster doesn't want to try it's like not today every third show won't go live i centered the cheeto I sent the energy dude you made it happen this is rare wake-and-bake day I don't do this you don't know no I get shit done first usually can you not get shit done when you wake and bake I kind of fuck off things if I get what's what's important really I I get stuff done really yeah I have like you know I'll do like my cup of coffee and a joint and I'll get some stuff done I joke that it's like it makes me super motivated to do not a goddamn thing but I get stuff done I mean all the stuff I get done is I like vacuum seven times it's a meth thing you sure someone's not slipping into I mean let's not put all the rumors out there now but you got anybody Bravo I used to say that about girls like he would if it was dating because Eddie used to work at a strip club and he dated a lot of the gals that were performers there and he said you really know when a girl's a meth head cuz you go over a house that's always clean she's always clean the big never clean enough maybe I'm a Virgo apparently speed freaks not method as far as favorites when people are on speed maybe coffee is the thing that does it to me and then I just get focused from the weed there's not one ounce of dog hair in my house really keep it fresh that's crazy you have like $50 you're a crazy dog lady I do every three dogs wait don't you have like a pack of chicken in your backyard dude I used to what happened to him coyotes got them all I thought you were up with the bow and arrow no we had an issue where our chicken coop burned to the ground oh fuck fires you wash ladies no we didn't they they managed to fly out and they were in the yard we lost two of them because they wouldn't we couldn't round them up to get them into the chicken pen and because we got a new chicken pen what it wasn't as big and then they were too good for IO ds8 those two and then they realized that they're all in this one pen and one they were gone they opened it up and got him killed all nine of them how they all had they opened him up pulled it apart with her teeth yo dog sir listen once domestic dogs but they're smart the difference between a coyote and a domestic dog is like the definition of hardened criminal on death row yeah and a baby no your hundred-percent right it's experience and to survive Donna survived and they don't have a house he's feeding them food I mean they're fucking little wolves yeah and it's like literally dog-eat-dog world out there yeah what was the gentleman dan coyote America the the author god damn it was he like a dude who lived amongst the world's yes Dan Flores no he's a wildlife biologist and a historian yeah he was talking about the history of coyotes and wolves in North America apparently all wild dog species came from North America even like jackals yeah shit like that like they made it across over there somehow like during the pangaea's period or so yeah it's an era no yeah it's well when they think that all of the continents were connected together yeah we are one we were one flat earth a giant chunk and then the rest was water and then it spread out which is fucking weird is happening how did that in like also is that happening on our insides unlike us it's obviously on a cellular level everything's just splitting and being torn the fuck apart there it is here's the the modern Pangaea map this is modern the modern country separations and all that because oh this is what it looked like I thought this is this more America what is that I thought there was some knuckleheads that thought that is that really all the continents together whoa it shows you how much goddamn water there is that's a mind fuck yeah because you really like to think that we're all dirt and not as much water it's so much water it's all water it's like a little speck in a huge ass ocean that's what's really crazy those ground-dwelling motherfuckers of figured out house suck all the fish out of that water I know just to be able to get those suckers out sometimes with your bare hands and then they're like yo we need something we need a smaller situation I think until they came up with nets and stuff like that I don't think they were real effective I think they just got what they got and they ate that but the populations were fine yeah but in the last whatever 150 years they've been using Nets they just jacked that whole ocean what do you think happened to the dude who figured out like the hook he probably got all the pussy in town but due to like hook the fish he was getting all those fishies he was getting the ones that were way deep what the kind of pussy that you would get back when you invented other you don't want it in your modern mind you don't but then you're like yo this is fresh fresh it only smells like must for sure yeah let's guess how long ago do you think they invented the fish shark do they even know I'm gonna say it's a really old invention yeah native before breeding those bitches would just break if you think about a big fish hooking like a little thin would they make it that bone probably must be bone you think don't want to be too heavy so just thinking would also break yeah wouldn't be able to hook it well yeah it must have been bone I bet it was bone yeah but bones get brittle especially after like you know they're off the body and they start to mm-hmm calcify and all that but how old do you think it is it's got to be really old juniper what it says juniper wood was the first one time twenty three thousand years ago what Christ there's Norwegians yeah those they were made from sea snail shells a bunch of information all put together in this in Okinawa Island dated between 20 2003 80 and 20 2007 70 in that crazy they get it that close they're basically in you know you know give or take 8090 years hundred years it's like is it carbon dating I mean that's the only thing I remember from high school how do you even how do you date it back do they find is it like a forensic thing where they grab a fly and they're like yeah this was six years ago because of the juices on the wings I think it's me there's like a bunch of factors like one of them is the dirt that's around where they fly like if they find it on the ground then it's covered with dirt over hundreds and hundreds of years they could take some of that dirt and yes yeah they're trying to test I think wow that's crazy I want those as earrings is that a fishhook yeah I click do that's how the showers yo those are fresh those are really nice I would rock those would you yeah we store oldest fishhook found in Okinawa Wow 23,000 years ago that's crazy and so they're saying that the oldest fishhook is linked to the Norwegians I would say Japanese this is Okinawa yeah Norwegian thing was saying that and up until the 1950s there were they were still using wood and oh yeah Japanese make sense what if they all figured it out at the same time different spots in the world you know whether if it's one of those things like you know I think there's just some weird thing who's that is that Rupert Sheldrake is the morphic resonance theory he's got this weird theory that I think the idea is that if some rat learns a maze on the East Coast rats on the West Coast will learn that maze quicker what Wow like a like a they don't know the collective consciousness amongst the rats as weird as it sounds there might be some sort of strange connection that all rats share and not just all rats but all living beings his argument was that if this is demonstratable with a rat in a maze that if they did something like with human beings if they could figure out a way to to prove this that's likely what's happening is that like he brought up a bunch of different factors like inventions that are simultaneously taking place like all over the world like what and strange you should attribute some of that's education right like yeah definitely education what's going on like that the the trends that are happening in education but like but they also think there might be something else going on underneath the surface on a different realm like if you learn if we're all a species and you're on one side of the world you learn something the people on the other side of the world have like greater access to it in some weird way that's really bizarre I don't that freaks me out that's like matrix E shit right there it's also unprovable and you bring it up the real scientists they get upset with you but what's interesting though is the mat the map thing the maze thing with mice and rats because I think that's Percy if that's been proven a pretty sure thing that if you show a major rat on one side of the country they learn it quicker on the other side how I don't understand how that can even be a thing well there's another one that's really interesting but I don't know how much of this is just because they didn't observe it before but they've noticed that apes are starting to use tools like cell phones to text each other no not that yet what weren't monkeys using tools together no but apparently they use tools like to get like they'll stick sticks into anthills to keep ants but they'll also use rocks to break things open doing that before I would imagine apes would follow suit I think they've that what they're saying is they're saying officially that they've entered into the Stone Age oh boy so like if we are watching if you saw the human evolved from being a person that you know what we whatever the fuck we used to look like when they first figured out fishhooks grinding to today you know there's many many generations of change and all sorts of different shit that we learned that we are watching literally the birth of that separation between like the regular chimps that are just chillin in the forest - the chimps that are starting to figure out tools and weapons right it's the first day we see a chimp make a fucking spear a spear sharpen it up and stab another chimp to death chimps are becoming woke is that what's happening it's like they're becoming enlightened and smarter I don't think just chimps there was one with an orangutan it was amazing a maritime spear fishing oh no oh dude you gotta see it it's prettier I mean it's really crazy but like it's a beautiful fish it's gonna be walking down the highway with a briefcase soon I don't think it's gonna be there freaky man freaks me out but it is so we're witnessing evolution they're learning things and this one I think their issue was that this orangutan had watched fishermen do this so he had apparently watched some fishermen like stand on a Ledge and stab fish so he decided to try to figure it out himself that makes sense I mean that's how all creatures essentially I mean puppies kittens they all learn it's just it's to a limit they don't get past that sort of being able to use tools you get that picture that's wild bringing up video too so I thought there might have been video my dog opened his dog food container when I was gone damn a twist a twisted yes did it I gotta get a camera but I came home and that top was twisted off and his belly was like the rang Tang spearfishing I mean that's crazy if you saw that in a movie you would say that is fake that is so that looks like it's still from Jungle Book it's amazing it's an amazing photo wish you get that photo framed Jimmy get up that photo and let's do that that's really cool name that fucker framed I talked about this picture all the time that is so wild so fascinating it really looks like the Jungle Book you know um have you ever had your 23andme done about it but like how accurate is it you know like what's with the science you're just gonna trust a piece of paper that comes back I wanted to go to the lab and see who's doing this like how do you know you're not just getting some like you know general packet that they're sending back to you how do you know why would they do that because they got your money why would anyone do anything why are motherfuckers throw-in fits in grocery stores people are crazy you know what we're talking about if you get high yeah you get a little bit just a little bit psychotic like there's something yeah something happens yeah then you really do like enter into the world of schizophrenia yeah you just did it I know this is good yeah what did it say all kinds of stuff mostly stuff I knew that I'm mostly Italian and Irish but they put Irish and English together which I thought was interesting I've 1.6% African 57% more Neanderthal traits than the average person I could have told you that I could without even the blood work I saw that I saw the paperwork I'm like that my figures I mean I knew wrong look at that look at that face look at the head you're definitely Neanderthal you're like your a link that's missing for sure no it's just Italians in general and don't be angry my Italian people cuz I'm Sicilian what's strange monkey folk right I should be your next special title system this when I was in Italy we had cab drivers and the cab drivers would like to stick their head out the window stare at someone's ass like this they're smooth but it's just it's just they're savage they're like and then I thought about it I was like well of course they are like they used to be the Romans yeah imagine how gross life must have been like back then with people gross it's gross now but it was really gross then without plumbing and I will say yours toilet seats are the warmest I've ever sat on thank you very much so it compared from here to the Roman era yeah nasty yeah what did they do they boil their oil or their shit though went through the streets right oh yeah part of the problem that's why everybody was infected and shaken I mean there was no system they couldn't figure mulch you know maybe like fertilizer to pour over it but that was it you know what I bet it was like it's like people who throw their cigarette butts on the ground like someone will clean it yeah someone also clean it some little at you know some will hand will grab it some old poor kid but I mean there's no perspective they were just in their own little yeah they didn't know they didn't know they were living as sophisticated as anybody that ever did this shit holes is that where you shat in that's a shithole and you around a bunch of other people's shadow no no it's all shit together you put your toes and you get a mani a pedicure that's what that little thing do you think that those folks had like curtains in between them when they shat look at that corner seat yeah right there how about that one he's touching everybody is touching shit yeah they were all just in it having a conversation talking about the latest gladiator sports yeah can you believe the Tiger got him I don't know why sounds when we were there they were talking about the front rows the front rows were all the rich people sat to watch the Coliseum and that was when if a tiger did get out that's where they usually got to those people and killed a bunch of him that's iron ironic just there to get a front-row seat and then nature's like Gow gotcha get support look at that they're all jerking each other off my god sandals of course this is everything in sandals who's the guy with the satchel all the way on the left Pluto okay covering this cock oh I bet that's not true dogs in the hole yeah all the shit on the floor shit on everything so what they were like what are these spoons for somebody shit scooping the poop out of your body with spoons - Oh probably scoop the water out is a disgusting facts I'm appalled Oh Oh water oh boy who's this guy some guy with a video and discuss it with poop yeah you guys have the nicest toilet here ever I can't imagine I mean what was sex like back then and even though they're in their own era and their perspective is limited because of you know just where they're at it still must have been gross this guy had to be disgusting they must have smelled terrible there's no soap there's no soap there's no no well they must have had some eyes up it was like you know it just wasn't as fancy as our soaps yeah there's no deodorant no deodorant and water what is going on here Jamie or they're sharing that spoon thing I can't tell what is this in a real moment wipe with or if it that looks like a little Dickie and Cosby here's the other thing too why not be a little further apart boys yeah why are they so close hey hey fellow with the robe how about you scoot over there's a couple extra stall to share that spoon pour that spoon on your butt three loose he was down a couple seats but homie needed a hand to hold I think what that was is they would take that spoon and they would wash their hands I'd use their hand to wash their but that's so barbaric that's why I think you're not supposed to shake hands with your left hand in some cultures I think - but why pinning it yeah so you would take the water you'd pour it in your hand if I had to guess lather your butthole that's disgust foggers were wearing Leafs anyways is outfit worn loose a couple dudes around the leaf shirt and a leaf outfit I think the Leafs are something they added to those Roman statues when people got mad about the penis they got a little weird they got a little modest they were sensitive they were modest then without any plumbing well I think they um they just decided to ditch were bad so moron I decided a sponge on the end of a stick they would wipe them Bunge since we got these toilets that actually clean your butt with warm water when you press a button it's more nicest well it's also the cleanest like what are we doing smear and shit around all you're doing is like smear and everywhere on the handles if shit came out of your nose would you be comfortable just smearing it like that and just give it a good wipe are we in Rome or are we in you know right now Ventura California yeah no I'm a very clean person i wet nap that bunghole whenever I can all day long keep it crisp good boom keep it crisp and clean do you think that you would use one of those toilet things hell no you wouldn't absolutely not you'd see me crapping in the window I mean this one the one we have are you kidding me that's the most luxurious Noah movie I've ever taken in my life there was like a remote control yeah that's like the upper echelon of society crap right there it's very fancy it's not that expensive really no it's not I mean for what it does it's like very very valuable at first I was confused because there was a couple on Dell what's it called bra bra bra no bra Rondo yeah say give them some love I think give us for free to there's a remote there too with a bunch of settings Brundle yeah it's a very nice toilet and that's like a model from like many years ago they have it nailed they had it nailed like oh no no these are recent these are ones that we bought when we got the studio right yeah it wasn't too hot either didn't feel like someone was just sitting there you know you ever have that experience where it's like there's a there was a but just here right there's a pleasure that you don't want to stay here all the back tears want to sit the engine on the crabs do you do you like only crap in certain places where you go like cuz on the road you travel a lot like you just got to go do you do what you got to do yeah I'm not scared discriminating in public like not even just being Joe Rogan and like being next to the person who's like what are you gonna do you're shitting yeah have you seen the bathrooms like at Venice Beach though are you oh going in there I see whenever you do then that smell of homeless that wino piece my room that is Rome there's a thing where you get pissed so close that people are wearing forever you know that super ripe pungent homeless crazy person smells it's it's it's the most things smell ever it's a weird smell similar but it's real similar like this is what what well you get it's usually a person that's got mental illness and they pissed themselves or shit themselves and they get this really deep horrible odor to them they don't even know but it's so similar it's similar it's like same it's like the same smell like Bo like really bad Bo is almost always the same kind of smell I would imagine yeah we're just using salt rocks to clean our pits we found out that and modern industrialized deodorant is really just a plot it's just a plot you know what else like furthermore to your point they really abuse the chemicals and the ingredients so this is like cruelty free free yeah nobody's like offended well they make the product yeah you either get it all natural which is like rocks I've ever seen those things like mineral rocks you smell like a salty homeless person yeah what is this salt in your pits work is that what people do you know it works well if you don't have a deodorant or anything lemon citrus it's a you know antibacterial natural notion yeah that makes sense spritz some oregano oil on that that's it also antimicrobial natural and asset and its antiseptic eucalyptus oil in your nether regions though that might hurt I hurt the couch couch are you maybe Kenny a soap called defense soap it's all made with natural oils yeah the best is designed for grapplers cuz grapplers get like skin scratch like scratches and infections and a lot of ringworm and shit gross have you had ring Oh bunch times what yeah I've had ringworm I've had staff twice and I had ringworm I think three times isn't that basically like three times because I've had it on my feet which is basically the same thing you poke your finger and poop and scratch right that's science you are a doctor it's bacterial I don't think so um I think ringworm is just a parasite and it's what happens is it gets through I think it gets through broken skin patch skin and then it forms this weird ring like a bull's-eye dude fucking gross I can't I can't deal with it like shows like the monsters that inside of me I don't want to know abou someone sent me a link it was Josh wolf sent me a link about the the little like mites that are in your eyelashes you can handle people in their cars in the 405 I don't want to know about fucking mites in my eyelash imagine if you could just see on the 405 as you're driving how many people have Lices Oh lights on the cars there should be that's the future that's what we need I don't want to know your followers I wonder how many Lices you have in your fucking like this is a weird one because lice is around when I was a kid it's not around first of all I can't get anymore thank you I know your ears your immune lice free your impervious to lice but when I was a kid I was like what are they gonna figure this life thing out because apparently adults don't get it so one thing in this we really know hardly ever have like those last time you had your the hair check for lice well I'm not hanging out napping in a kindergarten where children are riddled with it but if I did it how are the kids getting it cuz they roll around going head to head talking about you know there's got to be patient zero what the fuck's going on with patient zero some little kid probably some rich kid whose parents neglect him and he's had them in there for a long time yeah he's got rich lice rice you think that's funny it really does it does it's kind of it's an amazing it's amazing medicine for your brains super weird when you're not high and you watch some people that are and ya know we're both of us that's right Jaime's high - yeah he's very responsible those oven mitts on your shirt Jamie oh that makes me want like a grilled cheese sandwich I don't know why yeah but what is that Johnny Cupcakes oh cool wouldn't it be amazing if grilled cheese sandwiches were super good for you oh god it's my one thing that I just it's my food like the one thing french fries imagine french fries were this shit it's like they found out that it actually turns your age back does that work yeah it's the fry part that's the worst if you just had the sweet potato fries bacon you're good it's not as bad I don't I think it depends on what kind of oil you're cooking under but I think whenever you cook anything in hot oil there's something about the way the oil breaks down that your body's like what I think it gets Larson agendas doesn't it I don't know but I like when you use big words [Laughter] eat french fries doctors carcinogenic right god damn this health plan fuck you Obama fuck your singer pay care shit you can't afford health care come over my house I'll let you know if you're carcinogenic or not there's something real gross about people that are like you know better health care go get better health care yeah like it's just readily available that's one of the grossest ones when you don't you don't feel for fellow citizens in our community that don't have health care no I didn't have health care for ever just let it go you know I got it a week ago and I booked all the appointments did you everything I got the kitty cat checked got the teeth checked nice sighs were you worried about the teeth you have the feeling like you have a cavity like a some phantom cavity like shit yeah how's my tooth hurt don't have a fucking cavity I definitely did my teeth were like crevices Oh Jeff bunch cavities yeah she filled me like four times because I haven't been because health care is ridiculous you know I wasn't eating candy you get all these holes in your face I don't know I think like you know changes in my life maybe I got ringworm from you too changes [Music] two changes yeah little kids get it all the time they do oh dude just rolling in dirt I'm gonna blow your way blow your mind away okay hookworm is was super common in the south and it literally diminishes your capacity for thinking so like the idea like God Southern dumb person see oh no sorry I didn't know she was gonna do that I love you no no not fear but maybe people feel know he's relative have you had a say they feel gone voice like maybe a few people that I know yes yeah yeah there were all hookworm victims what so how do you get hookworm walking around barefoot ah I mean that there's just too many opportunities to get these worms in your body oh for sure that's so gross like when you see dudes who go to like some foreign country and they get scratched and they come back on a botflies clone other in their belly a kid just died recently in India I think it was India he got a infection he was having headaches and it turns out worms from pig feces had they made it all the way up into his brain and they were making cysts all throughout his brain they said it was so bad they couldn't even give him deworming medication because if they did they were worried his brain would start bleeding and that you know he would suffer from a stroke what I am NOT gonna sleep tonight all this worm talk it was a terrible cirrhosis pulled out pictures I find they have pictures of the dude's brain it's just like filled with cysts in the morning oh you know what I was saying before I forgot to bring my fanny pack you gave me one of your fanny packs and I travel with that everywhere thank you very much from glad you enjoy it it's the most trying to spread the resourceful thing this is my fanny pack I know where this I have the same one and a couple people have talked some shit and I was like you better step step back step back I've got money pharmacy in there I've got my whole thing so I can be a doctor on the road in a second scope I got a scalpel what's up he complained of having pain in his groin and swelling in his eye and then they found out he had cysts all over his brain I mean I have pain in my groin every week look at his brain on the right I'm assuming as a result both of its different views they're both different views those little holes are all cysts in sizes Bronk his brain is literally imploding although those little spots those little white spots those are all little cysts inside his brain that must have been painful a fucking pure agony it must be pure egg and this was in India you said what country versus man in India yeah you know talk fuck that and just imagine like people having not the access to health care in this country but at least we're a little bit modernized being in one of those countries in being poor you're fucked you're so fucked by swallowing microscopic eggs passed in the feces of a person who has intestinal pork tapeworm I never go on a brunch again but think about that's not even just pork tapeworm it's the eggs in the shit of a person who has the tape do you see what Jesus trollee Helms get in your mouth I'm sure I smoked a joint before this shit I am in a pure panic attack you don't eat in India unless that person is on anti tapeworm medication also never eat ass again I mean this is a PSA for anti ass eating it is I told you I had he cool I have few weeks ago that was my life Hussein Jamie there's been a change in the way that the pork industry is gonna be doing inspections that the government is gonna stop doing it apparently as of like early May and the industry is now taking over Oh that'll be R that's just that's exactly what you want this is one of those things where people that are all in favor of deregulating everything you need to understand this shit like this happens if these people cut corners and we know people have cut corners before maybe it's not all of them maybe most of them are gonna be great people gonna die sick they're gonna get ecole are they gonna get all sorts of fucked up things 40% and replacing them with my cutting the number of federal inspectors by about 40% that is such a bad idea well it looks like America and everywhere is gonna get a whole bunch of hookworms this is like having the Mafia police the streets taking away there would be no slaughter line speeds oh that is so gross no strong make it quicker pork is a weird one pork is a weird one it's too risky man it's way too risky no it's not even that I mean it they're they're fucking smart yeah one of the weird things are they're like smart like a dog they're like a five-year-old aren't they they're maybe not your kid like a five wow wow shots fired Wow doctor yeah fired right into my reproductive heart I mean you're a five-year-old be like what do you think he'd be like stoner see you're probably right actually you know a grade five year old my kid will be chill you know what he wouldn't be beating up your kid but he made very nice you'd be surprised my parents are hippies I know it sure I do know that yeah my mom's so super happy so but poor yeah eating pig is weird because they are a very intelligent creature their intent but here's the other weird part about it you gotta kill him because they breed like crazy and in a while they go nuts they're everywhere in the wild their tusks grow very fast they become very barbaric those are tusks oh my see that little tray yeah those pigs are they look like that's a wild boar oh that's from my from Adam green tree he killed that in Australia they have a problem with them in Australia too it's wild how how hollow it is but it's so it's so strong even still yeah that's a big-ass hook we should go fishing with this and see what we can catch up a whale with that yeah we could definitely catch like a humpback or something with this puppy it's a weird thing they're their teeth or they're shaped like these weird swords that is crazy and they grow so fast if you release a pig that those things these things pop out in a couple months yeah there's a while yeah they start changing when they're not taken care of like it's like remember that movie with Howie Mandel walk like a man remember that where he was like a kind of vaguely he was like raised by wolves or something that's kind of like almost the equivalent of him coming back to society is releasing a pig in it becoming wild not that I'm calling Howie Mandel a pig but he's a nice he's the opposite of a pig very nice gentleman but he's also like a super-clean for he's not getting ringworm or hookworm there's he's not getting any of the worms but he might because you like washes his hands a lot too much yeah you can do too much and you kill your skin yeah you fuck up your fauna and flora getting the imbalance you show us it was like raised by creatures in the wild and this lady cuz you know women especially a white lady's trying to like you know save them she wants to save them and do good for him and so he's just trying to acclimate great stoner movie by the way where do you think this was the 89 787 yeah man Dells been around for him he's been around and he looks younger now than he did then dudes you fuckin do this maybe it's washing your hair maybe it's a good move washing and shaving it's how washing hands yeah it probably is crazy no we're very clean in the society we you know we can't handle like natural bacterias that exists in nature it fucks us up we're gonna we're gonna end up just murdering ourselves because of how clean we are I think much more likely we're gonna develop resistant strains of bacteria that are murderous we already has there's a new one that they did just did you see that flu virus that's like that article there's an article that just came out about some mysterious infection that's been Merkin people that's because we're to clean we keep we should have we should bring back the Roman toilets just to level it all out a bit have a couple of them sprinkled around I don't think just a couple of them you know in the parties what's the difference between those in a port-a-potty if you like work in a construction site I can't hold a hand in a port-a-potty do you ever go to like a music festival fuck no and use one of them in the shit that blue liquid no I'm not and that's a low point I'm not doing that so I can get that worm that feels cousins have I'm not doing that shit are you showing me Jamie what festival are people at the art barefoot or as the deadly fungal infection resistant to treatment that's what it's called that's bad yeah all right sounds like a new solar system unstoppable fungus killing the world's banana supply man addicted to sniffing socks man addicted develop severe fungal lining infection this can't be real this is like stoner news here's another Walt linga socks aren't sexual says Kiwi school we fall down a clickbait clickhole is like Gary Busey who's writing these hide this how about what Tim Poole told me ready for this you know those clickbait sites where you go to and it's like you won't believe what she looks like now and then you click on that and then you go to another one just like never ending quickly click click they get they gather up all these cliques like if they have a site that's responsible for like 400,000 unique clicks a day if they have something like that right they sell it to another company those clicks another company attaches those clicks to their site and says we get a hundred thousand views a day so they're not real there's a bot there clicks you can buy clicks dude what world are we in right now buy and clicks I don't have time I don't have time please find out that's true I think it is it sounds cool doesn't lie he's and I know a lot of people right now like people buying likes people have done that or like followers it's the same it's the same yeah they will they definitely do that Internet there's a way to do that people get busted because like they don't have any interactions like so they'll put up something and like a put up a video and the video gets like a thousand views but they have like a million followers yeah that doesn't make sense there's no that that doesn't make any sense when the engagement doesn't match up with I watch the people all kinds of dumb shit the amount of time that I've wasted watching people's internet videos so those little Instagram videos they make the thing you posted today about the the Florida headline oh that was some that was like the Florida headline for sure that was like what you said in the caption that was legit yeah I was right in this bit about exotic pets and when I'm in the middle of this bit I just decided to start researching what what inspired you to write something I'll tell you I don't want to do the bit enough to says Florida man tries to start naked Fight Club at chick-fil-a a Florida man was arrested after he challenged others to fight and to stare at his genitals outside of chick-fil-a why did Dan Bilzerian say people just can't act right trust me that's a good job at himself points points to Bilzerian or at least come in correct which is funny that is a ridiculous head also where can I sign up it sounds fun it's like Game of Thrones for meth heads naked Fight Club yeah why not you want to go to watch from like a neighboring parking lot with binoculars hell yeah that's you want to do you want to gate that you want to be far enough away so if they start running at you balls out yeah keep your car in park engine right yeah and then use those by nose you know I mean I'm a professional Jamie with your oven mitt t-shirt sir gotta be video of that right if someone was out of the chick-fil-a depressing fact there's a video video of almost any kind of interaction yeah it's people create interactions so that they can videotape them parents man they got to stop putting their kids on video we got to stop it's enough you say that but there's a little kid that's like six years old that reviews toys and he makes twenty million dollars millionaire twenty million dollars interpreting Disney toys just looking at toys somebody 200 bucks open up a box of you know toys I'll do it hundred beans that's it nobody wants to see you open up I'm gonna find something else they want to see little cute kids I'll dress up in a diaper what has this not gonna help oh fuck another gotta find another thing to make money another angle yeah that kid is making a lot of money gonna be the YouTube toy guy there's a lady who does it with just her hands a girl's woman what does she do with her hand she opens things up same thing beautiful hands I don't know if they're beautiful I don't throw our feet out and start using the verb is what I got to do yeah I'm gonna open children's toys of my feet is that weird no you should do it you should do it and see which one gets better views do it with you with painted toenails and doing you with kind of like neglected toenails I'm saying like little chips and your paint you know this is nothing sadder than a neglected toenail that it's also kind of hot because it's kind of chick they'll take some chances she's like bitch she doesn't even have her toenail to order she lives she'll move with you across the country she's crying

together some people just never quite get it together right yeah and then you see their toes and it's a reflection of their own downfalls they're their own worst enemy or they have a job yeah that's you're busy too busy mom with a job and a couple of kids who's got time to do nails then unless you you know you're a rich wife yourself you get doing yourself that's the nail thing is interesting because here's why because it's like a service thing that people love right and love going and getting pedicures and manicures the people that are into that shit they love it they love Duncan their feet in the thing and then they get to talk to each other but they would never want to do that yes one of those weird things it's like if you found out your mom was given strange dudes pedicures look that's our new gig you'd be like oh like well we gotta go to therapists what's going on well we'd say why do you why do you have this job do you want to clean people's feet what what about it brings you joy coz if you need money like you might as well just slice mangos on the side of the highway or something different but it's not weird that that's one where people love getting it done but to do it would be like well I get my nails done regularly I love it it's very relaxing but yeah it's that weird thing where you know saying this it's like it's one of those jobs that's worked by you know non-white people for the most part which i think is interesting don't you think that's interesting as a woman entry-level jobs for people that are first-generation immigrant that like what would happen realistically if all immigrants removed from this country everyone's nails with look like shit they got rid of all the illegals every everybody who barely speaks English out restaurants would fall no delicious food there'd be no fun music there would be some fun music I mean some but like let's be honest but there's a lot of fun most fun music if there's a lot of fun like you know wasn't their idea Latino music that's true yeah have fun let's you know that's true not many like songs and like our culture can you do one of these and it fits you know especially at like a wedding but yeah everyone will be jacked up no food no no nails do a few things I don't know if I know it sounds very familiar put it on fuck are you okay there's some you can try it too it's too expensive no no it's not we'll get this yank from YouTube oh that's right you can put any music I don't put anybody's okay I think I just somebody sent me a song of Gypsy Kings recently they've been around forever yeah they're badass Latino band and what I love is because I can't speak Spanish so when they're singing it's just beautiful yeah like whatever they're saying it just sounds great it doesn't have any like I know there's a motion I can feel the guy's emotion when he's singing but I have no idea what he's saying so I don't I don't need to hear it I just love the sound of it yeah it is very nice the language is like very melodic oh yeah like Spanish Italian feels like Latin based languages are very pretty to listen to this is oligos a musical flow yeah you ever people from Brazil speak Portuguese I mean I flick a bean to it all the time the shoes have met that should sexy did they have a way of talking these are up and down so the old dance yeah it is it a little dance and then people where I'm from like Syracuse it's like hey guys wanna go get a sandwich just don't want us to talk you don't know what it is it's actually they're trying to keep people from breeding but it's like in places that suck the most you have the shittiest accents because they're trying to make everyone disgusting yes well I guess I'm not supposed to have a baby then I'm telling you they're just trying to limit the numbers they don't want over populations in places that suck there's probably something like legitimacy know what you're saying doctor in your scientists anybody who need some advice just call us at one eight hundred good luck there's a new documentary by the guy wrote coke cocaine Cowboys did cocaine Cowboys and a bunch other documentaries Billy Korb yep Billy Corbin you got it I don't wanna choke on his lame it smarter anyway Billy has a new document called screech screwball yeah it's all about Alex Rodriguez in the steroid scandal and one of the guys in is a fake doctor who would wear stethoscope around his neck like he got his degree in Psych Genki overseas University and wasn't legal to practice medicine in the United States but who call himself a doctor and he had like the stethoscope that he'd wear in his office he'd walk around with a stethoscope around his neck like hangar eyes neck I just again he's gonna check your heart meanwhile all he's doing is prescribing steroids it was amazing that was walking around he posed as a doctor and had multiple patients I remember this is in Florida the same place I guess it afforded to you must be pretty easy course it's in Florida this name does this name say Malakai yeah that's a creepy name that's like children of the corn right that's like how do you pronounce that mind Malachi Malachi yeah that's that is ballsy do you wait a minute that's not his real name mara malachi love-robinson that sounds like a character from like some sort of porno there is dr. Malachi a lovely nasty hhp - CA MP - TV dad all those things HIV what are all those other things it is health care proxy maybe some bullshit EMP I don't know what the hell that sounds like a gas station in Kansas let's read his thing listen says is a well doctor malachi love-robinson is a well-rounded professional that treats and cares for patients using a system of practice that basis treatment on physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing the human body that doesn't even that's a run-on not a sentence doctor love-robinson utilizes physiological psychological and mechanical methods such as air water light earth phototherapy food and herb therapy psychotherapy electro therapy physiotherapy Meccano therapy naturopath Corrections and manipulation and natural methods or modalities together with natural medicines natural processed foods and herbs and nature's remedies what you just said the only thing that was true about that was manipulation well how is this guy like who who read that and went all right we're in yeah who read that was like I need to make an appointment immediately found the real doctor all these other doctors that don't use manipulation all of them now I would not go doctor huh yet offices so someone had to like rent him the spot said they believed him - not just the offices he at least had an off a office like an off you gotta think a guy who's that good of a bullshitter that pretends to be a doctor actually gets patients who's got a stethoscope got a website is it that good but it's good enough that he's got patients likes it actually worked like imagine being so crazy that you tell everybody you're a doctor you don't know shit about medical medical practices you know you read his little bio there and you get offices then you get patients you treat patience it's the same as like religion it's a similar it's a similar approach you just find people who are gonna need and who need something and they're gullible and are vulnerable and they'll follow you anywhere or religion is either that or it's a part of your culture right you're born into it absolutely it's a cultural thing for sure it's when you hear like a 45 year old dude becoming a Mormon yeah you're like what what happened what are you doing you're lost maybe just have a great group of people that are all some Mormons you say fuck it I'll join I guess that what happened you know maybe even like with Scientologists what happens to people like especially in Hollywood they just get so desensitized or like they get everything they want they're looking for more I need purpose if I was jaded I would say that they think they're gonna enhance their career you think so I used to think that because there's a lot of like there was at least a lot of people in the film industry that were Scientology right have you ever gone to a meeting no but I did go to one of those they had like conference tables a folding table set up in San Diego and they had like the the two coffee cans with the strings on them that you hold on to and you know like they ask you questions about your childhood and weird stuff and you say it into the coffee can now you hold these things it's called the neck it's come what's it called an e meter it's not I'm so loud it's called an e meter you hold on to it and it it it gives you some sort of a reading on this fucking graph that's it's totally non-scientific horseshit right but you know the guy who was really interested is the guy who was doing it must be just like some regular dude who's in the church that they make do it it's not like he wants to do it nobody want to do that I tell he was like a volunteer because you maybe maybe have a problem with your dad I am as a doctor he was selling the Scientology yeah just to see what it's like just out of curiosity just to be in there you know in that moment and see what the hype is about well there's a lot of money right you have to think that they their massive real estate holders they've earned millions of million dollars and they have tax-free exempt status because it's a religion yeah tax-exempt taxes oh it's crazy they sued and want it yeah they sued the IRS see this is the problem we're on one side of the coin like people are good manipulators on the other side people are idiotic yeah you believe in deal with half of the shit that they believe and deal with I said I think they're what they're they're a bunch of different things at once you know there's the wacky beliefs that l ron hubbard all that stuff that he created but then there's also the Klan mentality yeah absolutely it's funny that the Ku Klux Klan they kind of stole the word Klan right like the work clay you say you get self-conscious you know it's the correct word for like a tribe of people right and it's not it's not reserved for just a group of white supremacists I mean it definitely no but indicates a whole bunch of groups of people like I used to play quake competitively if you tell people how quake teams are that their clans the question what and then they're like you mean like the KKK you're like no just a group of people like quake you fucking idiot with a common mentality that's it a group of a band of people a band yeah brothers but that that happens people just take over something and then that something becomes negative from then on well then they have a platform as well you know they can then they're like social social justice warriors about it you know they're like cheering it from the rooftops and making tweets about it and how how it's a fucked up situation are they really doing that if you were to say any word people like oh my god this person said this it's racist it's like I was just saying Klan I wasn't saying anything else but it's like the Hitler mustache you just gotta wait though it's too tricky the Hitler mustache now like you can't what really you can't who wants to wear it is there is somebody wearing it were for a while that's right he did oh my god he did playing basketball that's kind of final if he was playing basketball for you he wasn't he was retired sure like a hands commercial or something I think oh yeah my goddamn Hitler you can brazen you can't even like when does it become a Charlie Chaplin it starts as a Hitler like when it gets to the outer edge of the nostrils is it a Charlie Chaplin well Charlie Chaplin had a Hitler he he might he molded it after modeled it after Hitler did he yeah it was a huge fan of Chaplin absolutely there's there's some crossover there Chaplin was a huge fan of Hitler Hitler was a fan of Chaplin right in Chaplin just kind of you know because Chaplin was a little bit of a rebel man so why did Chaplin where's mustache I think it's like a little tongue-in-cheek mustache boosted sales and let me see that photo wow that larger that is so crazy that is so crazy that is wild even he had to give it up even Michael motherfucking Jordan what is it second paragraph say Jordan camouflages the moustaches to a small extent with a corresponding soul patch under his bottom lip but the lip beard appears to be exactly that a beard trying to disguise the teutonic neighbor upstairs a great sentence that's a great Teutonic neighbor Teutonic neighbor that's really know what Teutonic means do you know what Teutonic means I've never used that word capitalized I wouldn't hit it hit it maybe like probably because it's not a real word and motherfucker thinks its own war or something like some relating to two tones denoting Germanic branch of the indo-european language family definition you're like what's weird Roenick so go back to that and go back to that statement again that's the statement that we're just reading from yeah okay Choza beers trying to disguise its Teutonic neighbor upstairs houses so maybe those people wore those stashes maybe Hitler got it from notes because it's Germanic right yeah well like who's voting in German maybe it was a Germanic mustache yeah maybe it was all a mode of the times yeah I mean maybe a bunch of people at Hitler's kind of like how there's full beards now this like as a full beard the Hitler of ours is just like a common beard think so can you imagine if somebody rolled around with a Hitler stache today that'd be really wild you can't you can't that's too much right yeah but here's what's weird I've talked about this on stage - why is it okay to dress like Genghis Khan who's dressing like Genghis Khan if you want to do it for Halloween why is it okay yeah what do you mean like it shouldn't be Oh bleep yeah being a Nazi you can't be Hitler yeah that's I mean that's just won't let you that's what's also kind of lacking creativity like you want to be a Hitler it's like dressing up like a sexy baby are we really doing this is this necessary doing that no one needs to see sexy babies no one needs to see a Hitler well slow your roll some girls should definitely dress like a sexy baby okay so girls can dress like sexy babies but I can't dress like a baby and open up packages on YouTube you could just like a baby and open up packages on YouTube no one's stopping you know like we do invisible foes cuz you just said that it would be cute and now before it wasn't when I wanted to do it I wasn't cut to this afterwards and it's just ten videos of me open up packages cereal yeah in your underwear in my underwear with my terrible terrible chipped toenails yeah it's amazing how many people have created a career just reviewing stuff on on YouTube like those tech review guys they make a shitload of money you even have to have like degrees in electronics or an engineering or anything they just have to have a love of tech like our friend well unbox therapy first of all Louis like think about how many views those videos get his videos he's one of the top ones but there's Marcus Brownlee who's also been on hearing guys on there yeah they're doing it what are people often not Duncan yeah it's weird what is it like as a viewer to watch somebody else open gifts it's like that's like the worst part of Christmas morning watching other people open gifts you're like where the hell are my people get really into it they do it do you need it's bizarre do Flossie Carter's my favorite there's a things no one else yeah she's a jack black guy who looks like a like a powerlifter yeah tattoos on his hands nice like full-out yeah right and and he uses like he and he uses technical terms mixed in with like slang and he has a cat he's got a cool little cat that's always like in the videos hanging it up and he open he's a nun boxer yeah he's a super knowledgeable guy yeah when he when he reads like when he's talking about like the different details and what cameras doing doing but he does it in a funny way right like he's very funny yeah it's like also knowledgeable so if you're a dork like mean you're into like phone technology and alien to phone technology I'm always fascinated by innovations in phone technology because it's like I'm watching someone build a bomb like standing back where they fucked are they going there it's going nuts this is ruining us now they wanna make them faster and better and more see all hands too so this is this Fossey carter shoutout to flossing as far as the feel lightweight super comfortable you can easily wear these all day and for the look this is what they're gonna look like when you wearing them neck tattoo really but some people like them some people don't these really ain't my cup of tea there's pictures of him on his Instagram he's jacked like he lifts weights he's huge what's his background I don't know that's do I look a million seven hundred and fifty three thousand four hundred and ninety five views or his top ten truly wireless earphones he's got a huge following but it's because of that because he knows what he's talking about but then on top and no one really talks about it's kind of fun to listen to his voice is interesting his voice is full powerful voice you should do a TED talk just wait fellas out there that are carving their own niche and gals reviewing things talking about things like there's so many different people doing shit like that now it's interesting I guess it makes sense because they're such a huge space for the techie nerds to indulge in that stuff and become fans of that sort of well also no one would have ever made that a television show and if it does a television show people might not have watched it yeah this one's Iran on YouTube where you can just clear at your at your leisure that's the beautiful thing about the on-demand Westec TV though what's the shortest replace whatever job but tech TV was never this in-depth they would go you know they would gloss over things they would have like a synopsis so it was still TV they still had yeah they started that commercials I guess they were they did everything like it's okay it was great I would love remote control I mean not remote control what was it called screen savers remote control was the MTV show patch then as well yeah he had like a downstairs Hitler Hitler in the basement in the basement just not in the Attic it's too close but isn't it weird though that I mean not saying that anybody wants to dress like a Nazi I don't I don't want just to say that I have to say that but that if you dressed like a murderer from the past like Genghis Khan or something like that well you actually get in trouble now for cultural appropriation you know where you wouldn't get in trouble is it the Renaissance Fair when they have like heroes and villains day comes on what you're doing there you got some squinty eyes too far right now you're taking it too far but why is it weird that a physical characteristic like eyes like small eyes is like offensive to discuss is that fascinating it is fascinating but to recreate I think is it offensive or is it people enjoy the feeling of being offended I think there's a there's a sweet spot in the middle there I would beg to differ that some of the people in society who are offended by words terms sentences aren't necessarily truly offended as much as they want to say they're offended I am a hundred percent on board with you so loser doctor Peluso sorry thank you doctor Peluso I have HPV pH i I can't I mean people get offended to get awesome they love it they offended and you know what they also love doing not doing about it but in their defense if you see like a movie where a dude is playing an Asian man mm-hmm but he's a white dude and they do some malarkey with his eyes like motherfucker what did something to a leprechaun something Irish use that special effects monarchy and change them into a Chinaman by that god damn leprechaun that fucker you could be an Englishman no one has a problem with calling someone an Englishman do you call someone a Chinaman no no whoa you're getting weird there it's just getting weird it's exhausting when people are offended and then it's like girls being offended in writing articles about guys that are doing me two moments but they're not going to the rallies they're not involved in the community they're not really like moving the needle they're just screaming is it good to go to rallies I think it's good to be also actively and physically involved in whatever movement you believe in I think just saying and posting it on Twitter is a facade but it's good for likes you can get a lot of likes boom I mean I guess there's some eyeballs on it you're you're creating a conversation but I don't know I just believe in like living walking the talk a little bit more what the fuck were we just talking about the games cars Oh Chinese actors that get fucked out of roles by white people they don't do that anymore but they used to yeah one of the big ones was Charlie Chan Charlie Chan was like a famous detective show remember that show was it but was it casted as a white man it was a white dude playing a Chinese detective that was like super wise detective that's busted but he looks like you know like a white guy who eats good like macaque more like a commish no like that's that's what they're my holy hell yeah that was Charlie Chan I'm offended yeah you should be he looks more like he looks like a shitty magician he looks like Chewie from The Comedy Store you don't you guys don't remember Chewie that is offensive the same thing happened with let me see that picture look at that that shit is ridiculous I can't happening there he's he looks like he runs a casino in upstate New York you ever hear him talk can we play someone I need to hear it from Charlie Chan it was very offensive oh my god donk donk Charlie I'm shook right now what's that Jamie what do you think he wouldn't what year do you think this was 1945 it says he doesn't say 50s Scarlett Johansson had that whole issue remember she was cast in that movie an Asian role yeah look at his face he doesn't even look remotely they taped his eyes for sure they did some weirdness but not much because he looks like every housewife and Bev Hills - facial hair the pulled back face like take off 10 years but back then you know this guy could get away with that you know what's-his-face lady in a saran wrap she's a ghost or some shit dude what's happening to her that is bizarre me know if they had saran wrap put your food inside of it what is that shit she's wearing like a glass veil is this Shia LeBouf Shia LeBouf they're time travelers this is I mean isn't it great to live in this time where our movies are so much better but we're gonna laugh in the future looking back at how stupid things are today you just can't see it coming nobody thought to look at that guy that's a cool chair what is that dude so another Chinese guy that dude this is not really a Chinese guy I think he's got that's some terrible face makeup I think added to them I think that looks like a like Joey Diaz on acid look at that with a head wrap that's family tape it does look like tape a regal tape yeah acid really angry ruling a kingdom after a couple divorces yeah he's like an 80 year old tape yeah that's amazing well that's what they used to do but look look up John Wayne as Genghis Khan that's even dumber even man didn't even change anything included the weight talked he talked like John Wayne we're gonna fuck up these Russians he talked literally like John Wayne but he was dressed like a Ferb fucking hat on so dumb oh my god you ever see it yes yeah how when they made that movie where they're like this is it this is it yeah they didn't know everything sucked I'm everything did kind of suck there's only a few like gone with the wind like whoa what did they do their movies Citizen Kane whoa like wow this one doesn't suck yeah yes god I mean the likeness is a little amazing to wait yeah you imagined look at that beard like a fucking sheriff and some wide west Wild West Town - Genghis Khan Hollywood was so whitewashed it really really was well they knew back then if they did a John Wayne movie they would sell a million tickets you know it's that's really what the but the thing is I mean an aspect of that is still going on go on you know and I sort of I don't know if you feel the same way I get it to a certain point like when you go out my comedy clubs and there's like a YouTube influencer booked on a weekend you're just like a fuck but then you're like well I kind of get it from a business standpoint if they're fill-in the rooms I did a gig in in Arizona once and they had a daytime gig booked from a YouTube influencer they packed this place out at 11:00 a.m. with like 12 year old kids as fans was his name Bert Kreischer yes it was it was a Bert Kreischer day show he did his whole shirt off it was a crop top he wore a halter birth does those day shows he'll do radio and then I'll do a show it like noon for people that don't have jobs yeah it's like work call in sick to work or something does he call it something like that yeah call in sick to work day yeah so funny that ladies he's looking slim yeah that is slim for Berk that's only like 19 months pregnant yeah that's a protrusion in his heart eight year old in the belly year-old inside of him that's to take his shirt he takes his shirt off in the oh our now every time yeah I used to take his shirt off only in the main rooms like now now he decided no more of that does it come off on every show we set right what's on stage it takes his shirt off when did he decide when that happens I wonder like me a moment just right that's how you do it pre pre mic rapper grabs a mic well his body is a source of pride he enjoys what the fruits of his labor yeah and his appetite for indulgence I don't know if it's a body as much as it is a building it's a body people know what's his body they know he's the party animal and they go all right fuck yeah he's fun it is a lot of fun it's a particle that was written about that like we're talking about I was reading this guy was like talking about how hilarious it was it's a party it definitely is absurd II he is an animal and sometimes you know I mean there's the opposite where people are just kind of quiet on stage laugh just by taking off my shirt I think I'd go for it why not start off with it but now the problem is I think Burt owns it which is weird you know Mike he's like you think he should have some like a little bit of a feeling about it no like he owns it like if I just wanted to go up and take your shirt off people go what do you copy it he's the only comic Dee robing every time but there's some weird ones like that Bobby Bobby Lee takes his pants off I mean I've seen that that weenie weenie a few times winking at me from the green rooms of the comics you should probably not tell people that stop doing it people probably get mad now get mad I throw things out yeah you can't no you can't not do it they're like take off the shirt do the jump on him on stage tackle yeah yeah but I mean there's there's a couple dudes who go clothed clovis you got their pants and their shirts but we're that that's Bert's thing yeah it is weird you're right though if anybody else were to do it they would know that that was a Burt situation there's another one like that that we were just talking about the other night at the comic store like how crazy does that someone like took over like a thing yeah a stand-up comedian I think I wanna know what it is well there's like a cup there's a comic in New York or just snaps like a snap every time it you know what fraser-smith I love watching fraser-smith when he's like come on people these are jokes and he like it's like it's like a timekeeper I like that right yes in rhythm yeah it keeps you in rhythm it's it's musical up there sometimes if it's going but it goes well it's weird how people can become like a thing like this is the guy who talks about food I know I was thinking about that like how what what what comes first in that scenario doesn't naturally evolve or does it happen once and then the person builds around it because it's a crutch hmm there's there's a fine line between the art and the marketing exactly yeah and in who you know do your thing like it's a short life why not find that little niche that works for you and fucking make that money and have fun and bring some joy to people who gives a fuck I have a problem with people who talk shit about people going after what they're doing and finding a little trick to it who cares you get angry if they get tricked yeah that's true that's true fucking tricky can't believe this shit I'm not I remember there was this lady who reviewed video games she was like talking about video games and they found a video of her from years earlier saying the Chesnee and play video games they're like I don't even play video games yeah the reason is like evidence I was like this is this is this is during that whole gamergate thing like this is evidence that the world has gone mad people are arguing over whether or not someone is a real video game player you're not even a real player you fake play people have too much time on their hands man too much time and they get stock in that they get stuck in that like webby universe well not just that like yeah people change like I wasn't playing video games just three months ago now Jamie and Jeff and I were playing them every fucking day we play this quick game Oh Jamie fucked me up yesterday you beat his ass meet me in the hospital it doesn't feel good yeah we have fun we have fun we talk a lot of shit just gonna say you probably talked a lot of shit you lost no did you cry I did fuck me up on this one map that I was very angry at this map keep falling off when the environment cuz when you do go out you do suicide but it's not that common that other one it's just like every time I think you in if you're jumping and you don't look behind you you like fuck ah ah you watch yourself fall ya explode when you hit the rock how many times you fall some some of the range of 30 not joking you really are no and here's me falling fuck dammit fuck fuck this map shut this map son of a bitch fuck what the fuck and then Jeff's getting good to come problem Jeff fucked me up history too I think it's good to have like I wish I was good at video games I'm not I'm not bad what do you wish why would you want that skill because I think it's good like the hand-eye coordination and just like I don't know being able relax a game fuckin Chinook it wouldn't be them drone pilots in Vegas I do so what do you think about UFOs 100% real hundreds don't really ever see one um I did actually see one really I did in New York City this was years ago I was walking downtown nice to bartend at this place called Puffy's tavern and in Tribeca walking downtown beautiful sunny day and as I'm crossing the street I'm just looking at everybody I'm looking up like what are these people can I look up and there's this like I don't know like a weird oval chrome thing in the sky pretty far up but you could see what it was and I was I remember talking they dude I'm like what is that and he was videotaping it's like I don't know we've all been standing here it hasn't really moved it just was kind of suspended in the air not a lot of sound at all and I had to get to work I'm like all right well I gotta go make cowboy cocksuckers for investment bankers so let me know what happens and I went to the bar and it was on the news at the bar and it was just this weird it looked like like that bullet that little bullet vibrator thing or like a little suppository in the sky it was like a like a like a balloon yeah like almost like a balloon but a little bit more elongated very quiet it was bizarre a blimp nah not like it sat upright it was almost like an this was oval shape so did cam yes soda-can exactly in the sky right but all right side up yep it was bizarre but that was like the only real time I was like what is that huh I've never remember being a little kid thinking that I might have saw something but I'm gonna just convince myself to sales board and also as your memory recalls you recreate but what do you remember I don't remember anything really what I was gonna say is I've watched this bob lazar in area 51 documentary oh boy holy shit it's really interesting it's a lot more interesting than I thought I always like to like dismiss a lot of the UFO stuff because the most likes is non science is so silly but my friend Dave Foley who I treasure and I value his opinion very highly he told me that he started getting obsessed with UFOs he said thanks to you I'm obsessed with UFOs thanks to me I don't even obsessions I'm sure no but he and I when we used to work together on Newsradio I was deep in my obsession with UFOs I was convinced what kicked it off just tearing people's stories if you only had one experience as a kid I don't even think I really did have an experience I think I probably saw a jet fly overhead no I think that might be useful but talk to myself it'd be weird that you had an obsession not based off of your own experiences that's bizarre yeah I've always been super super obsessed with space yeah I think I had a really good teacher in seventh grade science and I remember he said if you really want to make your brain hurt just look up and and try to imagine something that has no end has no end just you can't you want to hurt your head just look up at the sky and understand there's no end to this it doesn't make any sense I was making stuff because everything else in life in existence has a finality to every single thing yeah we think but this guy when he planted that shit in my head I remember thinking wow I never even thought of that before like I just looked at the stars until be like oh there's the stars they look cool oh there's the moon kid you know the perspective of like the vastness yeah but when I was 13 this guy said that 13 maybe 14 no 12 yes 12 somewhere in that range 7th or 8th grade you're just starting out right yeah I remember him saying that to me and then being obsessed with space after that obsessed like one thing that a teacher said and I was immediately like what like that was one of the first cool things ever heard at school you know one cool well he was a cool teacher he was a Vietnam vet there was a couple of these guys that were Vietnam vets that were super scary they were scary it's good to have a teacher like that though so many like that whole thing like our education system really fails a student sometimes I have teachers who invoke curiosity out of children who actually care and have a you know interesting curriculum that they bring to the table I only had a couple teachers like that that I can really remember but yeah I think three the three teachers that I really remember like wow that lady was so nice out of your entire schooling yeah yeah the same I had a really cool miss a lot when was my first grade teacher and she'd have us lineup outside of her door and she always had a pop collar she always smelled good show he's at a pop collar and when you'd walk in her classroom if you had a collar she'd pop it Larry just brought this like right like it just we felt like we were our own little clan in there like the missile uh twin clan that's what it was like when did you know that you wanted to be a comedian early early on like eight years old I was young yeah I was entertaining my sister no shut but I didn't know that I could make a career out of it cuz where I grew up there wasn't those like outlets there you know we didn't have like theater or any sort of cultural exposure that I could you know adhere to and just like okay cool I'm gonna be no gay people thank you know gay people they were hiding because they didn't want to be murdered how old you when you first were on stage 19 oh yeah I was 19 years old I thought you had to wait until 21 I didn't realize afterwards that you can get into a bar as a performer I'll make sure you don't drink yeah there was this cool place called the cantab lounge which is a I mean your Boston right now you know you know about all about it Cambridge area had this bar called the can tap lounge and downstairs there was this little performance space called the third rail and I stood do improv for like six months and then one of the dudes is like you should try stand-up you might you might like it and this one Cambridge oh yeah that's where I started stand-up and this was on I see I was 19 I'm 36 now what you're doing them I can't do that math you would you're the scientist I'm the doctor I don't have time to do math I have to write too busy with my calculations about the size of your stethoscope I can't do the math - I was nineteen nineteen I don't know what year it was 20 2000 2000 I was amazed twenty-two years ago holy for 23 years ago what 80 years ago fuck you were bad at math just like me well it was whatever this may be doubting just making know what so you're 36 now yeah stand up when you're 19 almost 20 years ago almost when you yeah yeah yeah and my dad was there actually I've on tape you have it on tape I do the first time I ever don't and I watch it I did it fucked me up for months oh my god dude fucked me up for mine why did I think I could do this and like it was just everything you could imagine it was it was it was all the things things it was just all the little clumsy clumsy and fast and not rooted in like a negative about my life it just was sort of a reflection of what I saw essentially you go up there and you imitate something until you have your own voice for the most part yeah for sure but I have it on tape and I'll never forget you know we even videotaped afterwards my dad came out from Syracuse to watch it my dad said he's since passed in October but he came out he was there for my first stand-up show and he's like babe you're gonna be fine dude my dad's not in the industry he doesn't know shit this dude was like you know he's sold real estate and bartend like he wasn't like in the entertainment industry but he's like babe you're gonna be fine you're great because you got high energy he was like you're gonna be fine cuz you're up there and you got high energy that's in the people like like okay dad so I just kind of always thought about that like aspect of it like just my my physicality and not feeling embarrassed by it you know what did you ever say to your dad hey what about Stephen right yeah you know he definitely he liked comedians like that one of my dad's favorite comics was Stanhope he loves Stanhope I'll never forget I did a show with Stanhope and Syracuse actually and my dad was sitting next to me while we're watching Stanhope and he leaned over he was like man the mind on this guy it's like one of the brightest brightest people I've ever heard in my life dad get out more well he's using a grave now he's only getting out was a ghost he's probably a drunk ghost at some girl's house right now cuz he can't find mine Stanhope is getting ready to film another special yeah very excited to watch yeah it's gonna be great Santa was he's he's like the I don't ways like the equalizer when it comes to what's going on in society it just has a way of being like boom this is what's going on with gun control and with people being offended by terminology and words here's why it's ridiculous yeah he's good like that well he works you know he's a guy that he and he works on his own schedule he decides when to write when to perform when the tour when to do and he was always like I might fucking retire and then right back at it a special coming out next year yeah he's always he's always working he is always working he has his own gloves oh yeah yeah he's amazing I love watching him glad he's out there cuz he's just like he's basically an older version of the guy he was like 20 plus years ago it's not Leigh it's not changed at all other than like become more wacky yeah was fuckin goofy suits anybody that's fuckin suits every time I see but here's the thing like that's one of the things like he owns the snow she's just gonna say yeah we can wear the suit if you wear a goofy suit like a really shitty suit like stanhope tea peach colored suit with ruffles he wears like loafers like an old man from Caddyshack - yeah he looks like he used to sell cars 20 years ago and kept the outfit yeah and I loved it Frasier Smith's long-lost cousin he looks like a ghost Toledo its cousin from Toledo sells cars he looks like a ghost from the Titanic he rents out clowns yeah shoes shoes but you're right that's his that's his thing yeah that's his look no one can hear suits and he's been rocking this look for quite a while now like he used to dress like a normal person well semi I mean there was a there was always a level of eccentric yeah I could replace his entire wardrobe for $40 yeah I mean you could get that jacket for $2 it's amazing that it finds him all that seemed to be tailored he's a fraud he takes these good thing he takes these shitty fabrics to like a real high-end tailor and he has them like slim fitted me get them for tens he finds them he definitely get some nice tailored look at shirts a bum jacket that's sure it's not bummed though it's all nice and clean it's nice and clean but I'm saying it looks like a bum that struck it rich real quick like he got money fast and didn't know what to do so we just bought the same suits but cleaner now if a bomb struck it rich they'd be wearing like the finest things I saw on the windows of those department stores and they were on the outside in a garbage bag to Prada yeah yeah once you got on your feet and cleaned up and stuff days to get used to the fact that you're rich now I don't know if I'd be able to I obviously I don't have a knack for fashion I'm in like a gangster hillbilly overall outfit but works I don't know if I'd be able to like just know what to wear after being homeless for so long first you got to kick the heroin and the piss-stained shirt yeah you got to kick all that you got to clean your body up you got a hundred million dollars in the bank now Claude what I'm saying there's a little bit of a process yeah you know you're not going from like shit staying shorts to Gucci pants well most people don't even make it you know like when when people win money in the lottery they almost always spend it all or go crazy it's like I don't think people get adjusted to that idea that all of a sudden boom so he just drops off a giant chunk of change like if you got inheritance money from grandpa yeah he's yeah million dollars like you're gonna burn through that chest most people I don't even think it's reserved for homeless people I mean like rappers athletes comedians yeah it's it's like that's what goes back to our education system we're not taught financial responsibility in a high school we should be listen it doesn't matter if you teach comedians financial responsibility most of us are not going to follow coal civ I wanted to just at least have something save for the future because I knew that about myself that I did not know enough so I started to save some and do a little bit of googling for every Kevin Hart who has like real knowledge about finances there's like four dudes like me like a custom gym in 16 cars on the way how many time for thinking but do you like that like what you know as a woman you know our indulgences are like you know going to the spa or maybe shopping like what's your thing like on a day off what do you do that brings you joy that is it is a commercial legal material a material thing obviously you like your cars John the cars but I enjoy I'm a big fan of engineering like I'm a mile of mechanical things like like I think my favorite car have this car that doesn't have any power steering doesn't have air-conditioning and it's got an air-cooled engine it's one of my favorite cars what is it which the 1993 Porsche RS it's a really light car not really even that fast it's not fast like a modern car it's definitely not fast compared to my Tesla Tesla is the craziest fucking car I've ever driven by far every other car seems stupid what might seem dumb it's the Model S yeah Wow fucking preposterous how fast that car is in just a technology on it and does it also have auto oh yeah all the drives does everything how does that work like if you're driving down the highway if you set up Auto does it legitimately go to your destination you have to hit this little thing to switch lanes to see that you want to switch lanes but it'll switch lanes for you it will drive with the speed of traffic so it'll slow down when traffic slows down speed up and traffic speeds up it turns it makes perfect turns Wow it's crazy so could you just be cuz you're so now and let it go you really shouldn't but you probably could Wow you hold your hand on the steering wheel like you're supposed to have light pressure on the steering wheel apparently some crazy fucks have that's what it looks like on the screen wow they just updated it like last week yeah to recognize stoplights that is so I mean the future is now that is so wild bananas but someone told me I don't know if it's true and it's irresponsible for me to even say it but I'm gonna say it do it this is your podcast you're gonna go crazy someone said that you can bypass the touch sensors on the steering wheel that knows if you're holding on the steering wheel with the tennis ball these shove a tennis ball in there and if you do that you can just go to sleep and the fuck well you know what modern Darwinism will take care of the rest people to die either but people do dumb things all the time but there's a difference between those kind of cars and the cars that I really like I like these mechanical cars they feel you feel the gears like see this guy's got a tennis ball oh he's got an orange oh shit in there he's got a little citrus these citrus works for driving as well as getting rid of back Syria yeah he debunked Tesla's auto pied orange hack oh he debunked it Oh Stu see if it worked or not I see it seems like it's working it does look like it's working so but you're it makes you hold on to it like every now and then it doesn't make you hold on to it all the time as it sure ducking failed it actually does work that way I mean how is going on in your life that you can't I enjoy driving I enjoy the mechanism of it I enjoy where my mind goes I like blasted my music I may or may not hit a joint may or may not allegedly probably not but you know I enjoy driving well I do too but I think if there was a button that you press let's say you drive and the car just drives all the fucking time most the time when you're in traffic you just don't want to deal that's true especially in LA if I'm going to the airport I get up in the morning I just hit that ball yeah I hit that let's go bitch press that button no I barely pay attention tap that shit all the way to the airport yeah see that's there's certain situations where it would be useful definitely but when you're driving like say if you're driving in a canyon and you know like you're up these hills and and driving around these like beautiful scene scenic places you want to be driving like a little sports car with a manual transmission yeah you wanna feel it in the wheel and hug in the corners like a military person feel like he he can add that to the Tesla No why not don't feel the gears you won't feel the grinding you won't feel the shifting of the only the gear yourself doesn't have any gears like there's so many oral experiences you'd have to be lying to me about first of all here's one the revving of the engine like when you get up to redline when you're shifting gears like there's a sound that I especially like a really well engineered German car has when they hit those high revs yeah it's a just a it's a symphony of coordinated mechanics it's all quiet and you're shifting and youth really hit the fucking you blip on the downshift like on the downshift you do what's called heel towing well you got one foot on the brake and you go like this come on so that as you're going from third to second you give it a little extra juice so that your engine rpm catches up with where the gears gonna be when you get into second gear is gonna Rev higher so yeah and you're all dis like a coordinated effort all these things are happening it's not just like sitting there like with an orange on your steering right now and around it's something else going on I just came in my pants from that whole description of made farts out but here's the thing it doesn't matter if you make this sound I want to feel the shift no Jamie you're pushing your foot into the clutch you're putting the thing in the ear it's a mechanical action you can't fake that no you can't find that even Elan I bet you Lankan face he's not going to if he did it would be less good than what he has what he's got is better than any other car it's a basic level of driving it's not you know you're not interactive with shifting and everything which is probably the fun of having a car where you can actually drive it manually well there's things first of all with his car they don't have any gears it's just one gear it doesn't shift it doesn't change yeah it doesn't hit a redline and then you have to move to third gear right or it does it itself it just has one gear and then on top of that it has this giant navigation screen I mean it's huge fucking thing you've ever seen in your life it's like 14 inches tall right and then on top of that it's got like all these safety features it's looking at things and warning you about this and shows you or all the cars are around you as you're driving I was like having my mom in the front seat sounds like just to get something over there something here watch out for that Huns like all right shut up what if your mom was psychic and - just sending it to your brain that's like telling it right it shows it doesn't like say everything but doesn't it have like a fart machine in there I read that there's like a fart machine in the in the Tesla's well you should read more what it was a whoopee cushion it's a fart sound that it can make if you want it to right so when people say fart machine dude a fart machine would make actual farts well it makes a fart noise though right yes right so I mean essentially it's a fart machine just not like a well sound effect mechanics do a machine there's no machine but there's like the yes that's great that's enough for me kinds of farts what yeah yeah you can have like wet farts Oh short little tiny farts hookworm farts what do you think a hookworm fart fart smell like like rotten fish ok car guess some dead worms inside your body but like like a river soaked carcass have you ever seen an animal I know you have a lot of dogs you ever seen an animal shit out worms no and I I definitely don't want to but now the image is just vivid in my mind I have many times like how many times are we talking oh like worms coming out of their butt like you look in there but you see like a little worms yeah you never seen that had so many dogs in my life that's what does that mean that they're like not normal dogs that I haven't had them crap out worms well they probably didn't get dewormed you know they didn't get their pet rescue dogs yeah for you know the deworming stuff takes place and when I was a kid our dog had it and I remember watching like little worms come out of her but I was like raising little white worms wigging out uh but what in the fuck is this nature's weird man there's something even on everything yeah oh yeah there's an organism feeding on an organ is all this is just organisms feeding on each other yeah one big fuck fest with organisms or more leech fest yeah it is a leech fast yeah these things I think they fuck do you think those parasitic worms fuck no they just probably separately they damages you know they just divide themselves there's no sex happening there like it speaking of fuck did you see that Python that they found in the middle of the Everglades it was 17 feet long oh my I was like so I agree with it I saw this there's one things I said I was talking about exotic pets I googled that they get to 30 feet long I can't even understand that that is ridiculous this one I went down a hole I did I saw that Python hole the rectal records 17 foot long Python carrying 73 eggs captured in Flora's Everglades another reason we should just get rid of Florida snap it off and push it into the ocean there's too much craziness happening there that fucking snake now here's the thing that freaked me out I found out those snakes get twice that length ah so this has only been going on apparently for like the last 15 or so years they apparently didn't have a real population of pythons in the Everglades 15 years ago did somebody's pet get loose that thing at 73 eggs no no they didn't get loose some asshole just released his snake someone just chucked it out the window and then it fucks up the balance of the ecosystem they escaped from a breeding facility destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 well that makes sense a hundred percent how horror movie starts great horror movie somebody write that script tens of thousands of Burmese pythons are estimated and now be living in the area and that's just now they've completely wiped out all the raccoons all the skunk's all the rabbits no matter how yeah they're eating alligators now nice those things eat alligators at the video to see forget it dude maybe shamefully there's a photograph of one that died because the alligator chewed its way out of its body nature is so but there's some beauty in that ruthlessness just just that like undying desire for survival that exists in creatures like that that can't there's no empathy there's no sympathy they're just gonna eat their way out of you to survive yeah there's something cool about as long as it's not your five-year-old kid that gets no absolutely absolutely that's a goddamn nightmare do this show this but this is just for you guys she's just one doing this is meeting one I think this is an anaconda and a caiman says Python eats alligator alive I mean it's the whole thing alive oh is that a Python for sure oh yeah it seems like it is it seems like this that's actually a video of me eating a grilled cheese and chewy look at how it is sped up but look how it gets all the way down to the fucking tail that is amazing I wonder if snakes have taste buds or if it's just for pure hunger to just stop and think about what we're looking at here this fucking snake just ate a whole alligator there goes a tail oh it's body it's just my god look at that Danny he's gotta go away and chill because they're vulnerable when they eat that he's gonna go and just hide in a hide under a canopy well that's why there's not just aches everywhere on earth well now there are in Florida yeah but I mean they're not everywhere because if they they really could just eat and then go out and eat again like real quick like how a lion could write it would be they would eat all the ecosystem would be destroyed eat about anything where the alligator chewed its way out look at all so kind of badass of that alligator it looks like the tail popped out yeah maybe the tail you know cuz those tails are very strong and they're so thick it's like an armor go to that website that's wild Jesus that is really wild but that's just shows you how hungry these fucking things are they've eaten everything that's out there but also their masters their their ability to capture something and then kill it that's that vicious you brought an alligator like those are kind of hard to sneak up on and capture and hold on to I don't think they are I think you don't think so no I think that's one of the reasons why it could get it so quick I think they just lay around most of the time I think alligators don't tweak because they don't have any natural enemies until the pythons came along because they're so badass yeah I don't think they're equipped for this yeah they're probably not equipped for your pie right where they're just there the snake found a vulnerability in the system he was like I'm gonna snack on alligators wonder how long it takes a snake with a nasty gut juices to break down alligator hide three three three days three to four days that's my guess I'm gonna say at least a week to break down all that maybe even longer yeah it's got to have some gnarly like acids in its stomach to break that down yeah some shit like from the movie alien yes like battery acid huh it just burns right through it why aren't we like using snake acid to break down rust on cars and stuff we should be looking into that yeah I would clean up everything I would set up everything an animated recreation of the Python alligator battle suggest that the Python might have survived its massive meal but that a second Gator came to the rescue and bit off the snake's head Oh was that the alligators bitch being like no the force of the tussle the new theory says is what caused the Python last whoa so our alligator came and fucked him I call me eight alligator homie came in rescued they have any homies really no assholes I think they're assholes with tiny little brains and they just chew things and suck them down they just fuck reptilian style did you ever see that video of the crocodiles and they go to feed them and it was on my Instagram Jamie that one with the crocodile well this person goes to throw some chicken out for the crocodiles and the crocodiles snap up the chicken and one crocodile reaches over to the guy next to him and bites his leg Oh bites the crocodiles leg and his roll oh god snaps it off and tranqs it down swallows it and the other alligator the other crocodile rather doesn't even budge oh he just got his arm bit off he's like what happened oh my fuck this is when you realize what these things are they don't give a fuck there's it's so crazy to watch their dinosaurs doesn't even freak out that it's arm got bitten off and swallowed by his name well I will say if I'm eating a really delicious sandwich and someone bites me imma be like I'm just gonna finish the sandwich I have to be honest how hungry are you if you're very hungry well he's not even finishing he's lying there and the other out or the other crocodile bites his leg and then rips it off watch this shit just watch it boom now watch they run in see this one's snacking up and look grabs it and I'll watch Gator roll death snaps it off and I watch Chuck sit down cool but look at him he doesn't even do anything what the fuck bro he just lost his leg and he's like what the fuck bro I mean those are not regenerative right yes they are they are can he grow another paw whoa yeah they grow other paws all the time that's yeah that is so wild well I once like some Gator DNA in my face I bet yeah that's really good for just like keeping your shit fresh or you look like scales you want that they'll be kind of cool forever scales I'd be a superhero I could probably capitalize on it but what you look like right just no scales to your face to them right now I'm not gonna wear any Rouge I got scales I'm gonna go out some girl had to be the first girl you get a face tattoo you could be the first girl you get scales probably some probably a really long time ago someone's got a face tattoo well most tribal yeah most likely try definitely a tribal maybe like one of those polyandrous tribes what is this Jamie so it looks like a snake with alligator inside of it yeah oh it does take three days for it to break down scientists doctors coming into your lane better watch out I'm a doctor and a scientist know all about acid I know about acids because I'm Italian I've got agita that's the Cillian science yeah he's got the fucking odd Kenny you know meet the bottles they give me the odd you know huh you know what's crazy about the Everglades is if this is how it is now imagine what its gonna be like 20 years from now these things just keep reading yeah it's gonna take it's gonna take a few generations for that to balance back out they need to put some wolves in that area and get it all back to where it should be well they have crocodiles in there No - there's been confirmed sightings of Nile crocodiles not American crocodiles Nile crocodiles for the same reason that's wild where the alligators are yeah that's fucked yeah it's fucked because those are the ones that eat zebras and shit yeah they're getting everything they're gonna be eating that watch hide your kids hide your wife yeah they don't definitely I mean he this is I'm sayin he found a lane and me he capitalized it off of that little moment he did for a little bit yeah for a hot minute and now we know who he is by just saying a phrase yeah I met him you did yeah I met him at one of the UFC's oh that's wild how was he a gentleman er very nice guy who's super confused about his life sure fuck is going on here why am I here everybody knows me like he went from being just a regular guy talking about break-ins yeah he was on the news interview - dude on the news he was so funny that he became like a viral star and then next thing you know like Dana White flew him out to the UFC Mountain backstage like what is this life Wow how about that like cash me outside girl she is a rapper she's got like 20 million followers on Instagram dude she's rapping she's got a giant billboard on sunset you know buildings where they have the whole thing body B body but bad baby bad Bobby bad bitch Yvonne sadaebu but you know when I sometimes when I work out I put female rapper station on spider and she pops up look at look at his hair now living your truth hold on a second formerly gay yep antoine dodson announces his baby boy's birth after expressing his desire to get married was a confusing headline but live it do it a formerly gay well you know he looks great there you should be open to change people who should be do you think that someone can be gay and then that it could switch over absolutely and they stop being gay and they start being attracted to women well absolutely why not we're on a dot suspended and nothing that's expanding hmm why not why not why is that so stunning to think right like what is that possible because I think what you just said people exist some people exist in these comfortable bubbles and they have the routines and they fear change because of the exhaustion because of what it takes and then when they hear somebody else live in a life that's outside of their little bubble regimen they freaked out because maybe it reflects their own inability to change themselves or their fear of changing so I think a lot of that where people like you know look at someone like Antoine Dodson who's in a wig and wears glip glops are like what's that first of all you don't know that's a way that's hurtful same hair as Beyonce it's real I think the same thing when I wake up is real too by the way that's a real woman okay receipt on saying respect yeah better watch out those hips will snap you can you can turn on people that way yes by bringing something up that they didn't even say yep and then saying don't ever fucking say anything about her right well I didn't I'll send your own defensive be careful people like that I know what you're gonna say next you're gonna say yes that's mental illness you're gonna say that Donald Trump is a strong leader you're like wait a minute you're gonna say that we need border security I know what the fuck doing racist have a conversation here I mean we need some border security don't what god damn it that wormhole with crazies did you ever see what the border looks like in Canada the middle of the forest I would imagine sooner like maple syrup fountains no that's paved it's like not paved it's um it's like trimmed all the trees are trimmed and this is little concise wide there's like a path that's a hundred yards wide that it was like the border between us like say if this table was like barren right it's forests on this side the forest on that side that's what the path is like the entire length of the connection between the United States and Canada that's true that's trippy also did you just call me barren no I didn't I said it's barren I was like true probably that's wild have you seen it in person no no no I just found out about like two weeks ago that's really cool crocodiles apparently can't regrow their limbs oh that's a bummer are you sure I just looked at other amphibians can but crocodiles and alligators can't I guess they're not I can live without a limb or two it says but they can't regrow bummer hmm you would think they would cuz you would think like genetically similar like salamanders on a couple websites I mean I'm not I'm not the scientist here well we know you aren't because he's sitting right here I'm not a scientist either there of something that sounds good you're a doctor of theirs that just looks like a power line yeah no doubt looks like cocaine it's like a big line yes no there's no touching zone zone right there that's my that's all my zones there's that crazy that's the border between the years fall by the way if you go up there and that is God's country that is spectacular I would love to blaze a blunt and walk that whole fucking thing it'll freak you out do you ever go hiking deep in where you got no cell phone reception and you get to I like where it's that deciduous but like an you know like a Judas it'd you a second big but I am somewhat well-read I'm a fucking doctor I forgot you were a doctor I'm a doctor I'd like to be a doctor of something what do I feel you're a doctor of I feel you're a doctor of comedy for sure I don't have it though there's no no I know there's no mastery we you and I have talked about this before and you know I said something like I don't know you were like how's comedy I'm like I'm just trying to figure it out you're like none of us ever will I'm not saying that like you're the end of it but I think I was watching you onstage at The Comedy Store and Hinchcliffe was next to me and you know you're doing your set killing and having a great show and this woman he yells out in the middle of a joke and you just kept fucking going you were so disciplined you didn't miss a beat you didn't acknowledge her you didn't give her any sort of energy or attention you just were so like in your joke and I looked at Tony and he was like I know everybody else would have went to her of eight you know totally just like abandon their joke and messed up the flow but you just in that day I was like damn I need to I need to stick to my jokes more than like indulging people who are yelling at me from the sometimes you have to indulge and sometimes they are also gonna ruin it for the people around them that's the number one thing to like oh people go yeah you just can't fuckin hang like people have said that like Chris D'Elia they were this lady called him what did she say she goes you're a planner not a comedian a real comedian can deal with someone yelling something out okay it's totally shut the fuck up and get out of there and they kicked her out and that was your thing that you're a planner but you know that I'll text Chris D'Elia know where you have fucking planner bro you're such a planner comedians are the most unorganized people ever if anything they're the worst planner sometimes you have to address them sometimes yeah the real problem is that they're they're fucking it up for the people around them they think they're just there interacting with you but they'd not take into consideration the fact that even if you don't like what someone saying let them say it because there's 300 other fucking people in the room and you you don't get to this side you're not the program director right you don't get to decide what you like or don't like and just because you're in front of that person you yell something out if the whole audience is sitting there watching the performance and the guy's working his way through some material or the woman by the way sorry let them fucking finish their shit man do you find you have which gender yells out more or is it equal oh it's equal it's just dumb equal men to women's yeah almost women really yeah I'd say for me it's been like 95% women I think I'd probably say maybe there's a little bit of an event a little bit of a number difference in favor of men doing it obviously you probably have a more male-dominated audience than I would yeah but guys bring their girlfriends the girlfriends like fuck him always listening to him he's a fucking idiot do you really believe what is saying enough people just listen you can get confused and think you know what the fuck you're talking about that's what he is just cuz a lot of people are listening to him doesn't mean he noted the fuck he's talking about and he worship I'm like oh my god do you love him are you in a bromance you should be embarrassed of your side I don't give a fuck what Joe Rogan yes that man bringing that up god he's even Rio s disgusting he's very angry oh he looks like a man Abe you also the appeal is that you look like a Manny well I get it gals I don't want to listen to fucking Taylor Swift songs either out a few songs that are not bad you've got daughters in your house I know you danced in Swift I probably have if I've been hammered the thing is it's like it's not my thing it's not like what I would listen to all the time yeah that's not my go to you know and yeah people have different go twos doesn't make it right or wrong but if you get dragged into someone else's go - you got to grin and bear it anybody ever take you to a musical Jesus fuckin it's it's it's a thing I went to music I went to like three musicals one of them I only went to cuz Stamos was in it do - do he's tell everybody jessiemae might have a bit of a stalker stalker I am not stalking he's a very nice man he reached out to me when my father passed he was very nice to me she's very very nice well but all joking aside you do have about a hundred photoshop's of you with John Stamos I'm sorry Caitlin huge joke my fans make you know they superimpose me I find a photo of his honey and I'm like there's one horse he posted a picture of him on bed like from like the full house era I was like somebody put me on the back eight lanai always apologized to his wife and child I mean for the most part but it's a long-running joke that you've been doing for years now you kidding me like I loved him as a kid and I told this story before but I have a I had a poster of him above my bed as a kid that I literally kissed so much I wore a hole in his mouth Rudo Rogan did you ate through the paper were you looking at doing all the things yeah all of the things yeah but I went to a musical he was in bye-bye birdie very delightful very talented man and then I went to a couple others but they are I fell asleep and the other ones the ruthless thereit's and the intermission kills me it's like why don't we just get it done let's just go straight through yeah I think I would like to see the Book of Mormon that's like oh yeah you know that's that's a that's the exception I saw that it's awesome yeah those guys are geniuses it's it's just really well read to a really well-written rather it's really funny there's a really good story they did their homework but I saw cats once when I was on a date I was appalled 819 fuck that fuck yes in general who I guess they're scary in real life why you want to go see them sing and they're standing up right that's a nightmare you're a dog person not a cat person I I would like a hairless cat like a sphinx I think they're cool this shit in a box in your house perfect Senor I'm gonna change my toilet to be Roman fuck yeah I'm gonna shit a bucket yeah they shit in a box but that's a great things gross sometimes my dog's crap on the carpet if they're you know irritable but cats are weird man cats I don't have you can trust a cat you trust some cats you have a couple cats don't you you've got a fucking zoo I'm so jealous I want to come over and just pet everything in your house cool my dogs died recently I'm sorry with him last I guess it was probably almost a year now it was Marshall said uh he didn't understand what was going on he looks like he's just pure joy and happy he is all the time he's the happiest Artemis he's so he brings me joy I just started following one history he's so happy follow your dog on Instagram he's my buddy he's it's so weird well you can see you guys have a straight bond he's so affectionate do you run him off leash in the morning when you go oh yeah yeah no tickets you know he's been um he's got tick medication that he's taken but we have caught him with a couple of ticks home without all that luxurious hair those ticks are probably like he's drunk yeah he he loves it though he's never seen anything in his pure joy as that dog is like running through the canyons ah he just loves that he's so happy how do you keep him so clean I mean I know you got that like Joe Rogan experience money but he is luxurious called water well I mean quality I just have water and I've seen these mangled beasts they really don't and they wonder why they lash out yeah Marshalls not like if for cats when you die cats will start eating your face in like 16 hours dogs wait about a week that long yeah The pieman wait that long dogs we read them yeah they love you a little bit more they won't eat you right away I don't even know if Marshall would eat you I think you'd wait I wouldn't even know what you were probably wouldn't understand it he would just keep throwing balls at you just rolling him over to you you just wine my he woke me up yesterday was a fucking really annoying whining you decides to get up like I got home from the comedy store I'd like to and then I watched some goofy I've been on this UFO documentary watching UFO documentaries yeah I told you as David I'd say I started talking about it yeah we were talking about that what were you did you have something specific that you would saw recently a documentary one of them is area area 51 Bob Lazar and Aliev area 51 in flying saucers it's uh some documentary on this guy who claimed that he worked on these alien ships in area 51 in the 1980s gels as times gone on more the things that he said have proven to actually be true like what including an element that he talked about element 115 I think it was called like a organism from outer space no no an element like a man created element you know what this carbon right yeah well there's an element that they created that he talked about way before it was ever publicized and he talked about this thing and then it turned out to be true he talked about these there's these hand monitors that you would put your hand on this thing and these line these metal lines would detect the distances in the bones of your fingers the exact distances and every one is different it's like a signature thing yeah and that they could find out if it was you or not you it was trying to go through so the way they would scan people that bio scan would literally measure the bones and their fingers and people said that was horseshit why about this in the 1980s people said it was horseshit but then later on turned out no they did have that in Los Alamos they did have that in in area 51 and that this technology was very very advanced very not just very advanced but very not it was not well known at all like very few people did this guy who was creative this documentary was very difficult for them to get photos of this hand scanner but this hand scanner did exist and existed exactly as this guy described it in the 80s I mean that's super progressive for that time there's also a panel that did approve his top-secret clearance to get to this place they know that he actually worked there there's people that worked in the same Los Alamos lab with him they tried to say he never worked there but his names on the manifest it's very strange it's like they've tried to erase parts of this guy's past because he he filmed a bunch of their crafts as they were flying around like he knew what days this is the thing that thing right there you put your hand on that and it actually measures the distance of the size and length of your bone that looks like something that's inside of an escape room in LA I went into this documentary skeptical I was shit yeah but I am I'm so done with all those things but listen to this guy talk for a while after a while I was like what if he's telling the truth like what if he is actually telling the truth because if he's actually telling the truth there is some part of the government that had access at least in the 1980s to alien technology probably is some truth to that crazier things have happened and also like just your mentality of believing him it's probably the same thing that made dr. Malachi Lovejoy Robinson the third become successful con artist yeah I mean either this dude there's validity of what he's saying in this documentary which I can't wait to watch or he's just really great at painting a picture some people are so good at convincing you that's true of truths true there's you know people with like borderline personality disorder and every sort of spectrum in between there they become really good manipulators that is true however usually they do that in more than one Avenue absolutely this guy's not doing that yeah documentary then that also hasn't varied a story like it mean he might have like changed the way says things in terms of like the words he chooses but the actual story is exactly the same as he was telling a long time ago this is a self produced documentary is there a production company no production it's like okay there's probably some validity to this but this guy's been around for a long time I remember reading about him and watching videos about him you know 20 years ago I mean don't you think you're somebody who you said you know and I know it's about you you you love space you're you're obsessed with that the idea of what we are in the solar system and beyond like how impossible is it to think that there could be a creature that could breach our atmosphere with some advanced technology and be able to just sort of chill you know scoot around scoot scoot smug oops check us out and fucking peace out back up to wherever they're I think that's how they do it yeah yeah they just kind of cruise around you know they're looking at us well he had an interesting analogy he said if you brought a an atomic engine to these people that live in the Victorian era and said hey this is uh this is a nuclear power plant like here here check this out they would fuck with it they'd wind up getting sick from radiation they'd wind up dying no one would understand what it was or how it worked they would never figure it out right he goes why would we assume that this is only from that one time with this one device why would we assume that there'd be some other technology that maybe will create someday in the future I'm paraphrasing him very poorly it's okay or someone else scientists from another planet would create that we wouldn't understand at all and he said that's what we were dealing with when we're trying to back engineer the propulsion systems that these things use they use some gravity based propulsion system and it was something that would manipulate gravity in front of it's very look I don't I'm too stupid to know the science of it I don't know if he's tell like if you were scientists you're supposed to know these nuts yeah I have to get my Joseph Rogan degree so I can call him you should I just want to get an honorary one like Cosby had why this it's gone now he doesn't have it anymore take back those he can't keep that actually I think he wrote an essay and that's how they gave him his doctorate I've got more than one doctor yeah sure he did and he didn't it didn't deserve them but I think I mean there's gotta be stuff out there a hundred percent a hundred percent but I like to say there's not it's like a stop you think no no I don't think it is but it is entirely possible um I use that phrase too often and it's entirely possible you got to get a man all of those were the most advanced ability because something has to be the most advanced absolutely and something has to be the least we could also be on that part of the spectrum or maybe we're the last to evolve it's a hundred percent 100 percent possible and if there's if there's an infinite number of life forms out there like if there's an infinite number of planets and there's an infinite number of earth-like planets that could you know have beings like us on it who's to say that we're not the most advanced maybe they're all like people from the 1820s yeah shit they're still doing you know I'll think the chisels stone and chisels but I'm talking like old old shit they don't even have pens and papers yet like the orangutan out fishing with a spear exactly there's just a bunch of advanced orangutangs that are like you know putting hieroglyphics and caves it's possible it is very possible totally possible but cuz we're just we're just basing it off of our own experience and perception of what we have been exposed to no idea you know the other really interesting scenario is that there are time travelers oh really that's exciting what they are is some being from the far distant future that understands that they could come back and observe us and see like where things went wrong where things went right but do so in a way that's as minimally intrusive as possible and occasionally interfere that's things that gives me chills that freaks me out once you start fucking with time in our perception of it and how it exists in like being able to hop along that spectrum moment it freaks me the fuck out there's this movie I saw called a ghost story and it's not a horror movie it's kind of about to Patrick Swayze it's a Casey Affleck in Runa Mara I think Rooney Rooney Mara ghost I miss Patrick Swayze so much you miss him I miss him he's one of those actors I love if you could bring Patrick Swayze back and and take away your full house boy how dare you what's his name again Joseph Nathanael Rogan I don't know I mean that's a tough call I mean Swayze gave us he gave us dirty dancing he gave us looking for that beauty what a beautiful man he could move those hips that was when he was a surfer remember that was brave yeah he was the rebel surfer dude do you remember the video on Saturday Night Live of him and Chris Farley doing the Chippendales audition iconic that's iconic comedy that is like such a great crossroads between beauty when Chris Farley Chris Farley put it all out on the table during this sketch it is so funny I miss I really do miss Patrick Swayze said I crazy that he was so fit but yeah he smokes cigarettes you did it did he really yeah probably of cancer he probably smoked cigarettes to stay fit some people get stuck in that you know they are afraid of letting it go because they think it helps with their physique in maintaining the look Oh models do that stayin skinny yeah cuz you know it's a it's an upper yea crease is your heart rate and all that and whatnot it also kills your appetite I think totally kills your taste buds you can't taste anything everything is destroying us maybe you should smoke that's the only way you should look ass is by smoking cigarettes they don't taste and getting those brain cyst like you have to you have to choose god this is brutal dude you're making me lose stamos and get a hookworm I'm just saying Stamos for Swayze Stamos all day bro reasons for life sorry sways ste on the other side will be and I will be messaging you later stop for a moment really reconsider what you're saying think about the great films it's ways you provide us with all of mankind's entertainment falls in my shoulders Road House I know and like also you know house I know I feel mad house when you look at this IMDB poster for Roadhouse prints you're either going through ten seasons of full house or Road house I mean okay indulgently and selfishly it's Stamos but on an overall spectrum it's Swayze all to mankind for mankind yeah I will I'm sorry Caitlin I'm gonna have to go with sways sways all day that's what we said we're gonna start doing Jamie is doing like fight companions for like terrible movies was Stamos we should get barbecued and plays showgirls that just have a 25th anniversary you have to people don't even know it's a cult classic it's an amazingly bad movie it's it's so epically bad it's kind of like what how I felt when I watched the dirt recently it ended this girl's career it did it basically no not at all didn't it no did she take off after that she stayed she stayed pretty plateau but she was that she was on her way to being a gigantic superstar she's the star of this movie she's super hot she's half naked I think she took this movie I'm speculating but I thought she took this movie because because it was gonna be the next thing and ended up being such a such a brutal failure that maybe I don't know it's so good it's so bad it's good it's crazy and it's got green actors in the Toula Kyle MacLachlan that God's a great actor a bad actress gina gershon is amazing she was in bye-bye birdie with Stamos on on Broadway she was amazing what's the cast you scroll back all the way up to the top it is a great kiss all not just images I mean her body amazing in this obviously yeah it's kind of like remembered to me more when she did that stripper movie as well she was gonna say GI Jane she was amazing in GI Jane but didn't do me more do a stripper move apart gij elizabeth berkley my favorite part in GI james when she says suck my dick that's I need to put that on a t-shirt no just she said suck my dick in novi yeah she was like on her way to being a Navy SEAL uh-huh that's great you know GI Jane's going through yeah I remember those like dude Demi Moore's body and striptease was all the things she was so banging in that movie she's just beautiful amber I just remove II burned in your head it's just one of those movies that I remember she was like jacked in that movie mm-hm and in dancing very awkwardly the very awkward stripper dance that happened with that outfit looks like she belongs on a wedding place like something on a television show it's a night show looks like Telemundo what do you think she's doing these days some people get super super famous with her everywhere and then they go I'm done I think she's just chillin you think so I hope so hope she's just chillin and just kind of you know what was she gonna do another movie maybe maybe it's absolutely she maybe she should do I show you an indie I don't know because it would tap into a different era we haven't seen give me where she's good where she's taking a break you know we got a couple projects on the table I don't know I don't know what she's gonna do I don't know either oh cool I didn't expect you to like defend yourself that way no one's pressuring jessiemae whose is marijuana you're still high oh I've been high for four days who's your celebrity crush I don't have one you don't know I'm good you don't look good like a Fanta you know like a fantasy Channel maybe Madonna from the 80s Wow she was young bold choice pointy bra but also you know that she was never gonna get hooked on you take off yeah you'd be like oh yeah I knew she wouldn't like me would like me good long that's that's a real strategy that men some men employ like this one's not gonna last it's great that's that's an honest answer yeah it really is yeah that's the that's the allure of the positive independent women a powerful positive independent woman is like she's not gonna need me yeah needy at all she's like yeah well see ya there she is yeah from the that's all real - oh yeah that's from her closet for sure she's in like dudes briefs and some like doilies on her legs and apparently she like thought fuck oh yeah she like to smash hit warn baby Sean Penn bad boy you see this movie that these this is the three identicals these are the twins that that documentary is about you haven't seen the identical strangers no I heard it I almost brought it up the other day cuz you guys started talking about something I forget which podcast it was that this movie sort of bleeds into not spoiler alert because movies like genetic testing type shit yeah back in the day like the moat in the 50s right they were doing it like in the 50s and 60s in an in like an orphanage yeah I need to find some time to watch that yeah just when you think like a revelation happens and you're like what the fuck and then another one happens you like this has got to stop and then you're just like holy hell and then it's just a thing where if somebody wants to get something done sometimes they take really drastic measures it's selfish and it's terrible and it breaks all ethical you know rules but I don't know it they're do they do it well we're spoiling out for a while do it as an experiment on these guys on purpose yes a psychologist wanted to find out stuff finish yeah running an orphanage and in in withholding information from the families justify to find out how it would work out what they were doing was nature versus nurture they were they were seeing what affects it hasn't a child based on how its raised by also by the socioeconomic status of the family about the neighborhood it's in about the type of unit the love all of those factors in what results it has on the individual right why don't you say Jamie that's kind of in the data they have a bunch of data apparently somewhere and it never came out it's missing it's gone the files disappeared years of them basically ruining the lives of children in the effects of that is just dissipated into thin air it's such a it's such a heartbreaking story but it's also very interesting and then I'm saying like how would you ever not that that needs to happen but there is a question I mean you're find out unless someone did something right you just guess I mean we could look at like all the things that are happening in society especially with like mass shooters and people who commit these random acts of violence and go back to their upbringing in their rearing I'm pretty sure I would take a gander and I guess that they probably weren't raised with the most amount of love there's certain things that you don't really know how it's gonna work out yeah until you experiment yeah and that's when I was saying like it's a little brutal but right well people are scared of that kind of thing because that's where Hitler came from yeah that kind of thinking I mean you hear about some of the experiments they did on people oh man that was just scary this doctor supposedly I think came in with the Operation Paperclip oh no was that deep into oh my god that's all right it's pretty fucked up it's it's it's you know an operation do you know what Operation Paperclip was wasn't that something like a Hitler thing back in the day with babies no no no Nazi scientists that were taken from World War two so the United States took Nazi site including Wernher von Braun who's the head of NASA right a bunch of other scientists in all these Nazis that were working for Germany making rockets and involved in like high-level science and they brought them over to America and sort of whitewash the whole thing they called it operation paperclip holy Wernher von Braun when he was at the head of NASA he was a fuckin legitimate Nazi like the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if he was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity I feel like there's still you know there's still a retooling of people in there that sort of they've chased those guys down to the far ends of the earth dude that storage room those are very powerful positions to be and to have that sort of mentality driving it that's scary as fuck for sure you know what's really crazy is Argentina Argentina and South America a lot of Nazis went to Argentina and South America they fled Germany and Tim Kennedy who's a good friend of mine who's a former UFC fighters soldier he was on a show called finding Hitler where there was there was been speculation over the years because so many Nazis landed in South America that Hitler had escaped and lived out his life in in you know protected by these other Nazis in these south american towns there's towns in south america look at that dude there's towns in South America where they all they do is speak German they they have Oktoberfest they have photographs on their walls of their grandfather and SS garb that is very very scary oh dude it's crazy it's very scary he blew me away when I when I when he was telling me about this and he's a no-nonsense guy so when he's explaining he's like you got to understand you're coming into these towns everyone is German oh my god they all look like Germans they all talk German they all have German like houses and German like like German style stuff in their house that's bizarre I mean that had to be what happened I don't know no it's maybe not what happened to Hitler right you're pretty sure the Hitler died but I'm sure they relocated and that's definitely what happened yeah see if you can find that yeah Jamiel fine this is just a South America look it looks like a German town it does look like a German town it's crazy there's a whole village these fucking people I mean and there's not just one there's many many of these little little pockets that looks like an Oktoberfest bar that's really bizarre I mean that one looks a little Japanese that well there's videos though it's crazy they're drinking out of Stein's and like the whole deal that's really wild dude it's crazy well obviously we couldn't get them all I mean they had a flea somewhere yeah and they're gonna set up shop make it there you know make it their homogenous they saw the shit was about to hit the fan said listen I know place we can get some cool margaritas we can catch some fucking waves that's a wild I never knew that oh it's yeah I didn't know it either it's crazy that it was really crazy man I think there's too much to know there is too much to know but it's one of the great things about the stuff you talk about on this is you got so Jessica plethora of information you see most of its useless most of its you know if it's useless wasting wasting time do anything with it dude taking CBD with THC oh that's great she delivers it got a bit of a problem what's the matter I've been high every day for the last six days same I popped these little tablets in the morning it's CBD and THC it's not a lot of Splenda one and yeah it's one to one perfect it's amazing yeah that's you know that they work with each other and they help the TC helps deliver the CBD and vice versa you feel great yeah you feel balanced you feel like energized clay it clear I don't know about you I feel clear no no problem in terms of like feeling foggy or fatigued no it's just the right amount but I fucked up and took one an hour before I went to bed last night I went to bed at a sensible time I knew I was gonna do a podcast with Jesse may as well I want to be awake and fresh so that's fine but I went to bed and I taken one like an hour so before I was in bed I woke up two o'clock in the morning bang ready to go great train full of ideas did you write some stuff down I wrote that's cool I have I keep my laptop right now by the bed I started doing that too I just need it near in the bathroom next to the bed yeah I literally if usually everyone's else asleep I grab the laptop and I just go into the other room and I just start writing but I keep it in the bag I put it right by my bed so if I idea in my head twice I've written bits that came out to be like real legitimate bits because an idea came to me while I was lying there and I said I gotta just try this yeah I just run in the other room and I start writing and then boom it becomes a bit twice over the last year like legitimate bits have come out of just a random thought that it was popping through my mind while laying in bed now were you were you on the marihuana's both times yes I mean there's something to it definitely when you when you have it a moment to escape it's our brains like an onion dated with information all the time just daydreaming being bored that's where the creativity for me is the most active like getting a good nap or even just in a dream you think of something like in the shower driving those are my ideas I've had this similar situation where I'm like oh this might be a good joke that's my argument for ignoring phones too that you allow yourself to get bored and when you allow yourself to get bored then that's when these creative ideas will come like if you're in your car like that's the other thing about that little car that I was telling you yeah it doesn't have a radio oh that's great yeah no radio so you have to daydream yeah you not just date your it's like this you're tuned into the thing as you're doing a brand yeah and you think about stuff like I used to come up with some of my best bits when I first started doing comedy when I was delivering newspapers I would deliver newspapers in the morning and out of my car chuck them out the window how old were you 21 Wow and when I was doing that I would come up with some of my best bits when I wasn't listening to the radio I was just driving around and then I have an idea what why is it that we what the fuck is this yeah just be thinking to myself almost like those hours became productive they are yeah it's it's daydreaming is probably one of the most important things you can do for your brain especially for creative people and people in general you know I think when you're doing something that requires you to do something mechanically like driving even just washing your body paper route anything that you sort of have to do this like regular machine thing your brain sort of just can roam in the woods and just pick off little ideas off the trees and you know you're able to sort of give your brain a break yeah your brain doesn't always need to be stimulated externally fuck now so that that's probably one of the
