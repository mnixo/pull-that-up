all right here we go boom there we go so uh first of all welcome thank you thanks for doing this appreciate it thanks for having me you are fucking documenting me that that might have been one of the craziest documentaries I've ever seen in my life the 75 people haven't seen it dude what a fucking crazy life you lived Jesus Christ I'm lucky to be alive you're embarrassed I'm embarrassed because you know I'm looking at people that's supposed to respect law enforcement and and it's almost you know almost glorifying some of the crazy shit we did I don't think it's glorifying I hope not no it's definitely not I don't think it is it's I think it's an honest portrayal of people going off the rails because they didn't have they mean that you had the ability to do so you know I mean that's what it was about to rewrite I mean it's just untamed and yeah the ability to get away with things that you could no one else could well I think we're seeing today with law enforcement with all the stuff that's going on with all these kids getting shot and all these you know all this these videos that get taped of police abuse we're seeing that for the longest time this stuff just wasn't filmed that there was a lot going on we've all witnessed I'm sure you more than anybody but we've all witnessed some cops that were out of control and I think that's just what happens when people of power and you just kind of they get a little crazy they you know when you don't have anybody check in that power and then on top of it in your situation there was cocaine and there was crime and there was all sorts of craziness I mean I learned about your documentary from Nick DiPaolo he was on my buddy Ari Shaffir show and he was raving about this documentary and it wasn't even out yet it was you preorder it on iTunes right I fucking hate that when you wanna watch that I think people calling me like in the middle of the night where is this documentary I can't get it I'm like let me call the people at all three media and you know like they don't give a fuck you know they just they're just like I was sleeping right now we're in California time I said okay oh they're not awake yet whatever it's just there was luminous what did Nick see like a pre-screening or something like that did he see it in the movies I think I hate to say this on the air I think he pirated it as he couldn't get it right and I was like kicking the ground saying you know who's promoting this goddamn thing you know it's about my life and people asking me a lot of questions about it and I'm like why don't you see the documentary but after like a week of trying to get it then they they throw their hands in the air and they're like we can't get it so I a lot of frustration over the way it was distributed but I wasn't involved in it so I worked in that pot I white-knuckled my way through that whole thing I'm gonna tell you you and your audience how I mean I'm a I'm not like I love adrenaline shit but I really can't sit through most things and when the movie was premiered the first time I was seen ever by myself as well I sat by the door thinking that one I'm gonna be bored or two I'm not like the content in the movie and just leave the theater and and my family and some friends were there you know not everybody but you know select people showed and I sat by the door and like in a minute and a half I just turned around the seat and didn't fucking move and that's hard for me to do I mean you'll see throughout this practice conversation yeah I'm all over the map but haven't you always been all over the map um you know I think it's the Brooklyn the expressiveness with the body you know we speak more with our body than our mouth for some reason I don't maybe what tongue Donnie language English language but just the way we be a cop you always watch your back you know so there's a lot of you know I don't know how to explain it's just that's the way we speak now this it's a very well done movie but excellent the subject matter itself the actual story itself the facts involved in the story are fucking completely insane I mean you you guys you were involved in so much craziness it was out of control but here you are you're out on the street you're doing podcasts you know you're doing press for the movie yeah you know it's gotta feel here for you to have gone through that it's different lives you know in the way I see it you know a young young boy young man police officer convict inmate parolee and now I'm somebody else it's just weird how you don't think you chameleon you just change with with the environment and that's how you adapt and overcome anything is you have to learn how to live within the environment you're in and it seems like that's that doesn't seem the same first of all you know let's be real I was 23 24 years old when most of these incidents took place and then they carried on the more detailed the criminality took place later on as I got closer to my thirty years number but you talk I'm 54 today so my perspective on everything I did and my perspective on the world today is way different than it was back then you know yeah whenever I try to watch a documentary about people doing crazy shit I always imagine myself like what would I do if I was in that situation like how how would I have reacted if I was a young man you know it's it's sad you know what's sad about that is it's people giving the opportunity to do wrong and they can get away with it you have to ask yourself this question if I could take that two hundred thousand large right now doesn't you know plane out question and never have any negative consequences happen to me now I'm not saying because you broke the moral code of policing and all that shit I'm just saying just be a normal human being woke up fine 200 large no one's gonna miss it it's not yours and you're never gonna have any bad karma or anything happen to you would you take it it's a good question and you don't know it right there and no one no one even no one even knows except for one person that it's theirs and it depends on where you are in life you got kids you got a mortgage you have rent to pay your car's broken down you got no gas money if you're a 55 year old man and you have a happy family and you have a good career make a phone call and probably do something nice and you get on the news and right look at this Michael Dowd what a gentle giveaway two hundred thousand dollars she found in her bag well I didn't know what to do it in and I'm good my life is good you know - and your on blow and also it's interesting because you're constantly around people that are making insane amounts of money and they're doing it by breaking the law yeah let's let's let's focus a little bit here this is the 1980s mmm crack epidemic East New York right so no action I do is justified ok right I did wrong I paid the fucking price I hope you know some people want me for life some people want me dead but you know what fuck you - alright I'm here I'm out I did my time right I served it straight up I walked the track by myself for 12 fucking years kiss my ass good-bye okay so now I am here to talk about the stories that made the story the 75 what it is I didn't bring this upon myself I mean the actions and all that yes but somebody approached me from Hollywood want to do a documentary about this mission full of my own commission I thought it's a piece of shit deal do a story about the boys from the 75 and I think you'll have a good movie so what was the original thing they wanted to come to you about well I was the main focus which is a thread throughout the documentary is that there was this mission hearings called the Malin Commission which if people know history they can go back to the Knapp Commission when Persico in person surface or persico's the guy that did time with so Serpico was a cop who got shot in the face in the movie Serpico and in fact he actually commented on this documentary to tell a Russell the director I got a it's 2:00 in the morning just you guys out he don't know fucking time it's in the morning my mic text message goes off cuz it's 10:30 at night 11 o'clock at night right him I just got a phone call from Serpico saying it's the best movie he's ever seen in his fucking life Wow you know and I'm like fuck because I really don't like certain code to be honest with you cuz he said some nasty things about me one until he was a rat so but you know he says well Mike he's Americana he's history you know and so I gotta give him his props I said fine but I really don't want to hear he liked my movie really but you know certain people you keep at a distance and he's one of them that I would choose to shake his hand and say you're good Serpico he he ratted out other corrupt cops is that what it was yeah he did the right thing what's that movie accurate that al pacino movie I can't look yeah what is the word it's the word that it was accurate the word is that the shooting was not quite the way they said and in the movie itself but he turned in his countenance you know they will he they wanted him to take the money and he wouldn't take the money and you know he was intransigent about it and you know someone shot him a face now I've been in the building a half a dozen times and I know precinct they actually shot another movie what's interesting is your partner when you were your partner in this film turned you in but he was involved in a lot of it with you and he never wanted up doing any time yeah I mean this story can go in many different directions yeah yeah Kenny was let's consider a good cop you know he was data for the money what was his last name you know Kenny you know he was there for the money he would make collars he'd lock of everybody's husband up like you would have a fight with your wife in the ghetto and this was like daily the only thing you know and he would go there and lock you up and take you out that was his gig yes he did that for years because that was his overtime money and I told him I don't really like to do those things and we got together and we had a like a special team that was a special domestic violence ironically ironically so so he would arrest these guys and how would he make money doing that well you'd overtime every arrest would land you at least eight sometimes 16 hours of all the time depend upon what time you made the arrest oh so he'd be able to make the arrest and go to sleep for fucking twelve hours and and make six seven hours on someone's misfortune and and and if you know they may be legitimately arrested and not saying they weren't so how would he make money off of going to sleep I understand that so when you're awaiting to book a prisoner's late potential inmate you you have to wait hours now so I'm gonna sleep on newspaper racks boxes in the hallway central booking you know central booking was like a mass unit really so so you arrest a guy and then you go take a nap somewhere that's how it was Wow yeah so you would get paid to lock somebody up so that's why the city was against arresting drug dealers okay this whole thing turns into a whole conundrum here yeah like that word anyway um the crack epidemic caused the city to go broke in many ways because you'd have police officers arresting people for minor drug offenses that were you know it was crime you know I'm supposed to arrest people for crime so what happened was of course so much to process and arrest that they would sort of discourage you and by that I mean they wouldn't say don't do that didn't ever in policy but you would find yourself on a foot-post somewhere like I would get the post down in Vandalia by the weeds well it was drag racing there at night and that was it you know and so I would get like biologies from standing in the weeds if I made arrests for drugs and really yeah so that's how they would discourage you from making arrests and just to save money so what a bureaucracies exist for you know profit and loss you know but that's it they don't exist for the people we were supposed to serve the people you know then you become part of a system that's not there for them there for themselves so were you there before the crack epidemic and I was just before the crack epidemic started in fact we didn't know what it was we used to to us people just because we could drug calls you know someone what the fuck is this roaming it out we know what it was Wow and then one day one of my partners brought it home and he came back with like 500 hours and said that's what that shit was last night what is he goes it's cocaine throwing us out Wow and that was 84 5/5 yeah I remember hearing about it because I was in high school at the time and people started talking about crack like you had hear it in the news crack epidemic and then there's violence and crime epic yo you heard about it because Len Bias that's right yeah yeah yeah he was the basketball player that was drafted by the Celtics mhm and he never played a day because he after he got drafted and they gave him this big signing contract and everything he went out and party some crack had a bad heart on top of it and killed himself yes so Ted Kennedy put these laws in place which would have two urban kids in federal prison for fuckin life sentences which now while bomb is rightfully in many cases rightfully undoing and you know that's a big political issue that we yes it is well it was it was the only things I agree with him on is that Ted Kennedy yeah no Obama Obama right yeah well that's a big one the war on drugs is one of them it's not it is ridiculous they should just get rid of all drug laws and let people go to rehabs yes there'd be no money in it I agree I mean simple yeah exactly well I mean they've known that since the organized crime epidemic of the the Prohibition right yeah that's was a shit that's what empowered organized crime the ability to make shit tons of money that's what's going on down in Mexico right now they're making money off the fact that drugs are illegal in America when this is all going down for people on the outside like me you know I had heard about it but I didn't know how much of it was real you know you hear things about the news and the news being you know they turn people into criminals it really fucking good guys most of us were good guys from hard worker families cops firemen you know blue-collar people you know sanitation workers bus drivers plumbers electricians and became a cop you thought you were still in the same genre of a blue-collar and you know you you were the ones that the beast was a quote recruit equated to Beirut it was like go on a fucking Beirut and you know and and supervisors were just happy that you were there and like and that we can all go home today so you know so you took a 10 20 grand no one really gave a fuck the problem was when people stop complaining and make noise then it brings attention so when when you're there before this has happening but how much different was the environment that you were policing before crack and after crack it was noticeable it was like a fucking tornado came in and ripped the fucking community right apart now don't get me wrong it was you know urban ghetto that survived the 60s and the turmoil and all that stuff and you had your your racial breakdowns within communities but IIIi got there and I'm gonna say eighty-three don't my fuckin I'm old now so I got there in 83 84 so was there about a year and a half and it was getting crazy cuz coke was expensive coke was fifty fifty thousand a key so it was tough for the inner-city community to have it but it was around and then when it dropped down to like fifteen twenty thousand fourteen thousand a kilo because a crack and the volume that I guess whoever was bringing in you know there's many theories on who was helping bringing it in back then it just everybody can now get it and everybody now experienced the you know the studio 54 high and not a kid in in an inner-city was experiencing for five seconds yeah bang goodbye oh I loved it now they're looking for the next hit and it was just such as radical it was blood on the streets everywhere it was fuckin ridiculous Wow now when you got a day every day every day you just saw gunshot stand I've stabbings and shootings every day Wow it was exciting yeah I'm sure I'm fucking great well that seems like part of it to me like when I was watching this I was like jeez it seems like in a way you're kind of having some fun fuckin 3-day swings the cops hate me but they sort of respect me in a way because they understand not respecting what I did right my honesty I hope that's when they take from this cuz so you got a lot of cop fans and shit like that and I respect you and the martial artists guys you know most of of really good guys but they get it it's the ones who get what I'm talking about that will appreciate this conversation you and I haven't well I think you for your cop in Orange County in your police officer in Irvine you're dealing with the little bullshit here and there you've got kind of know there's a big fuckin difference between that and East New York in the 1980s during the yeah I hope and you gotta know what's the difference between I mean it seems like it wasn't just you it seems like your entire precinct was kind of full of shenanigans well let's put it like this and this is to take nothing away from the at that time let's let's say 90% were legit guys going to work their lunch pail and going home and living waiting for the next paycheck I mean I used to forget my paychecks because I was making so much money that's the truth got me in trouble but I started this whole investigation on me because he forgot you can you pull up your Corvette yeah yeah I was the lieutenant spot I pulled it and that sort of pissed him off you know sometimes you wanna make a point like fuck you he's trying to take my girlfriend away fuck you talking in your spot you're not getting her or the spot so it's just it seemed like it was a lot of fun like there was this one one case where you guys are talking about we kept circle in the block I'm gonna cheat with me because six hundred stories here right and I'm working for a guy named Rob see right now him and I start to collaborate on we're gonna do maybe the book again you know we gotta put please do well this is process you know how first you know you've been probably through this yourself personally like we got some people in but I'm talking with we're dealing with Sony a little bit we're trying to get this thing right I think Rob SIA who's an ex new york city cop who's done a couple bestsellers he might be the right one to put the whole thing together with me I can speak he can write he knows the color in the middle right now were a writer and could make it happen especially since he was a cop it was a cop and and he's got some credibility he does the Gotham comedy show in Manhattan I don't know they run they run some live shows sometimes live from Gotham so he's involved in that so he's got some credibility he does it as a comma because he no I he's just using the productions Oh caught of it stuff like that plays a writer and he wrote two bestsellers so well I think we're gonna have him talk with what's-his-name less sure was less sure from the the unless your list yeah oh okay so about doing a month or something about the seven five movie so he owns the rights right we're just trying to make it work right now you know so a lot of discussion going on on making it come together properly so Sony owns the rights to do a dramatic recreation creation up to seven five yeah Wow okay yeah I think because imagine this is no way they're gonna chain that they tell you a funny story so okay I'm on patrol in Brooklyn and I'm working with I can't remember it could have been Kenny I don't fucking know I don't care cuz I'm just telling from my perspective and down the block comes this guy chicky chicky Xin the movie yeah yeah he's pissed and he's in the back of his trunk of his car is is the trunk is wide open in the back is got to choke a poker machine in the back of his car right the patrol car mm-hmm it's a Joker poker machine gambling gambling machine yeah you put money in and don't pay out but they do pay out if you know the right people behind the counter there and yeah so it's it's a gambling device that you can get away with gambling or not you know we hand out candy instead to hand out money depending upon who the paper so it back in the 80s that was a game so we're driving down the block and and here comes a sergeant he's driving this way I'm driving this way I helped him load the machine into the into the back of the patrol Kafka's it's heavy it's about a thousand pounds this machine so he load this into the back of his patrol car then up pulls the sergeant you know Hans has no idea what's going on it's like what's going on oh this guy pissed Meucci shot saying this guy pissed me off food you know the guy behind the counter you know he made me pay for some meanwhile Eagle Joker poker machines in his store so chicky says um that's it these machines he goes yeah the owner of the page in the store he goes yeah that's my machine okay Tex machine blows you in the back of his car you can take him home and empty them out cuz it's four thousand dollars in quarters in the machine right so look I made him buy a soda for Tower now he's gonna take all the quarters out of machine so here comes the sergeant so I'm driving by he's on probation see that cops go on probation and they passed then they move state patrolman steady a sergeant gives from patrolman two to sergeant and then he's on probationary period so here comes a sword and on probation he's just for five year veteran cop with a joke of poker machines back of trunk of his car and he goes what's going on he says oh I'm sorry and I'm not let them do this illegal gambling shit is everywhere every fucking store has one right so it's just 600 stores this exists six thousand machines in the precinct but this one's gotta go yeah who says I'm taken because why what a guy pissed me off he was rude he's disrespectful and this is illegal it's a crime and we got guys getting shot murdered stabbed selling crack on every corner he's taking this guy Joker poker machine so that's how insignificant these things normally are so the sergeant's like chickie disrespected you and you may be pissed off but you got to put it back please it's like I don't need any problems so PS we go okay so I had no problem bring it back so chicky turns around looks at me he goes alright Sarge we're putting it back we drove back to the store so I did left went right from his right from the stop from the storage Shakey's apartment like you said you wanted two apartments before he had an apartment welcome to precincts we went to the apartment drop the Joker poker machine over his apartment I mean these are things we would know you know because just because you could just because he could push you could what seems like it was just there was a lot of excitement like doing all that like driving around the block store was my favorite because you were driving around the block for like an hour and a half yeah well cuz chicky could didn't get there in time he didn't have a car chicky had left a job because of all the investigation right you got that from the documentary yeah so I needed someone Kenny wasn't available so I don't know if I was working with him yet you know he'll say he probably was anyway so he chicky had his car in the shop being repaired so I'm like you gotta be fuckin kidding me I need someone now with a car and a badge that's all I need so I didn't want to lose sight of the house in case for people who haven't seen the documentary what was going on what what house there was a burglary call at the house so we've responded his patrol plane and we checked out the place and inside it was two young girls who were sitting there on the floor in this home you know with the door knob broke them off and they said that they were given permission by the owner of the home to spend the afternoon or day here in her home and well where I had asked her well where did where did the owner happen to be since you know you broke the doorknob to get in oh she's in prison right now I said oh and for what and she goes well I think for drugs I said okay thank you so I turn left hard and there's a box of fucking shoes piles of box of shoes mm-hmm if anyone knows anything about the drug business they spend a lot of money on their personal shoes because what else you gonna spend money on you know right you can't build a new house in the ghetto yeah just wasting your money but you could have a lot of shoes so I see all these boxes of shoes nice high heels pumps and all this stuff so I said okay there's a girl in here spend a lot of money on shoes and the furniture looked pretty good for the location so I open the closet and has a fucking duffel bag filled with cash I pick up actually that's really not exactly what happened some anti-crime guy went in there picked up the big he looks at me I look at him what are you gonna do voucher this come on we spend all day savanah my leave it there it looks at me it looks at me he puts it down I put my hand in the biggest load stuff in the money in my pockets but I had no room boomers we're in summer clothes I didn't have I went to uniform on with the jacket we can stuff everything's so anyway I said this is not gonna work as too much money yeah you can't you can't run out of a building with a big filled with money and have the cops see you because they're gonna say where'd the bear go right so my enemy was the cops at this point so you know I found a way to circle the house for an hour and a half and every possible direction you could and it and then chicky finally pulls up with another guy that was retired from the job they walked in with their Duke badges on and the Landlord lets them in and yeah that's they just left that built an apartment up right up there and he went in he'd come out with the big I got a minute later I pulled him over pull them over I go what are you gonna do is let's call a city I feel great I go back to the cell phone to cell phone I go back to the pay phone on the corner back then we had the original call form you would drive the patrol car up on a curb and just reach out to the fucking AT&T phone booth so you'd sit in the patrol car and dial the precinct so I dialed the precinct it was a free cool by the way and and hey boss yeah my wife needs to be at home right now you know one of the kids broke at all whatever you never excuse you to come up with okay no problem come in you take most times called lost time so I told the girl in the car is working with was an ID plant by the way she she was an internal affairs plant sitting with me the whole time I said okay I said you know I gotta go home my wife just paid who that beep is back there my wife just paged me two kids sick or something and so I went back to the precinct signed out my melanic sitting on the scene and so clean the money did the girl who was driving around with you as you were going around for an hour and a half was a plant I guess she was Internal Affairs cop she was an internal affairs so did she get suspicious did she ask questions while you were driving around her sir what I told her how I told her I said just in case someone comes back and breaks in though you don't want to see this people's house get ransacked right no those money in the otherwise she would probably majid it you know right we didn't let her know that right but did you know she was a plant or Janice so you knew yes Wow every good job they did of hiding the plant fact I had to be able to have two days before but it seems like like all this stuff that you were doing all these criminals you were dealing with like the the heightened sort of environment that you were in must have been very addictive because it was just so much going on there's so much action it was listen when you're 28 years old you're driving to work and you got the nerves on one side of your body freezing up on the other side from the ahead to your arms going numb yeah there was a lot of shit going on why was it going I don't know help from the coke or from the nerves just because she didn't know what's gonna happen from one day to the next but you just couldn't get out of it the stress must have been insane yeah wasn't was insane it was I pull over the side of the road and say okay if I die over here it's okay they'll find me like that's how crazy it's so if you die from a heart attack whatever I didn't know what I didn't know what it's gonna be Wow driving to work I did not sure so I like I just feel my body starting to go out so I pulled over to the right so I didn't hurt anybody anomaly very conscientious here right sweet Wow so there was so much going I mean how much coke were you doing not that much you know I was a steady bumper I wouldn't do a lot you know she's doing it all the time yeah so it wasn't like giant noise like that'd be dead yeah I don't know how they did it I tried that once it almost killed me when you were testifying in that film that was one of the more intense parts of that movie because you were just a hundred percent open a hundred percent to your own fault do you think you shouldn't have something that you should never conventions like why like with the Guerlain of money I'm gonna fucking Bible excuse me good you know I I'm still scared of God I ask forgiveness every day you know but you know that was this the most horrific thing I ever did I think you know the thousands of things I did I took some someone's 304 now it's candy he'd count the better than me but was it it just seemed like it seemed almost for you at the time like when I was watching it like you were just so overwhelmed with the pressure of everything that it was almost a relief to get everything off your back when they locked me up when I hit but if I tell you how the investment down it's insane but anyway when they finally put me in the car and tell me I'm on the earth under arrest it was like I can go to sleep really I can actually sleep and funny thing of it all was you know and this is a little touching maybe but we're not but I'll try to be light-hearted here I call my wife from the county jail she goes to me like please don't take this the wrong way she says but I had the best night's sleep in my life listening because I know why [Laughter] she's like a baby I had roaches crawling in my ears but yeah it's okay how much of what was going on did she know about she only knew that I was doing wrong for the most part and she knew they were drugs involved but she didn't never touched it got involved in it you know she just begged me every day stop but it seems like you kinda can't it's hard does anybody ever go corrupt and then just go cold turkey like a heroin addict good story yeah I tried did you I called internal affairs really yeah was a cop I was in the middle of my heyday I said I don't have to stop and turn over a new leaf my son was born and I had to become a responsible father I said and this is not gonna work out doing what I'm doing right so I was in Coney Island which is where I think the movies gonna start if they do it the way I suggest I'm in Coney Island from the Nathan's right by Nathan's they say the bumper car station wherever he goes drives the bumper cars they bang into each I was a rainy rainy summer they must spend 30 good days and the rest were lousy for the whole summer and this is one of the days that it wasn't and um pulls this mercedes-benz a guy in the car with the gold rope chains and the whole drug package going on I just turned my head to my partner and I said Tim look at the fucking gold on this guy's neck now he's got boombox gone with those big wolf furs and everything convertible Mercedes that's all I said listen here yo yo yo yo and I don't turn for yo yo yo yo for nobody and but I hear the footsteps feel the weight of it and I just glanced back and I see a shield in the guy's hand a big black dude monster what's up you said I asked you tonight Paki and you said can't you read I said where'd that happen that conversation all I did was turn to my boys a cop yeah so he was undercover no no no so he was a corrupt cop yeah Wow I didn't know this I didn't know him so you thought he was a drug package the girl had hoops with this is going he doesn't know you're a cop I was sent to Coney Island detail cuz I was in trouble yeah so he's giving you a hard time and he knows you're coming uniform and he's giving me a hard time a very embarrassing moment because you don't do that you don't pray you don't Punk each other out like there's now you created a scene where something has to be you know mediated so he's probably coked up at the very not gonna answer for him who knows what he's whacked out let's put it that something's going on yeah himself yeah he's full of self-importance fuck is he think he is when he's talkin to me right talk about self-importance right so anyway he he makes this big scene and I can't 12th the scene the sergeant comes and it's over with okay about a week I could tell the story different ways but the fact is couple days couple weeks later go by I'm out sick which I should be home in my house but I'm out I just left the beach with my wife I'm driving home from the beach and I see this car park on 111 right across from the cleaners which is known for having a crack spot above it anyway and it's his car this is the fucking name on the license plate that's how we know that well the car stands out but has his name on the license plate you can't fucking you can't miss that right and I asked my wife is what does he look like get a good look at him I don't wanna I don't wanna stop turn around make it obvious but I could see him you know I've seen a few title dog it with 20 minutes anyway long story short I go home I call Internal Affairs they rushed to my house joke from Bali the guy in the movie that says he could the hair on the back of his neck stood up he comes in my house with lieutenant ma they start grilling me about my fucking life like I crawled up on a guy selling drugs no one do I know 112 to you people anyway lieutenant Morris NGO Trimboli out of the house and I know lieutenant this is about me because I just get a fucking lawyer I don't know what's going on I called you because some guy was selling crack around the neighborhood he goes well how do you know he's selling crap it look I don't know but he's in a crack spot and he's a cop so I'm telling you right so I want to turn over a new leaf start my new life I got a new baby I think it'd be good now and I'd be a good cop four weeks later three weeks later I'm getting calls at midnight but not midnight it's 2:00 in the morning getting calls at 3:00 I work six or to shift is going on three o'clock and one of my phone rings nothing nothing nothing just went on for about if I say three weeks could have been to whatever it went on for the extended period of time finally get the guy to talk one day but what the fuck man why don't you just come out with this because he goes I'm banging your wife every day when she gets up to train in Brentwood I said really that's nice yeah when she come home from work she don't work yeah okay so she's somebody goes to train from work you're picking her up and prepping you're banging her he goes yeah okay so what else can you tell me I says well why don't you come to my house I tell him and we just do this since you seem to know where I am he goes why don't I put a boat you fucking head right now he tells me I was standing in front of plate-glass window so Mike meanwhile my wife screaming so now I'm sucking sand that at the bottom of my rug and trying to stay alive crawling into the back room with where my son and my wife was sleeping not anymore and I'm like I can't believe this is guys fucking heating he knows where I live and he's got to be calm I don't know that he was until that moment I realized this no one has my number and cops can get each other's number by calling the precinct since I want to get in touch with so and so hundred so and so and we have private numbers and that you know in a log at the precinct that you can get my number at if you need to speak to me turns out that he was already arrested he was out on bail but he's doing this to me so it was the same guy single chain guy yeah same guy so here I am trying to turn over a new leaf you asked the question I didn't pose this you said so what if I'm called Turkey like a heroin junkie and tried to start from there well I did and look what happened to me I they threatened to kill me it's ready to kill me that's the beginning of it then I go then I leave the Coney Island detail I'll go back to the seven five and no one wants to work with me so if you'd go to the documentary here Mike's no good stay away from him likes no good he's this they didn't want to work him because they heard I was a rat I gave up a cop for corruption night he wears a wire by the way Kenny's good with them I never wore a wire I never clearly gave up a good cop or cop that did it got was selling drugs on fucking Long Island trying to do the right thing turn him in I know they're looking at me for drugs we not no more no more involved with drugs I gave up the game I wanted to be straight so you can't go straight is what I'm trying to tell you once you get labeled in the police department you're done because no one would work with me because I was straight well no one wanted to work with you because they thought that you were untrustworthy because you were turning this cop in well that's what I'm telling you right but they would never admit to that they go everybody to 12 to now says no he was rogue he was corrupt right but the fact is they wasn't working because they were afraid I was going to turn them in and if you hear in the documentary says well Kenny says the only thing you'd turn me in for is having a beer he mentions that Mike and I had to be together and I could just walk away from this partnership and they put us in the farm together which they wanted to fawn three times so I'm pretty good with the farm - what's the farm the farm is where you're going to go for a rehab you know like if you need help yeah like a intervention like to do interventions today right well they do fated farms back then in with arms yeah what did it fall like an actual farm yeah it would go to the farm like we're cows cows had a fish pond they had hay field what would you do there just relax oh you dry out yeah okay there was a place for mostly alcoholics but you know and they called it the farm it was called the farm okay you'd be in rehabilitation okay it was known as the farm right yeah it's well it's renowned in the police department lingo okay yeah so so I wanted to farm three times in like nine months Wow I need well they were after me too you know they were fucking hard on me and I'm up two of my friends just went to prison Walter who's in they went to a prison for a robbery they committed it was Walter the big guy yeah wealth is the monster yeah it always helps having a giant guard pretty sharp guy too but you know he was young and dumb too you know so he wound up going away did chicken short bit like two years and he came home chickie went away for nine months and then they came back and they needed work so I helped for help to find him work different times you know chickie went to work for for Adam as one of my point men when I was off I put chickie on the on the on the clock so if I wanted to go home you know do my you know go home it's work I'd have chickie cover the next six or eight I was a shift that they would be the bodega would be open selling their cocaine now that's where it gets crazy the boat that was when you guys asked elated the handwriting was on the wall that of course the seven seven priests it went down for shaking down local thugs and drug dealers and the rumor was that seven five was going down so we stopped doing that I went to Coney Island half the guys left the fuck at the precinct just quit with the police department and chicky wanted them and when I came back to the 75 no one wanted to work with me and in fact one of my first days back I hook up a Walter who's a rookie kid didn't know anything except that you know he liked to make arrests and get involved and and then I'm like dude you don't know who I am I just want I just want none of nothing to do with this stuff and he's like you know I'll make the arrest and looking ok you're gonna really stop crime in here you're making an arrest for fucking for a drug okay good but I wanna do it because I don't want the attention meanwhile Joe Trimboli the guys following he's across the street watching us interact yeah so time I call from that's a long story I call for the sergeant to give us a scratch so we can be done for the day scratch means the sergeant comes by and notif you notification that you're wrong way you're supposed to be mm-hmm I'm asking the extraordin to give us a scratch just bicorn something over-the-air not asking for the scratch because that would be you know inappropriate but I'm calling a car license plate and Sergeant shows up gives us the scratch we're done for the day I get in my private car go to the bodega pick up four hamburgers and eight pack of you know little nip Bud Lights no they weren't but the regular buds back then and the sergeant's following us the whole time all this shit I'm over now I'm over in the other end of the precinct because one of my favorite bodegas who makes a nice burger and we came back to the spot ate ate this stuff throw the shit out the window just was too ghetto and it's what you do like an asshole instead of respect in the community fuckin idiot you know you dumb dumb young and dumb so I threw the six fifty twelve eight pack of beers out the window the so I just see this flying out the fucking window he goes and grabs cans now he's gonna call me in and investigate me for drinking on it on the job but Walter stood up and said what the hell is mud early on so I I gotta love them they could have lost his job because he was on probation when you guys started dealing with the guys who only de bodega that's when the documentary gets most crazy right and that's when it seems like you guys had escalated you'd gone from just taking a little money here and there and having some fun and go in Atlantic City now you are deep with deep yeah in serious drug deal yeah yeah and that's why you know I'm gonna had the meeting with Diaz I said listen you have to just talk to us you gotta pay us money cuz I don't know where this is gonna go but I know it's going deep right yeah so I can put it number twenty-four thousand don't ask me why I didn't say 44,000 I have no idea I just I think I in my mind it broke down like this three months clea pay for each of us you know right taxes at that time we probably cleared you know do the math you know three thousand a month whatever it was at that time okay so let's have three or four months of clear pay so if we get jammed up we can survive like that's the number I came up in correlation to something like that so it was in case you got it right away okay um brilliant brilliant thinking knowing that something was not gonna be good at this and where's that guy now he's in like the Dominican Republic get on my phone if you want really I get him all right he was fucking hilarious he's one of the best Oh him speaking of him he asked me to give you this oh really yeah I don't know if you likes ago I do like cigars what kind of this is the Adam Diaz king of Brooklyn cigar well he's got his own cigar yeah we just thought it's in the development process right now but if you check out the label you really can't see it well what does a picture him with the unibrow respect a commitment to a unibrow yeah yeah I think he's good yeah no no there-there the tact aback a letter in the mini smoke these they delicious for me and Marty had one more no no I won't do that but I would do it that's okay we can smoke him we got a little if you wanted to we could all right let's do if you wanted to these are delicious by the way I don't have a clipper yeah but so he but he's a fucking character that guy he's in this he's in that fucking unibrow that's that's a commitment today shave do you really shave the middle I'm step more hair there than now I don't know what happened I think from doing this all the time yeah brownie just just wore it off yeah or maybe from defense so funny story would Adam and I think most people appreciate this I hope they do Adams pay me eight thousand a week right now and I don't see him for two weeks now I'm get a little fucking nervous right what we got our purses and what's the fuck happened these cities so are you doing Jamie crazy when I'm not here so Adam Diaz and I haven't seen each other in two weeks I'm getting a little annoyed because I want my money I wanted on time and part of the deal was whether you're making money or not you paying me because we've already opened the door to this I'm gonna start living the life right and can you open it right I'm gonna start living like my neck is killing me what's wrong I got two vertebrae out I banged up death yeah yeah someone probably grabbed me the wrong way right yeah just recently so Adam did so anyway I haven't seen this guy and he owes me now two weeks right okay and if you learn anything about me I don't like to be old and I don't like to owe I like to pay I like to be paid on time and I'm always early so anyway I I finally see him I've seen he's got the red Porsche I mean 911 Targa twenty-two years old right yeah 911 Targa blond-haired blue-eyed Dominican 22 years old convertible there he goes down the new lots avenue with new lights in Vermont that meet in this little triangle and so um Kenny's with me in the car at the time anyway so so he's pretty good I just love the fact I'm smoking that dude cigar so I pull him over and he goes so Diaz is getting pulled over by the police in East New York and and I'm his hook right but he doesn't know that's me cuz he recognizes blue right this tall guy and he's sitting down low in the Porsche Cho license registration insurance card he's fumbling around looking for his shit he probably doesn't have anything anyway so he's got his Dominican pants on his nice loafers he's the shop looking kid he's dressed to the nines look good and finally he goes I look at him I go Adam it's me Mike he jumps up out of the car where you been like I'm annoyed right I'm annoyed but I'm being nice where you been I was in Yael Yael yeah Jill I think I can coin in my life that I know of right so I go yeah you're in Yael he goes yeah I go how long we in Yale he goes three four days you're up in Yale three or four days I said who do you know in Connecticut [Laughter] Connecticut Yale's in Connecticut the college he goes no no not college I was in Yale Rikers Island he says that perfectly uncle you mean Jail not yeah he goes yes yeah I go son of a bitch so I think I coined this fucking term jail not Yale oh yeah not Jail agreed this is 1987 okay I don't know you've been here we know term Yale not jail yeah no jail not Yale no I heard it 34 seconds ago so here's this guy saying I wasn't in Yale I was in Yale I'm like you mean you just can't say jail say it yeah well if he texts me all the time he goes instead of going ha ha ha he goes ji ji ji ji what is that that's ha ha ha that's so strange yeah that's how you know Spanish people and make it funny yeah JJJ ok yeah so anyway so just you know you can't make that up you know well boy I'm thinking he's in college you know cuz she's a sharp kid why didn't you automatically assume like I did that he meant but you're around Spanish people although she's out the fucking Street he's out of street driving a Porsche if he was in jail second well how did he get out I don't know why when there's too many questions I just wanted my money you want to learn about me I don't ask a lot of questions because if I if I don't like the answer I'm gonna get really fucking mad right right right want the money but dealing with a guy like that and dealing with an organization like that you you had to know that okay now I've taken this giant step I'm involved with a serious murderer cocaine dealing motherfucker like this is horrible yeah it's horrible you sell your soul and you know what's this what's the safe other than this I I got a little annoyed with them right so I get a complete disaster so I call my wife up by says this and things aren't going too good on you want to want to get back together I want some stability in my life right so she comes to me okay I'm okay from here and so she goes I go listen I'm going to Dominican Republic and I'm coming with this woman I'm seeing at the time I was a police officer sweetheart girl anyway and I cope would you would you come with me instead she goes take her have a good time that's a good I ruin everything anyway so you know sometimes like I think adversity makes some women better some women that like to dealing with a no offense asshole husband yeah sometimes it just makes him a better person they just they learn how to roll with a load they learn a lot yeah cuz they're sitting back observing this whole disaster taking place you know cuz they're trying to stop you and you ain't listening yeah so so I go to the medical republic right and and I'm I'm on I'm on the plane and this guy would it be well-groomed he's making small talk when I was meeting the girl and he's got some woman with him look I'm on vacation I'm not going here to fucking round anybody or make any deals and going there to see my Dominican drug kingpin and see if we can get the money pipe flowing again a little just destroyed here now my incomes cut way down only making about two three thousand a week I was getting six seven thousand a week between his payoffs and all my other shakedowns going on I was doing good now get a little tight you know I got fucking four homes I got a kid that I want to put away for his college sorry I never made that but anyway so there's a lot of things I got planned here and he's fucking it up right now cuz he's hiding in Dominica right so I'm going to see him so I got off the plane and they're speaking Dominican to me these people and I can speak a little Spanish so I said yo soy police were policia know where your DNA on taxi or call Jake but a transport or el Casa de Campo I'm talking to a cop in uniform the sergeant stripes on right right the the cab drivers start beating them up start beating the cop and they grab and pushing them trying to knock them out in a way because they want to take the ride and I want if this guy cuz he's big and he's the cops gonna mediate for me get you the right price because I don't think I look to take you know take advantage of the gringo from America anyway I end up fucking paying off paying hand and fist for this ride but in the interim some guy steps over to me the guy that was on the plane with me and says hey yeah you don't what are you guys doing where you going and like I'm like like what you here on vacation too and we're talking back and forth I'm gonna see this buddy of mine Diaz he's done he said bodega owner in New York I know guys like oh really where's this where's he live I go I don't know someplace in an hour old man or whatever I said turns out of the DEA they fuckin followed me on the plane how would you how did you not automatically assume that I'm 48 I was 28 I probably told them everything come on vacation have a good time you know and I'm just looking for like a friendly face right you know and he speaks Dominican and don't worry I'll take care of you he says I'll get you where you gotta go I said great so dei a guy says I'll get you where you want no he's fucking DEA oh fucking soft so anyway we end up in the car we get what this we get all the way to this el Casa de Campbell to plugin I think it took three different ways to get there so we finally get there and they put us in his house with four different couples what like we share in a fucking house with somebody okay no one's there who are these other people I don't know okay I wanna love his retreat for the weekend right and they got me in a house like for people who want to go camping and hang out together and sweat and something I don't know so I look around I go there's for the couples in this fuckin house I like I'm sharing a kitchen I'm sharing this and I'm like I'm here for this right so they drive us back to I said no get me out of here so now they drive us back to this little retreat right by the beach don't get in there everything's good have a nice time and I'm cool and Adam every night I mean your country problem I fucking like you see how I'm here Joe I'm in LA right I live in Long Island I'm here right so I told Diaz I'm here he goes his wife he wants a phone his wife says he's playing basketball now a few so Diaz in the film he's five foot three I know maybe he's cherlene five foot three but he sheets you he's five foot three and cute so I'm okay that's 10:30 at night her prince is really good at basketball Charlie Murphy talked about it so I'm calling them every day and every night I'm in your country right I'm here okay she'll respect show up right right plus the fact that you owe me fucking like fourteen thousand dollars right now I'm getting a little nervous three weeks four weeks pay I'm told myself you know right so I'm a little annoyed but I'm spending $1,000 $1,500 come see you for a reason actually four thousand by the time I figured the trip out of my fucking anyway so he's playing basketball it's midnight I call his fucking house Nomad midnight improving his fucking phone his wife answers the phone at midnight Mike he's playing basketball I said you got to be fucking kidding me it's midnight he's five foot three how much biscuit what could he possibly be playing I'm in his country I said this is fucking disrespectful tell him I said that I don't hit me kill me I don't fucking know I'm perfect I don't let this point kiss me anyway we turn around we leave but getting on we got really good on the plane about an hour before the plane I'm staying in el emperador hotel in a sense Santa Domingo and there's a casino downstairs I love the fucking gamble right Linux City every time we hit a big load we hit Atlantic City so I'm in the casino the lights go out in the casino I got like 20 minutes I put American money in there make any money I use American I hidden for like six eight hundred Lodge right in like ten minutes they want to stab me they don't want to let me leave hold me feet there I gotta catch a fucking plane like no it's a 40 minute ride from where I am so I got to get going now they're like you're catching it I go yeah let me go don't think I'd flash lights on the table because the lights go out I get mean every hour or two to go out for like 15 minutes the casinos not yeah back then he did so he's standing with flashlights making sure everybody's money's not getting stolen or robbed from him I cash out and I leave to get on a plane to come back home so I get home on the way home I get strip-searched in the airport now if you've got to be kidding me coming from the Dominican Republic there's nothing but packages with people at ropes and cardboard boxes right like real luggage these people have stamps on the side yeah yo on the fucking side of their box is coming in right women's have the thighs cut open so they can stuff packages of fucking coke in their thighs right but I'm coming in with a little bag and a little little kitty T whatever the fuck I'm wearing coming from Dominica and I'll get a strip searched in the airport so I'm looking around and saying this is fucking some setup anyway I know it's a setup right now it's Mike doubt is finally waking up you know and I go it's that fucking from I didn't know his name I thought it said trap bomb his name is fucking Trimboli like what's that fucking trap bound I know it is anyway get strip-searched she gets on the plane yeah on the way back my wife say okay go have fun come back we'll talk right so on the way back you look right so yeah she's distraught now she's getting bent off I just fucked up and now these people are fucking her you know horrible I mean that's what laughing because you know life is you know horrible well after the fact exactly so anyway so we get home and whatever we do our last deeds and outside this fucking Sala anyone tell us someone was outside fucking taking a license plate numbers down they had flashlights on them on the inspection stickers for our cause turtle affairs without side you know marking the locations and the times and everything else that I was at the house I don't want to tell her my spooker so anyway a week goes by two weeks go by whatever it was finally I met Barron shop portal Sound City where this whole thing basically centers around and Adams there I want to fucking I don't know for the bite him kick him hug him or stay at him I'm fucking I want to kill him right I what the fuck I was in your country what the fuck is wrong with you he goes the DEA had you following me public he said they tapped you they follow Jay he said I was warned by the Dominican Police Department the state of fuck away from you you think you would a sent a pigeon or something send me a message well he probably couldn't probably probably couldn't trust anybody it's probably one of those situations where what can you do if you're if you know that you're being tapped and you know that they're watching it's probably best to just play basketball do sometimes just lay low and hope that he sees you it makes sense yeah how did you avoid getting killed that's that's what is most shocking that you were involved with I mean listen you go into a ring you think you're coming out right yeah so just because do you realize now like we're looking back on it like jesus fucking christ like i came really close well serious affront that I faced was that guy cello that mentioned in the documentary and why I say that because at any moment something could have could have gone wrong any deal you know at some point I began purchasing the coke from these guys because they couldn't constantly front your fucking kilos because they loved you right and I could no longer buy them provide them protection because I wasn't they took my guns and badge away I surrendered it that's not so keep it real I surrendered my gun and badge why did you surrender it because I was trying to get up the job psycho disability see psycho disability huh yeah you know I mean it makes sense right but they gave me my guns back this was what's ruinous they gave it to you back they go no we did an investigation we decided you okay okay good and I'm reading the fucking papers you don't even know yeah this is surreal I'm reading this is see this piece of paper I have you on this piece of paper there's a guy he's about 90 years old this is no joke not bitten on here but there's a 90 year old guy he's the head shrink in the whole new sweep police department he's got this piece this dossier in front of him he leaves it out and I'm in there to get my gun and badge back he's 90 so he turns around he's got to go about 50 feet this way open a locker with a lock on it take my gun in my badge and give it back to me so I'm sort of like doing a neck twist and curl and it says four or five separate allegations for selling narcotics out of a red Corvette and this guy's giving me back my gun and badge I'm like this is fucking unbelievable mr. first time I ever saw officially in writing what they had me under investigation for there's 19 different fucking listed investigations a four specifically at one period of time from like 86 87 88 specifically laid out week after week what they were looking for me for I'm like and this is from a red Corvette so I knew exactly what time that was I only had the red Corvette for a short period as well so I'm like I can't believe they give my shit back I mean this is now I know I'm scared I don't know you know though do you think that they were giving your shit back so that you could keep doing what you were doing they'd catch you on more shit was that the idea behind it they don't ever want to catch you really they don't ever want to catch you they want you to stop at that point yeah because if they catch you at fuck's with the whole department and says it's a black eye for anybody okay which is true when it's hard you know listen what I did was not good we know that you're just talking about it right now do you know that uh it was Tamir Rice's at the kid's name the 12 year old kid that got shot they they decided that it was okay there was nothing wrong did an investigation show there was nothing wrong with the way the officer acted got out of his car within two seconds shot this twelve-year-old kid who had a gun fake gun toy gun so a lot of these things that you mentioned I don't know all the facts on I'm not here to bash what cops do because what they do was an impossible job right the problem is that everybody makes mistakes and when you're a cop and you make a mistake of course somebody their life yeah and that's that's the reality you know and you know if you ask me is it other solutions and other alternatives I say absolutely you know give a cop the body cam just give more body cameras why not I mean you know everybody else is filming you might as well be the one filming it yeah problem was this story is a totally unrelated story but this story was on camera I you know I caught a little clips of some stuff Joe I try not to pass judgment cuz I'm not the one there I've been in a hundreds in Eastern Europe I pulled my gun out every day I probably pull my gun out 15 times a day well and I never shot anybody so you pulled your gun out to warn people you pulled I don't know that air for let them know that this is serious and that I need to know where your hands are right now right now your hands on my threat right and if I don't see your hands and you don't comply with me with your hands then I may have to kill you right may have to I don't want to right but I'm letting you know it's amazing that you never shot anybody yeah close cover charge I actually shot a cop once really yeah undercover yeah in the couple she's beating up some kid so he had a gun on a kid and I told him drop his gun he wouldn't drop his gun I was with Kenny that time he could probably tell the story as well does he permit is everything perfectly but if you talk to that guy anymore Kenny not really they're not you know we don't have a good relationship let's put it that way I would imagine that what strain on the friendship when a guy puts you away years it's not even that anymore it's more the way he's handled things since then he's just listen I don't begrudge him for what happened to his life he made decisions in his life based on more than just his own freedom okay mm-hmm his wife's freedom was at stake as well okay his children's being put into a foster home possibility was there because you know right I understand dori was directly involved in certain things his wife you two together on a podcast would be fucking epic well we tried Saudis we couldn't do together did you know we worked on roots in the same room I listen cuz I really don't to give him the credibility that he does not deserve because he continually we we have word odds over certain things mm-hmm and aspects of the story certain aspects of the story and when I confront him and he just says well you're a liar you know what do I have to lie about mm-hmm what do I have to fucking lie about right I'm the guy who did the fucking time nothing to lie about if you remember things differently than I that's fine you know but the reality is I'm just gonna touch on it okay briefly the this kidnapping / murder / whatever executions live functioning and thing at the end we weren't going to the woman's house to do that okay going to the woman's house to survey her house he insisted that we welcome to the front door I said what do you are you fucking mine that's not even in the plan that doesn't make the tapes that's not even in the plan Kenny yeah well I'm not driving all the way here not going up to the front door first of all that shouldn't even be a discussion because we're not going up to the front door there's other people involved in this they're gonna go in didn't they get you on recordings this woman what you don't hear is what he's saying for 20 minutes 30 minutes saying they're gonna execute him I you know I'm like who who's gonna execute it the Colombians he keeps saying I'm Larin first of all we're all the Colombians second of all they're not here and third of all whatever we throw whatever I want to get past the conversation whereas I sense he's fucking taping it more sense they sense it to him I've asked him numerous times Kenny you wearing a wire come on just tell me the truth so who's this before he was wearing a wire you thought he was wearing a wire no while he was wearing a wire so you knew when shit was going down it wasn't making sense so I kept saying I'm you wearing a wire no no my god but never do that to you I'm like I want to believe this guy you know I want to believe them it should be one of those things like remembering those old stupid TV shows where you'd have to say you'd ask a cop are you a cop and then from then they would have to tell you which is goddamn hilarious you know for cop if you just ask him if he's a cop they're gonna tell you yeah fucking fantasy that's that's goddamn valaria cop is allowed to do a bump if he has to stay alive well they were allowed in Hawaii you fuck prostitutes well that's good I'm on the job there that's true it's a recent thing they made a recent decision that police are officers in Hawaii are allowed to have sex with prostitutes on the job as a part of an ongoing investigation but because they can't get enough on their own I mean come on well because they have to find out things and then we can talk our own private detective agency well undercover women wound up fucking drug dealers and stuff all the time right it's a dark secret isn't it well they could have got me pretty easily that way then couldn't they why did they do that you know dine packages the tape recorders back then though we're fuckin giant monstrous VCR looking things do matter and I didn't check them because I had was too proud like you wouldn't do that to me my brother says to me Mike did you talk to Mike oh yeah I didn't Wow and thank God I didn't that day cuz I well thank God I mean what's the difference I'm doing my time either way right but what if you'd killed him or something what if you think I didn't find out yeah well anything could have happened assault you threatened the witness a minute ago right exactly that's the sneaky thing about it now you went away for 12 years I was sentenced to 14 years I took a plea agreement that was 10 to life okay that's the police that was a plea and so how does it work they offered me 24 to 30 ooh that was my first offer I call my lord what the fuck did I kill somebody he goes that's just the way to federal government as I said that's nice so 12 to 24 to 30 was my first offer now what pisses me off is here's a guy he doesn't realize what he did just dead to a guy who was eaten in my house David yeah a couple weeks ago and now he you know doesn't realize that instead of just doing our time together like you take there let me let me stack track a little bright and we'll try to remember that where we worked okay when we were out on bail Kenny had some options as I did to either cooperate with the government and give everything up and just go on and do your memory a little bit in your life whatever it might have not to have been too little it might have been more so I get off for a shrimp boat trip a job in Nicaragua - my shrimp shrimp yeah who the fuck is offering your ship the owner of the Astoria Hotel in a story of Manor Inn in Astoria Queens he's got a catering hall with bunch of weddings and most weddings they love to had shrimp and every wedding is 11 rooms in the indicator mean wall so he's got 11 people sometimes twice a day filtering shrimp sir was business so he says listen Mike you're going away for a long period of time he said so I got an option for you I need a shrimp boat captain Nicaragua you want to go I went da man so you know I'm looking for any anything to grab on to at that point in my life and I go home and I'm like I give Kenny a call I said Kenny listen I want to talk to you like I don't know if we should talk as Ken let's meet and talk so we have a conversation and he says Mike I got a pension I got a wife and a kid he says I'm not giving that shit up Jim a little bit I have to do it fine he says but I'm not giving it all up to go shrimp boat fishing in Nicaragua I said okay done story done case closed Don never happened okay three four days later took maybe less two days later the phone rings Mike I'm interesting goin fishin talk about fishing so he comes to see me he says uh now I see the fucking DEA over here I see something over here because I want to go fish remember the fishing trip you talking about last week I know what fishing trip fuckin you know the marlin fishing trip what fishing trip he won't say the word shrimp boat in Nicaragua why well it has to come from me why does it have to come from me because is it if you're working for the government at this point you can't be the one that interrupts the person so him saying this fishing trip let's go fishing yeah all right so he wants you to say because he wants you to say I'm gonna skip the con three correct he wants me to say you mean like I don't write the shrimp boat job in Nicaragua right yes he jumps up out of his fuckin chair I'm like looking so excited about I know I know something's wrong so I go okay something's not right and I start finding the fucking set up everywhere around me and he's opening the window and his car is his perfectly quaffed I said Kenny will you open the window for fucking air conditioners on it's 95 degrees out your hair's gonna get messed oh no no anyway he disputes he disputes that but why would you dispute that anyway so so now think of what just happened he's now come back to me and says he wants to go on the shrimp boat trip right he goes home I go home I said listen it's a good idea we need a half a million plus this I can't leave my family broke all the houses are up for fucking bail judaize go by and some Colombian pulls me up and says I got I need a half a million dollars of this I need a half a million dollars recovered and ten kilos from this woman's house in Jamaica and in a same number just what I need exactly what I needed right so wicious I'm saying he's great really believed it they played it off well so and I'm looking for anything I don't do that sprit are you doing coconut no no no six six weeks clean Wow in jail so I was out on bail and no one would sell anything to me tried to pick up a package to my own dealer wouldn't sell it to me I'm not gonna go to Yale I end up in a discussion with him and this thing presents itself and he's all over it now yeah I want to Kenny you didn't want to go before he says yeah but now I want to go like he's like fucking screaming it like okay it sounds a little odd do you wear a wire no okay just checking anyways so on and on and eventually the sting was sad and this thing turned into what it turned into and you know well you dispute it in the film you say that you yeah but I dispute the premise of the beginning of the whole process what the woman is a controversy back and forth I never saw her never met it never intended to touch her myself personally ever now how she's gonna get in my car bag and gagged and whatever I don't fuckin know okay but the fact is that we were opposed to do anything to her so for people who listen to this that haven't seen the documentary there was it was sort of like a last thing that you guys could do to make a shitload of money and it involved kidnapping a woman who would eventually be murdered well this is in the film yeah nothing that I never had anything to do with the eventual and they spoke Spanish out of fucking candy know what they were saying right I don't know maybe the government translated for him so but what part if any were you playing in or anticipating take the money from a woman's house come on we could do that in your sleep take the money from a woman's house and the drugs and go home give split it up with with the Colombians and go somehow along the way whether the government fishing kenny fishing someone pushing this woman they're gonna go from being money that wasn't hers was a drug dealers money that was killed right her husband was a Dominican drug dealer who was killed by whom I can't answer that question but the fact is that he had a half a million in cash in that home according to the set up people and ten kilos and we can take it all to put it down the middle and you'll have your money you can leave the country I mean very convenient very yeah I was wow what a crazy scenario though so and that one from shaking down street drug dealers a couple hundred a day too you know but see that's like that's like an attempted murder that's a whole conspiracy charge no no no I'm not but I'm saying like they obviously couldn't pin that on you otherwise you would have run away for a lot longer than 12 years so you answer you answer - so but it seems like that was something they were trying to concoct to make everything a lot more severe correct okay now when you go away you went but think about how many years you were involved in actual crime how many years do you think you were involved as a cop committing crime well every time you put the uniform on and you don't do the right thing you pretty much become into crime right and the other ganya so how many years is that about I'd say a solid five a solid five years so it's not that bad go away for 12 you want to minimize my sentence now I mean every fucking day come on I'm sure but I was gonna bring that up too but what is it like when you go in there I mean first of all you're a cop they know you're a cop yeah everywhere I went they know what is that was the first person they knew on the compound when we hit the compound and what is out it's like having 1,800 men times two because they each got two eyes most of them not all so you have 3,600 eyes on you never mind the 600 staff in there watching you 24/7 watching threatening you you know you eyeball someone that could be a threat right you in a room in a fight game you know eyes can mean either compliance you know or fuck you and then you den it's up to you how do you want to hit did they did they think of you as almost one of them because you were also involved in crime there was a strange relationship many of them wish that they were me because they would love to have had that power I mean right dozens if not hundreds have said I wish I was a fucking cop well if you see the film it feel like you were God right you just you could do anything you wanted it was horrible look that's what was my point about having that kind of power but in prison you have none right you're the least one they want you and the child malicious you know that's so is that how they lump you in there right in the same category Wow yeah so basically when they say willfully yard by myself at what other than Mickey Munday who came up to me and said hello to me who is Mickey Munday blond-haired guy from the cocaine Cowboys fuck yeah yeah that's my friend Billy Corbin documentary both of them looking Cowboys 1 & 2 that guy's your buddy he went to jail with him the two great stories in Miami and his favorite fucking greasy spoon spot down oh he's out too yeah I was John Cardillo who does a radio show I on I Heart Radio down there at a Fort Lauderdale he and I he's a retired cop and it's a great host on a show and we're talking about maybe doing something together too as well Wow good come the good cop bad cop show that sounds like a great idea be fucking pissed first of all if you don't have a podcast there's a fucking crime being committed right now fucking easy shit Jamie will tell you it's easy this is a way more complex setup than anybody really needs yeah we only do it this way because it's kind of fun to have video I'll be live-streaming yeah yeah yeah library good live right now yeah you're great I wish I'd done this when I was 20 yeah but the the point is like all you need is a little mp3 recorder we had a little recorder that's like the size of a cell phone like this like the size of Kenny's water well now if he wishes but I've done a few of them just with my iPhone we just I set it down on the table and the microphones and these things are really good yeah you could do it and then you upload it it doesn't it's fucking easy shit but I need someone like you to feed off if I'm not yeah but you just just find somebody get one of the guys that shut down you could do that you can phone East or I met I'm at the one do premieres I had premiere and I see these guys come walking up and I look fucking they look a little Haggard you know and they're looking at me with that like cheapest like look and like you know I'm like this any star other thing so I got a look proper and everything and looking you know ever dite mmm-hmm and up comes these guys look like they from the street yeah right I got the hats on sideways half their teeth amiss and the guy sticks his hand out and he comes Mike I go yeah I just hang out on picking and fucking picking in nor would or picking in not annoyed because no one doesn't mean it but picking him and prescient and picking in chestnut okay but we both made it like it was like almost a fucking initial bond that you could you couldn't imagine like right like I was I did my bid whatever he did you know thirty fucking years later he's shaking my hand at a movie premiere thing it was saying he was like how do you I don't know if that's like technicians how do you live through it we only like ten people live through it know those three of those three and me and a couple of people so in a sense well you both survivors in a sense right no respect yeah I was respected nice to see that's bizarre right a couple cop came up to me I really didn't like it but they didn't like they don't they came up nug me and say man you made it you know go on with your life which really to me you know I have to be honest with you you know you're still a cop in your heart you know your fighter you were fighter in your heart you know you know that you know it's respect that's a what a strange relationship between you and the other cop well you give up your whole community yeah you fuck up like I did you know and my whole family is involved you know the police department Fire Department's you you destroyed your relationship with that old community and that's how you grew up so I basically destroyed every fabric of light of Who I am you know but then again they have to watch that documentary be fuckin entertained they loved it people come to me no listen it was back then yeah so now they know and they know who I am as a human being I really mean good I don't always do good but I do mean well right well like like I said if I was 23 years old and I was living when you're living and doing that job I probably would have been right there with you I probably would have you know one in a thousand I've said the same exact words so is it some comfort maybe it is there's some comfort no I you know there's some I used to have this different look about people I should say well you know you're responsible for your own actions which in a sense you absolutely are but you're all there's also this concept that all of your own actions and whoever you are in a lot of ways are determined by your environment by how you grew up by what situation you find yourself in by the circumstances you find yourself in in that situation now and there's all there's a lot going on there and then there's the fun fucking day I have to say that's but I was watching that document I was like this guy looks like he's having a great fucking time I don't know if that's a good thing it's not a good thing that's not good that it's not what I did but here's the thing right one of the things you alluded to it's like who's bringing the fucking drugs into that community you know who's bringing the drugs into the country and I hate to go all crazy conspiracy theory but the reality is there were a bunch of rogue CIA yeah Lee North screw fucking the Mena Airport Adam one cousin yeah was the guy that got killed the berry seals Barry seals who was the pilot there's all these photographs of him with all these Colombian drug lords and and this guy went he was murdered on his way to testify he had George Bush's phone number in his fucking pocket when he was killed fucking shit going on with this there's so much money involved in drugs like that's why I'm for total legalization decriminalization of all everything because you make criminal head of people that generally not criminals yes there's just a lot of money I mean a guy goes to school becomes a stockbroker he finds out that the real money isn't being criminal criminal instead of making his sixty seventy or hundred thousand he wants to make six million so he has to be a criminal so and then that's choice he made though it's right he made that choice but being exposed to the opportunity people find out who they really can become yes or or we you know I like to say you're not what you've done it's what you've become afterwards though like someone hurt somebody you know in a moment of rage or something inadvertently does something or will they go out of their way to do something because for whatever the deriving reasons are mm-hm so there forever defined by that act yes but that does not necessarily who someone is well people love to forever define people by that act because they ain't in some way are very happy it's not them right and so they want to say you pieces you're a piece of shit forever forever but how many people did what I did got away with throwing fucking stones at me a lot okay I'm sure listen go back into the histories and their lasts from between let's go 85 to 95 every single called ghetto precinct cuz that's what it's called in the police world every single ghetto precinct had a scandal very similar to mine except maybe not the depth like you had initially said like I really got into the pain and and and straight out dealing with the guys well let's be honest you're an all-star you an all-star in the world of corruption so much it's what it's like it's like you know guys take it to the next level spike I mean not everybody could be Ronda Rousey you know I'm saying you know not everybody movie Jonjo you had her last guys take it to the next level and you you took it to the next level in the world and my children are quite proud of that but I mean whenever you have any sort of an act whether it's a guy who's a marijuana dealer or a guy who's a fucking bow hunter you're gonna have people that just take it to the ultimate they take it to the furthest extreme and that's what you did as a corrupt cop yeah I just found ways to continually get out like Serpico look you think he's a piece of shit or you think he's you understand I wouldn't hang out with him you know for any period of time but you kind of dabbled in that when you write right quick dr. beautiful want it better now when you go away okay and you're you're in that what what prison did you go I was in several I started out and now she's seen you look I did two years there waiting to be sentenced and that's a state it's it's 10 or federal all fair I was federal and and it's not the camp that you think it is by the way and then I was sent out to Marianna Florida and us nice weather 12 105 summer go outside oh yeah no what happened was I was in isolation for nine months in nine months and in total isolation in MCC New York and what is that like it's the worst thing in the world total deprivation sensory deprivation every the lights on all the time not always but depending upon the location you're at sometimes they keep a light on so that they can see you but the worst thing is the worst thing about being isolation is your loss of interpersonal skills which I don't I don't know if I have any anyway but just when you pass people like in a physical manner you don't know whether they're gonna stab you you should stay up them you should hug them you should shake their hand it's it's total it's hard to explain but it's like that physical presence of another person next to you and you in your space I mean you're you're a fighter you know you're a cop someone gets in a certain space you need to protect yourself right well being convict / inmate / prisoner when someone steps in your personal space of course you need to check them but when you're in isolation you don't know what it is like your personal space becomes whatever you can grasp right whatever you can control so when I was first example was my first pass somebody we had a room let's say the sauciest studio here and he was like he was out on the floor and I was out on the floor at the same time which is very odd in my situation so I mean NEVER wasn't around anybody I didn't know what to do know how to respond to his presence in my in my world and he was another guy that was also in solitary for sure period so he was he just got in trouble for something mm-hmm but I at that point I was probably in at that moment probably five or six months so five or six months with no contact except when they feed you right and when they feed you they talk to you know they throw the food through a slot and you go no one says anything to you very little interaction how are you today you know yeah I'm good great I just finished another book you know you know so that's the entire extent of your human interaction for nine months essentially yes do you do get visits once a week or something like that for an hour with your family members Wow you know that's you know it's a little different because you know it's a warm thing you know but peep there are criminals and convicts in the same you not really touchy love you feel right so you don't know how to respond you know yeah I would imagine like but didn't Bradley Manning I think he was in for like two years plus before he became Chelsea Manning right two years plus solitary no interaction with anyone and I believe no clothes because they were worried about him killing himself with himself yeah or herself when is the transition when do you officially say him or her either way but but like I've heard it argued that like you go insane like if you if you leave someone alone for two or three years and there's no interaction at all with other people well you might as well just fucking shoot yeah I swear God used to sleep underneath their bed put the mattress on top of their bed and sleep underneath it underneath the bed we hang up the walls why I don't know Wow it was just like that's what their life became you become insane that Pappy Mason isn't one of the guys that he killed a cop and it was responsible for the killing of Eddie burns I think that was executed and he used to sleep under his bed part of the fact that he wanted to be known to be psycho rather than be responsible for oh so he was doing things yeah but then it became him who know his dreads were fucking like 12 feet long his life became sympathy for what he did right but but just people human beings in general that's what happens when they start to go on the other side well the thing about the Bradley Manning case is even more fucked up is because all he did was expose crime I mean that was the guy who gave away the WikiLeaks documentary documents okay he gave it to Julian Assange now they're both fucked he's the Julian Assange is stuck in a fucking embassy in London he can't move they just have recently I think in the last couple days they got rid of his 24-hour guards had guards outside the gate and making sure he didn't bolt now another like he's stalking this I think the Ecuador embassy and so he's fucked there and then Chelsea Manning is fucked in jail forever and they're never gonna let her out now and that's it and it's all exposing crime which is even more fucked up because Julian Assange is not a criminal Bradley Manning's not a crowd then you know the crime of exposing government corruption and documents so I'll give you an interesting detail one of the hundreds of stories my boys they do a shakedown they they hit they rob this bodega which is why chickie and Walter become my buddy I mentioned it briefly before so they're out on bail Walt is living in my house and from Paulie one of the internal affairs detective is constantly at my house like surveilling my house and shit and Walter Chickie's out on bail getting ready to do a little nine-month bid Walters getting ready to go upstate for two and a half years because he's like he was on duty you know he was the he was the police officer that was still on the job and so I find out that they get ready to go to trial now they're all putting herself this is prior to their pleas to get me on a trial so I get in touch with Barron I tell Barron tell the owner to bodega that he needs to leave the country right away because trials coming up in a week Barron reaches out and tells the guy that you know the cop stopped by my office today and said you guys gotta leave the country you know you gotta leave because things can get bit if you don't leave the country so guy leaves country immediately I get a phone call from the fucking trials me but they don't know the trial has been postponed I said okay good I don't know the details but I know he's gone the guy I hadn't leave the country so about eight or ten months later the case is ready to fall apart internal affairs goes and arrests this guy's wife or sister she's working some bookie spot was bodegas that sells numbers and didn't really sell food and they arrest his wife to him they're gonna deport her and take a keeper care to put him in PC bcw one of those Bureau of Child Welfare Sochi well cool yeah call your brother and tell him to get back here I can't come back they're gonna have me killed by the other man so he comes back on the protection the child goes forward but the fact is that what I'm getting at and when telling you is that's what you can actually do when you're a cop if you really don't want something to happen you could actually have that kind of control over a situation well because I mean it wasn't them who did it it was us who did it we had this guy leave the country so these are the stories that the book can lay out even if the movie takes its spin in that direction I mean there's really some intense shit that we were able to do I mean if a guy put a complaint in against us we call his house you know if you wanted to complain at the cops some treated me unfairly or something like that really you know you got to realize what you were dealing with well that kind of shit goes on to this day that comes on the shuttle subtle versions of that yeah I I'm not going to disparage anybody I'm just saying what we were able to do I'm saying in order to keep our moving the ball forward right you know that's the way you could do things you know if I put it what they called a civilian complaint against let's say it yourself you am I either my buddy one of my co-workers you're not gonna you know and say anything but you might have your friend sit in front of his house for a week and just freak him out do anything right I think it's enough it's pretty it's pretty clear how we did that the cello the the the kingpin drug dealin and that's when he tried to threaten to kill me right it's bream for the movie moving it out he put it on me because I sat in front of his bodega because he sure did a 700 hours i sat in front of his bodega for a week probably and then he notified Marin that he put a hit out on me I don't that was part of the fluff or the reality is so Baron and called me and he says there's a hit on you so that's when I went I found him the next day and day one whenever it was and pulled him over and confronted him in the street and he called the hit off and got my seven on a Barksdale which was a nice day Jenny says I never gave him the 350 he's gotta be full of shit I mean what oh he wasn't there like I said I'm not I don't remember you know wow now when you go away okay then you do your 9 months in solitary right why'd they put you in solitary initially a cop does you're a cop just to protect you yeah so once you get out of solitary yeah now you're in everybody else no what is that like is this maximum security minimum maximum high security so you're dealing with everybody with the guy so you know Gotti's crew was on the 11th floor I was on the ninth floor the 7th floor you know in MCC and I mean whatever but all the gangbangers were in there that were around that time you know that's some of my good buddies cop impersonators you know you know basically executing I wasn't executing anybody but they were you know they were going in his cops and executing the drug dealers and taking their money so they were going in with lights the whole deal badges coach bulletproof vests 38 Smith & Wesson's and ten people yeah killing people taking their drugs I mean that was the 80s and it's Brooklyn and Manhattan and a Bronx and when when you're in there and you go from solitary to just just general population report you just watch you back every time you step of the way what is that what does that like you know it's like how when I was driving to work wondering if I was getting arrested every day what was the first day like the first day like they let you out now all sudden do you have to share a cell with somebody yeah who's the gum I can't recall you don't know who you shared a cell with that was hundreds hundreds of guys yeah just different guys in transition in an MCC you know if you're in transition you know I ended up sharing a cell with Patsy Conti one time was one of the wise guys you know they try to keep the white guys with the white guys because prison is very racially you know devise divisive uh-huh you know black guys with black guys white guys with white guys that's how it was you know Spanish guys and Spanish guys you know so that's just the way prisoners now do you have to align yourself the particular groups or anything while you're in listen no one's in align themselves with me you know right but happened chance is that when you're an MCC New York it's like sixty percent black guys thirty five percent Hispanic guys two percent Asian and one percent white so I think you're missing some numbers I and so like even if you were a wise guy in the street you saw a white face you know right you talked whether you liked each other or not you know right I understand and you know being I was young and still a little you know not I was pretty good shape at this point now down about a year or so and doing probably push-ups thousand push-ups today chin ups dips back depends a little bit right now I'm least in great shape I'm doing the bar I'm doing 160 pull-ups you know frontwards backwards mm-hmm and people see you moving around they're like okay you know this isn't an easy trip no matter how what do you think of me it was a cop or not it wasn't an easy ride so and then you know all the older wiseguys you know their feeble guys most of them well they finally got arrested most of them little banged up anyway they're 65 70 you know and what happens to those guys when we get in well they align themselves with a young guy does most of their bidding and hopefully you don't have to take a knife for one of them or something like that but look they got money when you got money in prison it's like money in the street you know and when you're in okay so when you go from being in solitary to general population like what are your days like what it well there's different worlds you know MCCA okay you're in jail so you're really just inside a building and and some people have jobs some people don't jobs meaning they go to the kitchen they cook and they provide meals for the rest of the prison I was in like it orderly I have to clean a floor something like that and basically set their way it took it sentenced it was horrible you know you sat inside a building you you know you come and you look like a piece of paper so white you got no Sun you got no vitamin C or D or B and the food's horrible and you can't wait to get sentence to write because you want to go out and live a life now being a sentenced prisoner opposed to a prisoner in waiting and come like like a bride and waiting you finally get out you know so how long is this waiting period I was two years so for two years for nine months solitary and then another year 15 months you're just in this jail waiting to be someplace to be sent so finally get sense in the sense I get sent to I get put on a Learjet was like first class I get really yeah I got taken from MCC New York you know limousine a prison limousine to over to Teterboro Airport with with a federal jet is the Learjet me and like two other people get on this jet we they whisk us off to two people yeah but yeah they whisk us off to Florida the land in Jacksonville we pick up some some girl I don't know and then they whisk us West so this is how they transport prisoners they put them in a federal jet yeah yeah in my case okay cuz I was getting I was leading the the region okay yeah they have a big bus normally right they'll deposit your loan away and then some people get moved around on different sized jets just happen to be a lear which is like a four five passenger jet which was nice what's not but no peanuts remember but she was cute look at she did elba me a little bit you know where's she going I don't know it's a woman's prison in Tallahassee what does she do keep my my world small when you're when you're a guy like me in prison you don't open your mouth you don't talk to anybody you don't illicit a conversation with anybody that had to be really difficult for you very I would imagine horrible it was like pulling my tongue out and throw it on the ground for fuckin 12 years are you just doing this for survival purposes just your own little world because he open yourself up people want either in or to use things against you right you know like in the referee world but in this case that it's a microcosm you know I've come back to you real quick the way people use information against you Wow so so I so I go from there and then I end up in some small county jail which I end up with one of the guys from cocaine cowboy who ends up dying everybody back up of them did but this fellow he is telling me I gotta get the fuck out of here and I'm in the county jail and it's like a piece of barbed wire around this fence and he's telling me there's a guy in a tree treehouse is if I get a treehouse with shotgun that's it a shotgun yeah that's it what's security for this for this little County Jail but only a shotgun yeah you sit up there with how far away is he 60 80 feet from the barbed wire fence oh but the only making 10 12 thousand dollars a year oh so he's saying hmm and he's big my cocaine cowboy guys he's thinking he could have some money sent to this guy's fucking fuck knows all you have to do is give the guy something that puts him out if some chew tobacco god give him a pill that knocks him out I tell him you can give you I'm gonna give you I'm gonna dummy up your drink and I'm gonna jump and no one's gonna know how it happened I mean ever that young but these guys you know they would they were already fighting vanilla when El Chapo when that guy got out and he'd dug that hole a mile long underneath in the pill no but what didn't you respect that I respect look hot the fact that they had the fucking the thought process involved and every day no but I mean still I was like you had to know that I made a fucking mile-long tunnel with the money you've got electric bike when you got that kind of money you get a lot of people getting paid to go he's got a hundred million dollar bounty on Donald Trump Donald Trump talks shit about Mexicans to assassinate our political - but when guys want to get out you know and you all day that's all you think about - they stick out they caught them yeah do they yeah what someone gives you up right Kris think because they want to look good with a better place right like like let's say I mean I end up in Mariana well let me let me tear this okay so we get off the bus and I'm like gonna be fucking horrible I can't do another now at this point another ten and a half years like this welcome to fucking place like this and it's hot it's fucking the middle of the summer like July and panhandle of Florida it's fucking hot it's a hundred I get off the bus and I see this you know this fence and gate and shit and it looks okay you know and they bring you into R&D it's like you're a package they're bringing in R&D they process you they give you you guys see them on TV they got the fucking bags they got their bed roll then dead roll in their hand as their clothes and shit you're walking through this compound and this God opens up God whatever he opens up the port well to this compound and I say to myself strike me dead I just came from a fucking hole in the wall for years my two years I've been looking nothing but cement and polish on the floor and it opens now I see the washing place I probably other than my vacations in the Cayman Islands this was the most picturesque place I've ever seen like up close in person now doesn't matter two years I've been seeing cement so right I mean lush flowers call this beautiful grass beautiful cement gorgeous a big beautiful chapel with my name my name saying comedy you know I have had a good meal in fucking forever and the food was good I'm Seton fucking Hesh where foods gonna be good no matter what what I so I go like this I go to myself this is fucking paradise I swear to God I just finished saying it and the guard goes welcome to paradise whoa great so when he saying welcome to paradise he fucking with you or Z no because he knows where I just came from understand and he knows that this this is nice it's it's a college campus with fences around it right but the inhabitants are not quite you know the average sentence was I think 18 years when I worked in that place and it was 300 and I want to say 40 some odd men that were never going home that I was now gonna bunk with those are the dangerous ones all right you know what to the least dangerous the the one nothing to lose guys not the ones that are doing their time you know why are they the least dangerous well because they just want to live their lives out you know it's the young bucks that you know mmm just want to make a name for themselves and you know they don't see they don't see the 10 years 15 years from now they're going home they just see the same immediate gratification that got them there right so right now I like your sneakers or I like your fucking soup you know I don't have any soup because my parents I mean no my parents you know I mean and so I don't get the extras prisons about extras you know if you get extras in prison you'll survive you know so explain that to me commissary you know okay people live on the commissary in prison because it's like it's like it's part of rebellion no one wants to be beholden to the government for what they're gonna give them so when you go into prison yeah you get good square meal you know the food's okay you know it's cooked for fuckin 1800 men right there's plenty of it's a control mechanism okay food is a control mechanism exercises control mechanism and all the frills of control mechanisms and how do you control population water food sex that they can't have so certain things are control mechanism food and an exercise in prisoners control mechanism so the way to control guys is to provide them with with a good meal you know and you don't lose that good fuckin meal right so he's any good cuz I just came from a place where I was eating should have a place to contain her all day long now I got a plate with a knife and a fork I can eat like a gentleman you know you start to feel like a human being again mm-hmm but a pound the guy next to you is you you know you don't want to take him home necessarily you know so he misses me the guy next to you is not getting the same food no he's getting the same if he wants that right so so that he wants to keep the maintain the status quo so he's down there doing a life sentence he's okay with it because he's accepted it right it's the young guys that you know think that no they want you food or they you know they want to get over the good to get over mentality you have to let go of to get over mentality otherwise you're gonna live that fucking happy life in prison and get over mentality meaning you're always looking to get ahead a little but right scam a little bit easier sell them to this guy a lot of people send money home from prison so it turns into another rat race now when you say the commissary like what do you what can you get at a commissary well one of the big things are stamps so you can use that to barter stamps currency stamps and to an official currency in prison so you could send letters you can send letters so you have to have stamps you can gamble yeah yeah no coming gambling well sports usually sports gambling and then this card's you know then this card so check isn't chess you know people gamble on anything so can you watch games and stuff like that well the unit I stayed in had five or six TVs really in the common area yeah one had the wrap station on one had the basketball all the time and the other one had Spanish TV so then you had CNN once in a while which we saw the 9/11 attack and it will come out looking at me Mike did you see what happened I'm like okay you know they look to you because you were cost it was a difficult fucking moment to say the least yeah so I went through a lot of that stuff in prison so in the commissary you can get extra things extras yes food after food what kind of food I said tuna fish octopus yeah so yeah I'd buy it how much does it cost well if you paid $1 for a can of tuna in the street it was 250 in there like that type of thing you know or whatever the current rate as you paid a little bit more in front and then if you're working in prison you very little money you get very little money so the money from the outside is maintained so guys that go to prison and have outside connections with family that would still help them support themselves become a commodity in prison so you know you you're a hustler in prison so you you would like to take extra eggs and make some egg salad that's a mm-hmm that's what they do if we see a protein they want to stay in shape because they want to go home one day you know and so you learn to adjust your life in order that you have an endgame some kids only care about today you know and they saw them don't go home because they end up getting into fights they are being killed whatever you know and then they get another bid they get on the bed and there you go so is that what you did most I'm down there in Florida five years and plus in Marianna Florida and then I want to get closer to family ready to be able to be least that had not in seven years I'm anticipating release in about three or four years which didn't turn out and I lost a year when I got on a plane which is a legal argument that I made for the next five years and lost but I wanted to hear off down in Marianna Florida for my drug program participation and butthead to a court to get it so when I got on a plane to come back to Devens Massachusetts where I served in a your mass and familiar with that area of Massachusetts at all where's air what's air it's near from the W Fort Devens uh it's it's it's west west of Boston about 45 miles okay washed washed uh Worcester right it's near Worcester me okay anyway so they'd had to open a new federal prison there I want to get closer to my family so I ended up getting on a plane you know you request you make a request right get on a plane they've fulfilled my request I ended up in Devon Massachusetts and when I got off the plane I lost a year of my sentence because I now in a different legal jurisdiction than the legal jurisdiction that I was in in Florida so you have to do an extra year because I got the II put back onto my sense it's like you guys can you just send me back they went no yes I want to be closer to my family so they get to know me as I get released you know I get closer bond family visiting physicist fight whatever I lost my fucking mind and they ended up causing a hunger strike and because yeah I participated for an hour [Laughter] stories crazy so I ended up in in MC seen you up again the place right had just oh no back in the fuckin hole over there in isolation my hunger strike there Oh God and that time they listened to us and they shipped me out to McKinney in Pennsylvania and I did like three years there he just gets tired just going through the shit you know and you live the life out there and you know I don't need any sympathy by the way just it is what it is ya know I'm not giving you any sympathy I'm just think about it what it was like to edit to add a year some one sentence I they actually called for an ambulance after they told me do you want an ambulance I'm like I'm not sure I was going down like right right we used to get the sentence we do in one day why cuz I got off a plane in your fuckin state I hate this fuckin state send me back to Florida you got you got here's the quick news she says to me no hot bitch here's the good news the good news is you got four years to fight us oh of course so much to fight these cocksuckers you have no idea I'm living on stamps and the good will of people send any money and some of the money that I earned in prison you know now are you allowed to make money off of your case now um I did a lot of research might the people I'm involved with and you know unless there's a specific victim that right was specifically out there unless the guy says I stole his kilo you know I don't know what's he gonna do how many kilos you sold or did you know so so it's not like a violent crime like like OJ Simpson can't make money on this yes right but the details are slightly different because you know I was a I would fuck you would call it but you know the people that researched for me said that there isn't the law that some Sam law does not directly affect you yeah it would make sense you'd have to have a specific friend victimized right and then you profit off of that and that's their position right right right they you cost right yeah so this is not that this is some insane executed people right on Island you know right the guy the detectives name is a distant cousin of mine Timothy Dow to arrest oh really yeah they're called the Son of Sam yeah yeah so you know my family's got the legacy on both sides I guess pro/con yeah now what is it like the first day you got out yeah well the first thing I got out no this is this different outs okay you get right you get released to a halfway house so I was in mäkinen Pennsylvania now if I finish my bed and my parents wanted to send a limousine to pick me up and welcome me home like a big shot right but not not in a boisterous way just sister just to show me they love coming up right so I said you know what no I want to take the bus off the Greyhound so I got on a Greyhound bus and I drove the gray home it was a patriotic way hound bus to MCC MCC the bus the bus terminal in Manhattan and my families they waiting for me you know about 10 15 of them were there was it was a nice welcoming but all I can do was say I need a quarter and they're like what do you need a quarter for I said I need a fucking make a phone call I said you can any1 a quarter I got I need it right now I'm panicking because I'm running late and they halfway houses and I'm the rules follow it sometimes I don't wanna go back right I need to notify the half-ass I'm gonna be running late because the bus was late right so all of a sudden people start handing me these things to talk on the phone I go dial it for me I never dialed I don't know what I'm doing right so you'd never seen his cell phone wow that's not true I saw the original cell phones the brick yeah the pricks I was handle of the bricks but now I had no idea did you have one of those things no but my drug dealers did Oh all those they had those like the ones from the Gordon Gecko and Wall Street the wall cords like I'm calling my house from my what are you calling from I go on you do cell phones right now the guys like I said do me a favor race that number when I finish talking so you call the halfway house and now you have to you have to live there which is back in to go I'm not gonna get a living in a halfway house and I'm out about no two three days and the news the news people were out front circling like fuckin you know bees around honey slides on shit they're all over the place and if someone snaps a picture a guy puts in a front page of The Daily News and said ouch still walks like a cop it wasn't me you walk like a cop yeah what the fuck does that mean well you know we know they know what they say in whirling a baton together walking like I owned it Susan gets a half a million I'm still broke really yeah that guy sued and got a half a million dollars walking like a cop yeah well stay put his picture on the front page of all that's it and they and they tarnished his criminal image that said he was a rogue cop what was it it was yeah nuff said people ya know those those tabloid newspapers in New York those are hilarious newspapers the fuckin covers are always very funny Yeah right not when your face is on it for fucking like six months yeah imagine do you save anything else no but yes I didn't want to cap it my property when I landed in a different institution like oh yeah some family members have like everyone I guess but now when you get out and you're in the halfway I want to go calling you have to stay there go back to prison really yeah because the halfway house that bad no because I don't know what to do it so your institutional I'm done yeah I'm I'm cooked this is that's what they always say they're cooked I don't know what to do or how to do I don't how to walk across the street and I'm afraid cuz if I walk across it don't walk sign I'm standing in majesty and in Brooklyn in front of the don't walk sign for like five minutes and there's no fucking cards up standing there waiting for the don't walk so I had to turn so the hand they'd have the handle because you don't wanna do anything wrong right they're following me everywhere I go why I don't want the news people snapping a picture of me what it was against the don't walk sign so the post guy comes up to me and says Mike look I don't acknowledge him but where he goes can you just sign this affidavit for me that you that this is that I'm about to take you a picture of I go on about do your fucking Sharda leave me alone please because the other guy just sued the fucking Daily News that's hilarious that's hilarious I'm taking a shower this is my epic moment my first shower and freedom I talked about this Chris it's epic looking out the window is my brother's two kids I don't know these kids my mother's apartment upstairs my mom's house upstairs looking out the shower has a window I'm looking out I see these two little kids running across my brother's lawn next door my brother's account retired because of me but he got a pension thank God anyways it's not a story played good hockey player that's why you guys pension anyway so I see these two kids and I realized the loss that you know I mean the whole world took place while I walked that track by myself you know right and my brother who idolized me to no end now has two kids and I don't even know mine and now I gotta make a living and the first thing I want to do is help those that I left behind you know it was truly deluded and I'm like I don't think I can do this and I'm in a fucking shower crying so hard and I don't know I'm getting wet from the shower or my tears and like I know if you ever cried in your life I'm a man I can say it you know I've never I don't cry okay I've wept so hard I wept so hard that I wanted to take a nap when I was done it was just like I was like shit just kept pouring out of my body Wow my first shower and freedom was like I was getting all the poison of life because you know you got to realize this is um this time four years old I have nothing zero my whole life is a fucking zero at 44 years old but you still have kids and I don't have anything but you're out I have nothing I don't have kids someone else has kids I happen to be a guy that they heard about I have nothing be easy for me to turn around and go back Wow so do you you really wanted to go back what's it want to you didn't want just the easiest thing to do was to go back thank God that moment I had good parents solid family support and a couple of young kids that wanted to get to know me you know earning a living I never had a fucking job my life I was a cop so what did you do for a job after that because it's got to be hard to get a job I still can't get a job do you want one I need a real podcast network that's right you need to actually have a network yeah we start give giving guys like new shows yeah I couldn't get a fucking job but my brother was doing consume construction and then I mixed up with the construction industry for about four or five years and I did pretty well and that was in the prime time so anybody who could hold the brush in their hand or a hammer in a and got a job and they made a decent salary and I turned down some union office because I have family that runs one of the unions I'm and I turned it down because I needed money now I wanted to try to help now and so I did what I call it and and you know listen I put an ankle bracelet on me when I got home cuz I was banging one of the chicks from the halfway house you're not supposed to do that but you're not supposed to know why not I don't I don't I don't they own you are you free you know because she's a convict - so can't associate with convex eye but you're sleeping in the house with them right you can't fuck him right can you hug him no no patronizing a matron izing or sexualizing any of them oh so it was very difficult I broke the rule from the Navy the first rule so did you get in trouble for that yes break in that role eventually what do they do or less I tried to get rid of her because she was a psycho I found out oh jeez how weird psycho ex-con then Denis makes it make sense and I won't talk to dispersion about the dead by the way she pissed Oh what happened I think I know liver something anyway but horrible horrible death but yeah I had to get away from her so I made a decision to go back to prison just to get away from her really yeah and she threatened to call and she did she called my probation officer and he came and put an ankle bracelet on me he spared me prison he put an ankle brace and then I got to end up again put the ankle bracelet on because like I said I was going to church but I didn't where'd you go I wasn't it was it's on his house right I understand could they would let me leave my house finally I got out so you were under house arrest is that what the yes does it keeps you within within a beacon of the machine yeah fuck so I was willing to go back to prison to get rid of this relationship and I almost did yeah Jesus Christ so that was my entry entry into society so how much time do you have to spend doing this halfway house thing before it's like but what it is you go from halfway house to home confinement and then after home confinement you don't want to supervised release home confinement so you're you can find your home for during the during the hours of the like if you're not working you know you're locked in your house you know yeah yeah so they can call any minute and you can go to the movies yeah but you can ask for permission to go shopping and things of that nature you know and then come back in so you're clocked you checked constantly on your time I don't understand that like why is that if you're free if you're free and if you can go to the movies but you're not free you're not free you're not free yet you're still part of your sentence which is why I said twelve and a half years not eleven years nine months because the last six months of my prison sentence was in the street and then from there to five years of supervised released which is when she called me I broke up I said look you can tell the judge come on she was a love judge judge judge Kimbell would the one who was a little bit of news what happened to her no I me see him again well you have to talk bad no she got jammed up with a relationship she was understand that's what I thought how dare they so then how do you woody what do you eventually wind up doing for for work so I continued on the construction field no continue Oh limousine driving I end up being a limousine driver the job that Kenny actually got me fired from before I went to prison because I got a job done the limousine for one hour but never drove the limo because my lip I don't tell a story I'm about to get a job driving a limousine so Kenny goes wakey-wakey working well he's wearing a wire and go I'm starting driving a limo tomorrow I have some decent pay all the plans about leaving the country or off well you don't know any fucking really knows the depth of this right this is my route and bail so I go look good if I got a job driving a limo make you know six eight hundred week for now I had a lot of money coming in and rental incomes I'm good it had four homes and a condo on the ocean and so he turns around and he says wait wait wait I go where what are you fucking care where he goes well in case I want a job so I go I tell him I don't know what's in the fucking newspapers in Deer Park somewhere born next day I go to start the job I'm on my way yeah I just bought the last 300 hours I bought a suit black suit guy goes I go I'm on my way I says I haven't heard me Fosdick or me tell me what time to be at the shop because we got a problem I know what's the problem he says I got a visit I thought what he goes I got a visit they're gonna open my books and my taxes and leave me a new asshole if I give you a job here I said fuck I just spent my last 300 kids cuz the government takes everything when they get you so now I can't even get a job fucking doing that while out on bail so I would've had the desperado to leave the fucking country so Kenny set that out I don't know allegedly possibly probably I'm sure yeah Wow so wasn't just wearing a wire who's conspiring on go you know fucking looks right he saved someone's life yeah you fucking ruined mine Wow probably saved it no way - yeah I'm not mad I just just just you just keep it real he saved my life and whatnot you know what someone the cops saved my life right they locked me up right Wow I couldn't get a fucking package after that you're sitting on a gold mine oh you are sitting on a gold mine these fucking stories oh it's fucking ridiculous if you just write it if can you write can you type I can do a lot of things you should shoulder hurts though well yeah you keep doing this you doing this no what's going on stinger and you're damaged yeah - vertebrae have you ever been treated right now what are they doing for you I'm doing a thorough physical therapy act I've had some serious spinal shit bulging discs working out yeah you can now you can get rid of that I've got rid of it right now yeah it's a process you just got to do it slow and you know spinal decompression is a big thing to stretch hanging by your neck they have these um things that you can actually set up they're fairly cheap you just set them up on a door they hang off the back of the door like a little chain actually my friend danny has one that he likes even better than that it's inflated actually and you put it on your neck and he's had he's got some spinal issues too and it actually just lifts it it's eat it you pump it up and it kind of like lifts up on your neck and stretches because a lot of it is either injury or bad posture and everything gets compressed and it stays compressed and does that pop out right and what you got to do is relieve some of that compression and one of the ways is these I have this one it's like a harness I strap it under my chin that velcro it in place and then I crank on it click click he pulls my neck click-click pulls why we don't you know you know nervous or afraid you might overdo no it's not you don't fall listen I hate to change this up for a second you're right but I appreciate the the medical advice you know because it's I'm pain but the mic'd out calm people can get my they can download the 7/5 from my website laughs oh my god I might get 25 cents if they do that oh do you get a cut of that be nice I mean I lost my job due to the documentary what job was that I was doing mechanical services in the location that I'm still in flux with them even when did you fucking describing a legit job everything is with problems I lost the position because of my past mm-hmm so if I put their specific I understand no I'm still trying to work something out with them right so they found out about you they knew about it when they hired me but the documentary became so compelling and riveting so interesting and so detailed that you know probably some cop called up and said I don't want my wife working with this guy around right the fucking CEO said find a way to get rid of him yeah Wow listen they're doing your favor I swear to god you're sitting on a fucking goldmine these stories you have and you have I guarantee you probably have a fucking thousand of them all your years in a job easily ten years ten years five months I did in the street yeah you just need to sit down with somebody and write these out and then edit them and make the most compelling ones you could probably have a fucking 500 page book 500 yeah I'm going to cut it down if you cut it down to did the gems and just you know honest about all the fucking craziness and all the weird shit that's going on in your head and the family and the pussy and the drugs and goddamn it's a gold mine I'll fucking buy it I'll buy in a goddamn hurry you know my friend Joey Diaz is a nut for crime books he's turned me on like a fucking hundred crime books he's always like Joe Rogan you gotta read this fucking book you have the kind of time to read because today people don't that's good that's what you get on planes - yeah plane oh that's a good time I just forced myself a couple days a week to force myself to go to bed before I go to bed sit down that's good and that's you know that's what I used to do in the joint I'm ever I've read probably four or five hundred books always you know I try to expand my vocabulary however when you talk to a police terms and you look heavily Narrows back to the to the vocabulary you use well you well you're doing your job yeah but fuck you motherfucker get over you get down right now let me see your fucking hand don't fucking move meanwhile I want you to raise your hands well the audiobooks are great - yeah I love that because I'm always stuck in traffic and especially how do you like the Circosta for their very good very really not fit right I put it down after yeah no let's we're talking yeah I know Todd it's hard to keep it wet it's rude no it was great yeah it was good though it's good cigars good it's very solid cigar yeah yeah yeah so it's funny that's got a nice fucking face the detail is really really cool because it has the street in there you don't see it it has the location of his drug spot in the fucking band on the side by these well that we're working on right now we're putting together you know so there's a big tobacco leather they call it in in Dominican Republic uh-huh who saw the documentary oh that's no I said relationships company he says yeah I said well go tell them what a fuck you are so he went and saw them and they stay sort of documentary and I think they listened to Audis podcast with me or something uh-huh and they went holy fuck yes we

sure we got many more things to talk about as more things come out and you start doing things I'll be happy to help you promote will not be nice anymore than a book comes out fuck yeah all right what do you think that's gonna it's in flux right now you know because the thing is we've gotta see a couple of publishers right now they're a little nervous what the fuck is wrong with I did bad things I don't think I'm not bad of a guy you know what I mean I hope not anyway I've known a lot of bad guys I don't think you're a bad guy no I think it did bad shit like I said I could have done that same shit yeah I think yeah I think people being honest if you're if you're honest about circumstantial situations that you find yourself into and poor decision-making and being young and doing drugs and then also being involved in a heinous crime riddled situation like your environment that you're in you're going to these places these ghettos you're constantly around crime you're constantly around drugs and I gotta imagine like as you detailed in the in the documentary the crime aspect of it slowly sort of started creeping and it catch you and that was young impressionable you know you see a 70 year old kid in a Jaguar with a gooseneck fucking equalizer he's the he's the bomb you know he's got twenty five thirty thousand dollars in his pockets and he's got ropes and diamonds hanging on his neck I'm like what the fuck yeah and what am I doing here right listen it's wrong doesn't seem that wrong sometimes you remember the first piece of crime that you did while you were a cop it's like do you never forget your first pussy it's an object first woman excuse me pardon me people first woman you've had sexual relations another story of a rat right not even her the other chick Doug Lee one remember the whole story no Monica Lewinsky was friends with some old nose the blonde was a different one the last great American dick sling yeah yeah cuz now you're not allowed you're not alone anymore we lost what it meant to be do this wagons laughing at these fucking ideas I don't want to get - haha checkmate you know he gets head and then shoots the hooker off the top of the Kremlin - shoo - get nuclear poisoning drops for these people they have all kinds of things but do you remember like the first crime the one I talk about often what is if you're not doing what you're supposed to do by the book you're on the edge of committing a crime very fucking right every time you even let somebody off when they're supposed to be arresting basically you've committed a crime well because you you used this a discretion in an area where there was no discretion right you know so you know so so but the thing I talk about is when I took the money from the Hispanic kid the Puerto Rican kid yeah what was that situation well he had a mystery my favorite people they're fun the best the best you know they got the Remi they got everything going on the bodegas I love them they they they helped me grow up I learned they're very funny one me the same thing for Ian to them and they ruined me the same time so what happened was this is vet driving down together when you see a vet in the ghetto you're gonna notice it right I mean look at me I put a little turn spotless I gotta be noticed but so this kid's got this vet and I pull him over and he's got nothing I mean nothing no license plates no insurance I mean no plates on the fucking car just driving it so but I noticed he had a thick wad of hundreds in his the fanny pack back then you know I still wear one until you say back then see that father's back yours is dual I started wearing one again not too long ago I wear one I'm married yeah you don't need to get laid you Hennig nap i get headaches one I wouldn't want to so I pull a guy I respect I pulled a guy over and he goes nothing he's got Benjamin's and Franklin's in his fucking back right so I decided that he could buy us a nice lobster lunch cuz you know everybody eats Lobster for lunch right I said so you know lobster lunch kid you know he goes yeah yeah yeah I said and leave it on the back seat now what you handed me nothing right right I'm scared right I don't see the first thing yeah it's the first thing so that's right so you leave a couple bucks on the fucking backseat I don't know if it was a hundred two hundred there's no back seat in the Corvette yeah but this was a back seat of the police call that I had oh I see oh he was in the car under arrest okay okay you have a nice day I don't ever want to see you again you hear me there's

Academy the same day okay now just think about that that's the size of the six largest Police Department in the country and now we hit the street like a bunch of fucking cockroaches go go on everywhere right and we don't know what the fuck we're doing this the last thing I copped knows what he's doing when he's nothing there's no clue okay well you know it's like an accountant who

down two plots make a left right just so you tell people so my father was Mike it's straight ahead I know oh yeah go straight ahead up there sir on your right and then you look up you see you see the spire the top of the Empire State Building right there so anyway that was my first day you know being a competent I was right right now you're I am one now I realize the magnitude its uniform you got on people come to you right what did you be serious what did you see in the enchanting Trinity training in training miss Pierce the Academy kind of bright bunch of shit so in training uh now ather six months in the street by myself no one wants because Christa training the other rookies first I was in the second tier of training so now I'm learning the street a little bit you know I'm learning how to get a doughnut because they give cops free food sometimes some places do some places didn't back then and if they didn't if they didn't you didn't go back so I thought everybody did well you would think it's not a crime but it is so you kids are crimes and fucking crime y-yeah so that's what I'm saying so that's what I'm saying wait a minute wait a minute it's a crime fucking car free meal it's a crime that's wrong yeah that's wrong that's fuck you could give you construction worker a free fucking meal what about a fireman you give a fireman for Same Same Same that's a crime right whoa but they cook for themselves nice they they cook a nice meal and if I ask what should I end up going to them quite a bit but anyway so so now I'm committing crimes now well out you were wandering around trying to get doughnuts right I'm getting doughnuts and that's it you know I'm like running to like radio calls so you give us see like cops running in uniform that you know it's like a little silly because you're walking the beat cuz you're welcome to beat you know right but you're a rookie 10:54 which is an 8 in case you know someone's got you know hernia whatever you know where location you know what the fucking is he's not running you know you four blocks ladies see the patrol car sitting there and then like kid you don't fucking run to these things that's what I think of patrol calls for standing on Queens Boulevard 80 mile an hour wind blowing my skirt up all day long I want to see something you waiting to see some action right so anyway this goes on for six months so finally my first tour in a car I get with these two veteran detectives were 22 years on the job each and said the precinct that I was in had just finished their scandal in the newspaper it's called the 110 sergeants Club my neighbor actually wasn't involved in him with the jail anyway so you get right to the meat of it so he says to me this d'être me cause you know the last guy I don't don't ask me how this conversation started he was the last guy that's connected with the scandal he fell over a railing on the fifth floor during a Christmas party in the snow and he died I said what do you mean they go what it is this he was wrecked he told on the cops in the 110th precinct and he fell over the top of the railing I said how do you fall over the top of the fucking railing right you've been it's a four foot brought iron railing how do you go over the top of it right he just did he just managed yeah so he did he I don't know if they considered his suicide or accidental death but it was not a homicide so they told me that's what happens when you turn another cop so I said okay I'm on the job now a little less than a year six months in the Academy six months chasing people around I didn't know what I was doing eating doughnuts and now I'm being told by veteran cops that that's what happens if you tell on a cop that they murder people well that things can happen right mysterious you can mysteriously get injured doesn't seem that mysterious how old do you know 48 okay pretty mysterious I was scared ask what happened to right okay I'm good but I think I put the dots together yes don't tell on a cop right so right away you're like okay well this is that's done it was in a week or two I see him robbing fucking cocaine from spots I was same guys same crew not the same right so you're saying right away it was it was in Corona Elmhurst Jackson Heights which is called a cocaine capital of New York actually the world at the time was more than Miami because it was where the we called little Colombia with all the all the major Colombian cartels were shipping their cocaine to Jackson Heights in Corona and we're being shipped out around the whole metropolitan area from there it was huge because they had the airports there they're fucking Kennedy and LaGuardia they ran them you know they're in all the fucking transportation and out of those locations so they would get jobs or get people that would get jobs doing that and finally baggage handlers fucking like a free-for-all Wow so I'm working in this low-profile precinct but that's what really was going on in there right so you're right so you're see what's going on right away right you're being indoctrinated like almost instantaneously you've seen a lot of things that don't add up right and now I leave there and I go to the ghetto I'm like okay I really should have stayed in fucking school because this doesn't look right I got tears in my eyes I got Elvis in the ghetto playing on my God strike me dead I'm driving down Sutter Avenue I just got graduated from fucking Queens to the East New York and there comes in the ghetto mr. song in the ghetto and the young and a mama cries and I got fucking tears in my eyes oh my god I should have stayed in school you just hatin that your choice you just talk scared scared how long was it for you for so your first dead body I had already seen that but cuz that guy actually fell from a roof you solve it I've seen plenty of dead bodies probably half a dozen at that point but so you actually saw the guy who fell from the roof no no I saw a guy that fell from roof though I know what happened oh it did yeah yeah yeah head gets egg-shaped um yeah so he's committed suicide Oh anyway that was my one of my first days but soon a in the ghetto and you're there and you're scared and you're saying I got a sink or swim you know it's it's time didn't sink you got to swim and I had a choice to make so I learned to swim quick and I was probably in the precinct you know a day I saw my first murder and then but by day yeah but I wasn't it wasn't my case so I really didn't handle it a couple of stabbings and then my first midnight ship Jesus gets shot Jesus gets shot my first midnight shift Jesus hey hey soos what happened to him the story goes like this I'm working with my buddy Sal nice guy he's a little older than me the more mature he's really ready for this action but he's not an active guy so he just wants to he wants to do a shift and go home great but I'm not a monk I want to be a compliment please work two guys will put a crow bar down the street or a tire iron down the street it's 1:00 1:00 o'clock and one two o'clock in the morning I'm like salad that looks a little suspicious was what I thought fucking guy's got a tire iron his hair a little suspicious what do you think Mike do you really want to get involved I know that's supposed to deal with police supposed to ask some questions and that guy's got a tire on it's 2:00 in the morning what do you think all right so I'd make a u-turn go to wrong way on Fulton Street right by Cleveland one of those streets Cleveland Fulton and we're going back to check up on these guys that we just we drove past and he'll going back and all of a sudden we pull up in this fucking scene in the middle of the street guys got a hole in his head he's laying on the ground obviously dead already and I see a tire iron sitting right here like this right but he's here and tire irons over here about 15 feet away and I go what happened they go these two guys I said the tire iron they go yeah the tire irons right there it was them with the tire iron they ran so they shot this kid Jesus he probably went out and confronted them and said what are you guys doing in a neighborhood with a tire iron you know if to stealing cars stealing cars tires and hubs whatever they could get right so he confronted them they shot and killed him and they took off in the wind so I go to Sal I go you know not for nothing Laird you didn't I'm glad we didn't stop him first but Jesus did so that was my first actual shooting that I was deed what they call the first responding officer on the scene up I was there about probably a week and a half Wow so I see my first murder in a week and a half and this is before the crack this is before the crack so this is just straight this is straight violent violence you know Harvey let's let's just kill this guy cuz he confronted me what's crazy the idea that the poverty and the guns already feel the amazing thing was that it probably could have been us what they would have ran most people try not to shoot it out with the police but he just put right and then I wouldn't have all this shit to talk about or who knows yeah she's amazing that the crack came along and accelerated what was already fucked up yeah you know I don't know what to say it was just it was amazing I'd say the one thing that was interesting that during the correct thing we took the cocaine from the Panamanian government in the Dion pattern in the army was involved bringing a lot of cocaine with Noriega through the into our country so back then with the Kangol hats well the can go has they were getting robbed from people so there's one kids are stealing candy killing each other for the for tripled fat goose right the triple fat goes to Nike is and and and and the can glance so this kid Rob's his guy for his Kangol I had someone calls 911 robbery suspect he runs into a home overrun I think it was being sickling on one of those streets up there right off Atlantic Avenue and he had been up on the guy kept the kid came off the subway when the kids stand there waiting for him stole his can go at gunpoint and ran into his own home so we knocked on the door where the kid lives he won't open the fucking door the kids show up I had open the door for you so he goes back upstairs in hi it's the kid that was a two-family home the people downstairs open the doors to a common hallway because they see the police they don't wanna fucking out they didn't know they open the door they go upstairs place has the shoes the fucking beads separate in each room you see the beads that separate the rooms why the people make noise when they go through the room no it's sort of like you're supposed to know that this is two different rooms when they hang the beads okay that's like this is a door but it's really not you know right so this is how it was that's the ghetto is you know just all the hang of curtain mm-hmm two different rooms so we get inside to see all the shoes and all the money that's meant in this place it sums up so we grabbed a kid the kid downstairs says that's him we can't find a gun so we ended up going downstairs in the basement that's when you see me in the movie talk about the story where we found this fucking called a suitcase a wooden suitcase it was fucking like it was like two inch ply almost that's how thick the suitcase was wrapped in leather I couldn't get it open the domination there's no one standing with the gate so finally one of my my partner comes up with a hacksaw I just bought hacksaw in this fucking thing open the police right there's police all around this is an armed robbery suspect so there's a half a dozen cops milling in and out of the place I killed my buddy watch the watch the staircase goes down in the basement right I cut this thing open the fucking cocaine comes flying out and smells like that bubblegum shit delicious so I'm like holy shit we hit pay dirt I'm trying to get the shit out and he goes my point was they're coming they're coming like who he goes the owner I go no fuck never mind the police the owner of the coke is coming Oh what do we do can't well come up with stealing his coke you know right the worst position I finally I'm working out my I'm like I put 50 12 pounds on I'm trying to get the smoke out of his house and he's looking at me like I stole something from him I feel guilty and I go set your stuff Eagles okay so I get the patrol car we got a bodega we weigh it on a fucking scale how much it was like like that was on a half of cocaine is a lot of money right at that point yeah it was it was like we got 28,000 three we got 28,000 for it so I bought a condo with that's when I bought the condo at least you were investing that's actually smart yeah it's very smart it's a lot of a moon you said yet four houses at a condom like that's actually for a guy doing blow Robyn I wasn't doing blow at this time at the time just selling it but no stealing it and then yeah I mean you were selling it anytime you transfer cocaine by the way if you give me a half of April right now you've sold it really well you take some yeah just remember that now I know something you don't have to give money for it Wow Sony tell us joy it is handles hands out fucking pot candies everywhere he goes so you this was like one of the first really big ones that you were involved with it was an exciting one to say the least I left there I went out into South Carolina and bought a condo on the ocean so you would kind of like but was I went back to the location mm-hmm to get more because there was a lot more in there but when I got there there was a fucking limousine out front I swear to Christ there's a limousine out front with two guys one stain on each side with their full length trench coats on I like to stand me like this and looking right at us like what are you gonna do and I went let's get the fuck out of here and I'm not this is no this is noyoke it was like okay I'm the police and I'm scared to death right now gotta go see Jesus Christ and how long did I end up in the joint with Noriega that's all you were in the same place as nor yes did you see him no he was in they gave him a his own house is he still alive I think so the game his own house he had who's like the this little little they gave him a little house yeah something going on with him Oh me know him does the government have a little something going on with him like any come on give him some pussy he hasn't said anything I think well you always hope that I mean or you always hear that runs protection program you get you get pussy yeah but I know from guys that were that got kicked out of it and they get pussy while they're in the program they bring in they well they they bring in to a hotel to meet their family just for you a reunion oh well that's your family though but I mean like Noriega the royal family they got him in a warehouse somewhere I would imagine he got his own little spot in this and I'm like if you go there it's all fucking plush carpet fucking beautiful TV the story that everybody dreams of wow you had don't bid you know that's what everybody dreams of is like that Goodfellas scenario yeah it's not see the movie where they're cooking steaks don't kid yourself really yeah absolutely and their mistake you really get steak enjoy and if you know are the right people well what else can you get when you're in there can you get girls you have to pay the gods but it's real but it happens to god you banging female gods but yeah I hear right that was that shuts tape that was that stain in Fez a little more classy you gotta send money to their private account oh really but you can it all can be how anything can happen if you have the right number right well how much you got to pay a guard get some pussy I think the going rate was 500 but I'm not 500 bucks so you pay them 500 bucks and you can get laid you don't hand it to them you have it right that seems like it would be worth I mean I would have doubled that if they have to certain amount of time it seems like a really good deal in the country they weren't like city girls so but female guards would oftentimes mix it up with some person if I have to go back in fucking prison okay this is not a good thing for me to say so well you're not going to find ways why would you we finally have ways keep my nose clean yeah keep nose clean but that was what happened in upstate New York right those guys they got our relationship it's a difficult position to be in you're a woman getting attention by man who most of them pretty good shape sweet-talk you and you know you have to fight your husband that day and now you know you're vulnerable like anything else mm-hmm that's I think Tupac's got a song about that doesn't mean when I get free yeah that's a just hand you a piece of paper there sounds given you know what I made thirty eight thousand dollars with phone sex in prison did you really why would you not talk about that is it illegal no it's just I'm over it wait you make clean sex for like calling out like gay guys would call you up no no no they don't call you you crawl out all right I don't have I didn't have a hotline in the prison now I had had a following enough people that you know so you had a woman that sent me books on dominatrix stuff you know she wanted me to dominate her but master/slave books story of all right guys you guys might be too old for that but it's not not old enough story of always like an incredible book about a woman I'd like to be sort of manipulated and whatnot and some kind of ways and so this woman same context woman says a bunch of books related to that and then I would have phone sex with her on the phone and of course you know and she would give you money yeah I mean Wow so a girl would pay you for phone sex yeah that's pretty good yeah they called they called it cell phones but back then like that's pretty rare though isn't it that like a woman would pay a guy for that like they always say that men who are in jail for like murder and cementum yeah yeah mostly women people are lonely you know mm-hmm even people in the free in the free world are lonely they need affection from anybody and you know it wasn't really done in the ability of way right because I needed attention and affection to happened that she wanted me to do this the guard would fight to get my ghost a word we'll be listening cause heavy conversation in prisons I'd booked on the compound they'd be looking at me like okay when are you going on tonight yeah so you would like like going on like it was a performance yeah like like ice now I got on the phone I was sweating on the other end I don't know and they were listing the guards were listening yeah that's fucking hilarious so he got mad at me they just made me make me send the money home you know you got too much money in your account you gotta send it all the guards would make you send the money home because you can't have too much money in your account while you're incarcerated because then you could control people in the prison uh-huh how much can you keep in your account I don't know they made I had 16,000 in there they said whoa whoa you got a fuckin sense um home and it's often this one lady yeah did you have other people that you were doing this phone sex is not she with my memo because she wasn't mean she was the Peggy how much did you make her pay her I didn't make up there was no salary no I wasn't it she just rescinded donations she had an escort business shouldn't escort business Shannon escort business in Orlando she ends up getting arrested for it while I'm on the phone with her having sex she gets arrested like they broke into her house yeah oh why why why why why so what right there's no other shit to recipe before the fact is that she ends up going to trial she ends up going to trial and winning well it's a great story for her you know yeah but my fucking donation stop Wow that's crazy that it was interesting yeah I would say so yeah we have you have a life we all live a life we all do things and as it turns out you know you can write books and movies about everybody's life everybody has listened to me right now your life is way more fucked up very interesting but a lot of fucked up things are interesting yeah but your your story I mean like you say everybody's got an interesting like you write a book about everybody like no no listen you let her book about you know Jamie's life be boring as fuck he's a great guy don't get me wrong I'm just saying no no Coke no no phone sex business no murders he's never seen a dead body I don't think no see everybody's got you know tail yeah see you've you've seen some shit you just don't think you seeing some shit you know did you take things for granted you know I'm sure he lived a life I lived and even though like I'm lucky to be alive you know in many ways you just you know like you can you we haven't even discussed police work here because really yeah well the reason is because to me it was a normal day you know I handled 28 day jobs average a day so and then backed up on another 28 so the reality is you know fucked up things I was involved in I mean I don't tell you this till I tell you story all right you're gonna I hope you guys enjoy this one this isn't entertaining enough about it myself and you know what when I left don't take it the wrong way because it's just crazy you know I don't mean to demean and or anyone so I'm getting ready to go to the

that you went through all this and you're still alive and he's still healthy in I am very lucky and blessed yeah yeah I mean you you've lived I mean to say you've a colorful life can tired you'd have to be fucking Jesus Christ enough shell is the fuck just telling these stories carrying weights your whole life on coke on these sticks you spin those abilities fuckin Christ it's a crazy story and and I'm sure you have a million crazy stories like that's that's an easy one that was an easy one to tell you know yeah that's a four-minute one yeah yeah I just couldn't imagine I really do hope that this does become a book well I'd like to share the stories cuz they were interesting and funny you know yeah and you know a lot of people like to not they don't want to give the recognition to that this is what life is people live a life and and you have to share your story for people you really do you know I like to talk so well in little of the time it's like you you were alive during the perfect time or all this happened and crap about it right the crack noticed that like you started out before the crack era the crack era happened while you were in destroyed a large community of people and people that weren't even part of the community got destroyed because of it and think about how much like wood how much of it would be different today because of cellphones because of the internet I mean there's just you know we can bring it this conversation that direction it wouldn't be the way it was there's no way and that's why I like I talk about this often I think that you really you know you have to get with it you have to you have to move along the melis society has to move along you know I listen I tell a story in the movie gonna cop gets shot right I end up taking him to the hospital and I didn't deserve to feel his pain and that's that's a really hard thing for a guy who was a cop I didn't deserve to feel what happened to him and his family and really when you're a cop you don't want to ever feel that way I mean did you feel like you were a cop dude when I was middle of it all you know what I always felt like a compa I just always thought I can come back and be a cop see you always thought like eventually I'm gonna let this stuff go grow up Wow just never got a chance this my luck we don't hold up so much you know you know it's it's guy it's a fucking crazy life man it's not it's not a good life you know and the fact that we pay we're saying that you know I could sit on something pile of gold or whatever I love to hear that he wants to you know that is just a cute earn something bad into something good is a good thing but it was fucking hell and still you know I mean sometimes I can't even go up to a cop today and say hey you're doing a mic down you can do that to any cop and I said Joe nice to meet ya I love you I do that I'm like you know they really want to say hello to me or I want to just come out to be a previews I did or screenings and said you're a fucking lowlife piece of shit go fuck yourself yeah yeah I probably could squash him like a bug but that's not the point you know no it's true fucking squash you you couldn't be after cop I was money when I did my job well you couldn't be helped by what I was but you know the problem was I dabbled on both sides at the same time that's why in the movie they said what were you a cop or a gangster both you know yeah there's that scene where the one cop sees you coming out and he says he looks at you then he goes and I don't see cop I see perp right right well he's a douche big big they don't like him why is that no one likes him internal affairs doesn't like him really yeah I'm working with internal phase right now by the way you're working with them yeah I didn't tell us about no no no I'm training them I'm training we're in the midst of finishing of a training video for bosses cops and and recruits three different videos Wow well that makes sense that seems like something that you really be able to help yeah I I think I could a night you know I I put a little lot of these films are so dry and boring and I give it a little character to the fucking training session you know listen I met two beautiful women I'm being honest sincere they told I spoke I'm gonna one was the chief of internal affairs and almost a lieutenant and turn off his both smoking hot yeah and for real and they would have me in a minute you know if they just sent them in I would have been caught in 1987 but anyway these two girls women and they they fucking just they knew they knew that their Internal Affairs Division needed something that was afterward poignant or riveting mm-hmm and they said we need you can you help us they need some character they need some character yeah people don't pay attention to information but once it's distributed in an entertaining way there's a big difference between just flat boring dry information or information it's got some some flavor to it right so I did something with them and in fact in fact I spoke to him last week briefly I told him you know some of the things I was doing there was sort of acting jealous I said jealous you got a fucking pension don't be jealous okay I'm selling my soul right now just to make ends meet you know and they they get a pension and retirement system they're gonna be fine you know but interesting conversation with them and so they're looking to to do something with that and have me back and speak before academy class or you know I don't know about the precincts the guys might not open their arms to me the way the rookies are forced to you know well and then and then I'm doing some colleges right now that's great - yeah that sounds humanities classes some ethical classes for the law students and criminal justice department's one of the one of the police departments is actually reached out to me in the south I don't want to put their name out there just because you decide not to but they have like 750 officers they want me to come and actually it's a great idea it makes a lot of sense that's a very smart idea you know look what I did was horrific you know I've used the position to trust I did my time now I hope I can help people avoid guys that can do what I did and it will pick up pick up on it and and maybe how to stop before like this maybe guy has the characteristics of a guy that could go that way you know this is not an innocent happening this thing's just didn't happen for because I was like greedy which which is definitely part of the reason it happened happen because have a bunch of political things were put in place back in the 80s we started promoting people based on based on their the color of their skin or their ethnicity rather than on the promotional ratings passing tests and it was very very device if the police department became divided and we all became our own actors and it was it was a difficult time for the police department and what you got from it was a lot of internal strife cool we hated the job but we loved being cops mmm so it was very difficult the guys that love being cops that were true to the job they became good cops and got their pensions the guys like myself who turned into me they began to rebelled I mean they're telling you not to make arrests you know they're telling you not to do this and your boss failed three tests and you passed you didn't feed and pay him either but you know so you both should be the same ground now he's your boss or she's your boss so it was a very very political upturning upheaval within the police department itself when this ripe time in the crack era hit all at the same time yeah it's like a perfect storm it was a perfect storm the whole thing and they didn't want another fucking scandal like they had in the 7/7 precinct right which people aren't aware of unless they know the police department history Mike we just did three hours fuck that was it that's three hours just make sure we talk about the Mike down calm yes the Mike down calm and that's where people should buy the documentary the 75 and do buy the documentary cuz it is fucking five stars thank you it's outstanding it was well done it was very very well done and it's it's compelling and so are you man thank you very much brother I'm very happy you're gonna do this again okay thanks all right fuckers see you soon [Music] [Music]
