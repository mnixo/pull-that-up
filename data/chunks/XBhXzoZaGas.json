the jello can experience and also it's like try getting really high on a really good weed and start thinking about those fucking drones zooming around Afghanistan and blast and missiles and kids and it's like you'll really start getting a clearer understanding of how fucked up that is you know no matter what even let's say even those drone attacks we had to do them it's still fucked up it still creates more of a sensitivity towards people getting their limbs blown off of their bodies in the pursuit of some ridiculous war and that kind of you know that's hitting the military industrial complex it's hitting the pharmaceutical companies because if you start getting high you're gonna start experiencing a better level of happiness it's gonna make you start dealing with your bullshit or maybe it'll make you depress because you're lazy but either way it won't allow you to like sink into the kind of sedated hypnosis that it seems like that works really fucking well for Applebee's you know it works really well for the corporations for people to be in a sedated hypnotic state where they can really make sense of going down to a shopping mall and buy and like eating at a fucking I don't know chicken place with their with their kids and then going up and buying some shit at a shoe store and then spending their day just consuming shit they don't really need and then going home and sitting back to watch TV with more advertisements and not thinking that's weird and falling asleep in that kind of depressed slumber that is really hard to do if you're high if you're really high it's really hard to watch normal TV and not be like this is horrible look at these advertisements are you kidding they think that they're that's gonna work on me oh my god forty-eight thousand dollars for a fucking car you're gonna pay for that's like over a year's wage for some people you're gonna make sense of buying a brand-new car payments of two hundred and eighty-five dollars a month when you for like four grand you can go buy a fucking car get it fixed up through the year and have like a shitload extra money and not being debt that's what pot makes you think if you're not you know but if you're like Runk and you're fucking scratching your balls and watching the game and a fucking the new lexus you'll start thinking like well my credit score went up this year I think I'm not being able to take out a loan from the bank and get a new Lexus even though you're fucking broke and living in hell and it's gonna just create this weight on your budget that's gonna make you miserable dude I don't mean to go on a long rant but did I ever tell you the time a friend of mine picked me up in his fucking Mercedes and took me to his apartment never tell you this no he had a brand new Mercedes and I know this guy knew what his job was pick me up in his and I knew he couldn't afford a Mercedes picks me up in his brand-new Mercedes and he's like hey I gotta stop by my apartment come inside for a second go into his apartment it is the size of a fucking closet it is the smallest apartment I've ever seen in my life like barely could be like he had to like kind of like almost like walk sideways against the wall to get around the bed to get to the bathroom it's like a New York style just shitbox meanwhile that guy's car payments have got to be like 550 600 a month I mean this is a nice fucking Mercedes and in his mind he had like his logic behind it was like yeah it's better to have like a really nice car than like a comfortable living situation I talked about that he's like a deal one last thing that guy is a tramp demon his white goods he's a tramp demon cuz tramp see that Mercedes and they're like let's go back to your apartment cuz they think he's rich and then they get in this tiny little fuckin shitty closet see they probably has some rap about that they're making my new place they're fixing up town I'm staying here for a little while oh yeah yeah fuckin said the look on those tramps face when they walk in that door and realize that they there's barely room to stand there's like two feet of carpet between the door and the bed there's a lot of people who believe in those really small sustainable houses you know that people are making these like really really little houses and you like move things out for the kitchen and move things out in the bed is like a live scene area and you know and yeah like it's it's like a whole trend on the Internet there's a lot of that's cool I don't think there's anything wrong about living simply it's just hilarious when people throw themselves into hellish debt for a symbol yeah and and and well it's not just that honestly it's you you enjoy the fuck out of a nice car shouldn't get an Mercedes you can't believe you're allowed to drive this thing you everywhere you go people look at you like you must be special looking at me is getting into that Mercedes oh my god for a lot of people that is a tangible benefit of having a car like that they like this now you could say it's shallow all day but men driving one of those things is beautiful it's a amazing piece of engineering and as a gearhead you know I'm sort of a minor league period because I don't know exactly how all of it works yeah but like Adam Carolla is like a legit gear and he can like build cars I just like buy them from people who know how to build them and appreciate the fuck out of them I think they're interesting but the driving one you drive like a really well engineered piece of it's amazing no I man I I had shit shit loads of money I would buy a nice car and I wouldn't feel weird about it cuz anything to like to dull the fucking existential horror that comes over me on the 101 and traffic that's beautiful I understand when those commercials you know they're they're not just appealing to rich people they're they're they're manipulating idiots render somehow convincing them that they're logically make sense to get in debt to a bank for 50 grand it's not just idiots it's people that are not happy that's what they're offering you happiness see most people throughout their day they have a job that can occasionally be interesting but they would never fucking do for free and whether they're good at or not they take some sense of pride in their work they get through their day but they're fucking tired man and people are unsatisfied they feel like they work so fucking hard they put so much in and what am I getting I'm just existing this is what I'm doing I'm existing so what do they do they get fucking shit they buy a new bowling ball they get a new heart they get a new Lexus and you know what for them you know for some of those you say it's sad but for some of those guys that are stuck in that life no matter what they do that might prevent that might give them like a a bit more happiness driving you know yeah but that's plastic a nice new Mustang on the label it's like eating classic fucking fruit I mean really the ideas get underneath that don't start you're starting at the top start way deep start down deep and then worry about the fucking Mercedes yes for you yes for you for you for a guy who thinks but for someone who's just locked into the life of a drone and accepts it nice little red Mercedes look at that yeah look at that look how Bob's face he's so happy he gets into his red Mercedes I don't know the girls hey girls yeah I know five Mercedes but I guess ladies you know like I get myself in debt always have been I did the same shit I don't buy Mercedes or go to that crazy but my shit was always like I grew up super poor and then now I have credits so now I could buy things and Duke like the most of my life was like hand-me-down shit or you know like shitty toys or you know just not like you want you live in the neighborhood with a bunch of kids to get anything they wanted growing up I can oh I don't know if you see these kids and you're like wow you got Voltron how'd you get Voltron that's just like $80 you know and then now you're an adult you're kind of over like you feel like I deserve this cuz I didn't have that stuff growing up I want what I want you know like like these kids always had growing give me any fun like objects of to soothe them give me a big computer monitor and fucking World of Warcraft and some medicinal marijuana and that's all I need and that cost thirteen ninety-nine a month [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
