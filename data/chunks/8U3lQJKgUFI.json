Tarantino owns called the new Beverly and they show grindhouse flicks twice a month and last night they were showing a anti-drug grindhouse flick called like the acid strip or something what exactly is grindhouse mean I don't know I was out I was shocked I want to google that but I don't know yeah I was wondered when I saw that when I saw he was doing those movies the one with was a pretty girl

thing you've ever seen like the way they try to do like they were trying to do the anti-drug message in the 60s and bud cort plays this kind of rampaging hippie weirdo oh here's the here's the definition a grindhouse is an American term for a theater that mainly shows exploitation films it's named after the defunct burlesque theaters located on 42nd Street in New York City where a bump and grind dancing and striptease were featured wow that's crazy so that was that's the old 42nd Street that's back when New York City like had like a really fucked-up area yeah do you remember what it was like here did you ever go to New York City when it was crazy no way I've heard about it but I never went there I was a bit I was there many times when it was when it was still dangerous it was really interesting that 42nd Street was a completely different place it was this they decided they made like this active decision to clean that fucking place up and take out all the bullshit and make it like super like fan friendly and super you know visitor friendly yeah so what it used to be was like one dirty little striptease and Peep Show and xxx movie and it was fucking creepy people creepy people hanging out like you're like let's Google old photos of time it's like taxi driver it's like the movie taxi driver that's where it's yeah yeah yeah now that I remember that I remember it was like I came to New York a couple times when I was in my teenage years and I remember being there wandering around called what a fucking crazy place this is man yeah I had family in New Jersey and they had they've taken me to Manhattan a few times when I was young I remember like man I barely remember when I was like a little kid barely remember but I remember like feeling dude so dangerous like it's so big and crazy I was Dana it is dangerous but I remember when I was like in my teenage years is when I saw like the peep shows and all that shit I saw those that's we we came there for a karate tournament there was a big karate tournament these two do it mess square garden every year so we came in me and a bunch of fucking soft dorks from Boston you know Newton even where I was from the suburbs of Boston to go to this crazy fucking City like we were essentially living in Mayberry compared to Larry York City shouldn't have your own problems with like socially with people everywhere but where I where I grew up like I went to Newton South High School's like for the women nice house high schools ever you know you're always going to have problems with human beings whenever you get 17 year olds and you mix them all together there's gonna be platters but like this is like very few fights in school very few like no one got really seriously injured you know there was like a few squabbles and people got upset with people but other than that it was a nice place to live I didn't realize how easy I had it till you're you're in Manhattan now you know and you're like 17 years old and you're like in time scoring on what the fuck is this place yeah like this place is crazy it's just one person after another who wants to fuck you and give you some new disease like one of just people looking at fuck people people have jerk-off and people looking to go sit and watch someone play with their asshole in front of you where you be but while you beat off in a booth and then someone cleans that like that was Time Square ah no one cleans it there they did clean it then we go in there with a mop man they would go in there with a mop and they'd look at you like you fucker I told you when in San Francisco I went to one of those places in I accident like I've never been to the place where like the thing goes up and you're in like this room and there's just a bunch of people behind this glass like fingering themselves and stuff and accidentally put my hand on the side I go take a little sweat that is not good and like the guy was like as I go I think I just put my hand and come and go so no we clean those things every in between every person and then I just watch people go in and out and I think you know you know I'm watching people you put your hand in shit yeah it's just so don't worry about it man if you had to choose between a guy punching you in the head or jizzing on your face what would you pick punching in the head I would take the jizz in the face all day you know why would you do Tonka you know why because I'll tell you why because a I've been punched in the face and it's not fun and B I've accidentally come in my face and it was not that bad oh it was delicious it was no no wasn't delicious but it wasn't nothing that hurt you know it was pretty pretty pain free it was warm you know when I was like 16 I was a you know I was completely retarded course I was using the pullout method might also teenage girlfriend we didn't know what the fuck word yeah we're idiots we shouldn't have been alone together so I would pull out and one time I pulled out and I shot it so far and hit me in the face like I was like looking down at it as I pulled it out I guess I wanted to see how much came out and it hit me right in the mug splat more I was like wow so that's what it feels like was kind of exciting put yourself yourself in this girl's position feels like why do we want a hot load in the face it's hot you know represents represents the man's passion on your face ah not that I want it from anyone other than me doesn't sound like it at all no it only happened once there's other things that only happened once that I'm shocked with one of them is beating off in the car I've only beat off in the car once in my entire driving yeah one time when I was living in Boston I was working for a limo company and I was driving home it was a long ride and I was horny so I just beat off it was like something to do and I just squirted a load inside my shirt tucked it back of my pants yeah and then you know I remember doing it and everything and well all right so here's some new fucked up thing I do now because I figured I would just keep doing that now I've never jerked off in the car before and being like 20 years old or whatever I was at the time I was like what an idiot did you really just start jerking off in the car because that's what you gonna start doing all the time now dummy and I didn't for whatever reason I never did it again like what do you mean like that would become your fetish like jerk yeah I figured if I found one other place where I was comfortable jerking off that's not a good thing you know they make jerked off at work before God imagine the world where jerking off was just normal and like he just like you know in line people are jerking off one time I jerked off it worked twice because I had this really hot date that night and I jerked I was doing construction I was a spaceman I would we were building this house and I would just open the door beat off onto the dr and then go back to work and I did it twice that's how fucked up I was and then when I went on the date that night with the girl I was like barely into it and I was like I'd wanted to fuck this girl for so long and we finally like ran into each other somewhere and I was like holy shit she was so down but I was like barely hard it was so sad I had a complete three-quarters erection you fucked out and she was the first girl that wanted to put her finger in my ass I was like you never forget that lady she goes I know what you want this is what she said she goes I know what you want we were both like 17 or something like that I I go what it what do I want she goes you want me to stick my finger in your ass I was like whoa what the how wrong are you yeah like that you couldn't be wrong yeah that's more like what you want but automatically I want I didn't want a griller you know cuz that's kind of rude to do a girl you're dating you know but you don't want to go how many dudes who you stuck your finger up their ass because if you just offer that up like the first time we hook up I just offer up a finger pants and you're only 17 I think maybe like maybe I was 18 she was 17 or 19 and 18 one of the in that range you know right after high school around there it's like she's already done this how many times I wonder how many dudes buttholes this girl's just I know what you want and I was like yeah you know go for it baby like just on a whim on a hope that it's a good day and also she's sucking on her fingers me know and where's this going see in the world of Kerswell that we're talking about the idea that you're going to be able to record everything there will be a way that you can hack in the way that like guys will hack into their girlfriends email you'll be able to hack into your girlfriends like past and like see a scan of like you could actually just enter in how many buttholes is our finger been in put 28 it's a breeding that sexy to go on-hook I'm reading this sex is pretty good yeah it's fascinating and one of the things that I find fascinating is all the different theories about why people act and behave at certain ways when it comes to like sexual like how many sexual partners has your wife had yeah why it's so important that you limit that number you can trust her and keep alright it's really fascinating stuff man oh man that book is incredible I love that kind of good that's a really cool dude - Chris Ryan he's forget him on your podcast and twice twice yeah I gotta get in touch with him and try to see if he'll do this cuz he's he's really very interesting I love the part about uh you Katan the name of the yucatan remember that part I don't remember that they when Columbus's people or Cortez came to the Yucatan they asked the people like what what do you call this place and they made this sound not that sound but they made this sound like we could talk or no you know and the guy said you Katan close enough code so they say we're going to call it the Yucatan well it turned out that the Mayan scholars after all those years of deciphering they just do that what he was trying to say was I don't understand what you're saying man that's what he was saying yeah that they had taken his guitar hilarious isn't that amazing yeah that's such an amazing like I love knowing shit like that like house and then knowing that that was only a few hundred years ago right that's really kind of nuts yeah we're so spoiled by the time that we arrived you know we're so spoiled that being alive in the year 2012 like just a few hundred years ago there was people that got in boats and just traveled and didn't know where the fuck they were going and had no idea what they would find and didn't have math but dude think God what is it five hundred years ago I love to think about that and I love to think about the fucking feeling that feeling that that that's a feeling I mean we can find that I mean yeah you could you know esoterically say you know we can search into the world of psychedelics for neulander yeah but no one is ever going to know until interstellar travel happens no one's ever going to know that fucking feeling of being on a ship and for the first time seeing land in a place where no one knows there is land yeah and the idea that you would have the audacity to go look in the ocean to not know what's on the other side to just go out there like oh my god you had to have fucking tremendous balls yeah and the boat wasn't with one of the things it must have been amazing back then was the ability to see the stars like as long as it wasn't cloudy out you could really see everything because there was no light pollution where if you if you've ever been in the country in the middle of the night oh yeah look up and a clear night and just seeing fucking unbelievable amounts of stars it really makes you sad that that's not a regular feature like that what we've done by creating these beautiful cities and the safe roads to travel on we've disconnected ourselves from the vision of the cosmos yeah of our part in the cosmos yeah when you're like in the country man you're staying in a farm and you go kickback in a hammock and you look up and the entire sky is filled with stars that is a perspective enhancing experience that's a visual psychedelic I'm staring at the stars is a very visual psychedelic well I mean you've got like light pouring into your eyes yeah from the far reaches of the universe your you've got light coming into your eyes that's from so like so long ago and you you're getting that feeling that you get when you see something beautiful that we seek out beautiful things which we seek out them whether they're flowers or sculptures or a person a car there's something that strikes us when we see something beautiful you know it's all subjective but to each person whenever they're beautiful is it lights that charge in their mind yeah look have you ever seen a guy's like really into old cars and he sees an old Corvette or something like that oh this is a 67 yeah look at the lines on this baby yeah and you see them like it's fucking eyes light up and like these are there's a charge that a person gets from a thing of beauty from seeing something that's beautiful there's an idea that that thing of beauty is lying underneath everything that the world's just covering that beauty up and that people use objects as a way to limit the beauty because - like really except the whole thing is like would be so potent that you start off like getting that feeling from cars or you start off getting that feeling from looking up at the sky you start off getting that feeling from falling in love but like that feeling is like underneath everything that's what everything is composed of is that sense of like wow holy shit because that's like a peak that's a peak feeling that feeling of being like whatever the thing is that activates it sometimes I think that maybe that's what enlightenment is is when you just hit that feeling perpetually you're just perpetually in that space of like wow this is amazing.i I had a friend was like really into Buddhism and she had this thing on her wall that said Lightman is enlightenment as possible in this lifetime yeah I remember reading that going wow that is a profound statement you know enlightenment is possible in this lifetime I remember thinking like wow what a what a weird thing we we all have in our heads is this this burning desire to get our shit together yeah like everybody would love to be enlightened you know yeah beware of anybody who tells you they are beware of anybody tells you they don't want to be wow that's great yeah ask me that other that's great dear that's really good it's delicious yes a gift from the universe yeah that that really is I'm sure somebody probably already said it somewhere already yeah that's big that's too good I couldn't read that one oh no I've never heard it but I've heard if you see the bhoot on the road kill him I've never heard beware of anybody who says they're enlightened or who says they don't want to be that's pretty good when you talk to people needing to have this box that they don't want to operate in a oh you look there's a real live the sound gonna die it's like our thing we didn't you and I broke down that country-western oh yeah you know yeah that ridiculous and a girl happy to be single-celled organism anybody wants change that got to come through me yeah yeah man it's that that kind of you know constricted life sucks for the person who's living in the constricted life and for the people living around the person in the constricted life and it's like you can if you just play around with that fucking idea that you can permanently permanently shift your consciousness so that you are experiencing life in the way that like those however many times you've had happen in your life some people more sometimes less when you're for the first time you like accomplished some big thing and you get that sense of like oh my god man I can fucking I can really do shit that I didn't think I could do that feeling is like the universe at that moment unfolds it's like a whole new room whole new giant land pops open and your subjective universe you're like wow there's an entire other part of this life I had no idea about well it's like if you can always be in that state of recognizing that this is the most beautiful peak experience that could happen to anything which i think is what enlightened people the people I've been around who are very advanced I wouldn't call them enlightened they're just happy man they're just like Happy's the wrong word for it though they're like connected and they're really really not afraid to express love you know they're very they're feeling love all the time I think that that's a cool idea that you could feel that all the time I think that's a beautiful idea that you could be in that place it's all the time you're careful about your friends you know and you you only surround yourself with positive people I think you can walk that out I think I can do that all the time it's all about constructing that environment though you know you have to like do that by sharp editing throughout throughout your entire life you got to figure out how to edit yourself and edit people all right you know you got to figure out how to get get the most like they'll get rid of as many of your own negative instances any of those that you can get away with not not causing yourself like minimize that try to get it down to zero where then that none of the negative moments are created because of your actions and then figure out who's creating all those other negative moments and eliminate interaction with those people yeah I mean if you can do that and then find like-minded folks who will not put anything try not to do anything negative to their friends and don't want to accept anything negative either then you're about around a bunch of people who love each other let me throw out an idea because this is what you're talking about it's something that some hippie bullshit know how to calm you it ain't hippie bullshit man this is like the idea of like well in the beginning you know there's there's a the beginning of spiritual life is what they say they say the beginning of spiritual life is like it like a tendril like the beginning of like when a tree grows right and when a tree is growing at first the most gigantic tree started off as a tiny little fucking sprig so when you're in that place it's really important to keep shit up it can like fuck you up and that's the idea of cutting people out or like cutting out the negative elements but then there's this other idea that I was listening some rhombus lecture he's talking about reactivity and that when you're around someone who's got a difficult personality or someone who's like an instigator a drama vortex you still get to decide if you're going to be reactive to that person or not you still get to be in control the way you feel around that person but in the beginning that person can make you feel like shit when you're around an asshole your mood will drop your mood shifts you get mad you get unhappy you feel threatened but the idea is as you advance and gain more and more control of your consciousness then that stops happening so you use that asshole as an emotional gym yes you use them as an emotional or psychological growth sparring partner yes and as you deal with their douchiness you learn how to better navigate douchiness throughout your life yeah and also for the first time when the asshole is around someone who isn't reacting to them being an asshole they're going to be like what the fuck is this because then their whole life they've been going through life getting cues from people like oh I don't think so No so all of a sudden if they're around someone who's like beaming you know beaming in the way that they you would be beaming around when you saw like when Joey Diaz walks into a room right you're beaming that way around a cunt suddenly they're like what the fuck is this the real problem though is when they become physically violent when you have dumb cunts I want to punch you that's when you run in a real situation yes but how often did I mean that doesn't happen that most of the time but you've managed to surround yourself with you know hipsters I mean if you're in certain parts of the country certain parts of cities you can you punched in the face randomly I've seen a tear there's a terrible video a woman in London some guy just comes and cracks her for no reason they're looking for the guy some teenage girls knocked unconscious demonic son of a bitch just fucked up that people are capable of doing shit like that and that there's there's the broad spectrum of the possible human actions it's so broad mean you could be a god that she could of cross paths with a guy who was like good morning you know at top of the day to you and been real happy and made her feel good and she could have moved on to you know her job or whatever feeling like really good instead she runs into the wrong guy and he cracks or an ox or unconscious for knows for no reason whatsoever she hits her head in the concrete like I saw it dude she's out but you know what's amazing man this is again that shit we were talking about in the beginning this is the shift that's happening because there was a time in human history when a thug go galloping up behind some young lass in the street and knock her down and like the entire planet doesn't know about it in a matter of like eight hours you know this this is them this is the incredible time that we're in is that that it's a double-edged sword you see something like that and you're either going to be like goddamn this is a fucked up world or living in AI there's guys will just run up behind someone and punch him in the head or the other side of is like fuck in one you know in a day or two this act of violence has been broadcast all over the planet and has created a situation where people could like talk about how awful it is and how how bad that is that people are like that and it I think that elevates us a little bit I think it just takes a lot more time than we're used to because we're used to like processing power going up in a year and hard drive space doubling it we're used to all these massive improvements and then we don't see that in human nature and it's really frustrating you know I think that this this you know shift that we keep saying I think it's just more subtle than people would like it's not as fast as a going from an old tube television to a 55 inch flat screen it's not you know it's not it's something different scene having DSL and you know having you know 56k you know it's it's it's it's it's too small like so we still see these versions of the worst-case scenarios of human behavior it's shocking to us that they still exist but I think the direction is for them to exist less them it seems like more and more as part of the shift things are standing out that aren't shifting more and more so like you know like Romney for example or like at least like crazy fucking like uh you know homophobic anti-abortion Republicans jongil my family boy these crusty old sons of bitches more and more are starting to look like monsters they're starting to look more like freaks whereas they used to be able to like you know they used to be able to turn fucking high-powered water hoses on crowds of black people you know that without without losing their jobs you know what I mean like so this this shift is like but it's really interesting to watch the way that a lot of these crusty old pundits are reacting to it man they're having the same effect that when they threw water on the Witch and The Wizard of Oz you know that kind of like they're hissing and shrieking and they don't how to deal with it what's fascinating to me in is that with this with this new sort of understanding of people that we're getting because the Internet is water all over mass build coffee family and I have a nice shirt and I don't want to ruin it with this this new understanding that people have of like what like having the access to these kind of stories having the access to these horrible stories that are things that are happening from the Gaza Strip that this shift that's going on like as it's happening all these horrific things that still exist in the world they seem to escalate almost as if they're worried that something's coming at them almost as if like it's the you know the fundamentalism gets even more and more extreme and more and more hate for more and more crazy and you start getting shit like God hates fags and guys holding up a fucking sign they have a whole website dedicated to it like all that the hate that you see with you know we had um on the podcast we had this conversation with Shane Smith about Pakistan and India and the potential for nuclear war and it was one of the scariest conversations ever alright because these people like it's like almost like a lost state like Pakistan who's talked to Morgan how chaotic it is and how chaotic the rulership is and how they hate India and India hates them and that different leaders have said they wanted to strap themselves to a nuclear bomb and go over there and blow the other people out there that this all exists at the same time as these this new understanding of this new shift it's almost like it's its resistance and it's almost like this thing that we have to rally against like the most fucked-up part of human nature it's like we have to rally against that and that's what unites people and what you need otherwise would be too lazy otherwise we have to get we would accept mediocrity we would accept a certain slow tempo to the evolution of human consciousness but this forces it to act I could all the evil and all the fucked up the actions of the world and fucking drone attacks all this craziness forces us to act and think well it's again man oh yes I agree like and not you know there's part of me that gets scared because I feel like that thing gets backed into a corner and it decides to press the button but I think that what what's really what's happening is an amplification effect I think acts of violence are becoming less but becoming more amplified because we're so we're becoming so much more appalled at the idea of like the the barbarism of war and all the shit that humans do I think that that that what's happening is God hates fags these people pop up right and then what happens though people organize from the internet and suddenly God hates fags is now whenever wherever they go they get surrounded by mobs holding signs God hate signs God hates this God hates that giant signs blocking them out so it's like the hate is getting absorbed it's getting us it's not working it's not working it just seems like it's horrible because it's being broadcast to so many people but the way people are reacting that's what's important that's what's important as long as people are reacting you know that's the number one thing and not ignoring it that's great and as long as people are reacting in whatever way just fucking as simple as the thing is like just tweeting just tweeting something retweeting something about some of the violence that's happening just anything to get the information out there and keep that fucking pop bubbling that's great man that'll that that will continue to push the war mongers into the periphery and I think that though that they're what just happened with Romney and fucking Obama I think we're lucky look what's going on with Egypt with a new president decided to give himself all power yes now all-powerful status but look what's happening even there look what's happening it's not what is not working yeah it's not fucking working that stuff doesn't what isn't working in the way it used to work them and that's the shift the Mojo that these fucking old white dudes used to have is fading its fading away man it's like them it feels like the magic is leaving them which is why it's so beautiful when you watch Karl Rove on Fox News having a little like Wizard of Oz style man behind the curtain meltdown as he realizes that his evil scheme to try to get Romney into power didn't fucking work yeah that's cool Danny isn't it that's cool that's he was like though the numbers are wrong the numbers are wrong yeah he wouldn't admit it man he would admit to defeat yeah it's great to watch and a lot of them are like it that's what's happening is they don't want to admit they they're always upholding the virtues of this country and how we come from revolution but when the real revolution starts happening they're like I'm going to secede now I'm going to secede because the real revolution is in a revolution worried we all get to hide in our shacks and collect our fucking guns look at this photos photos 200,000 Egyptians and they're protesting what's crazy is they're protesting around an ancient obelisk Wow it's from you know the dynastic Egypt yeah it's incredible stone mystery that are covered in hieroglyphs and these people are protesting around it and screaming and yelling that you can't have fucking you we were done like we elected someone the idea is that we're now in a democracy you cannot have this crazy Telegraph but he wants to he wants to say that he can't get arrested he can't go jail it can't be didn't word look at that didn't work asshole amazing though that he would want to do that and he says it's because of his opposition because his opposition would try to do terrible the Muslim Brotherhood well he's the Muslim now he is yeah the Muslim Brotherhood is what's in power now at least I believe so I believe that's how good for some reason I don't think that but I don't know I haven't I don't know maybe right I don't know well here goes a protesters stormed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the countryside largest city of yeah they know that that's a Muslim is the Muslim Brotherhood so this guy wanted to do something where he didn't have any there was he had no no worries whatsoever about ever being arrested and this actually could be a dictator he wanted to be a dictator right they're like no this isn't working sorry it's the same thing as like when it's just whenever you start letting freedom out of the bottle man you're not going to get the freedom back and once people feel that sense of like holy shit if we get together we can change things in a big way yeah you're not going to be suddenly they're gonna be like alright well you're okay we'll let you be the new dictator it's like no man we've learned we've learned how to change things through the group mind do you think it's possible though then moving forward we're ever going to get to a position of no we'll have no one above anyone else no one in a position of like president or where they can take executive privilege like Obama did that with that whole gun-running thing with that whole you know that all of the fuck they call it fast and furious yes or they sold guns to the Mexican drug lords just to track them and those guns want up being used on American citizens like it doesn't make any sense that the store makes no sense like the story that they would sell guns to the Mexican drug lords so they could track the guns that's one of the dumbest fucking ideas I've ever heard of my life you're going to arm them with thousands of guns so that you could track those guns alright who do you think they're going to do with those guns are going to kill people that's the craziest idea I've ever heard do you pay it almost like that's their excuse like that's what they're going to say and they have it planned out and make it look like that's the doing but really what they're doing is they're profiting on selling guns that can be and they're just playing dumb yeah that makes a lot more sense to me it doesn't make any sense to me that someone would think that selling criminals guns is a good idea because then you could track the guns like what the fuck are you talking about dude we don't I mean that's a problem that shit gets so obscured by like they have so many great ways of like diffusing information of adding information to information that's not real of subtracting shit it becomes that who the fuck knows what it when it becomes a part of you know like the government where the president doesn't have to f get tried on this they he invoked this executive privilege he doesn't have to testify that's squirrely that shit squirrely there's never I don't think there's ever a time where anyone should be able to say like oh I had something to do with that hole guns being sold to fucking crazy people who kill people on a regular basis but I don't want to talk about it like you either knew about it or you didn't know about like we hired you bitch you got to talk about it and if you knew about it and you didn't do anything about it that's incompetence that's crazy if you let that fly of Obama let that fly like that's one of the dumbest things a president could ever approve ever sure we should know we should know whether or not especially in a time of a reelection when that was going on there's no way he shouldn't have to say well I thought it was a good idea at the time they assured made these guns with this fire you know there was no there's no or like Romney's tax returns like that shit like that kind of information should be all on the table yeah you should know how much he paid in taxes because you know how rich he is if you really did weasel it out and then the last couple of years decided to start paying a lot of taxes to to show you know so yet it on paper if you're running for the office like that yeah I mean that's that the idea is you know to change this fucking businessman president into like public servant president that's that's the idea that you want you want the fucking guy who like runs Coast Guard asset rather saw this thing on reddit the guy runs Costco pays his employees like $18 an hour minimum they have health insurance and he only makes $500,000 a year this is the guy who fucking runs Costco like think about that meanwhile the guy who runs Walmart is like something out of fucking Pink Floyd the wall it's just some Pig man who's like you know I mean it's crazy it's crazy but that's the shift man we want more things shifting to that so that you get the Costco version of the fucking president that's like yeah you know I'm really just in this because I'm trying to make this this country prosperous and the people in this country have as much access to like health care and what they need to live really great lives so more Richard Branson less less Rupert Murdoch yes these old fucking warlock pigs man drive them into the shadows pigs that'd be an awesome name for a band warlock pigs yeah man we need more Branson's interstellar travel we need more fucking Steve Jobs you know we need more fucking like more of that running the show and I think that's gonna happen more and more well you know what I'm really impressed with when you talk to people that work for Google when you talk to people that work for Google they tell you what a great company is to work for and how well they're treated and like the the facilities their their campus I guess they call it a campus yes you know that you hear those cuts tours like you know that it's possible that a company can operate like that dude any kind of super anyone who's plugging into this vibe that's happening right now whatever the fuck this thing is man you know right away that's all about connectivity and you know right away that the feeling you get from like giving more than you're supposed to give is such an awesome feeling in that feeling that state of mind where you're putting out more than you're supposed to be putting out it seems like in that state of mind is where the bigger ideas come from anyway it's like that's creating a fertile ground in your consciousness to open up for like the big ideas but if you shut down close down if you're fucking if you if you're just one big human muscle spasm pushing all your gems into the black pit of your life you know hoarding and hiding and concealing then you're shut down that's when you turn into Donald Trump with his dumbass tweets who's sillier than that guy now I just you pay attention that shit Brian yeah I don't like the guy anymore I used to like him a lot but he just seems like it's a crazy kook now Yeah right like something has something shifted yeah is that why I can't see your face the way we have everything set up this is stupid and I know I'm gonna see you sweetie we should put a TV I guess sadder it's monitor yeah I don't he could be making funny faces I mean I wouldn't even know how dare you we're still working this place out ladies gentlemen um my mic sounds weird sounds like I'm a robot sounds find out since cancer sounds Oh Kenny I think it's the Lakers knowing that you don't like them but you're wearing their headset they're getting mad and there's oh is that well that's the way here it's colors answer all Skullcandy give a Caesar there thanks called candy did you have the bill burr ones down there bill burr ones oh yeah the Boston Celtics sure whatever come on come on Celtics they have them I guess for basically every team are these good headsets man I've been real close to forking out no I'll give you a pair of these okay yeah yeah skull candies been sending them to us 340 bucks yeah they're expensive they're good though these they sound fucking wicked yeah they they sent me this whole email explaining how they spent a lot of money on research and development to try to make like really good sounding ones that initially they were more of a like a lifestyle company they had like good ones but now they were to concentrate on really creating like something that like a DJ would listen with I leave fucking earbuds scattered across this fucking country like spiders thread and chargers just at chargers and fucking earbuds everywhere I got trailing reps and sunglasses I by lost my goddamn iPad I lost my fucking digital recorder I'm like a fucking 11 year old with like bad ad D at a summer camp on this last tour I did I left shit everywhere well see first of all have lost the puppet hey what about me but saying this last tour whenever you go on tour man like you're going from one hotel room to another hotel you're lucky if you keep 80% of your shit it's amazing how much you lose dude it's amazing you do do you feel bad not that I do this but I think you might do it do you like do you feel guilty when you like when you like jizz in the hotel room and like what do you throw the tissue down have you ever done that you risk you left your fuck what do you have why pit in you fro ad you feel bad though you just throw I don't know wash my your Chuck yeah but you know what I mean like I feel bad for the maids man like like all the fuck up them the maids I just started fucking tip in the manager I don't even know you're supposed to do that that's something I just woke up - yeah I like yeah I just started doing that good but unfortunately for many many maids of like I had to pick up a rusty old Fang and like they many of them sucked on the napkins and yeah so many of them are immortal now take in your salt oh like that's what they that's and they feed on ya like a washcloth just sucking on the washcloths fight over then I'm in the bathroom and you know she doesn't know that you used your key get back in because she didn't hear the door open cuz she's making that sucking noise she's a bitch she's like on top of it like a praying mantis eating a fucking bottom parents slowly starting to bring color back to her face God vampires were so close to being awesome man if only they wanted jizz well that would be the succubus that would be attached to your dick and balls with like knife like teeth so that you were scared to move so you lay there in terror and you would just shoot a load out of pure fear and they would just keep suffering they wouldn't let you pull it done you know that feeling like after you come where you want to like ha ha he's only touches your dick like yeah like it tickles almost like it's too crazy blowjob matching that if a giant succubus with teeth is attaching itself the head of your dick and sucking on it and you can't pull your dick back because if you do it gets shredded and you feel the Stinger on your neck kind of push in a little bit yeah you start struggling too much giant stinger like a like a scorpion like comes over the top of your head so while you're blowing it while sucking your dick it's it's stinger is like it to attach to your spine and you're looking at in this weird cave it's dragged you into and it's just all like withered dude corpses and maybe a couple of guys still alive and the stinger has to vice-like tentacles I neither saw the clamp down on your neck so right before it pushes that sting against your spine those things get tighter and tighter and you feel like you know don't go anywhere I'm sucking your dick yeah and this is going to go on for five years Julian dude I never pictured them as like that like when I think of a succubus I think of World of Warcraft it's fucking hot chick with like leather boots like a dominatrix with a little whip that like you know over fun to you but it starts out as a beautiful girl and then you realize in the middle of having sex with it like sort of like Jack Nicholson when he's making out with that lady Shanee then all sudden she was like 100 years old yeah cancer all over about yeah maybe that's how it gets Conan maybe it looks like Rose McGowan and then you move in for the kill you start squeezing her ass and all sudden she morphs into this thing yeah just you're you can't move I think that we have to hold your neck and then it starts sucking you off yeah I think that's the story of a lot of longer wives man it is it always starts off like that next thing you know you're already clamped into some kind of that submits a symbol you know it's like the heart does sirens that like sing and the sailors crash their ships on the island you know it's all the same fucking story right how come guys don't see those in prison like you know some girl with a fake girl with a key that's going to let you out do you never hear of like crazy hallucinations in prison I don't know about that I'm pretty sure there's some pretty crazy hallucinations in prison yeah but I mean like that kind of reoccurring theme of like someone with a light near the rocks going come on over here I had on a sailor smash into the rocks prison harpies yeah there's prison harpies man I called trannies we had a Victor Conti on he was telling us about his time in a minimum-security prison were you allowed like really allowed to leave whenever you want like people come and pick up their family like uliana stay there a certain amount of time you could get like passes to leave he said that the security guards like there was a girls crew guard that would make money prostituting herself yeah like you could go get some head from the security guard she made a lot of extra money that would make sense to me these poor bastard tell you but I'm not gonna let these guys fuck man that's why there are so many problems it's awesome I would add that to the goddamn Constitution if you're in prison you get a blowjob a month job because you got to be around some crazy fucking people that want to kill women what if you're around some really crazy serial murderer character and someone's got to suck his dick whose job should that be I mean another serial murderer a guy yeah whatever dude who cares this is a fucking hole in the wall you know what's on the other end it's like you make it very like Dutch guys would bite each other's dicks off there's no way you fucking defend him you can't defang a guy because he's on the other end if he grabs a whole tooth it DJ pulls it out with his hands look I haven't perfected this system yet but I'm working on it but because he couldn't blow you with his hands would be an inferior blow job living through a hole in the wall and be like fuck let me just take it down from this disgusting level it's gotten if you word about the new program where they give prisoners kittens you're about this yeah and it makes them why number what's that thank you what's a giveaway haha down to two of my pets have one left do Dom yeah it's really cool but it's like just like having these fucking cats is changing the prisoners behavior and massive ways man because they know that if they get in fights they lose their cat so they don't want to fucking lose the cat so it's like it creates this like it adds peace you got to bring love into prison that's a problem man love is the answer yeah it is godly I got with a little fucking kitten can transform some hardcore thug into somebody's like you know I'm not gonna fight cuz princess is back in the cell and I don't want to lose her that's love man that's the most powerful thing that's a lot more powerful than being like will put you in solitary confinement at though a lot most of them right yeah I may be the cat is like a special attachment when you stick a dick in its ass and alarm goes off you get the RFID chip you push you push the button with your cock you try to fuck a cat you're not like a cat it's like a probably do an operation on the cap where there's like there's like a little toggle and as long as the poops going that way it passes the toggle it doesn't go off yeah if a dick goes in the other way click it hits a switch and then the RFID chip signals the alarm that's a cat that's a fleshlight in prison yeah they would fuck that send I think prisoners have flashlights man I don't know why we're acting like it's gonna do anything good to like try to like change someone's libidos in a cage like that's not going to add happiness to a prison or peacefulness everyone you look at these prison rides like what are they writing to they're not they're not fucking these guys have so much testosterone in them you're not letting them fuck yeah but even if you give them flush light so it's not as good as raping a guy that's part of the fun for them I think it's holding someone down and and getting that man pussy you know I mean when when they're getting out to each other that's part of what they're doing you know I'll disagree I this is like love CNBC we're a roundtable respectfully disagree phrase that I'd rather be punched in the face and flick a flashlight yeah no shit man but dude I saw terrifying thing ever seen that thing that dude is like the like the toughest prisoner and like Columbia have you ever seen that thing and he's just like yeah that guy's a monster and he's like I make a man my girlfriend I let him sleep in my bed yeah what is it he says it's like well it's it I give take sex from him if not I kill him yeah I give him my food yeah it's really dark African guy yes fuck them a new guy come I fuck him yeah I fuck him I have sex with him yeah yeah that well that yeah that that kind of shit if you find that pull that up because it's just the audio alone it's like scary most evil prisoner of all time or something is what it's called or just Beast prisoner man my bonds might knock us off line but I'll try yeah son so bitchin I just look you might be right there might be nothing here I just looked on this website that checks everything checks everything what like Internet yeah no I'm right there fucking international bro you're high damn we're in the we're in the woods oh yeah we're in the woods of discovery look at it we're gonna get it worked out this sucks but it's online and the I'm looking at the video it's not that bad it's working but most importantly it's just got to go through a process this whole thing is going through a process that's part it's exciting me I've never built anything before I've never like slowly started and organized and put it together and to have it the way I want it like I love that having a brick wall like a real brick yeah I love the oak table of literally days yeah this is but I love I love like a real shit like that bricks and wood makes me feel good that stuff yeah the kind of like metal like cast iron like these these legs and shit werewolf sculpture yeah that too perfect I'm gonna bring one of my buddhas in - yeah boots gonna rock it in a corner and swarms over an old one not a big one it's too hard to move the big ones too hard to move but I got another one it's pretty big - it's going to go here cool match over us bad ingestion 'z what else try to do this place fucking of float tank yeah but that's no one's going what are you doing I have some going yeah and they're gonna be annoying yeah man float tank and then you give your pals keys to this place they come here flow yeah come back we're just gonna float everywhere where's float lab valence Duncan was here written in blood on the wall oh yeah that guide I would I would waste blood on maybe a little period blood you know who knows IV chinos blood blood bricks that they can make now it's a it's a brick that they take blood and they mix it with something and it makes a brick and they're making houses out of these quad bricks oh my god that's great whose blood I don't know yeah how do you know there's not a couple of people mixed in your house well no that's cool I'll tell you this if I was going to die I wouldn't mind somebody withdrawing my blood and using it for blood bricks for their house would you rather that or tibetan sky funeral sky well no both turn my blood into bricks and let the buzzards eat me Wow well you could probably grind most of you and turn into bricks why why just fuck with the blood I don't know I don't you just said blood bricks I wouldn't I like that whole idea of like the way we do death in this country is so goddamn sterile and fucked up well it's a scam first of all the big scam is that you have to pay for the funeral and then it's really expensive and you know you have to pay a lot of money for a casket and you have to embalm the body well she even if you're going to they have it set up where the body gets embalmed I believe even if it gets cremated I think you still have to embalm the body I think that's the law dude the tibetan sky ritual is such a beautiful fucking thing man when you watch someone turn into a bunch of birds that's really cool to watch that you guys have wills i I don't yeah I need do you know if you if you don't have a will I think I'm not one person sure but like the government just takes all your shit even if you have living parents in another state I have you know well I don't think that's true I think it goes to the next of kin Joe if something Joe if something happens to me dude you can have my little hobo and my computer oh do that's all I want I own two things that's what I want I got a pulse again you got a piss again oh my dude I drink so much coffee today huh we don't have much time left in this podcast unfortunately because I got a big stupid important meeting where's it at because that highway was fucked I don't have you got my text message there was like five cars all cop cars it seemed like that guy in the whole freeway is closed which freeway 101 oh great whoopsies whoopsy days well I'll try I'll try I'll try to make it but if I don't make it folks I hate to leave anybody hanging the more the more I think about yesterday's podcasts I don't know if I want to say this say it the more I think that guy is a Tweaker you think so yeah most people thought that really a lot of people who listened and thought he was off and that he would like contradict himself and the fact that he knew so much about those drugs but yet there was you know we read on Gizmodo they they didn't cite sources but they said you know sources close to him say that you know he's always been interested in finding drugs that make women sexual it kind of goes along with the whole 67 year old guy 20 year old girlfriend thing you know it sounds like a dude who's just that's his thing I don't know I mean he claims not but then he all but he knows so much about them man how the fuck do you know so much about bath salts and MDPV and these different hyper sexual compounds and how could he tell us the exact chemical composition of it remember when he told us in but it what it actually was why would you say that unless you have great interest in and why would you have great it and then the other thing was saying like the I have to be addicted you can't do that then I would be on it right now and I sound all I get on it he might be on it right now but I don't necessarily think that a strong-willed man like that has to be addicted to so I think I like supposedly really hyper sexual that's the thing but I figure if you're gone gone like garlic mcafee he's you know he created this business he's like a very headstrong guy very powerful guy a guy like that could probably quit a really fucking dangerous drug for a little bit sure you know he could it's it's hard to tell when someone lies about anything if they lie about anything or don't are not completely honest about anything you immediately have to look at the whole thing and go well if he's not telling the truth about doing those drugs then how can I listen all the other stuff yeah it sounds it sounds like it a lot of who the fuck knows what to believe that at that point in the fact that he has no charges nothing like on record like there's no warrant for his arrest there's nothing that kind of made me think that he was just super paranoid well it couldn't that it could be that you know I mean they're told you there was that story that someone had said that he thought that there was people outside and he had a conversation I heard this I heard this this you can get on wired this discussion this is something hold on a second I'll find it because maybe we could pull it up in its audio anyway wired you think it's McAfee off the rails crazy audio um but he was talking about how there was these people and they were they were standing then they were like military people and they were standing there and they didn't say anything they just just stood there and he wouldn't move and so he just stood there too and they slowly went away like after hours and hours like so he was like standing and he was talking about like how how much is his arm hurt because you look leaning up against this wall but he couldn't move he moved they would shoot him I am fucked yeah but the hell people are saying there's no footprints there there's like he's that house that somebody posted on your message board the guy that died like it was like a shack they had an American flag in it and I don't know I don't know whose house that was yeah is that what was what it was supposed to be I thought that I thought that somebody that died because it was like this I mean it looked like a Shack like it just looked like a junkyard Shack you know yeah he's fucking I don't know mom yeah I could that was the interesting podcast cuz I kept on thinking about it after when I got home and then it the more I thought about it was just like you know this just seems that something's not right it was cool though that he he was willing yeah you know it was cool that he did it that's like I'm just getting trolled oh maybe that's what it seems like it doesn't it I also seems like hope smells like a big old troll yeah yeah so I'm trying to find in this I'm trying to find this because it's really interesting I really want to want to play it okay here it is if you go to audio just look this good Google search disc audio McAfee still in hiding predicts they will track me down and there's quite a brilliant man the picture of him is him of course shirtless with a gun another different photo of him shirtless with a gun like apparently posed for quite a few photos a whole look McAfee predicts during podcast being broadcast to millions of people they will track me down but he's uh you know I appreciate the fact that the guy was willing to talk to us I mean is pretty interesting to be able to talk to someone who's in this crazy scenario yes that's cool who's a crazy person in a crazy scenario well he's an eccentric you know I definitely think I mean that's a lot of what it takes to become some super millionaire type character yeah yeah it's true I mean that's the thing man you've got to be able to like let your mind go into the weird places we got to be able to come back you see this picture but this is the one that's the best law do you wait for wait to pull off visit polo yeah it's um the whole story is so compelling it's soul Hunter s Thompson ask like this guy just goes off the rails on an island sixty-seven years old 20 year old girlfriend yeah pictures him with guns yeah surrounded by dogs he's got eleven dogs you know I mean his hike wow it's like feral he went feral it's amazing and he has all these lawsuits that are coming after him and he will not pay he's like I simply will not pay he goes I will I you know I will spend ten million dollars to fight it to give them nothing what are the lawsuits about well one of them was about he had this he was connected to this sort of a sport where they would fly these looks like motorcycles that are attached to kite wings it's really crazy and they're really maneuverable apparently but they would do these low altitude you know not even altitude and low off I mean basically just very close to the ground they would do these things like acrobatics yeah spin around on these fucking planes well someone crashed and died right and so he got sued and that's when he decided apparently to move to Belize he just loaded up his truck and he moved to Beverly he's got the fuck out and I guess Belize won't extradite him or something I don't know how it works but if if he apparently says that if he loses the court cases it doesn't matter they'll just come take its money like if if you lose you lose but that he doesn't believe that he's guilty because he wasn't even driving it he wasn't responsive wasn't responsive or maintaining it it wasn't his you know I mean it's like wasn't his fault this guy died like this but apparently he was like working hard to promote this crazy sort of a sport John McAfee yeah here it goes who was calling to tell me that the police were closing in he had spent the night and an undisclosed house in Belize sleeping on a bed infested with lice and that he felt that the end was near that they would arrest him at any minute but he was not going to surrender because he was convinced that they would kill him I've been following McAfee's case in Belize for the past six months ever since April 30th when the police raided him and accused him of being a drug trafficker and possessing illegal firearms over those six months I've spent weeks in Belize and interviewed McAfee both in person and on the telephone probably over a hundred hours of interviews and I can say without a doubt that he is a very complex person but whether or not he's a murderer is yet to be seen I recorded McAfee phone calls to me this morning with his permission and what follows are those calls one of the charges against you is that you're a psychopath what do you have to say about Tom well if I were Psychopaths I would I would not be competences to to comment on it others is it a yes or no and by either one if I were a psychopath would be irrelevant I don't think I'm a psychopath I like people I think psychopaths are are sort of anti-social folks okay people I tend to love people I can a lot of people in spite of their faults in spite of the things that they do or attempt to do to me you're well aware of marcia for example who who plotted for for three months to on to have me kidnapped for money and yeah whenever you sit like not in that you live with me after them for for two additional months before that's fine i got two engines well you know i thought this is a good question why do you surround yourself with people of questionable character I surround myself with people of unquestionable character to Eddie and cone eyes I don't know a more honest god-fearing person um yourself I think I've you friended you and and and embrace you as I embrace their licenses is not even the audio that I was looking for unfortunately it's pretty good now that's pretty good but the other one was better because it was really nuts to when I worked at the Comedy Store there was this lady you would call I can't remember a name but she would call and like she it is interesting her the way that her insanity function cuz she call me like she would always say she used to work out their camera name but then she'd like start being like yes you know yeah last Wednesday three men came into my house and they raped me and left and you know like would slip in these really weird hardcore story she called a few times and I was always like these plots against her you know they they did like you know I was kidnapped too just making things up she but she believed it and she you know what I mean it's like when you're mine I'm not saying I don't know about but I don't know who knows maybe he's all together me he's totally there people are really plotting against somebody rich people live in a different land but it's interesting how like people who are paranoid the way it comes out it's not like they're gonna be like uh everybody's out to me its idea that people are looking at kidnap him she's been plotting to kidnap me enforcer when someone starts talking and that sort of matter-of-factly had there's there's a disconnect there from reality as well do we got to end this pocket fuck out here I'm so sorry but we'll do it again quite soon cool ICN as often as possible yes please powerful powerful Duncan powerful Brian driving all the way over here for 40 minutes of
