the girag and experience um so uh you and you were married at the time and you were getting divorced while we were doing the show and it was one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life and not just a Phil Hartman divorce thing you know scared me but Dave's thing scared me and one of the reasons why Dave scenes things scared me was you do not want to get fucking married in Canada no because when you break up in Canada say you decide you want to get a divorce you can't legally get divorced until you're separate for a year right that's correct I'm not sure what I can't even remember I believe it was a year it's tattoo in my brain yeah because I remember thinking how crazy this was that you were fucked and what was happening was is why his first wife was an eccentric character and she decided to start taking the cheating all the fucking world or a contact on the radio I would have gone with that yeah you're a great guy I want to say that she's a cunt yeah well she's the mother of your children so yeah that doesn't excuse it ha ha ha ha that is not a get out of get out of cunt freezes well she was very odd and the the first season the guys were together and then I believe by the second season it was over yeah yeah yeah we split up yeah and so she started what she would do is spend all days money so David be working and she would spend all Dave's money I mean by crazy expensive furniture fly all around the world all the time so whenever Dave wanted to see his kids he used to have to get fucking malaria shots yeah okay so one time we're at one of these NBC things and Dave's fucked up on malaria medication and genetics or whatever the fuck you were drinking yeah and you get like like crazy I had to stop Dave from beating a guy up I had a step in between do you remember the big guy with the long hair with the fucking John's over here Tony why quite a hike yeah Johnny Carrie it wasn't I really liked it wasn't that the guy had done anything wrong it was just the malaria medication you become a psychotic it's a very common effect especially apparently when you mix it with alcohol yeah well and you and then you add that having made two trips to Africa yeah month yeah Africa she is fucking kids like I had to fly to I had to fly to Morocco at Thanksgiving and so we have two weeks outfit so I floated flew to vow and this again and she when we first separated she took the kids Wednesday be like a summer sent mom divorce where's like I need to take the children to the continent and gather my thoughts so she like traveled through Europe with you know a six-month-old baby in a two year two and a half year old six months and then so then Thanksgiving there in Morocco so I had to go meet him in Morocco so I get spent 10 days in Morocco then another 24 hours flying back and then two weeks later we get our Christmas break so I have to fly to Zimbabwe and there was nothing you could have done like taking your money like hey I'm giving it to Joe or something like that no it was like Oh money yeah no you you have to be responsible for taking care of their well-being well at the time when I like when I made her get into therapy she's uh like I forced her to get us begin to couples therapy because I was miserable and and so since we have I'd say let's go therapy say well I got to go first and all right you can go see the therapist said the trousers yeah yeah so she goes in and extend explains to the therapist that I'm an abusive husband uh you know and then she starts physically fit she - excuse me being physically abusive whoa and then she starts like phoning my family and friends and saying I'm physically abusive okay complete fabrications right so she's just yeah creating a good friend of mine Steve Hibbert when he heard this said that's crazy if if dave was abusive she would be dead you know but no then I go into therapy and the therapist cuz you know who is prepared for this abusive husband to walk in and she goes and she explained Delaney I was very weird because you walked in and you didn't match the description of you at all and she said when he walked in you and I saw you two together I immediately realized that if anyone in this couple was abused it was it was it was me did the therapist say this to her uh I don't know if she ever said it to her in therapy did you have a one-on-one but is one with it we have boats are individually and together and then after about six months of therapy my wife but I thought things were starting to get better because I was you know I was able to do things like OCD shopping with Steve without get without that being a huge fight when I got home you know you know how so that was like other a little bit of freedom here I can go out and hang out with hang out with my friends for a little bit without there being a huge fight and but then like she was diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder what does that exactly mean why is it borderline personality just lets a misnomer really don't like it they used to they used to think it was because it was a condition that bordered on being psychotic and now it's that that's they know that isn't the condition it's not letting you do the psychosis but the name is stuck the problem with my problem with the name is when you say borderline personality disorder do you have a fucking person how I disorder or not yeah what is borderline you're kind of weird kind of yeah and black because in fact borderlines a lot of therapists won't even treat them because they think they're just impossible to treat and they're they're horrible people to deal with you know that they're incredibly dishonest the pathological liars how do you define it though how can you define certain sets of mental illness I mean other tests issue is it a judgment call there is like I was the DSM is that what is called a diagnostic standards manual something that and it's got like a checklist and if you score a certain number on the checklist they go that's a diagnosis and I think she had like nine out of ten Y on the checklist for borderline was she always a swear did she change she was always that way you know yeah like basic as soon as we became a couple like before we were couple she was like my um before she did she was my best friend's girlfriend oh shit you know that's karma son yeah that's what happened you know yeah you hooked up with Karma yeah it was like funny things were hers like she break up with him first and then go out with you or you know knows like one these things where I sort of said look I'm we should stop hanging out so much because I'm you know right I was like feeling bad about it can I was like 20 years old and at that point kind of lonely and desperate and said look I've got these feelings and we should stop hanging out together alone really you actually said I have these feelings and we should stop hanging out yeah many guys would do the very few yeah and her her reaction that was the the she just showed me her tits and started kissing me so that's like oh all right well I tried you did give it your best so um so what happens then you go to the buddy and go hey bro fuck your girlfriend again well I tried to cool I tried to get out of it and I even was out of town for a while and tried to stay away from it but you know he was probably like thank God thank God yeah well that's the thing is I didn't realize at the time cuz I've gone alright I thought things were okay with them and you know it wasn't till she and I hooked up like cuz again as soon as we hook because borderlines when they love you you're the most beautiful perfect thing in the world but then but then after that like if anything is wrong then you suddenly become the most evil dark horrible thing in the world and they can't they can't see the two at the same time they can't see your flaws and your and your virtues how do they treat him wow I think I've dated somebody every girl you've ever had yeah like man I need a rest fucking guy you don't even know he just got out of relationship with a Penthouse Pet of the year Oh real it was wonderful for me it was like I had my own so proper going on yeah but it was also just like this where where when shit went down it was it was on or off it was no like shits down maybe we can work through that it was just that's one of the key signals of a borderline is that that in they say it's the inability to recognize the good and bad in the same person you know so you can shift from being the most evil person to the greatest person 100% yeah so with my first wife before we were a couple when it was just you know uh illicit you know when it was like these secret feelings I you know and when we were friends I was the greatest guys and she made me feel like I was the greatest guy on earth so you thought this is the perfect woman for me you know she's with my friend you know so she meant to be there they do right yes yeah you know and then but as soon as we became a couple first thing that like sex gone immediately whoa we didn't have sex for 11 years we're the other 11 years and we'd have sex maybe once a year oh my god how did you have two kids once a year wow really I have very motile sperm um holy shit we had kids because she decided she wanted to get pregnant and and even at that point that oh well we still get laid you know God and but our were your friends while this was all going on well what if what a men friends always do what depends on the men friends they never say anything they said they're quietly eight and hate her not me man yeah I've learned from the phil heartman yes experience I tell people yeah and whenever I think that my friends in a bad situation I will pull them aside I've offered which is on risk you should take for a friend yeah I thought it should stay at my house Duncan stayed at my house for a few months after he got out yeah you know you got to tell people like bro this is you're stuck and you think for some reason whether this person is a part of your life they're not this is this is a show that you're tuning into the you can shut off yeah okay and for me it was like that's a lot of guilt why how we started course and then eventually eventually you know I'm gonna you know I'm almost as crazy she is after 11 years of no fucking your brain doesn't function properly you know and it's also 11 years of like twice a month suicide threats oh you know oh god you know and then you know that you know I got to point rose so crazy I thought well at least if we have a kid you know if we have a kid she won't kill herself when I leave you know I sound crazy and live on my within um less than a month after my son was born uh out of nowhere she goes you know I've been thinking about it and I think if you left me even with a baby I would still kill myself like she could read my mind whoa I've been thinking about it yeah holy shit is that uh really my look at that time I was like when when Tabitha I split up she was going through about 50 grand a month and that was before we had it that was before we had it like a separation agreement half a million a year yeah running spending it and you have to make a million to spend a half a million yeah yeah Jesus oh right it's been so fun who is renovating the house constant what to be her to be Richard Rosie those beneficiary ski real antsy had the backyard real an scaped twice cuz she decided she didn't like where the koi pond was oh my god you know that's a you know core core ponds are pretty awesome though yeah yeah thing I've always thought about killing something so do we need it's not you know what you can't really raise a child in a healthy home without a quick that was that her argument you know it's argument it's all for the kids yeah the kids need a koi pond kids need to go to Morocco yeah worried about getting bitten by poisonous insects yeah she turned like the third if she kept renovating this house like at least spent like another like a half a million dollars renovating a fully renovated house well this is why I brought this up so I ran into you on Twitter I saw you on Twitter and one of the first things I saw you on Twitter was you talking about how you had just gotten the the court it just told you you have to pay three times your monthly salary in alimony yeah and I guess two times left but I would say is an average because a lot of months I don't have a salary no yeah they ordered I have to pay seventeen thousand seven hundred dollars a month or go to jail for ten days every any month that I'm late without warning that's that was the hinted judge's ruling jail for ten days so do you have to bit be exported to Canada as I would well that's the thing I'm here so so do you just say fuck you I live here now and just stay here but I yeah I can't risk going back to Canada she'll go to jail yeah whoa so unless I've come up with seventeen thousand seven hundred dollars which in a month where I haven't earned anything is a little hard to do walk back so how much are you sending over there are you trying to like whatever I did then yeah like I sent five grand this past month and this should go crazy twenty grand a few in November this should go crazy and yell at you like you need more and well she hasn't talked to me directly you know really it's all through lawyers but again they were trying through this this organization called the FR o the my responsibilities office in Ontario that and this this legal office is really responsible for hounding a lot of men to their death like there's a real problem with like people committing suicide after being prosecuted about these people and they they were trying to get me like in November I'm sitting in a court in like November 20th I guess sitting in court and thinking the end of that day I might go to jail for six months they were they were pushing for me to go to jail for six months this is what the f ro was asking six-month jail sentence if I didn't come up with half a million dollars that day and an additional 30 days for every month I didn't come up with the money oh my god so and I was saying going well the judge if he goes for it either in jail for life they'll cuff me there that day taking Jay my god and I'll go to jail for six months the end of six months they'll say you know well do you have the half-million dollars and and plus the ongoing money that would accrue over the six months and I'd say no I've been in jail for six months how I supposed to earn any money all right that's another 30 days the end of that 30 days yeah the money no I've been in jail so it's essentially a life sentence unless someone gives you $500,000 yeah how long how long how much longer do you have for this well it's really is unending until I pay off the arrears that I owe or you know and that's crazy and then until the kids are 22 if they stay in school so and the skin and so then the money just keeps adding up and yeah my dick off tonight yeah like I mean don't know just don't married Canadian jerk yeah I mean in order to pay seventeen thousand seven hundred dollars I have to earn about forty thousand dollars in a month just to pay that just you know you know with you know 20% Commission thirty five percent tax bracket you know so I got to earn forty thousand just to have zero dollars fuck and it's on of course is someone you hate yeah yeah and who didn't fuck me for eleven years tell us what it's got raising ass laws now when you tell them that you don't make that much money anymore what do they show the judge you pat who made this ruling because they were asking for the six months right and the judge kept saying to the f ro attorney you know give me another option because I'm looking at looking at the the dot the financial documents and I'm seeing where all the money all the money that has come in I'm seeing where it's all gone it's all here in this documents all the money that's come in and where it's all gone I can see it all in these documents so I'm convinced that there isn't a half a million dollars for mr. Foley to to come up with today so if you insist on that ruling then I would send him to jail and your client will never see another dime because mr. Foley's career will be over and that's it and he kept saying give me an option that will get your client some money and the effort refused they said well we don't have the authority from our client my ex-wife to make any other offer so for about two hours the judge kept asking them to come up with another so all this time what you're sitting there you're going I'm going to jail yeah and I might be going to jail essentially forever yeah yeah what happened going to jail for being for the crime of not earning a million dollars oh my god so what happens if that actually does happen I mean if guys got in jail with a large sum like that and never come out I don't know but people definitely gone to jail and and definitely there's a lot of people who have been looking at jail time who have just killed themselves okay can you get the kids and have them stay with you so that she has the Talabani bro it's alimony no this is child support it's all child so this is all child support yeah so whoa 17,000 a month in child support yeah steal the kids what the fuck are your kids eating uh $17,000 iPhones they're eating iPhone yeah that's incredible yeah seventeen seventeen thousand seven hundred dollars a month that's crazy yeah I would I would talk to the kids in the cake come live with me we'll have a TV show together I'll get you up on and somehow turn the tables well yeah I mean get a horse yeah let me get a couple you ever thought about being on the real house husbands of Beverly Hills prenups I'm thinking we can get a reality show off the ground right what are you are you willing to marry a Kardashian oh my god look hey I can't marry worse than I have mm-hmm they probably a lot better yeah not crazy there's ambitious yeah fuck man so what's the solution so you cannot go to Canada and you just send whatever you have and then you have to constantly deal with legal payments because they're constantly trying to fuck you and so I spent like a year and a half literally going to court every single month with lawyers just basically go having to go to court every month just to stay out of jail to go and have them put it over to the next month and the lawyers you know the lawyers you know I mean the you know people that do family law a lot of them are really horrible people and they just make money off misery and even my own lawyers we're just you know extending this as far as they could until I ran out of money and like and then quit so when I went to court for this ruling I didn't have no I didn't have a lawyer that couldn't afford one so you went by yourself I was there by myself not only was i there by myself but all of the documents that had been piled up all of the evidence that have been piled up over the course of a year and a half was sitting in my lawyer's office oh my god you know so you had no evidence and no lawyer yeah did you have records did you have anything nothing and nothing God so you're just going today are empty anything I have no money I saw I can do yeah and there ask me questions about files that have been piling up over a year and a half you know but what how did it just thing I don't know I don't recall I don't you know examine you know how do they justify such an exorbitant amount of money uh because it's the as it was explained to me by my lawyers was that the courts a assumption is that the children should continue to live at the level they were at at the time of the dissolution of the marriage so which is crazy because if I we were still married and my income drop their lifestyle would change right but because we're not married anymore their lifestyle should never change no matter what I'm earning what's that the judge the ruling that was enforced was by another judge named justice Backhouse and she's the one who ruled about three four years ago when I went back to try and get it adjusted I went to uh to have to have a hearing to have it adjusted to meet my income and she ruled against me and in her ruling she said my ability to pay was not relevant to my obligation so it didn't matter to her what I proved my income to be if my income was zero she said I was still obligated to pay as though I was earning a million dollars I know a lot of people saying Joe Rogan is Dave Foley guys bombing me the fuck out yeah well listen this is an important shit this was my education in in relationships and the law regarding relationships as I was growing up literally I mean when I was on Newsradio as a fresh-faced boy didn't know jack shit about the world and this is how I learned about relationships this is how I learned yeah about yeah well the whole gamut from divorce to fucking murder-suicide and I learned it are you happily married yeah crazy with yeah it's figured it out no no don't got lucky yeah could go ugly for me too I would do in your podcast yes I would probably seriously just move somewhere like live on a beach in Japanese loves his kids you need to see your kids not now I can't go to Canada so I can't see so you don't see him at all no most last time you saw them uh was in November Wow don't drop me not last time I sighs went to see my son's play at schools lost my son and I said was the chick there the wife no no she wasn't everything good so you have no communication with her at all no not no nothin you don't have to pay any more alimony no she didn't seek alimony she sought of Jarlsberg cuz yeah but it's none of a gut to the kids you know that all girls to her yeah she was getting you know so all this money and then on top of the child support payment which is she was also getting something called section 7 expenses which is basically anything she chose to any bills she chose to run up what you know so it'd be like $20,000 for summer camp things like that anything that was for the kids that she chose yeah so not just alimony not or not just child support but child support plus and then all of her living expenses you know the merit of the mortgage and you know everything medical expenses everything makes me so it should make you sick
