three two one and we're live gentlemen dr. Neil Reardon am I saying that right yes sir and Mel Gibson how are you sir hey how you doing welcome aboard folks first of all thanks for coming here really appreciate it very nice to meet you thank you nice to meet you too so this you wanted to come in and talk about stem cells yeah so what is what's your experience been and what what is uh what's this calling that you have here well I was initially it was for my dad who was you know he was 92 and not and he was doing all the old man stuff you know his hip was killing him and he was like he had he had multiple problems I mean I won't get into the whole litany of complaints but hey you know your engine starts wearing out you got to replace the carburetor and a few other things I took him to the Mayo Clinic great place if I ever get into serious trouble that's where I'm going and they were fantastic there but they were able to say you gotta leave me here he'll be dead in 48 hours of my vote so they they clocked every problem that he had everything from you know a prostate to the to the hip to the kidneys to the heart to the lung you know the whole deal and he you know they they stabilized him they said okay we'll do this and we'll do this and they did some you know Orthodox medical procedures all allowed in this country and they were great but you know I still had reservations about him getting a hip replacement because he was old and of course just the recovery from a traumatic surgery at that age is like it's a big deal and I thought well what can I do my brother says why don't you look into these adult stem cells I'm like yeah you know I've heard things about this you know you grow you grow a spare mouth on your head you end up with an extra asshole or something but I was like okay we'll look into it so we did and of course a buddy of mine who was that who was a Mayo doc he said stay away from those witch doctors down at Panama he said it's like leprosy and banana boats and three-legged dogs you know and I'm like can we call him and so so Brad and I got on the phone to Neil and who else was it yeah dr. Paz America yeah yeah it was the two of these guys in so they're talking highfalutin terms medical all being medicos you know they sort of they know what a mesenchymal stem cell or mesenchymal how do you say it mizenko mesenchymal you know and you know cytokine missing Komal's cytokines you know out of sight out of kind as far as I'm concerned but it's like and they they give us the wristwatch show over the phone for about an hour and the doctors asking them questions that I can't even think of so when we hang up I said no you know translate what does all that mean he was like he translated a few things he says you know it sounds kind of interesting pretty good you know and from being an ace air he says let's call him back and I think we called you right back and we spend another hour on the phone and well to his credit Brad Brad asked for a bunch of literature and I sent him maybe 30 articles and most physicians wouldn't even look at it but it was all relevant to what hutt had and you know for the heart heart problems and kidney problems and orthopedic problems and he read all the articles and he read he read the the upside the downside and and and then then we had a to his credit then we had a very educated talk after conversation yeah and which he and he was he was really you know by this time informed I and he he just said to me well you know he's 92 he says what the hell are you got to lose I said no nothing let's go so I'm up for it we asked him is he up for tea goes hell yeah cuz he's you know they took him into the hospital he was 92 and they said what medications are you on and he said I'm not on any and they said you're 92 years old how do you account for not being on any medications is big I stay away from doctors and hospitals and you know and he didn't have any problems he started to have a rough trip well we took him down there and he got I think it was like a double dose in the hip you know so where'd you have to go this is not legal in America is that what's going on yeah right now their clinical Charles gone in the US but it's not broadly available and in Panama they passed a law in 2004 which allowed us allowed doctors actually to go down there to be able to treat people with using adult stem cells so the bill was actually designed to prohibit the use of embryonic stem cells and in this in the same law they said it's okay to use adult stem cells including those from umbilical cord basically from ethical sources and so in Panama they they gave us we have a license from the Ministry of Health to manufacture and use those cells in addition to doing clinical trials there so it's it's one place on the planet where you can get really high quality umbilical cord these this type of cell they're two major kind of stem cells we only work with one kind the mezame come all that we just call it MSC it's a lot easier and so anyway that's that's the that's how I think we were actually we actually own apartments in the same building in Panama never met each other I met we met through his brother finding us on the internet and there you go and then they brought him down to get treatment we were quite hesitant to take him you know because the last thing you want is Mel did Mel Gibson's dad to drop that in your clinic and he wasn't in great shape but you know as I recall when he got there he was in a wheelchair and like wasn't talking a lot and things like that and yeah having a pretty rough time and and then so he after getting medical clearance for him to actually fly down there and melt them down there privately then we we did some IVs on him first in the clinic and then to do the hip we need to do this ed did some IVs what do you mean so we give the umbilical cord these are these are isolated from the basically the the meet of the umbilical cord they're isolated then they're grown in our laboratory which is you know ISO 9000 and very high quality and certified by the Ministry of Health the they're grown in the laboratory and they're certified to be you know free of everything any kind of infectious disease and and I went into the clean rooms and they make you put on my hats and gloves and you know you feel like all Frankensteined out and you walk into these cold rooms and you're watching cells divide under the microscope it's kind of miraculous really look at this stuff you know so intravenous stem cells right intravenous that's correct and whatwhat's the benefit of intravenous stem cells like what does that do well the good thing is that this kind of stem cell the mesenchymal stem cells are found throughout your body and they're the normally what they do is they they modulate your immune system they decrease inflammation and they stimulate regeneration so and the good thing about them is they tend to home to areas where there is inflammation so intravenously they do a lot of things and but they can home to areas of inflammation and and they they really reduce inflammation in the body because they up regulate part of your immune system that that controls the inflammatory process which I can talk more about later but in his case you know his kidneys were in trouble his heart was in trouble and the cells they don't unlike what we used to think in the early days they don't become anything these kind of this kind of stem cell does not come become anything in your body but at homes to areas of that need repair and it secretes things that stimulates the repair and decrease the inflammation and helps out with the immune system so mote the vast majority what we treat our autoimmune diseases and in in Hutt's case we gave him IV so that that he could basically have these things on board secreting the the secreting the cytokines and the growth factors that are normally secreted and when you're 92 and you have multi organ failure you're basically running on fumes and so you put these days zero young healthy cells and they secrete these things that kind of restarts everything yeah and so what was his response to this IV treatment Wow I you know I I could I can wax lyrical about that he's almost a hundred years old and from pretty bad shape it was like bee stings it was he got a new lease of life like he got a big dose locally in the hip which fixed all his inflammation and pain and he started walking again and his kidneys were good and his heart he had a prolapsed valves in there and they healed and his cognitive powers improved his eyesight improved whoa you know and other stuff improved that I he would hate me to talk about but he had two nurses that reported to me Wow using it as a towel rack you know well Dan Bilzerian was telling me about intravenous stem cells he's and so was bas Rutten you know bas Rutten the former UFC heavyweight champion he went down and got some he's had some pretty significant neck injuries and neck fusions and he said he got intravenous stem cells the way he described it's like with his Dutch axons like it was like I had lightning coming out of my fingers like did he go to you yeah did he yeah yeah he said it was phenomenal I mean he said it's one of the most incredible experience he's ever had the the the feeling of a regeneration of energy yeah I reached out to him by email and he just to see if he it'd be okay for me to talk about him on here and he said yeah absolutely and you know his his cholesterol dropped all his numbers you know the basically numbers associated with aging all got better and and like he said he felt this tremendous energy for some periods why is this not legal here well it it's considered to be a new drug by the FDA and that's the number one reason there are four countries so far that have approved MSC products there's Canada and New Zealand were the first to go to Canada and get this time well not for only only for certain conditions so in Canada New Zealand they approved bone marrow MSC's which are in my mind are not as good as umbilical cord and I explained why and and then South Korea has approved umbilical cord from knee osteoarthritis only so the cells have to be injected into the knee and then Japan just recently approved this product that it's used to treat a very serious acute Graf acute graft-versus-host disease and children after they've had a bone marrow transplant now are there peer-reviewed studies or anything that shows the efficacy of this intravenous use of these stem cells yeah there there are hundreds three hundreds and and my book MSC which is you know you don't want to read it unless you want to go to sleep unless you're looking for something you know it's just it really is purely a research tool we have 800 references and we reference every clinical trial that's ever been done with MSDS and human beings and there were eight hundred of them well I've had some great results with stem cells dr. Roddy Magee in Las Vegas shot a bunch into my shoulder I was at the door of surgery I was like my shoulders in pain all the time I can't do a lot every time I do something I have to I sit down for a day and now I have full function I mean it's crazy I mean I was literally it still clicks I've got some weird shit in there and there's probably some stuff floating around in there but as far as like the function of my shoulder and the pain it's it's like a hundred percent I could do basically everything right right yeah I was 57 58 years old and this is like what four or five years ago and both my shoulders torn labrum arthritis bone spurs like rotator cuff issues and I went down and I got ten billion cells in each shoulder I said to the doc you know this gonna hurt he says only when it comes out the other side but he put it in and it was you could feel him Pierce the capsule and you could feel pressure and I couldn't flap my wings for three days but after that no more problems and this is different than the stem cells that you can get in the United States currently yes yeah what's the difference well from umbilical cords I had was it called what's the kind that you can get here in the United States well you can you the only thing that's legally legal in the US at least for now I don't think it's gonna be lasts much longer is from amnion yeah there's an exemption in the it's a federal federal exemption for the use of amnion for wound covering and a lot of people have now translated now they're using it in joints and things like that but you don't think they're gonna be able to do that very much longer I don't believe so why is that because this Commissioner FDA commissioners made it very clear that he doesn't like it and and they really haven't liked it for quite some time because the the exemption is for one thing and and there and everything doctors are using it for all kinds of other things I I don't necessarily agree with I just I just know what's coming down the pike from a regulatory standpoint and and they'll you know they've been some regulatory things that have come out they've gone after clinics and you know I think they've shut down three places and just in the last couple of months and they haven't gone after amnion yet but I think they're building their case for it and unfortunately that's what's going to happen so why would they go after it that's what's confusing if you've seen all these benefits and I haven't heard anything about negative results yeah I don't I don't understand it myself to be honest with you it's you know a me on it's been used clinically in the United States for over 100 years without serious adverse events but I think it's more about the claims that people are making because there there haven't been studies for example of a me on you know a me on tissue injected into a joint and I think that they're the biggest concern is the claims that are being made and maybe people are being vulnerably you know I don't know to the economics of it I'm not really sure but I know that I just you know I have my finger on the pulse and and that's it seems like they're good they're gone after fat you know we were the first in the world to use fat derived stem cells in 2006 and 2007 we published in on using those to treat rheumatoid arthritis and and multiple sclerosis and then a lot of doctors in the u.s. started doing that now now there's a new guidance the industry that came out a few months ago that specifically prohibits using it for for example taking your own fat isolating the stem cells out of it and then injecting them in your bloodstream or even injecting them into a joint so I don't I don't really know the whole the motivation behind it but I know that they they very clearly stated that that's not gonna fly anymore so the stuff that you did for male shoulder what what exactly was that that's basically a new drug product it could be considered a new drug product in the US and we are in clinical trials in the u.s. we've already we have to IND s for the treatment of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and we're just going to start a spinal cord injury trial at University of Miami and and Thomas Jefferson University we got funding from the Marcus foundation Bernie Marcus is one of our clients and he sees all these kids with spinal cord injury getting better and so our product is we we were able to figure out which cells work which which umbilical cords give cells that are really useful and which ones aren't so we throw away the vast majority of the umbilical cords that we get how did he tell well we we had the advantage of having thousands of cases and and I'll give you an example of one case of a football coach from from Dallas where I live and he had diagnosed with MS he was in and out of wheelchair was on you know basically out and he was out on disability and retired from a very successful three time state champion in Texas that's really saying something and he came down in 2010 for the first treatment and we gave him the treatment and he got much better he improved for about 14 months and then he came back again in 2011 and got another treatment improved not as much as the first time and he came down in 2012 and boom all the symptoms were gone and now he's back coaching and he is completely normal he's probably you know he's a junior he's a bit younger than me but he's probably healthier than me and the guy works out all the time he's out there in the field he doesn't have any heat intolerance didn't have any problems so I wanted to know what's the difference between those cells in 2012 and the ones in 2011 and ones 2010 and then we took other cases similar to that where we'd had Lex less than spectacular results I mean there's still good results but they weren't you know but boom and so we took cells from those different Lots and we grew them up and then we had them analyzed for 1200 different molecules that they express and we found that these cells we call them are golden cells because they they just seem to work all the time and we found that they under expressed certain proteins and then so early on in the culture process we can select for those and say hey these are golden cells these aren't throw them out so we throw we throw a whole bunch out and we keep the golden cells and we grow those up and that's those are the only cells that we use so that that's the big the big difference in the advantage we have is that we've had all those cases were able to look back retrospectively at which cells really worked and analyze them from a molecular basis and then now we can select using that so when mail came in with his shoulder injuries June an MRI first he had one but we didn't do it there but he had one yes did you do a follow-up MRI we did not know we do it feels great so you don't even bother just good I don't bother it's like my dad was walking with that pain right you know his hip was dissolved he was doing okay Wow and so are you still no problems with your shoulder how are you good you have that done oh and was that I had it done twice it was I I went 18 months and then I started it started to return the symptoms of discomfort pain and so I did it again and like it's been like a couple of years almost three years it's fine Wow yeah I was really impressed with what I was able to get done but the stuff that I wish I had dr. McGee telling me exactly what it was the stuff that he they had done to me about a year and a half ago is no longer available mm-hmm they decided that it was considered a drug and they weren't allowing that form of amniotic stem cell treatment so now there's a less effective but still effective form right so it seems like there is some sort of an effort afoot to diminish this in the United States yeah well I think they just want to control it and they want you know they want it all to go through their deal and and their process but in the meantime a lot of people are probably suffering from some pretty significant injuries that they could deal with with that far easier if this could somehow another be sped up I absolutely agree with that him so when did you start doing this down in Panama we started there in 2006 and just because of the regulations right when we found out about the regulations around 2006 and and we went straight there once we found that law the blot was passed in 2004 and then we found out about it and we went down there and we built our lab out we were actually functional in 2007 so it's we're having a 10 year anniversary what's it like in Panama never been in Panama is it weird seems like it's cool that's cool yeah it's very it's real friendly with the US I think that's the currency you spend there's US dollars oh really it goes further yeah they use u.s. dollars yeah oh yeah they use u.s. dollars I mean we kind of ran that joint for you know many years until 1999 when they would gave the canal back and that was pretty much the vast majority of the economy so we gave that back to them then they just kept the dollar and it's been you know the explosive growth it looks like Miami now it's there you know my billet the building I live in is 70 stories tall and it's not even the tallest building you know so there's so they our clinic is on the 63rd floor of a 65 storey building they're just full high-rises and of course there's a little bit too much traffic if you get that much concentration people in one place but fantastic restaurants movie theaters mall shopping high end shopping malls you name it you got everything that you want down there and you know I'd love to spend time I spend a third of my time down there that's friendly and it's relative you know it's not dangerous Wow so you have people that you that hear about you from United States and they find out about your your treatment and then fly down to Panama to get treated yeah that's right not not just the US but the probably the majority that clients are from the US and then we have people from all other places around the globe do you anticipate this moving back to the United States in any way or is this something that the hurdles are so steep that it's gonna take a long time I think we're gonna figure out a way to do it you know I think ultimately we're gonna do it we're you know just having we were the first to get an ion to treat a human being in the United States with these cells and that was three and a half years ago with the young man with the Shen's muscular dystrophy and my you know my other book that's hopefully interesting to read it's starts and finishes with his case where we traded him in Panama for a number of years and then we just petitioned FDA and said it's kind of ridiculous for us to do this down there please allow us to do it so we're using the cells that we we isolated and expanded in Panama we're using it to treat him and another now a seven-year-old with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy so that was the first wedge and then our next wedge is going to be for spinal cord injury and they're there a number of clinical trials that are going on not not just outside the US or a number going on the u.s. the biggest hurdle is that a new drug if you look at the last several years cost two and a half billion dollars to get to market and unless we do something a little bit differently on the regulatory side it's going to be it's going to be kind of hard to do this Japan has a law or that went into effect two years ago that basically allows you for allows you to once you demonstrate your product is safe then you can go ahead and start marketing it and then you have seven years in which to to demonstrate efficacy so safety first and efficacy and that's resulted in four four new drugs already and in less than two years and we have zero we have zero so they don't the only sell product that's that's approved by FDA is umbilical cord blood for the treatment of when you're doing a bone-marrow transplant that's the only thing that's approved now is there an argument for that like they just being cautious they want to make sure that there's no adverse side effects that could really be significant yeah I think there is an argument there there's an argument that they want to they want to err on the side of safety I mean that's our number one priority is to is to create create a safe environment for receiving medicines in the in the United States I think the model is a little bit is a little bit antiquated for the sell products just because they are natural products I mean if you think about it every woman that's ever given birth to a baby they have stem cells from their baby in them these MSC's you can find them 50 years later and they're not toxic and we wouldn't exist as a species if there was a inherent toxicity to genetically distinct cells because the cells are 50% mom 50% dad and their that you can find them in mom you know for her entire life so and the cure Zack was supposed to was supposed to address some of that and we'll see that that went into effect last year and we'll see going forward if that actually does affect things now I know that they're doing some stuff in the United States where they're injecting them into discs this is a new thing to regenerate discs tissue for people that have degenerative disc disease and bulging discs and disc injuries and as an alternative to either artificial discs or fusion as a first step before they move into those do you do any of that down there we don't do any right now we're we're working with a hospital that we're actually going to we're going to have a a room just for doing backs just for doing spine because there are study there's a study out of Europe just came out a couple months ago and it showed about 50% of the patients had their discs become normal on MRI after treatment so it's not every case but I would I'd take a 50/50 shot versus having to have an effusion right yeah so that's the same sort of situation that we're talking about where you're injecting it right into the discs yeah and you know you can in the United States you know we have a clinic in Dallas that the RMI clinic where we we can do bone marrow right and and so we use bone autologous bone marrow and we do do the discs in the United States and it does help a percentage of people doesn't help everybody and like we were talking before about not just not just the disc but the muscles around the disc so yeah you take somebody's had an injury my partner dr. McKenna is a orthopedic surgeon and he's been talking about this for years but if you take somebody with a disc injury and you look at the muscles right on the either side of the spine there and you'll find that they're withered away or they're marbled with fat and that's that sort of thing you take an elite athlete something super healthy works out all the time those muscles they're like they're like ropes that's a filet mignon of the human body right and you look at that and they're just black on MRI but you take somebody that's had a disc injury at any level and you can look and there's marbling there and it's withered and that sort of thing so one of the things we do in in South Lake and in Dallas is we inject the disc but also inject those muscles along the side and that's using your own bone marrow and that's still allowed in the United States so the bone marrow draw that concentrate the stem cells and inject them in those areas well that's something that we were talking about earlier when I showed you the reverse hyper when I showed you that machine and then that that dex back stretcher I think that's a significant part of the injuries that you see with people with discs with back injuries they don't have strong backs right there they're the tissue the muscle around the back that protects the spine is just very weak right right yeah it's fantastic machine I'm gonna get one yeah you gotta get one too Mel yeah you got a crazy back dude that picture you showed me your back is fucking bananas yeah I had done down in Texas yeah yeah no actually had that done it and yeah in Texas yeah how many treatments have you had well there was that one and then I had the shoulders twice and then I just had them drop it into my vein you know just run around what's that like that's pretty cool I mean you feel a little sleepy for a couple of days and then you feel pretty energetic really sleeping yeah they kind of I think it takes its toll on you I mean I don't know why you feel sleepy Neil may have an explanation for that but yeah well we hear ya the cells are going to kind of re educate the immune system you know a lot like a lot of what we treat our rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis autoimmune diseases and there's a retraining that's going on in the immune system and so that that involves cytokines and those molecules those peptides are the things that make you feel sick I mean when you get the flu the flu virus doesn't make you sick it's your body's immune reaction to that that's the stuff that's being thrown off from the from the fight that's what actually makes you feel sick and so when you're activating certain thing parts of the immune system and and they're thrown off things can make you a little bit tired some people very small percentage have some flu-like symptoms for one day but those are that's kind of like the extent of the the side effects that we typically see but if you if you look at like but yeah you asked why hasn't been being done the us for for rheumatic drugs so you put you see them on TV they're advertised basically every hour of every day on almost every station you sees and rheumatics and you know if you have rheumatoid arthritis if you have psoriatic arthritis or this sort of thing these are biologics and these are antibodies to a certain molecule called TNF TNF one of the commanders of the immune system it kind of says hey let's let's cause a bunch of inflammation and make you miserable and so the the these drugs basically bind up or stop up the TNF that's in your body for a period of time that's why you have to get retreated like every month every six months every two months something like that six weeks to two months and you have to get retreat and retreated there's a study of rheumatoid arthritis where they it was 172 people that were already on on medication for rheumatoid arthritis not adequately controlled they gave them like the equivalent of what a typical dose we give in Panama is like roughly 120 million cells and all of them got better all of them symptomatically improved and and the cool thing was that that TNF alpha and another molecule similar similar to it decreased by 50% and that decrease persisted for eight and a half months that was the length of the study so rather than putting an antibody in two to top up what's being produced apparently by your immune system you the cells tell your immune system to stop it right the cells they up regulate a certain immune cell called T regulatory cell that says to the immune system hey quit making TNF alpha quit making this il-6 stuff and they took 30 patients of the sub-cohort like three months later and gave them another shot the same dose and it dropped their levels another 50% from that baseline so from from baseline to post second treatment two treatments two IVs and in the chair dropped their levels 75% it just seems like something that would be amazing for overall repair like just go down there and let your body just get a little dose of healing to figure out what the fuck is wrong with it well I'll talk about like we talked about something in Costa Rica we were both there and I had a you know they looked at my neck I had a 50% occlusion in the right carotid you know like buildup of stuff like like you don't feel it happening all of a sudden you know all of a sudden when your carotid to shut down they think well you have to eat the statins right yeah like Chris Tora lipitor you know I looked at what the side effects of those things are terrible yeah and I said I'd rather die than eat those things and they said well you and they try make you feel guilty for not doing you got kids you got you know like yeah but it's uh I don't have that stuff now and I didn't get anyone to go in and remove it and I don't know if I can attribute that to the cells but I got a bunch of cells like twice and that went away now I talk about that for a minute does that sort of yeah well just in general your your body that you have a certain number of these cells when you're born and they they age just like the rest of your body and they they they perform more poorly as you age right so if you take one of these cells from a newborn like when you were born you could pluck one of these cells out throw it in a petri dish and let it grow you let it grow for a month it divides roughly every 24 hours or that's the doubling rate so at the end of a month you have a billion cells and then at at if you take from a 35 year old and do the same thing doubling times like two days instead of one day and you at the end of a month you have 32,000 cells and you take them from a 65 year old who's relatively healthy and they divide every 60 hours if you get 200 cells at the end of the month so if your problem is a thousand cells or it's twenty thousand cells or if it's a million cells you can't get it done past a certain age just because it cells don't have the regenerative capacity and the good thing about the umbilical cord cells is they if you co-culture them with these older people's cells with the young cells they don't have to touch each other just the secretions of the young cells will make the young the old cells start dividing faster and behaving younger and the mitochondria in my book you can see a picture of of cells from a 65 year old diabetic and without any with without any juice on them and then you put the juice from the young cells on there and they look like 18 year old MS CS with with the functional might of mitochondria all throughout the cell body rather than all bunched up they have they look help they just I mean as a cell biologist I know what looks healthy and anybody else would you can see just from the picture how vastly different it is just to be exposed to the to the juice you know you heard of this para bio so study they did at Harvard where they took young life and and their young mice and they and they sewed them together with old mice and then the old mice actually got younger and and that mean they'd use the blood of the young mice and put it in the old mice well they literally showed them together so their bodies together so their bodies together and so their blood streams together oh gee so that the blood stream is mixing and so that you the young that's some Frankenstein Shay yeah that's pretty Frankie but they so at the end at the end of the study they showed that that that the older the older mice got their neurologic system got better the cardiovascular system got better skeletal muscle got better everything got better and and one of the key molecules in there is called G d/f 11 and gdf 11 is if we when we look at the secret tome that's what these cells secrete when they're growing and we pull that out we quantify it in the top four every time is G d/f 11 from the golden cells so the golden cells are overproducing g f 11 which is one of the key molecules for stimulating regeneration in your body so what other audio move immune diseases do you think could be assisted by this well we we do a lot of MS as prior number one indication we just finished a clinical trial prospective clinical trial we submitted for publication and should be it should be coming out in the next month or so and and and statistically significantly the these patients improve dramatically and as far as side-effect profile is it was highly minimal I mean field headaches and a few few flu-like symptoms things like that how many people this was what twenty people and one of the one individuals actually is clinically is perfect and all of his legions went away and and we only did one treatment with these typically with MS it's more refractory than rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis usually after one treatment people get a ton of benefit with MS they usually see after two or three treatments that they they really they see the most benefit and we only did one treatment in this in this trial but one gentleman had three lesions in his brain all three lesions completely disappeared so ms is a big thing rheumatoid arthritis is that is a big thing and I tell you there's stories in the knot stories but you know people talking about with their responses and it's pretty incredible there's one lady that her husband was a PhD physicist he carried on working just so she could afford just so she could have insurance to afford the medications which were around a hundred grand a year for her to get treated for rheumatoid arthritis and she came down about it'll be it's a little over three years ago November and she hasn't been on any medication since she actually started walking around the mall when she was in Panama and then when she got home she's completely you know pain free and she's been pain free for three years and her husband finally retired because he didn't care about you know having the insurance to pay for these very expensive drugs that she was taken so MS rheumatoid arthritis lupus we don't we don't have a lupus protocol there's there's a group in China that's that's published six really good papers on lupus it's very very effective in in their trials we haven't done it yet and and then autism you know it's it's not considered an autoimmune disease but we have a trial we just completed our autism trial with 3333 enrollees with very good results many many of those kids became not autistic after treatment that's confusing to me because you talked about people that are young right so why why would it have such a benefit for them well I wrote an article in 2007 about why these cells should be good for autism and and and basically it it's and it's the most downloaded article this journal ever had and something like 75,000 people have downloaded a scientific journal article which really doesn't happen very often but kids people with autism have inflammatory things going on in their body a lot of times in the gut there are in the in the in the at the end of the small intestine there are these inflammatory nodules that look a lot like Crohn's disease and they secrete these this inflammation that thing goes to the brain inflames the white matter of the brain the white matter of brain swells decreases the blood flow to the brain all that's in you know intertwined and then just a few years ago there was a study that came out and this is what this is what allowed us to go forward with our clinical trial they found that there are these two inflammatory molecules that are MDC enteric and they're perfectly correlate with the severity of symptoms of autism and so we measured not only those two but another 30-some biomarkers we measure we did quantitative EEG s we did a lot of standardized scoring stores scoring with a neurologist that that read them you know before treatment during treatment after treatment so I believe a lot of the problems with autism have a stem from the inflammatory status and these cells are definitely anti-inflammatory you know they've had some benefit with changing the diet and changing the gut biome of the kids with autism and they've made some benefits for that and which they they believe is also connected to inflammation yeah absolutely if your if your immune system is freaking out every time you eat a piece of bread and that in that immune systems thrown out molecules that are swelling your brain and inflaming your brain then it makes complete sense and yeah you know the I think in general that the people with autism that do the best are the ones that get that address before they come down you know there's some other doctors that do functional medicine and they look at their diet they look at see if they have any heavy metals and that sort of thing and the ones that just are slam dunk do the best i've been cleaned up before they come down well so what about heart disease you were saying you were talking about people that have heart issue yeah we have a number of patients with heart failure that have responded quite well failure heart failure so heart attack need of a transplant that kind of thing yeah yeah on transplant list and that's one thing yeah so I have a friend who's on a transplant list yeah right so there are different kinds of heart failure and so but the other thing interesting about heart failures the cells don't need to go to the heart and to actually become new heart cells and that sort of thing it's actually the secretions of the cells like I said before there was there was a study at University of Buffalo where they took they injected cells IV in a hamster model of heart failure and and then they looked in the in the heart and there were very few cells but the heart failure got better and then they said let's inject let's inject those same cells these are ms the umbilical embassy's inject them into the into the hamstring muscle and they demonstrated that none of the cells came out of hamstring muscle and yet the heart failure got better so then they took just the juice the liquid that the cells secrete and they started stimulated the amount of juice that the cells would have produced in the body and just injected the jews and the heart failure got better so it's really the secretions of the cells stimulating the natural repair augmenting the natural repair process of the body that has spent stretched to its limit you know if you have a 65 year old those cells aren't dividing very well this the juice can help the cells divide faster and produce more repair molecules and make it better so do you think that it could take someone who's on a heart transplant list and literally fix their heart I've seen it happen time and again Wow and there there are clinical trials using similar cell types that also have demonstrated that you know there's a there's a molecule called BMP which is high in heart failure the BNP came down in every single case the injection ejection fraction which measures kind of like the efficiency how much how much blood your heart's pumping on each stroke went up and every single patient you know I think are in in the book the the craziest case was like it was a gringo who was down in Costa Rica in it and he he he was our I don't know he's probably 20 25 percent routinely but he got a viral disease or something else he was 11 percent ejection fraction normal is about sixty and they the the regular the regular hospital who worked a lot with us using with our spinal cord patients and seeing results seeing people walking again they they just said you can't get on a plane you're at 3,700 feet if you get on a plane you'll be dead your modules go see these guys over the stem cell place and see if anything can happen and I think his cases in the book as well but he went from 11 to 42 or something like that that he wasn't the first case the first case was a doctor who's a friend of Georgie's friend doctor pause or medical director who had congenital so his mother had died heart failure his sister had died his brother had died and he was you know not even 50 years old in his ejection fraction was you know hovering around 30 percent and a lot of people at you know at an advanced age you're not even going to get on the list because if you if you're if you're a 50 or 60 year old and there's a 20 year old ahead of you 20 year olds gonna win and so he begged and begged to come down he was our first patient we didn't really want to take him because we didn't know what was going to happen because nobody had ever done it and we treated him and he went back and he had has had a ejection fraction you know echocardiogram and it was 52 percent and then the doctor didn't believe it so he did redid it a month later it was 55 percent so you know it's not I don't think it's for every case we have people with like a super bad heart attack and there's not enough to repair and you really need heart transplant but I think I think you're gonna see that it's ultimately I think in in 20 years you're probably to see standard of care for diseases chronic diseases like any chronic degenerative disease for which there's no good treatment you're gonna see standard of care is going to be young healthy missing Komal stem cells because if you look at the root cause if I get a question what how is it how is it these things work for so many things well when the root cause is a lack of or dysfunction of those cells then it makes sense that replenishing those or restoring with young healthy wounds could be a useful treatment well Mel this is so important to you that you wanted to come out and talk about this you wanted to let people know about this shit yeah I think it's amazing and it seems a crime to me that you know it isn't easier to do in this country where you know we're an advanced country I mean they should look a little harder at it and it's a mystery to me why it isn't the case but you know hey if there are places where one can go and get some help it's good I mean I know another a gal she's a good friend of mine she tore her shoulders up because she was like an athlete and she had her shoulders down and she got some dropped into her and that actually helped greatly with an autoimmune disorder that she had and then she was able to have kids it was that kind of thing you know yeah there's some really good animal data showing that you can inject these cells and you can take ovarian failure and reverse it and in her case she she had an autoimmune disease and she was in unable to have children told that from the very young age and after treatment she got pregnant pretty quickly this sounds almost too good to be true this is almost like skeptical people that are listen to this right now probably this fucking shit everything yeah it sounds like the old spruiker on the corner good for moles holes and pimples on big ones but you've got studies you mean you've got real trials to back this up and you've got a host of patients that have healed up and and and healthy yeah yeah shut up well if you see a 92 year old man who's about ready to kick the bucket and he's almost a hundred he's gonna celebrate 100 years in August so and it's incredible he's better off than he was let me tell you yeah this young guy with the Duchenne's muscular dystrophy you know this the cells don't last forever this is also an important point with the Shen's it's a it's a it's a genetic defect so they're missing a protein and these cells go in this in animal models these cells you give them to animal they go into the muscle and then they they start secreting that molecule that they're missing but they only last for about four or five to six months and then the then they start maturing and then the immune system clears them it's a real important point you don't have that with embryonic stem cells because they cause tumors and things like that and the great thing about these cells they don't cause tumors because they differentiate they don't want to be a baby they're just there to do their job which is to keep homeostasis the immune system controlled can you know help with regeneration and all that sort of thing I talked about that but the embryonic stuff because I find this interesting the embryonic step is full of weird anomalies and stuff yeah you know we wrote we a few of us got together and wrote an article when they finally put the clamp on the last embryonic stem-cell treatment and we've been saying for years that embryonic stem cells aren't gonna work because they want to become babies their number-one problem is they want to become babies they don't want that these cells that cells that we start with they don't want to become babies the babies are already born these are they're mature they're missing camel and and that's what they are and that's they're never gonna be anything else whereas the embryonic stem cells the biggest problem with them is they always form tumors they form teratomas and so in order for them to be functional you have to grow them out and if you want them to have MSc like qualities you have to force them to become MSC's and then you have to make darn sure that there aren't any that if it takes one if there's one left then it's going to form a tumor so that was the big problem that the expense you know three four hundred thousand dollars a dose just to make sure that they didn't have one in them and then they weren't is beneficial and they've been monkeyed within the lab from when they were embryonic and then converted and converted and converted and converted and then grown up in huge numbers and so they were monkeyed with and this these cells you don't have to monkey with them they just do it naturally you just take them out you digest them you you put them in a nutrient broth and the right temperature and humidity and oxygen levels and they just grow and so the you know the we wrote an article about embryonic stem cells that we call the the king is the king is dead long live the king because you know the the California the California voters need your three billion dollars towards embryonic stem cell work and you know against the Bush administration's restriction of spending money on embryonic stem cell research it wasn't banned as most people said all they said was we're not going to use taxpayer money federal taxpayer money to go towards that and what people heard was they don't want they don't want progress well what's happened is they at last count I think they spent you know two two and three-quarter billion dollars I got two hundred fifty million dollars left and guess what they're studying now adult stem cells they're studying umbilical cord stem cells they're studying missing komal stem cells they've completely cut out everything on the embryonic side because it just took that long there was so much misinformation out there and and now thank God it's gone and and we regained our sanity but we blue we blew a lot of dough on the whole embryonic oh yeah it was a lot of money and we paid as taxpayers in California for that you know because people were misinformed so if a person's listening to you right now and they've got some issues what's the first step they should take well I say guys got a blown knee and it's thinking about getting surgery yeah well they could go you know our website is sell medicine see e ll medicine calm for Panama if you know if there's if it's something that can be addressed with bone marrow in the US RMI clinic calm that's our thought the bone marrows is not as effective well it can be it's it's hard to say because everybody's bone marrow is different your age is different you know if you're 85 years old even if you're 65 years old and you're a smoker or you're diabetic I don't think it's worth typically using your bone marrow because it's just not going to do a lot but younger younger people healthier people a lot of times you can you know when it's in a joint because that's the only thing we can do in the US as orthopedics so but if it's an orthopedic problem then you know they could check out see it see if they could you know we could do something for them in Dallas if it's not orthopedic and you need systemic treatment for autoimmune disease if you have a spinal cord injury or autism any of those conditions and they go to sell medicine cels and calm and that's where we have there's all the information there and they fill an application doctors get back with them and get in the system now how difficult is it to go down the pan Aman get treatment like how do you schedule that well that's that's all taken care of there's a whole team of people that do that the only thing is you need a passport and there's no visa required or anything like come on is that flight from LA it's six hours it's way far east so it's like tents like going to Miami it's like two-hour yeah it's actually two a little over two hours from Miami so because it's cuz its way east to somewhere south of Atlanta it's closer to New York right yeah it's five five five four nine five New York oh my god so sell medicine calm they go there contact you now do they need to have some sort of a consultation with a local doctor an MRI or anything like that before they go to see you oh yeah they need to have a diagnosis from physician for what they have and then you know that we have a team of doctors there and they'll talk to them and see what they need if they need any other information any other you know x-rays or MRIs or whatever they'll sort all that out this is all fascinating stuff man and I never thought about going to Panama until about an hour ago now I'm thinking of taking a trip six hours it's worth it yeah I just want to feel the intravenous stuff I want to feel what bas Rutten was talking about the lightning bolts coming off my finger he's a little dramatic yeah he's definitely dramatic I wouldn't say that to his face with a smile only but yes when you treated him he was going through some pretty significant issues with his neck yeah yeah what benefits did he find off of that well you know I don't think for his neck it structurally we weren't able to get the cells there and I don't know if there's enough left you know it's a lot of people there's nothing if there's nothing structurally to you know to do anything but thought people talk about you know hair loss and these cells work for hair loss and yeah they do pretty good job but you can't grow you can't grow grass on concrete you know right and you can't you can't stimulate a nerve to regrow that's a there's no but not even a thread left well he didn't get I don't believe you got any benefit from his as accident problem but he you know the metabolic benefits were fantastic for him and and energy wise and things like that yeah his one of one of his issues is that he has some atrophy on one of his arms because his nerves and his neck were being pinched and for a long time and he didn't address it quick enough and it got to the point where his armor shrinking right yeah and that's one of the reasons why I went down there did the experience any benefit from that I don't believe he did no no that's a tough one right regeneration of nerve well especially really long time out you know for like for spinal cord injury we did a we did a cohort analysis and and basically if if they're within one year of injury a hundred percent of a hundred percent of the patients had restoration of some neurologic function it was between one and two years is 82 percent it was after two years it was fifty percent so the longer it is and also the older you are the less month you have left you know the reason these cells work for spinal cord injuries they don't become spine they don't become nerves or anything like that but the spinal cord is one of the most replete areas of the body when it comes to blood vessels there's just barely enough blood vessels to keep it alive and your liver on the other hand has just tons of blood vessels in it and your liver you know you cut 80% of your liver out and it'll regrow itself with your spinal cord you just kind of ding a little bit and it won't repair itself that's because there are no blood vessels and therefore there are no MSC are very few MSC's it's like 150th the number of MSC's reside in your spinal cord because we built this wonderful cage around it to protect it and so all we're doing is we we shoot the cells in there we also give them IV and the cells secrete the things that are necessary for this for the spinal cord to regenerate itself but the longer it is from imagery the more scarring there is and all that sort of thing the less benefit you're going to see so do you anticipate a time where they'll be able to regenerate spinal tissue or someone has got a spinal cord injury where they have partial or some sort of paralysis when they can be able to regenerate that I do and we have many cases that it's already happened really yeah like what cases well you know Juan Carlos Maria is a commercial pilot from Costa Rica and he was one day flying as a National Geographic photographer around and in his private plane and a pancake and both of them got spinal cord injuries JC you say pancake you mean crashed crash a plane yeah yeah they were up on a volcano and there's like some crazy winds and stuff and it just it just dropped out of the sky and landed on the ground and and he had he had no no function and no no sensation below the injury basically from his belly button down had no erectile function no bowel function bladder function any of that stuff and you know the first time we treated him and how are you treating him we're giving him IV cells and intrathecal so into the spinal fluid so the first the first round of treatments after that his his biggest is he had he described as like a 10 out of a 10 pain scale so he had this neuropathic pain that was just like he was shoveling down narcotics like nobody's business and he after the first treatment he didn't get any restoration of the function or anything but his pain dropped from a 10 to a 3 and so he got off to narcotics then the second time we treated him he got his left leg back and he could move it okay we started treating him six months and three days after his accident and then so he got the the first round of treatments was in you know the first month and it was about three months later we did the second round three months later he got his right leg back and then three months later it was over about a year at fifteen month period probably in total he basically got everything back you got erectile function he got bowel bladder all that sort of thing and you know I just I just had dinner with him the other night in Costa Rica and he can walk in here and he got his commercial pilot's license back and you know he started a new business and you know he has 100% he's I wouldn't say a hard percent because he does have a bit of a limp but he broke his leg when he was four wheeling so before after the accident he broke boy know so yeah so he got all better and then he was perfectly fine and then he in four-wheeling and breaks his leg so yeah so he was a hundred percent then he fucked himself up again yeah so he lips a little bit but but most people don't know that he ever had a spinal cord injury you know that's incredible so you feel like with conventional treatment that guy would still be in a wheelchair yeah absolutely yeah I mean he was that he made zero progress so that we're designing this study at mine that we're doing at Miami that's being funded by the Marcos people there are two newer neurosurgeons that are on that so we wanted to okay we're discussing what at what at what time point should we accept him and these these very prominent neurosurgeons said let's do six months because that's six months you got 98 to 99 percent back everything you're gonna have so let's do patients their subjects better from six months to two years and so that's the those are the inclusion criteria that's a timing that we're going to do for this study at Miami this is phenomenal so is that study published online is there anything we're or this case rather published on that case is post online yeah absolutely it's referencing my book it's its own you have to it's yeah what's reference in both books but in the spinal cord chapter so stem cell therapy rising tide is the one that it's written for the layperson there you go that that it so it's referenced in there and the whole story about Juan Carlos and his you know his journey and you know how he got started and everything's in there as well as a reference to the published article that's in a scientific journal about this case and then MSC is the one that you read if you want to go to sleep or if you're a super nerd exactly exactly and sell medicine dot-com that's the that's the website yep CEO Melissa man this is fantastic stuff and I mean I'm very intrigued and I really I hope people that have issues can reach out to you and and try to see if you can get some treatment and if I would love to hear back from them I mean what what happened with you and what happened with your dad it's just incredible and the stuff that I've experienced in the United States seems like it's not nearly as potent as the stuff that you're using down there and I've had some pretty dramatic results yeah so it's incredible stuff cool TJ Dillashaw says hi oh you know TJ yeah he came down there and yeah it came down there like three months before the last fight and he got his belt back and he's really happy on well yeah he told me I could tell you everything he's got IVs and he got his shoulder done because he was his shoulder was really bothering him so that was that was it and then he and he went down to Panama to get all that done yeah how'd you find out about him yeah all right frankly I don't know maybe Bozz or else in that we've had a few MMA guys and I asked them in bahs bahs and he both said that is okay to talk about it I'm going down there yeah yeah well listen man was a real treat real pleasure I'm so fascinated about this stuff because of my own personal experience with the you know the limited amount of stem cell treatment that I've gotten but I've had great results I had a knee injury that was bothering me forever I don't feel it at all anymore the shoulder doesn't bother me at all anymore I mean it's uh it's pretty amazing stuff and from what you're saying I'm getting a very watered down not nearly as potent version of what you have in Panama yeah Wow okay so sell medicine calm yes sir and then the books again our MSC say that word again missile mesenchymal stem cell stem cells and stem cell therapy a rising tide Mel Gibson thank you very much thank you this man in here hey appreciate it all right fuckers read into this look it up get healthy [Music] [Applause] [Music]
