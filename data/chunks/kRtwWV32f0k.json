fucking break look at that supreme crowbar they sell a crowbar so the crowbar we just have like the name supreme on it okay who's using that no one uses it it's like that it's real you have to look into the brand a little bit to understand it but it's sort of part of the joke almost there making parody of the craziness of it all by just throwing their brand name on stuff and people are buying into it go back to the page so supremely we're in top 10 non wearable supreme products Jesus Christ they have fire extinguishers yeah new trucks but some of the clothes are cool diff nunchucks it's

hilarious supreme nunchucks did we wait on line we were not for anything like last night was watching something the real story about the Godfather and they showed when they released the Godfather at New York and there were lines yeah the movies yeah I'm sure waited in line you'll see Star Wars but not three fucking days can't doubt the night before not for a hammer what did they camp out for back to him they kept out for something really I feel like the first I ever saw it was iPhones when the first iPhones were out I remember going to the mall and going what in the fuck am I seeing and there was a giant lion outside the Apple store and this was like when one of the first iPhones was coming out and I was like quiet waiting for a phone you don't have a phone already like this it's the only way to get the phone I was it was all so confusing but it was a thing where people would wait in mine and then they would look at each other and I remember when I remember when they were waiting in line for Harry Potter when Harry Potter was coming out and people would drive him by earlier yell and now Dumbledore dies at the end another they're yelling out all these different spoilers all I typed in was waiting in line for in Google and the only things that come up are iPhone supreme and iPhone 8 or gasps yeah that's right the seventies with the flag yeah red green a yellow flag what was that there was like in the mid 70s there was a gas shortage so Green meant that you got gas if you had an odd-numbered like if your license plate under the nod yellow was even and then red was were shut down bitch oh yeah that's you remember that they had to fly in 73 to 75 maybe something like I don't know the exact dates then they had a weird line studio 54 had a huge line but you got picked Studio 54 3 or 54 was on fire you showed up and you didn't guarantee to get in you got picked right the way they do now in Hollywood like they pick hot chicks right so they pick hot chicks what was the thing we're talking about one night they won't let a guy in without a check something yes I'm for me going to go out in clubs and yeah they never would let guys in without chicks so if you walk into a club with three guys they don't want you they want the chicks in there first yeah well the glass thing one is a sausagefest look at all those dudes try to get in look at Stewart look at this that was inside but outside the deal are the people well that could be it no that's outside that sound what a zoo I just try to get in just to try to get it what was the big deal about studio 54 you could snort coke dance get your dick sucked and get your shoe shines all at the same place and be home by 6:00 it was a vet you know I mean everybody was dead like this is that Andy Warhol it's Andy Warhol but was the girl look at us she's got a be a bottle in her mouth you know champagne on champagne yeah fucking Black Sabbath this 154 look at Mick Jagger's wife dancing with any Warhol looking liza minnelli behind them Wow so it's just like the place to be it was the place to be you could go crazy strange he strange times huh but here's the beauty of it they have a station but serious and it's called Studio 54 you can just put it on on Sunday nights they do a podcast and what they do is they interview people that actually used to go there or work there and I never tell you something John they had a dentist on about a year ago and his wife that it was crazy listening to this interview about what their life was they were professional dentist making money in New York they stayed out till 5:00 6:00 every night but went home took the kids to school went back home took a nap - one got up went to the dental office work till 5:00 went home took another that fed the kids and at nine o'clock they'd fuck him bring the kids downstairs to their moms and they do it all over again five nights a week over and over and then the lady was saying not till he is Leila Liza Minnelli thought I was a publicist she goes she didn't know I was a dentist they just saw you in there it was draw trust funders you know that's all the people who could do that type of shit do blow till all hours of the night you could put it out they even had an interview about when Bob home went to studio 54 five hope I hope walk through the studio that know what the fuck he was gonna wear he was gonna walk into he went out to the middle of the floor and started dancing and these chicks got together started tying Bob Hope up just tying them around like an Indian he's just dinner like laughing Bob Hope style don't you think it's just a fucking joke they just left him there and they just tie them up and left them there tons of stories out there like that you know like just but then they moved on but you got picked to go in there how did it move on like imagine how weird it must have been when it finally the door shut and that was it the people were it was their whole life for years people move on you know clubs get hot different clubs I went that one time and they a three maybe eighty four it was done my friend who's already done yeah every time it was just a bunch as I was trying to be cool Wow and I found the holla bill I was out of money with a bag of blow no cash not a dime in my pocket can I look down there for no more there was a holla bill and that's how I got saved that's how I got home wow that was it that's my studio 54 story it is weird those clothes the nightclub scene the nightclub scenes a very strange scene now one club gets hot and then it dies off and the people that are in that business like try to figure out what makes something hot and what doesn't you got to rename places and redo them and reopening and grand reopening and get people to show up like I remember hearing that they were paying Paris Hilton like shit piles of money to just show up a club that's it the Kardashians and any of those people they pay a shitload of money you're there they take pictures and the club gets hot now after buddies start taking partners it yeah shut because you know what's on the way down I'm so against you so after a year some guy comes and I love your place oh yeah I'll take care of ya and that's how you get out of it or you do a lot of people didn't they just like the place on fire stuff and scratch a little Jewish lightning the play starts to scratch you know I knew the guy that owned the gay clubs in Houston like in the 70s and he was telling me one time he was you know once we got our you side of him you let him on fire like the insurance and then open up another club that's it Jewish lightning Jesus Christ it's a weird scene you know I mean people that just look forward to just going out and just drinking and dancing and snorting coke every night just looking for like experience just something different and wild it takes him out of their everyday grind just do it over and over and over and over different like when I was growing up it was club area was big and the rooftop you paid like 24 bucks to go in at 11 o'clock and you drank all night till 7:00 in the morning 24 bucks all you could drink it's shit booze I mean you're not drinking kavadi and shit right when you're doing blow you just burner that shit anyway you come out they give you sunglasses and that's it if you went in after three was it was like 20 something after 11 and then like 17 bucks or you could drink after three so seven in the fuckin morning and people were packed that's what New York was about back then it was just people staying out those seven six New York is what a four am glass call once last call in New York I've no idea Florida I think it's even later than New York Florida Florida it closes for one hour five o'clock in the news cafe right well bullshit and we're having a good time at five o'clock they'll come over to you and say hey do me a favor by five o'clock the bars are the closed so you can't ought to be until 6:00 so we just all the twenty five beers and you wait to the ball pizza six and now you're fuckin ready to drink again I got this for one hour one hour this was back you know twenty years ago 15 years ago I'm gonna grow

or we did West Palm after Joel opened up that new place the big giant Sal I saw some great place yeah then the new place though is like a theater it's like 600 seats it's fucking huge I mean that's a huge club it's a great place that I and even for a lot of there was a great club inside the casino which they read the / oh yeah that shut down oh dude shut down till next year yeah we have no action now there no kidding that was a fun little clutch a fun little Club because that's a good size that one there in the Hard Rock's good so that's a good size yeah the last time I was there there was a couple next to me that was fuckin in the bedroom next to me and like animals I mean like fucking animals I mean like porno film animals like like I was lying in bed and I heard the any was in the afternoon I was trying to take a nap but these people were I was like Jesus Christ that fucking Florida oxycotin dick one of those pain relief centers you take two of those things you get your hammer with a dick 10 times and she won't go dead bas Rutten total story the other day that I read online I'm one of martial arts websites about his addictions that's a great article Oh scary scary shit scary shit well he was talking about trying to get off of it and how difficult it was and you're talking about a guy with like an iron will you know in bas Rutten imagine the average person who just has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning doesn't have a lot of discipline and they get hooked like that's it that's it you're gone it's fucking amazing that stuff's legal did you watch 60 minutes three weeks ago no that was the whole look that was the motherfuckers motherfucker it wasn't just about the open opioid epidemic it Oh the DEA stop prosecuting the word came from you know it's just a nightmare they're fucking terrible things listen those things are terrible yeah there was a whole article recently about the company that that sells most of the opioids and the family that's behind that company and how many billions of dollars that they've made off the opioid crisis opioid opioid or bid how we say opioid I always say it wrong once that should grips you that's synthetic heroin that's what that right isn't yeah potentially yeah it's uh it's a bad grip like I said I took a sixteenth one night in my living room and I had to lay down and that was my that's my whole resume with ox and cons and I'm a fucking mule I can eat 2,000 milligrams of THC and live 1/16 and one of those pills I popped it was just a little piece nothing my blood pressure drops so fucking much I just laid down went to sleep and I knew my pill correct I'm doing that and never even let it start really never even let it start can you believe brother in two weeks is gonna be ten years since I've done that white powder we need to think about that Wow I really think about I still remember being at Cobbs with you that January and like going it's been two months I don't know if I could really do this shit like I don't know if I control this feeling and I controlled it so you like when you quit what was like the first week like hell hell first two weeks were hell did you think about going back just like I can't do this or did you know that you had to make a change I had to make a change I knew that my spine was starting to hurt I knew this is buying this time yeah I was trying to get jolt in this by 4:00 in the morning you know after you do coke oh right at the tip over here people done coke get like Parkinson's you think that's related well a lot of lot of old-timers that did a lot of coke in the 70s and then they wound up like some serious neuromuscular Bob salute that shit shops gee a central nervous system there was times I did cocaine that was like electric it was like when you put that thing in your hands or you get electrocuted you could feel the electric in your body and next day like that like in your brain like you can actually see this is the neurotransmitters the fucking on fire you could feel that you know I could tell when I would go on stage after doing two or three nights a blow that week I had no control I really had no control over my material I no control over my delivery that's what I want to tell you like you're just the way you keep running off yeah I can't grip it you can't sell the joke the facial doesn't connect with the hand movement Oh or the breathing so like I knew that that was always going to be a danger in the future now you know I take all that uh for like a year I drank those what's your buddy's name that makes the neurosurgeon no shakes the football player they fuck the guy up Romanowski I took all his stuff for like a year just to did you yeah the orange drink is for neuro one that stuff okay yeah it felt good to feel a lot better I didn't give you brain some nutrition control yeah but ten years I mean that that I had to do a benefit in Hoboken and I gotten high like that whole summer I tried to get off coke I was doing the heroin I was trying to get off the coke and shit and then that September I ran out of heroin so I was doing like maybe once a week and the whole thing went down in Maryland I knew I had to stop and then I had this thing in Hoboken I went whole thing went down Marilyn Martinez yeah when she died he was dying I would I went back east that week and she was dying I don't know what happened it was like you know what I was trying to get coke on Friday night I couldn't get it and I just took it for what it was I was trying to get coconuts Saturday I couldn't get it so fuck it I took the plane back son there couldn't get it here something happened I couldn't get it and then that Monday I had a meeting to do a movie and at the end of the of the meeting the guy said listen man we know about your drug problems so before you say yes we want you to think about this because you can't miss a day on this movie you cannot be late if you're late the whole movie can't shoot because it was a cast hmm we all shot in one room wasn't they a meeting so I thought about it I'll do it and that was the roughest fucking month ever cuz I was just going home and before 8 o'clock would start I would just go to bed because 8 o'clock was my cocaine time that's when my body would start to ache that's when I couldn't even you could be telling me the most important thing in your life and I'd be watching you but I couldn't hear mmm all my mind was focusing on was getting that blow at 8 o'clock Wow and then I would figure out how to get the 60 bucks you know I'm gonna go to the ATM machine I would shoot over the rock and roll' rouse there's an ATM machine in front of rock and roll Ralph's right there yeah and I would take sixty bucks out that I would run every red light to get to the ATM machine but I didn't give a fuck fuck and then from there we just make the u-turn go to my dealers house go home and leave the coke there and now he's ready for the night I was in peace just knowing that the coke was at the house I didn't have to do it you know I've never been physically addicted to something in a way where I had a hard time kicking it but I've had some psychological addictions for sure and I think that one of the things that's that I've gotten out of this month of no the sober October thing that Tom Burton Ari and I are doing is that a lot of it is psychological law because just knowing that we can't smoke pot or can't drink all month you start thinking about oh we're at the home stretch November 1st around the corner like I don't really feel like I need to get high it's not like I need a drink tomorrow but it's knowing that I can't do it for the month where it hangs over your head so that's what's even more impressive that you could kick it because it's not just the fact that you you have like a physical problem but you also have this psychological problem like the psychological part of it is like it's it's a pattern that you're comfortable with you got used to that pattern of 8 o'clock you're looking for the coke you go into it and then you're off it's like you're off even though you're you're in chaos your life's in disarray and you're in the grips of addiction you're comfortable with that feeling you've been there before and you're but for whatever reason when people get used to fucking up and they go why do I keep fucking up one of the reasons you keep fucking up because you're used to fuck you and it's not an uncomfortable feeling in the sense that it's it's even you know it might suck but you know it's the devil you know you know that was nice I didn't want to do it I still did it in this family yeah I didn't want to do it like I didn't need to do it like I feel I just want to do it but it was just something to do like it was just something that don't Wow it was just something to do but you know what I tell people all the time is you want to have to quit it just doesn't happen like I quit at 44 I'm no fucking genius but it took me two years like it was a two-year struggle like a personal little struggle like when it was with you that you were free cuz you didn't go to a no Narcotics Anonymous I went to one meeting and they ain't meeting him I want in Hollywood which everything is good until you go to an Hollywood because in Hollywood you act at you you add to dramatic and the actor image to it you know if you go to a meeting in Jersey they're in there smoking camel Reds fucking talking from the heart you gonna lay a meeting in Hollywood you got people with AAA tattoos on their arm I'll give each other you know it's a fucking Jamboree this is happy to be in a yeah it's a new clan that they're in and then what happens is after about two months in this area for some reason I've noticed cuz I have a lot of friends are they a they somebody approaches you this is high you know what's going on you're like I'm struggling really why have you seen dr. Bob like dr. Bob gosh I'm just making this crap they're like dr. Bob oh my god to tell about dr. Bob tell Joe about doc dr. Bob was changing my wife so basically you'll see dr. Bob he gives you bullshit referendum whatever description what you have you know oh you're you're this now they start shooting at her all the others Shanaya so you're really that sober you're really not so but you see now after I got clean I discovered I had a problem I discovered I was bipolar or Johnny goo BOTS or this or that or this now that medication they give you you know on top of the old opiate epidemic how bad a fuckin animal adderall is so fuck that means animal we have someone every month that's on adderall when they're doing the podcast it's obvious yes they can't shut the fuck up they talking about fast pace they're really excited they've gotta look just a little bit too much energy there's something about them that you just know and you just like you could tell like you're like whoa whoa slow down sometimes I've all offer him a drink I mean I've had people on the podcast where I tried to figure out what the fuck was went on and then later on in the podcast they told me they did adderall and I was like okay alright now I get it alright now I know where all this tension it's crazy chicken we knew they used to take two outer walls and fucking the chicken West palm or something used to drink oh dude everybody does do you know how many people do it though I'm getting stunned all my like the families that I know like with my kids or friends with their their kids and I get to know these people fucking these all these like successful suburban people are doing adderall all the time that's how they get through work that's how they become successful they're always hustling throw he's getting things done and these motherfuckers they always want the newest shit they want the newest watch oh is that the newest you bowl is that the newest this is that the newest dad oh he's got the Mercedes AMG oh look he's got this and she's did she bought a house in the Oaks oh you know look at this and she's got a VAT and look at that purse yeah where'd you get that I heard that such a Hermes oh you can't get those all they're doing is like chasing after these things so they can go places and other people will look at this new thing that they have it's very strange it's like there's one thing like if you know someone who gly collects a certain thing like they're you know so we're really into fucking whatever it is old samurai swords or something like that they love the history of it that's not what these people are doing they're buying things so they could bring places and other people would go woo so they get a feeling like a feeling of I guess a successful feeling you know they get a feeling from other people recognizing that they have the latest thing like oh where'd you get that jacket oh look at that purse oh look at that wow look at that chain how many carats is that ring let me see your ring girlfriend let me see your ring amazing it's so cute those shoes are so cute oh my god so cute and they're just like weird fucking just filled up people what weirdo speed it up people that elect chasing after the next object it's a fairy it's a very string and they don't talk about shit I get together these people you know because we'll have dinners together or our families will get together the kids a play will a party together and you know a good 20% of these people do not talk about shit all they talk about is objects they talk about this object and that object and how much this is worth and how much Real Estate's going for here and that's the whole focus of conversation it's like an anti-human conversation because they're not talking about anything human they're not talking about you know with the community what they love about life and their experiences as a parent and none of that matter well I don't don't even pay attention they're kids they they go and drink and leave the kids outside and the kids are just fucking hitting other kids with sticks and shit and going nutty and then when they come out no my kids a good kid he doesn't do that and then go back inside and drink more and it's like crazy it's really interesting to see it's like the things that fuels success in a lot of people are a lot of these folks it's like this this need for material possessions and then pills this is what's going on you didn't come you and I didn't come from the best home conditions available to us I'm not insulting you no you're right the same you had to deliver papers and your mother had a work and Lou and the whole fucking thing do you ever sit there sometimes on one of these fucking parties with these people who have everything yeah everything we didn't have and you're like my parents worth 20 times better than these fucking people as a parent yeah I come sitting there every day now I'm apparently little pools and gymnastics tonight I got a fucking recital I mean I have to do this is right who the fuck a part of my I am but I see these people that do this shit and I'm like my mother was a fucking bookie my mother owned the bar and she was a drunk and she was a way better parent than these fucking guys guess she was there I think what we're talking about with this pill thing there's a lot of people that are on antidepressants there's a lot of people that are on adderall there's a lot of people are on xanax there's a lot of people that are a lot of weird disassociative and these disassociative pills you see it in how they interact with their children they just they just zone out there not there even if you're like stressed out about your kid you're interacting with your kid at least the kid knows you're communicating with them the kids probably not happy that you're stressed out but at least you're there when you're zoned out on pills and staring at the fucking clouds it's just it's just not it's not a good way for human beings to interact with each other well you're hopped up on some weird shit and I think I mean I don't know what the actual numbers are but are in the communities that I associate with I would say a good solid half of these fucking people are pilled up a good solid half they're either pilled up on xanax what's really hilarious is I've talked to some of these people and they're like I don't know how you smoke pot every day I'm like bitch you take a xanax every morning every morning you take a xanax I know a lady who takes his antics every time she gets in her car she's like just too much traffic OOP Pops's annex for traffic the Pappas annex to go to sleep the Pappas annex cuz they have to fly oh I have to fly need a xanax unedible yeah for those four hour flights I just can't sit there no more well those intervals make you think about the universe I mean people say it's a different thing though when I have mercy in the morning I don't fucking get high I don't get high like I have her in the morning before school and I Drive I try to cuz I gotta walk into school for a week like it they already warned me one time they're warned you smell like I went there pick her up and one of the teachers came along she was a little that's Friday you were kick it bunch of last Friday so I can't embarrass my daughter so I track that was it that was it once they said it that's funny then the answer you know I take my chances I get high go to the gym this class was swimming or the ballet or whatever the fuck we have to do and that's you know I'm out with my friends are doing the podcast doing comedy so but I don't all I have I don't have beer in my house generally you don't really drink you've never got along I don't want alcohol in my house neither have a child don't know what alcohol in my house well I'll tell you what if there's one thing that I could kick that you know like this sober October shit like if I could if I had to choose like for the rest of my life no booze are no pot I would say no booze and a heartbeat yeah but I like a cold Heineken eyes attempt Oh cold cold valium was fucking delicious but I get something out of pot I get like sensitivity I get community I get compassion I get introspective thinking I start examining myself more I become more humble I get something out of it I get like real benefits out of pot like a lot of the Bennets of benefits that some people would call paranoia or you know that people they freak out because you know they think the walls are closing and I love that that's yeah it's good for love that I live in that world I fucking love it I love somebody telling me I'm a loser get it together you have some dick today get how the fucking you watch TV I think you're not proud of I'm very proud of Bert Kreischer for kicking the booze this month Barry and listen this will help he stays off of it well or at least what do you think you put these guys in rehab this month practical rehab is a rehab it's just to let you know where you stand 60 days if you're not doing a certain something makes you know where you stand and sometimes you go you know what you're rolling I'm not gonna smoke Bob but I'm gonna have my drink twice a week that's cool too you know Bert has a problem flying you know he likes to fuck and get twisted you know but Bert's what you call a social drinker yeah some fucking Florida you know they wake up they have the little fucking cocktail when I was gonna take a nap they'd go to the beach you and I don't know that life I've never lived that life of drinking all day and then taking a nap Bert's a real soldier you know but it's not fucking around Bert's not an amateur show Bert's the real deal I saw him running a couple days so I'm running through my car and when he was running at me and shit with his little thing I just took the car and you started going at him and he's like and I looked at me like coz he's in my neighborhood so I saw

you know that you didn't have to smile when I went to prison the hardest thing about prison wasn't going to prison you know it was how am I gonna live without my marijuana feeling how am I gonna fuckin sleep I wasn't worried about nothing else in prison except marijuana I never get any in prison no you could 50 bucks with two joints that were brown weed I wasn't doing that but after the first

when no one does right here white pizza no because no was Catholic there was a fucking there's a pizza place in White Plains New York down the street from executive billiards I think it was Nicky's Nicky's pizzeria and they had this fucking white cheese slice this white pizza sliced with and it had like you could see the olive oil and butter in the pizza and the garlic and you would bite into it you'd be like holy Christ and the crust of the pizza underneath is just like they're just the right amount of cooked whether it was like a little bit of just a slight burn to the crust and you're biting into it and you're just feeling the cheese in the dough and all the sauces and the Oh some fucking during Lent when you grow up back then you go to your friend's house on Friday and they get like mussels and red sauce at Nicky's that's the place and white fucking pizza we'd walk to that place right from executive billiards right down the street fucking phenomenal place so our good street fight there once and that's what it is the other thing that bothers me the most you know the slices you know the fucking slices yeah here's a move a slice is a thing of a move okay what's a slice of a move a slice of a move is you me you're on the fucking move when I come in to see Joe's pizza and I go let me have two cheese to go and you give me to me other thing and I fold them up I eat one there and take one I want to go go get a slice in the Hollywood someone what happens they take it they write a receipt if they hang it up and some other guy comes takes the slice out puts it in you have to wait for ten minutes then they come with a number and they give you the fucking slice listen do it all one shot use your dirty hands they ain't gonna kill me then I'm gonna kill we have them give a fuck of you scratch jazz throw the fuck the heat from the oven I'll kill the germs I'm saying just draw the slicing everything's a process a slice that's the whole corporate yeah it's a move it's everything like that shit I know what you mean everything has become corporate and these places that you're never gonna get that old small restaurant feel from a place like this that you'll get from a place like Nicky's pizzeria you know you know in the the flavors are different like we've talked about this before I don't know what it is and I've heard people say it's the water but whatever it is the place down the block from Gotham that's what I can do God fool I'll show you this slice right here I even took a picture of they got a sausage Stromboli in there that'll make you asshole fall out

Jersey with the cream all those Italian fucking cookies right just take picture so I could show people here what they're missing like this is what this doing this yoga thing where I did 9/10 yoga classes in a row whatever it was I think it was 10 you you I'm hungry all the time cuz I'm doing 90 minutes of yoga every day every single day not a day off for nine days or whatever it was let's say it was nine but even it was nine I took a day off before that I did two days in a row so it's like over the last couple of days or last couple of weeks it was 11 classes you know mostly in a row and just always hungry just constantly hungry like your body's just craving it and so I've been eating all sorts of shit that I never allowed myself to eat like late night like grabbing a burger and they're like I had Wendy's Burger last night coming home from the store not good for you but felt good but you burned right through that I do work a lot I burn right through there still not the smartest thing to do just not I feel so much better when I don't do that when I just limit myself to that like once a week I feel so much better but I just I don't I don't necessarily think it's good to do anything nine days in a row I just feel like your body is just like I've got a weird hamstring pull that's going on right now and just everything feels like a little worn out you didn't run this month I didn't run but one one day the first week of the month I'd lifted weights a couple times here and there but almost the entire month it's been yoga so far went to a jujitsu eight you know when I want the runner do I have to call in the weights and I do this little fucking kettlebell crawl little ski like my backyard just to get that hip thing going so I laid the set Oberto gavazzi stuff no I decide like somebody told me to crawl and I started crawling like you're in the army like in backyard they started crawling I fucking around your yard yeah just crawl around oh yourself on your hips this shit do all this shit on your elbows I like it so I've been doing that well when the gyms installed the gyms gonna be installed here in two weeks you got to come by we'll do a workout no I don't want you to teach me the the Darce and all that stuff I'll half guard and all that stuff okay great sure that's great that you got this place this is a fucking big place this is a crazy place right but it's this place we're gonna do all kinds of stuff here we're gonna have it set up where people could follow along the workouts I'm gonna get someone to like guide us through a workout and like I'll say hey everybody grab a 35-pound kettlebell we're gonna go through this like that Keith Weber guy that I've had on before Keith Weber I'll get him to come up here and teach that extreme kettlebell extreme cardio workout it's fucking phenomenal workout that you can do with 135 pound kettlebell and you'll pick up a 35-pound cannibal you like fucking workout am I gonna get with this little boat weight that does it five minutes and you'll be dying guaranteed 100% even if you're in good shape it's hard if you're not used to that workout is fucking hard and by the time the thing's over my legs are on fire you're 35 pounds 35 pound what kind of shit are you doing like Oh clean presses over and over again hot potatoes back and forth renegade rows you're doing like one push-up with one hand on the kettlebell switch to the other side push up with the other one doing them pass it in between your legs and you're going one after the other one after the other windmills over and over clean press snatches and you're doing these in succession over and over again switch to this side switch to the other side 10 on this side 10 on that side and you know and it's we're talking about like a 45-minute workout we have them you can you could buy them all over the places but we have a man on it he's got three of them out three different workouts they're fucking crazy DVDs I mean this kick this guy's he's a trainer up in Canada it's just in tremendous shape but the videos are so good because it's one of the few videos where a lot of these kettlebell workout videos like people were teaching you proper form which is all important you know it's real important to learn proper form learn where to peep to keep the weight balanced keep your weight in your heels and keep your feet flat on the ground all the different things that they want you to stress about various individual movements but Keith Webber's like you better know all that shit because we're just gonna take you through a radical workout like ready here we go boom and he does he's doing it all with you he's doing it on the beach it's also any crazy shit yeah the guy's good too from our bure though he's good - he's got a nice little workout no more oh yeah that's kettle jitsu guys guys yes 5:00 5:30 a.m. i watch it online 5:30 a.m. he's going fucking a stack of people in there and they go right to jiu-jitsu it's 6:30 how great will it be the show up I get up at 3:00 a.m. yeah that's what I'd be ready at 5:30 for that type of shit have coffee I gotta have coffee smoke pot have a protein shake right a little bit just so not to think I can get change fired yeah I can't have a heart attack I just can't get up and go over that the good thing about doing a workout like that before to g2 is that you'll approach jiu-jitsu like light is this him kettle jitsu yeah he's got a good program like he's doing hip escapes he's calling it snake moves while he's holding on to a kettlebell at the same time that's phenomenal for your core these rocking-chair get ups you know what I really like man I do these sit-ups with kettlebells where I put a 255 pound kettlebells or 50 pound kettlebells over my feet I put my feet through the handles and then I put two in my hands and I lay back on my back I press them up and then I sit up with them pressed up and I do my sit ups that way and it just makes your core your your ab muscles just so goddamn strong yep 225 you give me I don't tie my feet and what I do is I go back and like go this way hmm I do like a fucking Burpee okay yeah the legs going now that's great too well from my back but I do that in the end that's one stand back up all the way oh no no I just move back go back in the back at least it's like I get me to a table mm-hmm yeah we get into a table I wanted to strengthen all that shit and it helped me strengthen my back doing oh that's those are great workouts because they're not it's not like a glamorous thing where it pumps you up it gives you big dog makes you look Jack but it's just great for your body your circulation I told the bag in there oh yeah so to warm up I hope it up with the bag very lightly probabilities close distance then spread out punches bum bum just get everything moving push-up stretch once you do 20 minutes that then I start doing my stretches to really get the muscle warm then I go back and I start throwing kicks that kills uncle Joey once I start throwing the kiks kiks kiks system I crawl then I do my cleans I do all the Oberto gavazzi stuff with a 15 pounder now instead of using the kettlebells for swings they win the middle of my back I used to fifteen I turned my arms and I go up boom catch them Oh raising the club's yeah they're fucking great do you uh do you ever do Turkish get-ups I do up to a degree yeah just so I take the the ten me whatever it is boom boom boom and then I do like a table instead of getting okay well that's good it's all right yeah no no I do it that I like all that stuff any of that stuff like when you're lying down on your back and you're pressing something up and even just getting up to your knee it's all just about like strengthening your core you know do you do anything for your legs like do you do like bodyweight squats for your legs squats the goblets you'll have to do with your with weight Evoque I do it I do I start with nothing and then I work myself up to a thirty five goblet ah and then I do you know what man my knees are kind of yeah you've always had some knee issues the left one the right one now is a little funky so I I stop with the swings I love cleans with kettlebells that's my shit so I like the combination clean and then squat all those are great and then I do another clean squat and I do five on each side does anybody run you through a program or do you just come up with this on your own whoever I worked with oh thank god and they just decide to do whatever you want Alberto is there my wife got me a bag for Christmas I got to Calibos from you do you want to join us if we do some sort of a challenge some next-level challenge some next thing you want to join in I don't know I don't know I'm just thinking I just see this is one of the things that I've realized from this doing the 15 yoga classes I would fucking never do nine yoga classes in a row like that I would never do nine days in a row unless I said I was gonna do it but once you say you're gonna do something and you do it it's not that hard you just you just wind up doing it you know what you have to do it like my alarm goes off at 7:00 I'm out the door I get to the class I do the fucking 90-minute class and then I'm done and then I go do my shit and then I know the next day when I'm get doesn't matter if I get home from the store at one o'clock in the morning my alarms going off at 7:00 I'm getting up I'm having a cup of coffee I go there fasted I just have coffee you work out early yeah see I don't like getting nothing I'm good about 11 of 12 I have eleven o'clock podcast a lot of times like today's 11 o'clock podcast so I'm up you know I already got a 90-minute workout in come here you know stop it like Whole Foods or something like that get a coconut milk eat something I get the coconut milk now and mix it with the acai vanilla Jesus Christ is delicious ice cubes yeah I never liked the ice I even though but they ran out the chocolate yeah it's not to sell something I'm like beggars can't be choosey good googly moogly it's very good it's very good you know then the good thing about that hemp horse protein is it's very little sugar that's why I use the water scoop a couple grams of sugar that's called nut milk yeah no I like it I like that one I don't mind doing a challenge here's the problem Joe Robbie here's the problem what happens that a lot of people don't realize I know the jujitsu right let's say I go to our boroughs right I boroughs has some fucking killers so I'll do the break the guard past the guard right couple those and then we start rolling well a guy like me an older guy starts rolling and that for the second 5-minute roll he's opened up he's all I'm open like I called though Jim I told you what's my problem bro how come I'm not breathing goes you know you guys know we throw out the gun and I gotta work I'm out in the back of 45 minutes before cuz they can't breathe either it's just just go with it so if I do more than those two roles it's a law of diminishing returns I really can't walk the next day it's it's hard well you got to build up to it you gotta build up to it so that's what I'm that's why I like this other guy in a way because you work mm-hmm one day you drill you know one day you work I could do uh wait shit like I like wait shit I was thinking of joining your buddy's gym for a really good workout Terry Norris mm-hmm Terry if that's the one in Studio City Terry Norris attack clayman there's other terry clay bond is the guy used to train with who's in Hollywood know this former boxer yeah he's amazing he's in hell he's in Burbank is he really fuck yet he has a Groupon for like 30 visits for a tune-up so he's like teaching people on a box yeah Terry Norris was bad motherfucker little corner store it's up the quarter from it's up the corner from a famous bodybuilding gym oh yeah it's right there up the corner from there's a fucking great restaurant of their breakfast restaurant and he's right there how is he like talking and everything's York because they had a thing on him on television he's having some issues I think his was wife is there yes somebody else there but he was bad guys yeah she said that it's interesting because like he's got all these issues but then once he starts hitting the back right he do he comes back and he looks like Terry Norris of old yes talking and struggling you know he just I remember seeing him once I was at a boxing match I was actually with Damai rera and Terry Norris stood there talking to people and this is before he died retired like officially and he was talking to somebody and you could hear the slur and I was like whoa like I had no idea no idea was this bad you know all those guys those guys that are in Wars like your you'll you will run into them one day and you will say it all you'll see the war in their voice you'll see it the slurring and the the weird tics and the movements and you're like oh you're looking at a frazzled person there you know the shattered did Jamie show you the hit from last night the way you watch the hit from football last night Oh what happened somebody get smashed or yeah but you know what's crazy this was football ten years ago now they're fucking done like did I hit it hard anymore no you can't well how'd this guy get hit so watch this yeah it's it yet the main issue on it is like it's a quarterback played they do this thing where they uh I guess they're called kits giving up their body they slide with their legs first they're not supposed to get hit like in almost any way or maybe you're supposed to tap them just to like let him know they're down so this guy gives up his legs and if I don't find the video to trying to that while I'm talking but he gets hit really really hard and then when you see it in slow-mo it kind of makes a little worse cuz the dude led with his arm don't come right now helmet oh he goes like this Joe oh you see you're like damn I'm surprised and throw my like I didn't watch the game when I got up this morning was all over the place it laid hit lady I wonder if one day they're gonna be able to figure as a sit right here yeah here he goes running boom oh Jesus why is that guy mad cuz it's a late hit they got furious at him let me see it again show from other angles and you'll see protecting the quarterback is a big deal that's - got it I hit him 47 Kiki Alonso I thinks his name Kiko that's the guy who got hit at Joe Flacco for the rape all right here we go he's running he's running this is the angle it's rougher well he was already coming like how is he gonna stop it stuff that's the part about that so far feet-first let's see that's good to be like you're supposed to stop it's like kicking a fighter when their arms are down kind of thing it's a rough time like I know that changed the rule recently but sort of the same kind of things he hit that dude even though the dude was already down the guy went down on his own accord he him sliding feet first means he's not supposed to be hitting him like that he should know better it's what that was why everyone was mad that's why his coaches yelling so he just took a cheap shot at them yeah exactly and he hit him really hard knock them right out of the game so what happened to that guy 47 he gets a fine right yeah that dude you get suspended for three or four games he got his bell rung yeah that's a fucked up thing right in college football they're taking them they're taking him out of the game right away he would have been probably thrown directly out of the game potentially missed more and maybe half the next game and so they give a penalty to the other team yeah so an NFL right now it's just a penalty how many of these football referees are on the take how many these guys get busted like that's a big thing about NBA players I was reading this whole thing about how little NBA players make and how they're constantly watching all these NBA or not NBA players NBA referees me and now they're watching all these players pull up in bentleys and Rolls Royces and shining with diamonds and gold and jewelry and that these guys just start taking bribes and that there's at one point in time where there's just a shitload of referees in the NFL and the NBA that are just on the take really yep and they they'll get bribed by bookies they'll get bribed by you know people that are big-time gamblers and you got to think if this guy's only making I mean how much does a referee make system here between anywhere between 150 and 500 thousand oh yeah well that's a good living but if someone comes to you if you make 150 and someone comes to me goes Joey I just want you to make this game a little bit more easy for the Dolphins here's a hundred here's how much they make per game per year and some players there make that per game now pull up bribery in NBA referees or corruption and NBA referees it's been a bunch of guys that have been busted right I don't know about a bunch I think it's really just the one guy just one he tried to call out a bunch of other people but he didn't do it by name who dharna he hit him Donnie yeah I talked to him that guy did you he's not my podcast yeah no shit what'd he say good god it's just a fucking listen you fall in that trap man right they have so many scams like he was telling me they got like the first class tickets shit mm-hmm you know where they give you a first-class ticket the travel to the games just so just a little bit of this a little bit of that you know well there's always a lot of that with boxing as well no in college basketball just oh this is like huge this is tremendous coaches and some different programs and I think it was adidas might have been so they were playing families we're getting paid through the shoe companies to direct players to certain schools oh and then they were getting signed by those companies when they made it to the NBA and in some cases I think Rick Pitino who's the coach for Louisville is taking something like 98 percent or 95 percent of the money that was due to the school from adidas he was just keeping at all what yeah what no yeah I don't know legal is a weird word on that I mean it's in the contract and it was like cash and so is paying him basically yes if you go back to the movie blue chips which came out a long time ago it's all being it was like fictional then but that's been going on for the last 20 so why would they pay him like what are they whether they get the D just wants to like what does adidas get out of he's bringing in the most popular players that are going to be like most popular recruits from high school and AAU and so that maybe he could bring them to adidas and then adidas you have them all over the final for the NCAA tournament they're gonna be on Saturday basketball they're getting advertised just like NBA players but they're not getting the money they're getting using their names there's lights you know they're all over SportsCenter so they essentially would adidas would pay him to be an influencer 100% yeah wow that's weird that's a weird role so he would be the father figure or the coach figure to these young men they look up to him he's a mentor in some ways and he weasels them into the adidas fold and they would they're also what they want that they want to wear a Dita's cloth stuff yeah they want that the cool jerseys there make Ohio State right now the team I'm pay attention to for football have some awesome crazy jerseys that nobody's ever gonna get that like the LeBron James brand of Nike is giving them that are gonna be showcased all over TV Saturday Wow I was reading about Under Armour is banking on Steph Curry's new Under Armour shoe how much they were saying that Steph Curry who's like one of the best players in the league apparently you know that more than I do I don't know shit about basketball they were saying that his new Under Armour shoe there they're putting a lot of money into this idea that his shoe is going to rebound the stock so people are making recommendations to buy Under Armour stock now so that when the shoe comes out everybody gets crazy and buys his shoe and then Under Armour will bounce back you know the problem is once once something has a stink about it it's kind of it you know is that bad looking in my opinion and from knowing what I know about sneakers that's not the shoe that's gonna bring them back what's wrong with that shoe unless a bunch of kids are into it which I don't know that they would be it's all it's more about marketing uh-huh so you have to get a whole bunch of kids into buying that and then there's got to be a couple influencers in the I like MBA video game world and like the YouTube blogging world that are gonna have to make this seem cool to them what influence what is insane is this a Steph Curry on an SC 30 his number Oh looks like an SC doesn't it I mean I guess I wouldn't wear these shoes at all it's so much fucking money in the sneaker business you wouldn't wear those when you wear those goofy-looking Yeezys i also like I wouldn't wear these casually I'm not playing basketball give me a tissue so if some people might be wearing these for basketball they're a lot of kids still play in basketball if they can get a team into buying them and you get 15 pairs so that's two a team you're talking about two totally different worlds right you're talking about there's people that buy shoes to wear to play in casual or and then there's people that wide buy shoes just to hang out in correct yeah whether they're doing them they're buying athletic shoes for handle purposes right and these the marketing of it is a real weird place because Jordans are where it all started Michael Jordan got everybody wearing shoes you know yeah and Jordans people don't play basketball and Jordans correct or do I don't know they don't look cool when you wear it you're wearing those fucking cool Jordans yeah oh so if you wear Jordans playing basketball like this guy's so fucking crazy he's playing basketball in Jordan or even the a like that he's playing basketball in $1000 retro Jordan we know cost $1,000 them do no wait yes really I mean brand new retail they're costing about a hundred to two hundred dollars nine hundred twenty bucks retail but the rarity of them especially depending on the year they came out if they came out five years ago they some of them cost a thousand bucks 2,000 bucks out the same shit with jeez you know every really whatever I get like a cheap key take out those shoulder roll what do you call those show your roll yeah people wait on money for those yeah limit they made a Michael Jordan they made a guy that don't do jujitsu they put a guy out of Michael Jordan key that they sold in Chicago I know a guy that buys all those keys like they do the same thing like lucky limited time only midnight nickel and they have hundreds of geese they do not work really because the shoulder rolls to show you rolls I don't know exactly what they came back no I like dots asuras dr. sybers good stuff yeah those are great like that that goes where you know where the dots hussar is nice it's it's real durable too because the hemp is just so much more durable than cotton it's just those things I mean keys are pretty goddamn durable as it is it needs it takes a long time for one starts to break unless you have a single weave you know when those thin lines are great I love doing all the mats pretty much yeah I love food James I got the white one the black one that you could pull them I'm a gorilla in that day but they're like this why do I wouldn't this is why I knew I wouldn't do well in hot yoga first of all I'm Anna Akana you could tell all right even here Millie I don't respond well to when I first started you JIT that was the biggest problem I had that I didn't know anything about G's right so I wouldn't bother judogi I hit that heat that heat level one way up that took me to a different place yeah those double weave G's like those things those are very heavy but some people like that they like the double weave they like the feeling of like security of having that very thick cloth around them some people like that golden weave I like the single weave this only the summer before yeah yeah I wanted to feel light I don't want a fucking G you know what look at the size of me if I put again it's 20 pounds also for me I have about staff a couple times so I always put a rash guard on anyway even if I wear gear I just don't just people get scratched from fingernails all the time and I also carry those defense so the white wear spray mm-hmm the soap I got the soap in the shower yeah but I'm on my fucking feet when do you drink kombucha yes that's so good getting probiotics do you ever have kimchi every kimchi that's what it smells fucking disgusting I love that stuff even though Asian that says I'm Asian I'm the fucking thing I buy a fucking jar of that shit like a 32 ounce jar and I'll eat most of the German kimchi like a book it's Babich it's pickled cabbage it's fermented cabbage from Korea and your farts smell worse than tennis they'll clean the paint off your fucking car now I like the camp introduced I just can't deal with other shit damn all that stuff is good for you I don't do the Greek yogurt either now I like to regularly yell the Greek yogurt tastes like ass fuck that I tried the vanilla plain like all the other ones you know well over the last few months I've been shying away from from Dairy I've been I'll eat a little cheese every now and then because I like cheese but I've been trying to like eliminate dairy from my diet a little bit just to see because I've heard from several people that they've eliminated dairy and they've had good reactions their body they fed like less inflammation it makes them feel better on that shit that's it on that report I'm lactose intolerant yeah yeah yeah I took a milkshake once a month to you know a climber I'll drink a milkshake I'll make a banana shake at home with someone yeah I like my shakes then so I think that's what I'm gonna do for November I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for November but I think for November I'm gonna go the entire month without eating any bullshit a hundred percent the entire month just all straight healthy food no added sugar no no nothin no sodas no crap I'm just gonna see what that feels like I'm just we got it we're gonna come up with some new challenge because after this month doing this I feel like this was a very beneficial month for me beneficial in that first of all my back has never felt better like doing yoga all these times like it makes your back feel bulletproof like you just feel like my posture and everything like everything is just that feels so sturdy because yoga especially B crumbs like that 90 minute hot yoga shits so much of it is about your back and your core and like supporting your spine and I think you know sitting down a lot doing podcasts even though these chairs are phenomenal these capisco ergo depo chairs these things are phenomenal they keep you you know sitting in the right posture and their support you well it's not real good to sit down all the time like that and a lot of times your back is like compressed and if you don't have good structure and if you don't have good strength around the spine like good muscle strength around the spine you're gonna develop all sorts of weird problems and you know weird weird issues with your back but I think I've learned a lot this month about like what what kind of exercises you need to do to keep your back strong you know like this yoga shit like doing it as many times as we did it this month I mean I'm not gonna do it this many times but I'm definitely gonna do it two times a week from now on definitely you know and if you mix it with the weights a little running you can go don't ya you're good to go that's that you don't need much in the Olympics right trying to maintain you just trying to maintain keep your fucking whatever going that's all it's not a lot have you ever done the cryotherapy cryotherapy the cold shit yeah I worked myself up but it's right down the hall of miles have you know I just always forget to go down phenomenal I think I had a lot of problems you know I wrote I wrote the fucking whatever the first four chapters for the book for your book yeah that's why I did all this in September which all right what are you writing a book about what got me into comedy why I got into comedy just the biography yeah hey dizzy and I finally started August 1st I got the iPod whatever the iPad you write it on an iPad fuck yeah and I write it my hire the kid he had it's everything for me oh yeah so I had to have four chapters done I got to taste them so you have a book deal yeah I wanted to write it properly I wanted to write I didn't want that every time I had somebody else write it Joey Diaz is like a Floyd story they used to sing the last guy good story Floyd thorium's whatever the fuck those peoples have no fucking Dorian story who's Floyd I have no fucking idea you know these people you know you know writing has gone like when you read Silence of the Lambs right it's just plain writing but sometimes you read these books with the writers go a little too far with their bullshit it's just too much it's like you were saying you ever go to people's houses and they talk and then you say shit for 20 minutes they like it's like by Studio City where I live go to that coffee shop anytime the time you know what they were saying in there well the day after the Vegas shooter the Vegas shooter was Sunday night do you know what these idiots were saying in their Monday but that this had to do with women's rights and the abortions and and they just talked these new breathing Gentiles they just talk that's all they do is talk with big words to impress you but they don't say shit they don't say shit three or four big words to let you know they're smart and then then say nothing and there's a lot of repeating narratives oh yeah every time the show the new show I'm gonna do I'm buying one of those little tape recorders and I'm putting them under these six fucking morons every day yeah at night I'm gonna do a show about what they discussed because this is 60% of America what these fucking people are talking about this is the idiots the shit that comes out of their mouths is amazing and you sit there and go no wonder fuckin Isis wants to shoot listen to these fucking dummies listen to what's coming out of their mouths women's rights that's a total well what was their argument they were saying that the guy bow they all got everybody the argument is everybody trying to be small and everybody it's just six people trying out with each other it's like when you go to those fucking dinner parties you talk about and by the time they serve the salad you want to put a gun in your fucking why am I even fucking here with these people I could have stopped at Burger King and had a better fucking time that's why I don't go to those dinner parties because there's eight people to and once politics comes up you lose me Joe Rogan I don't want to hear about it no more you lose me you lose me these new political people talking nonsense you lose me move forward either impeach him get a new woman or shut the fuck up I can't you put the news on any more butts definitely he didn't send the check he called her a hey what the fuck man just tell gives a fuck who gives a fuck there's got to be something more there's gotta be a seal stuck on a beach somewhere in this fuckin country something more important than this shit every fucking day so the politics is over my world religion you know I don't want to be yeah that's supposed to talk about politics or religion at those fuckin things but this new breed of Gentile they just talk for the sense of talking to see who's the smartest person in the room but at the end of the day they're all a bunch of dumb fucks anyway it was definitely a lot of people talking and just impress other people yeah that's it and there's a lot of people saying a bunch of things that they've read on blogs or read on websites everybody wants to have an intelligent conversation and everybody witty get the fuck out of here you know get the fuck leave me the fuck alone mm what would you rather them talk about life something that makes sense something simple that you're not trying to impress me talk to me about your kids what don't you think there's a lot more that we Hollywood because people are trying I think one of the things about Hollywood is that people are always trying out for auditions they're always going in on our dish and they're always they always have to be picked and chosen and they're always trying to position themselves like someone that you would want to hire and so they manufacture these these attitudes based on what they think they lift their finger they hold it up they find out which way the winds blowing and that's the way they go and they start to sort of construct their personality based on what they think with all the casting agents all of them a hundred percent of them are liberal they're all liberal everyone's liberal everyone across the board is a Democrat or the radical ones are Bernie Sanders supporters and everyone has like very clear left-wing views whether you like it or not not not a judgment on it but these people that go in for auditions and actors which is most of what you're running into either actors or screenwriters or someone who's trying to do something in Hollywood they all want people to know that they're on the right team and they all want to say all the things that they think need to be said where you saw a lot of the hypocrites was in the first few days of this Harvey watch please and you know what man at the end of the week they're all fucking disgust us cuz they all fucking knew about it oh they all knew about it for years and then they all want to raise their fucking happy you know what bro when Harvey was given the movies nobody was complaining yeah was complain playing it from a girl she was saying that uh Harvey Weinstein gave them all careers like wow that's a crazy argument the one tattoo of the chicks thank them in the Oscars yep now you're gonna make you listen to leave me the fuck alone the ones that really need to smack at them off of the guys that came out and said I got molested once I I got my dick got touched on a party one time we live for that shit we live for somebody to touch our fuckin dick we're not gonna go to therapy with us ain't nothin somebody grabs your dick you just fuckin smile and whatever everybody needs a break from time to time I'm saying you never let a gay guy suck your dick what I excusing their mouth no it's a party game I don't know I don't know but I had a friend one time that he'd let anybody suckers anybody anybody anybody wanted to suck his dick it sucked his yum-yum stick really one day he was telling me about fucking getting his dick sucked by a gay guy with ice cubes in his mouth I nearly fucking died he just let think I do it yeah he the fuck was the conversation he was telling me how his mouth was cold and all this shit and that was fucking dying I couldn't believe it the guy was sucking his dick listen I don't want to know about that I would want to know but you wanted to know about the guy get his dick sucked by a dude with ice cubes in his mouth I mean why not what he told me is watching it first of all well he told me the story I was young I had never heard that story before I was like one time but if it was so good why not keep going you know it's tough to find somebody will suck your dick with ice cubes in the muff unless you give me the small fifty I think once you put it out there you put that flag up think um that was the funniest thing with that crazy bitch from Superman cuz she popped up like eight days later Harvey took his dick out one time that Tom put that back in your pants and crazy chick from Superman with ya what's that chick that's crazy oh the one that was hiding in the bushes when they found her she had no teeth that one what the hell's her name what's her name but the Superman will Christopher Reeve right no the other one was it Superman Oh Christopher II the early Superman right yeah was the one with Dean Cain who was the crazy being Cain who was the one in that Kenner Margot Kidder is crazy right yeah sure this was the other one that the other one but you're talking about the one who was in Superman with Dean Cain the TV show yeah makes it was a really pretty girls named Terry she got talked into Mike but she was on the TV show she was she was in Desperate Housewives - right yeah no wasn't her I had an ex-girlfriend of mine get so mad when I was talking about how pretty she was missing Superman actress found frightened in the bushes yeah that was a 96 Margot Kidder yeah she went crazy 47 year old Canadian born actress best known you know what that's the thing once you hit like late 40s and you one of those actresses and they stopped calling you are already crazy and the pressure builds up she'd cut off her own hair with a razor blade an attempt to alter her appearance a Glendale police sergeant Rick young said oh boy to all of you Medical Center for a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation they could have spared 71 hours and 50 minutes by just bringing her to me that bitch is crazy know what happened there with Corey Feldman though I don't know he arrests all that thing yeah I just I made a joke if people get mad we they got mad but it wasn't them getting mad was me getting mad at myself what was the joke uh he was wearing a really small jacket I'm always doing this performance at like a minor-league baseball game and he was doing like this Michael Jackson thing and that the jacket was so small I go is that a jacket he was wearing when he was getting diddled when he was a little kid it was just trying to make Greg laughs I just I said something that I was and then afterwards when I saw it especially out of context it was very disappointed in myself he was he was ten million the fuckin if I saw that he's out of his mind I think I don't think he first of all he never said that Michael Jackson did anything to him he was he said Michael Jackson didn't but he said that there's a lot of pedophilia in Hollywood he wants to make some sort of a movie on it which I'm sure there's a lot of pedophilia in Hollywood but like this idea that people are trying to kill him he was saying people trying to run him over and sound what isn't that what he's saying yeah I watched the video fool have a hard had seconds and I felt bad yeah if they wanted to kill him he'd be dead yeah drugs tried to hit him that's not real see this is like weird paranoia shit let me tell you something if they want to kill you you're dead and it's not gonna be trucks trying to run you over it's gonna be a guy out of nowhere shoots you in the head and gets in his car and no one's gonna know who he is and no one's gonna catch him because they're gonna hire a professional like this idea that someone's gonna like miss him with a car and then they're chasing and running him down I find that very I mean it's possible but I find it very hard to believe I always think that like if someone is a very powerful man like like I don't know if the Clintons ever whacked anybody but if they did they walk those fucking people like that one guy that was the big the big conspiracy theory about the guy who released all the stuff to WikiLeaks the Denham DNC guy Seth rich yeah they killed that motherfucker whoever did it whether he was killed because some random person decided to shoot him in the back in the middle of the night and not steal his watch or his phone or his wallet whether it's that or whether it's what Julian Assange from WikiLeaks said is that this consequences to leaking information to WikiLeaks because that's what they were saying and people were saying look this is another one that Clinton body-count people and there's you know giant conspiracy theories about how many people the Clintons have had killed I don't know if that's true or not I have zero information but I do know when people want you dead you're dead you're dead when they're real people like that that are real killers and evil fucks there's a lot of people that've been killed like Putin if Putin wants you dead you get shot on TV in front of everybody and nothing happens no one goes to jail no one gets caught you're just dead that's the type of people we're talking about so this you know I just I have a hard time believing that like someone's getting like barely missed by a car that's like some movie shit like they were coming after me but I Drive to the bushes of the last minute and now I'm hiding in a motel somewhere and I can't tell you where but if you give me ten million dollars want to make a movie you know what I feel bad for Corey from when you see that when you see that performance I mean everybody's a nice kid and stuff but you can see how he was just fucking made a mockery like they just beat him up dog grew up on TV and they beat him up grow up in the movies you you know you don't have a childhood who the fuck do you know who I named one that made it through that meat grinder of growing up famous that's not completely fucking crazy name one name one look Miley Cyrus might have got out of it better than any of them she's like her new albums are really good she's music she's great bro told them you've seen those ones that she's up on the hill in Tennessee with a little band and they're singing outside in the mountains she's summer of Jolene yeah Jolene Jolene

sandwich or out did you see it in that you give Machado yeah I watched it twice I haven't seen he you know he gives this part - he plays a cab driver so the other that could think about is to fight he had the garage with the cab drivers when he was fuckin shooting at him and all that shit how nasty fucked Mighty Mouse is armbar how about John Wick's on boy ahead with his foot that's the fucking Mighty Mouse Rehberg that fucking armbar that he does is be Borg great Borg great Berg hey you know what I realize in your your fault your computer is uh having problems with the internet mine is not

was a hundred percent legit like there was no like shenanigans like you see him throw somebody around he don't believe it like even his front kick diligent front kick look he's doing real shit you know what else he did that was real he did a lot look at he's doing all this fucking strength and conditioning footwork moving he's doing all these roles another thing that he did that was super real was he did a lot of tactical firearms drills like a lot of you know close-range handgun shit whereas you know shooting that uh steel targets that pop up and hiding behind things and turning corners and shooting at targets real quick like legitimately looks like he knows what he's doing don't have you better chat with him I've known him fondle never met him tremendous I bet he said eats breakfast at dukes why is this in Hollywood yeah I'm the way I just go what's up dawg when you go what's happened man have a great day yeah this is the shit that he did yeah he's real there's a whole video of

like most companies you go to have a couch and screams this shit no this is what I don't think this is the place they have like a real fucking place where they do all stunts and that was that John over there yeah jean-jacques John Jacques enjoy yeah there's heekin John stare all the Machado's but all this stuff that he's doing is like super legit there's he again I mean he's he's really he really wanted to learn jujitsu like he learned real jujitsu as opposed to just making up some fake moves and shit no his arm ball with the bullet at the end is fucking beautiful movies they're fun ridiculous sort of cartoonish violent movies it's really good times let me go say yeah those itself yeah fucking crazy well who's girl to that is that sort of androgynous lesbian character who's in a lot of stuff orange is the new black is that who she is she's very pretty she's got short hair she's the hit woman in the movie oh yeah she plays a deaf girl a deaf girl yeah doesn't you play the Deaf

that's the wheel I love him I like all his fucking movies man there's just some people who watch them movies don't need to think yeah well he's got some classics I mean think about the John wick series he's in the matrix I mean this dude has been in some fucking classics and Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure that's right you go back to that I mean imagine that that guy started with like a really silly comedy and then went from that to be a giant action hero and somehow or another still looks good at 53 what's that movie he made with the bank robbers that they fucking my big fucking movie pay moving Patrick Swayze fucking good movie - yeah I wanna know what piano Reeves does to reduce stress because he looks fucking fantastic look at him look he's never in trouble you never hear from him of the bar or drinking or drinking wine while hanging out with nobody or abuse he don't do dick he grows his beard out he walks around looking dirty when you see him in the daytime my god like what is he doing he looks so good he's just a regular guy there's no trouble I know but a like I wonder like what he eats because someone told me that he actually smoked cigarettes like he's that he's not like particularly like disciplined about his health that's incredible 94 to 2014 how is that even possible imagine if you ran into one of his ex-girlfriend's he looks exactly the same she looks like an old hag she's like what the fuck I mean that's 20 years of difference and he looks the same well he looks like shit in the 2013 no 2012 2013 was a rough turn one that fell off the road well that's when he met he everything changed like doing jiu-jitsu and his life fucking shake he's starting to podcast he called me up to go down there yeah on what um some network then they should maybe know learn English first or no yeah it doesn't matter they love him anyway they love is that him smoking cigarettes yeah so he does smoke yeah see that's even crazier like how is he not old as

pictures their finery is like oh Kenna Reeves from the 1750 whatever yeah they photoshopped the shit out of that anyway right I watched some crazy shit last night Joe run I didn't feel good I couldn't

rent look Francis Ford Coppola with r2d2 that's incredible just he was like 24 years old young kids bro young kids I'll tell you what was a good move that a lot of people were critical of when they sold Star Wars to Disney cuz Disney is taking that shit and run with it they run with it I mean they're making so many more Star Wars movies they're good fucking movies they're fun they're doing Star Wars world at Disneyland which looks insane they released a preview video of it the other day have you taken your girl to Disneyland yet no she hasn't asked you job said I was I'll play you just wait

nothing do not the dough have you thought about moving out of here just waiting just waiting just a wife for another year another year what are you thinking it going I don't know it's Colorado or Lexington Kentucky huh yeah there's a lot of people here Joey Diaz seems like it's getting worse - the thing that freaks me out is the eminent doom that one day for sure the Earth's gonna move the fucking water pipes are gonna break fire is gonna break out it's gonna for sure we're gonna have a disaster and when we have a disaster then we're gonna realize the real consequences of jamming 20 million people into a small area that bothers me well you know all this was going on this summer and for two or three weeks you'd watch the news wouldn't you think of that like we got to be next was sitting here not cozy fucking warm living room watching Florida underwater Texas underwater you know what what's gonna come to us well the fires in Northern California were fucking insane hardly anybody talked about him it's not a ton of people living up there so people did it didn't get the amount of press that it deserved because there was so much going on and in Texas so much going on in Florida so much going on in Puerto Rico but the fucking fires in Northern California were insane and they couldn't do a thing about them they didn't have fire hydrants and a lot of these places they didn't have access to water and they were just burning through towns I think they said hundreds of people are missing and thousands of buildings were burnt to the ground and it barely made the news fucking Puerto Rico is still without oh yeah they're fucked they're fucked and they're not getting any funding and you know how come they're not getting funding they got some I mean it's not that they're not getting funny but they're not getting enough to rebuild to do what they need to do to get their infrastructure people don't understand about Puerto Rico is that you have someone and be a hold someone and after that what surrounds these cities is what you see on TV is these fucking villages yeah you know did you read the New York Times article about Cuba know about the hurricane how good they are with hurricanes No you had to read that article practice in these shits is 1915 well they have to they're a fun night when I called my sister my sister was like it was three days we got killed I got killed and come away when my dad's from they got fucking killed that's still in the water but they don't fuck around they have this complete if you can look it up New York Times article it was fucking huge about how they have the hurricane how did they handle it community they have it there they fuckin the what's that when they pull you out and pull you out right away I mean they just like you didn't hear about Cuba having a problem no they got killed but they are so used to it they have such a great system for dealing with it they only have four there you go hurricane tips from yeah there you go unbelievable how good is that right there the water hitting yes that's a mother : look at that they got a 1950s car and the water is like fuckin 80 feet in the air smashing waves against the side of the building or the side of the road rather how cool is that caught it's pretty bad car how cool is that they take those cars they put like four cylinder Diesel's in them too they do all kinds of crazy shit with those yawning did you watch that show when they do the 13 episodes of the Cuban cause no but I've seen a lot of things I'm really interesting how they fuckin paint they look like all that shit that they get my car and they put the car together pretty interesting shit there was a guy who bought an island outside of Cuba I forget what Island was but it got hit so bad by the hurricane that it completely wiped off everything on the island this guy some billionaire character bought the entire island and for the first time in over 300 years it's unpopulated there's literally no one living on this island they went from being this green lush Ireland to be in just a big flat patch of dirt like flattened it just got hit by the full brunt of the storm right after this to plot it I mean it I don't know how much you spent on it except Richard Branson's Island I don't think so no no I think it was the guy who owns uh John Paul Mitchell nectar island completely Oh nobody knows he's a hat bonking so Richard Branson says nectar island completely utterly devastated by hurricane Airman herma yeah it's uh I'm sure that Island got Jack too but there was an island that is completely unpopulated for the first time in three hundred years forget what the island was but these are just gonna get worse the crazy thing about these hurricanes is they're building up steam out in the ocean versus in the Gulf like usually they would get to the Gulf and they would build up because the Gulf has warmer water but the water in the ocean is getting so warm that think it's the island of Barbuda I don't think yeah that's it I don't think somebody owns that one no someone just bought it oh really yeah yeah some guy just bought the island of Barbuda I think so you've been thinking about leaving yeah thinking about stay no I think about leaving all the time yeah I've been discussing it open well when it was getting a hundred nine degrees in fucking October we were like is this gonna be like in five years like is this keep gonna keep getting worse like if climate change is real it seems to be if we're getting record temperatures every year which seems to be happening at least around here you got a wonder like when that's not sustainable anymore when you what do you want to live in Phoenix in August I don't you know that that Phoenix weather we've been there before it's 120 degrees that's not that's not deal about to me you know we got it we got to assume that Robert De Niro vows to rebuild the island of Barbuda after hurricane armor strikes why is it filled with black chicks not he owns the year before I guess he bought a resort there Jamie's taking over no no oh my god did you ever see when they did the fucking benefit for him they did the tribute to Robert De Niro no and Beyonce got up there with a fucking miniskirt and start dancing poor Robert De Niro did go crazy oh my god you could see him just melting high lifes and look at that dogs yeah he loves he loves the sisters he does can't be Madeleine for that it's kind of sad interesting is there another famous guy that's known for love and black chicks as much as De Niro is no no no he's like known for it well you crack jokes about it and everybody knows the joke right it's loan free but nobody really says that cuz it's DeNiro right I'm saying well I mean it's an obvious flavor it's like I mean you I can't even think it a single celebrity that's like known for having a predilection for Asian chicks name one okay name another celebrity that's got a thing for four black chicks its DeNiro it's like De Niro is the running Wesley Snipes he's got a thing for asian chicks fit me thank maybe yeah maybe maybe he's married to one or something something yeah but not enough worry like you can tell a joke about it like De Niro is one of those guys were like a piece of information has to be so far distributed so widely distributed that you can crack jokes about it and everybody knows what you're talking about like that's like the de niro thing it's gotten to the point where anybody could crack a joke about it did you prefer any particular woman tightly I like white chick yeah yeah I love white chicks Terry white just love love them love them love them love them Chinese I like white dirty white chicks yeah I love Y I don't know just something but as a kid I like the Irish chicks I grew up in a past without I was surrounded with chicks with freckles and red hair and sweaty tits I love all that shit you know I don't like dirty feet but I like white chicks you know they say when you're a kid like the things you're surrounded by the things that like you first come in contact with when you become sexually active that that's sort of like cements in your brain and a lot of people but I know those worries and all those Gina's I can't be with that Muresan Gina's they get leases Gina's yeah they wanna fight scream at you and throw shit yeah and it there was something about that that I liked them they were hotter than fucked I love the Italian women you know mm-hmm but I really like white chicks Irish chicks is my shit I love them I fucking love him but to just like I have a friend that's Jewish that's all he dates his black chicks you know really half from The Sopranos yes what was the old man with yeah yeah I don't know if you look she's a little pale for my taste yeah you know it's just some people I have a body same thing Jewish guy that's all marriages ii black chick yeah oh that's right that's right yeah yeah yeah that's all I know and it's funny because you think of like a black like De Niro he's an older guy you know he was around I could just imagine the first time than they were with home oh yeah I've brought a black chick home his dad's like you know well maybe not its dad but how about all those fucking people that loved him in those movies all those Ginn's o's you know probably racist and then loved him and all these and expected him to be with some fucking mafia looking lady and he shows up with some super soul sister well that's why fucking Bronx Tale was so good he really put that part of his life in there like that part with the black chick you know that kid that went to jail that's what Bronx Tale was about really it was about he remember that movie yeah it was about a Bronx Tale is a good fucking movie and they we just I hated the movie theater when I went to see it I didn't like it and it wasn't for me but now was on a couple weeks ago that scene with the bikers that's a great fucking Saint and that's a true story that's a true fucking story yeah this old-school Sammy the bull story but your bikers were into his bar Sammy came back told to be cool no clock the door and said now you can't leave and they just be ever seen that they just man to fucking all those bikers and they get out of that but that movie was about the kid that was on The Sopranos that going to prison for murder what's his colossal oh yeah oh this is hilarious with the guy with bad luck his name was mush some him live in the closet they wouldn't even I don't want his money touching my money he's so bad luck but that whole thing is about him dating the black Jay and then they go to the brother member was jaw that that street in the Bronx where I used to get nickel bags and whatever Avenue or that all that shit up there so it ends in a black neighborhood so he would have to walk home and then 1/9 the walk home is for friends went into a black name but with the car and they got blown up you gotta watch this movie right is it the movie man that Chad's pulmonary guy he did a lot of shit and then he kind of vanished he was still around he's doing this shit and Broadway now what's he doing the Bronx Tale on Broadway he just took it out see he took it out new musical who got him with the gay community look at their de niro and who's the guy on the left that's the gay guy we tell the Bronx Tale yeah this is a good movement bizarre bizarre number this guy lived at your boys and they said to go home at night and tell stories every night so those guys are pissed because they said supposedly took some of their stories Frankie Renzulli and most of his stories from East Boston actually wound up in this movie so he did they kind of have Julie was the kind of a Sopranos right yeah he's right Sopranos he's written for a lot of things yeah that world debt world of guineas and mob movies and mob stuff it's just like it becomes it's like an identity in a weird business it's like an identity that they put on you know this you know the connected Italian character identity you know and like from The Sopranos on that became a big selling point in Hollywood like it was a niche you know that people got excited about like the Italian gangster movie became a big thing the Italian gangster films became a big thing and so there was like a whole bunch of guys like I'm sure you went out for auditions and you were around those guys that were in that loop it's a dumb little it's a dumb loop it's hilarious it really is like well they were talking about last night like look at the Sopranos killed the Mafia TV show that's it you won't see another mom will be again for 10 years because they were so good yeah just covered too many of the babes you've never seen it again every once in a while I got a script for a mom when I want you know Rufus I open it up if I see Gino Vinny or Tony or Angelo I close the script because you're living in a fucking fool's paradise it's not gonna get made or it's not gonna do nothing you gotta come and that's why they haven't been able to figure out the post Soprano world right there was too much they got into the Columbus yeah they even got into Columbus Day that's how brilliant the fucking Sopranos were they did an episode about Columbus Day when they said people down in the Apollo played the cop and oh yeah remember that soprano started off as a comedy yeah oh yeah soprano started off the first episode was over-the-top comedy where what's-her-name Edie Falco was outside with an ak-47 because her daughter was trying to sneak out yeah yeah I mean she was a cartoon character I mean every it was ridiculous and then slowly but surely it became this are really intense complicated drama and it wasn't funny at all well the mother died and that changed everything was the first show that somebody died and changed the course of it because it would have been completely different it would have ended with her being the boss yeah it would have been the first time or a herb but they went back to this last night with the Godfather how they had failed twice to make a mom movie Kirk Douglas had done a movie in 67 and didn't do well so when this Mario Puzo was fucking the book was tremendous they sent it to what's-his-name they did not want Marlon Brando really no they did not want him Brando had been a dud he had just done fucking that movie on the percent that movie where he bought the island Oh island of dr. Moreau no no one the big one when he first bought the island 70 68 I saw when he bought his own eye right but he shot the movie uh bounty what is it the treasure I forget what the name of the movie Monte Cristo's no they gave a bunch of money go down there shoot the movie he fell in love one of the natives so he got like the first guy hey Jamie come in direct the movie and he started fucking around every day so parama wanted footage with clarify I saw the footage they saw birds and people run and they go what happened to our movie so they kind of like fucking five Brando from directing it Mountain Beauty mutiny on the bounty so he was done he we came back to the states like he was persona non grata they didn't want to talk to him no more you fucked our money you left your wife with his hot chick on an island yeah she's hot yeah once he met her he told his wife to go fuck this out they're about to go fuck themselves and he just doesn't hang out goes full screen with her goddamn I get it holy shit that's what legit huh fuck man she's fucking hot that's some serious Polynesian jeans right there baby so when he came back then well you know they didn't want Michael either what they wanted they wanted didn't out one out but you know you mean for Michael corioli they were Leone they wanted a Robert Redford whoa what Oh or Ryan O'Neal well that's hilarious that's what they that's what they want if a rocky that's a lair I don't deal that's what I want that answer inmate from 73 to 75 we need a black actor how about Ryan O'Neal we need a box how about Ryan O'Neal they loved Ryan O'Neal's look so they were gonna put him rocky you don't even hear about him anymore well he's 90,000 fucking years old what is this cat his original cast list like people he had written down for what worthy because Godfather Wow Jimmy Caan Jimmy so who wrote this list this couple is less hopeful is less Wow Cory Leone Marlon Brando underlined he wanted he wanted out Pacino badly he just did that movie about the heroin or something and they want him the the studio didn't want him no the studio didn't want him he wanted them but the studio didn't 1 Wow so fucking John Saxon wasn't a played Sonny Corleone that would have charged Saxon from the editor of the Dragon yeah like I was a good actor yeah Robert to vow for time look at list wow that's amazing yeah there's some movies that just even today if you try to watch them there for now phenomenal that's this one's one of them it's phenomenal this one's one of them don't watch the one with the brought back footage though which ones that that one that HBO released I don't like something he tree you could tell how bad James Caan is as an actor then oh it's brutal it's rude have you seen the 8 hour 1 9 HP oh well they put them all together no they put them all together and they put all the pieces back in really but you got a lot to have a lot of time eight hours yeah it's like six hours there's no time for that you break it up into two hour segments but it's pretty interesting it shows you what really happened with the father in him like the father would just torture Michael ah how you doing how's that little white girlfriend doing her hysterical he would there's a scene in the hospital he pulls them over those little white piece of shit did you tell her and then he like how is those medals one of those shooting people he's shooting strangers is shit and then they go into it opens up with them at the wedding and they go from the wedding to the hospital to see the guy originally called slew the Eddie and you got to see that scene the dude is sitting there Brando walks in and he's like Godfather hold my hand the Reapers gonna come but if he sees you he'll be scared like that's how fucking much they love The Godfather and maybe he goes listen I'm here with my four sons he ain't gonna bother I'm here with your son somewhere I'm here with my sons to pay their respects to you he ain't gonna bother you shows all that shit the guy that blew up his wife in Sicily mmm it shows him getting him and Buffalo now I really back in yeah he owns a pizza parlor he gets in the car they blow him up they show all that shit so who cut that stuff out the studio it's too long yeah you know don't quote me on that maybe the studio maybe the director hmm but James Caan scenes are just not too bueno no you can see he doesn't but Michaels fucking tough Michael slots all those dudes that's when directing was directed if you've ever done anything bad in your life you learn anything bad when you do something bad you know your ears ring your ears ring o when your Adrenaline's off-the-charts when you're hiding in a bush and somebody's coming towards you you gotta hit them with that stick you have no idea what happens to you do you have no idea Joe Rogan that's why I've always loved the godfather all those type of movies because when he comes out of the bathroom you hear the train screeching G right but that's what you hear when you open bro when you're right probably I'm just talking about hitting somebody the head with a stick right never mind having to come out of a restaurant with a gun and shooting two people I can't imagine where your heart the way that you just get up and shoot beep your heart beats that Adrenaline's going you fucking you don't hear nothing like why are we still robbing us I can't hear nothing don't you just your heart is gone the problem you just go under your heart takes fucking over you know I had this I forgot about this I had this when I was 19 I was an electrician did you know that an aspirin there was a dude that used to break my balls all the time like say stupid things for me he will always go this to things a buddy I don't like your Cuban in you from these coasts so I always knew me and this guy we're gonna have a little fucking problem I was 19 he was a little older than me I always know me and this motherfucker have a problem and he'd always say little things to me look at my tools out of the bed and I love his thumb go get him yourself bitch and I was kind of scared of the guy but I knew me and him we're gonna battle one day and one day he said something mean I told enough go fuck himself when I came back from lunch you put a box cutter to my throat he got me as I was coming in he threw me against the wall he had the box cutter army I was bigger than physically and I knew I could fuck him up I was just scared I was a young kid I was not in my I was living in basalt Colorado you know I was not on my turf with my friends but after he put that knife to my throat I'll never forget that I I fucking like when he stepped away that thing came into my mind where if you pull your gun out use it like that thing came up at that and I go I'm gonna fucking kill this guy I'm gonna do something bad for this guy and I had a guy used to shoot with taught me how to shoot guns he was a Vietnam vet and on the weekends I would give him money he'd teach me to shoot everything a arse and fucking a K he taught he had every weapon he was just a Vietnam vet to live than aspirin and I finally figured out why they put all those Vietnam vets around Aspen and Colorado why NORAD yeah NORAD so they could be ready to fucking rock I never thought about that you know everybody thinks that if we get hit we're gonna hit California in New York the most strategic place to it would be NORAD wouldn't it cuz they control everything out of Colorado and under that fucking mountain let's read up about I don't know shit about that yeah like that was years ago they always said we will get a hit will you hit Colorado so what happened with you and the guy in the box man the guy in the box cut I kept fucking like I was scared of this guy Joe Rome and I was definitely scared of this guy but at that time I wanted to kill my stepfather so I went to my friend the guy I was teaching me how to shooting shit and I told him about what happened he goes well if you're thinking of shooting his stepfather why don't you use this guy's practice well what's the difference if you're gonna go back to New Jersey and spoke his stepfather and shoot him start with this guy use him his fucking practice either I'm saying I was a little pussy I thought about but I don't like the guy put a knife to my throat I fucking didn't like that Jerome at all I said I'm gonna get this guy so I was cool to him at work I let him go to work this went on I figured I'd get him over the holidays he was a boozer and he went to this little bar in Carbondale all the time and I think I might get him down there so I went to Fred I don't teach me everything I need to do to get this guy down he goes we're gonna get you out as quick as I could possible and he's the first guy never taught me a hanger you whip somebody with a fucking hanger it's all over you take the handle whip it tape the other side and just come on at dark with a hanger they don't see nothing all they see is this that's all they see they don't see a fucking hanger you know I'm saying I never forget I stopped this guy for like fucking a week man and I finally fucking call him Charlie and you know I couldn't hear for like two days after I hit him with that anger so you beat him up with a hanger I bit him up with a hanger and a fucking sticks fighting stick a fighting stick you have those you know like Paulie yeah you know collie sticks yeah I took one of those I put it on my jacket and I whipped them with the hanger first when he got out of his car and then when he went down I whipped them in the legs dog I pissed my pants I had shit in my ass fear is a motherfucker like even when you're winning fear is a motherfucker and I couldn't here for two days out and what happened the dude never came back to work really I went back after the holidays thinking I was going to arrested that day because I did it well I had the mask with the holes I did it perfectly oh I threw all the clothes away down in Glenwood Springs I got rid of everything you know me I had this teacher that taught me everything he goes if you don't have blood on your clothing be in a sweat get it rid of everything so I had a bag in the car I went down Valley and got through my clothes as I went down the Aeneid you ever go up and down 82 if you go from Glenwood Springs up to Aspen that's one of the worst roads in the country I just drew my clothes out of there if I was an 18 19 this guy had to be like 31 bro I could smell the fuck I was just whipping him at night with that woman so I took the stick out and I hit him in the legs a few times and I got close to my said don't tell him less to nobody oh I'll fucking come back and beat you again because I didn't want him to hear my voice I went back after holidays he was they never came back to work the guy sent somebody down at his house and never came back but I was so deaf like there's been a couple times that my hearing has been gone because of something bad that I've done and the fucking my heartbeat and the adrenaline or you hear is like a fucking beep well most people are just not used to that kind of confrontation you know well the average person I just couldn't let him get away with that that little motherfucker you know I never saw him again after that never saw him again move to everything he moved I was shitting pickles for a couple of weeks he come get me no it was you I don't know really I don't know I gave him like a three month window after them I wanted him to think I want him to forget about it like I was gonna do it the right way that's how you do it all right you know Wow I imagine that was you at 19 like imagine like stop this is points in your life where you go was that even really me I mean I know it was me because I have the memory of it I know it was my physical body back then but wasn't really me don't what I was trying to write the book I would read like well that those chapters I would read it two days later and I would have to stop Giroux because it didn't stop like it didn't sound like when I was in high school or I go from robbing a gas station for my buddy losing $60,000 now we had to rob somebody get the money that I was in a flight to Sarasota Florida and then the people you know when I was 18 I robbed a jewelry store and I had to go away I got a call one day anything goes come back the guy got it all taken care of the guy got and didn't arrest you in 60 days so he filed an insurance report now they can't arrest you you know like I learned about all those things at a young age like what a scam so the guy knew I robbed them and then afterward a friend of mine tell me this guy bumped into that guy in the Christmas party he was happy you robbed him he goes he wanted you to rob he just didn't want you to come back because then you get arrested and had to pay restitution what can I afford five hours a week right if he collects the insurance he gets a big lump sum payment plus he could liable what was in there so I was doing him a favor no shit fucking crazy what you learn man what you learn as a fucking young I was fucked up Jerome this is amazing that you got through it all though that's the really crazy thing you got through it all pretty unscathed no physic cost me a couple years of my life costing my daughter cost me nobody is in my life that I'm what am i early don't you I got arrested well I got arrested for the kidnapping then I had the kid and then I had my beef with him you know I had the beef with him when he called me a spic and I smacked them and I had two families already they were gonna throw me in jail for fucking him being the guy that was Daniels John your ex-wife and when you have two felonies one more but he couldn't in the city of thank God for Balder and liberals thank God for Boulder and liberals you can't use a racial slur and inside the city limits a boulder really because there you go because the University Colorado when that chick called JJ flamming and the nigga and he smacked it and he got away with it on Monday at court because she so the same check what was that story some white chick was drunk coming out of a fucking pole goes one of those 18 and over bars and she got into an argument with JJ Flannigan my corner you know it was racist JJ finding was a football player at the time for the University of Colorado from do you ever see that that from like 9 89 to 93 that a lot of problems in Colorado they were getting called criminals but what it was it was just three black guys walking down you know fucking Boulder at 11 o'clock at night cops pull over one of them says racism they get into a fight I mean don't get me wrong nobody was angels that fucking one line back of the head can a mr. McGee somebody called him a yah one time he punched him in the face so hard he broke the guy's eye socket that guy ended up going to the fucking New York Giants as a linebacker but that's how bad that cop prom with the college football players it was that bad and boulderon at one time so when I went to court and the guy goes there's no charges here even the cops wouldn't charge and they wrote me a summons to go to court but they wouldn't charge me for smack in the fuckin dude then right after that I knew you know what man if I stay I'm gonna go to jail that's number one number two I really wanted to do comedy I really wanted to give Tommy a shot you know I was like I gotta give Tommy a shot hey how old were you 32 years old I got on stage the first time 1991 so how long is that 26 she is yeah 26 she is so the first time I dicked around for the first two years but like by 93 I got really serious about that's when I went back to be a dad I was really serious about that I had a good job but they kept fuck with me but that one day when he called me a spic and I smacked them that changed everything I was like that's never gonna be the same I saw my little girl cry and you know she's here all up in that I grew up in that world with people getting smacked you know she didn't grow up in that so I just said listen I'm never gonna win this fucking war this is gonna be a war that I might either end up in jail or something good and I'm gonna kill one of these fucks I might as well give comedy shot what do they have to lose it's this crazy thing that that was your option and then think about all the shit that you've been through now like thinking of yourself back then you know I mean what do you think about today like your life with your little daughter and your wife and you know doing podcasts and doing all these shows everywhere and then just thinking like holding someone hostage kidnapping them robbing a drug dealer the machine gun and we just think that was you it's it's weird because that's not you you are right now no no but you have these memories of things that you did I used a weapon like four times to bust and to drug the others house all the things that could happen oh yeah easily I mean the other times I would just rob them just because who I was I don't give a fuck what are you doing man I'm just like thinking about that guy that pulled the knife on you what if after you beat him he came back and tried to get you and then escalated and the next thing you know he stabbed him where he shot him or easily could emerge I was so confused at that time in 1919 everybody's confused at 19 but 19 and been through the shit you know as I confused as I was I was really fucking confused so I I was you know from I think till 20-something I wanted to kill my stepdad and that was why what was it that was all that was getting consumed with me like that that was my consumption like the pain I was going through without my mom the drugs and killing my stepdad well why you stepdad what does it was about my mom died without a will my mom didn't leave a will so he took all the money all the jewelry he didn't give me a piece I didn't collect Social Security you know I didn't get my real father died my real father was the first Cuban committeeman in Union City all right and he was doing coke in 1966 and somebody gave him a package there was pure heroin a little wine and that he died they took him to the hospital and they never signed the death certificate in Union City New Jersey so they forced my mother to take him back to Cuba 1967 my mom had to take my dad my dad's buried in Cuba Wow but guess what my dad got an insurance policy and then and the debt the coroner never signed the death certificate so I never got that Prudential Insurance plus my mom all properly with Miami Airport is my mom had that property with to our drug partners where that fucking thing was and I didn't get my cut from that so I wanted to kill the guy so for years that was my whole thing you know when I went to Colorado and hooked up with Fred and he taught me how to shoot and not a fucking you know shoot a fucking rifle and measure distance and all that shit they do on TV that was me what did you step down say did you ever talk to him we ended up talking and shit you know what man he was the type of person he was and I wasn't gonna get shit and after a while I accepted it I was like you know what I'm putting too much stock into this fuck this I'm gonna go make my own money do you know I'm saying like sometimes we get stuck and I'm happy I didn't get no money because I wouldn't have been the person I am today yeah I'm happy I didn't get any money I'm not funny like that's one of the worst things you can do is like win the lottery or get a big inheritance you think getting a big inheritance would be amazing for you it's one of the worst things that can happen terms of like your ambition if you're in the middle of doing something you've got some ideas or maybe you don't know what you want to do and you need to find something you're hungry then all sudden you just get a giant chunk of money and now you're buying things and your ambitions gone you don't know what to do I don't mind giving somebody startup money you know you have to give you a child some type of startup money you know something wrong with that but I'm socking about like winning the lottery like people win the lottery it's like there's a giant percentage of them that ruined their life giant like they've done all these Studies on people winning a lot so what is it because I'm giving you a bunch of money you didn't earn it like I'm giving you a bunch of money is that what it is yeah for sure like think about you and all the money that you've earned in your life you've earned it you do all these shows you've you've built up a successful stand-up career you built up a successful podcast you've done a lot of film and TV you've worked you've worked right you've gathered up and you make a good living now you know but this is all from work right there's a build-up to it it makes sense in your head there's an effort there's a reward for that effort there's motivation there's discipline there's focus and then there's a payoff for all that if you just get the payoff with no discipline no focus no lessons learned it's just not a healthy way to exist it's terrible that's why rich kids are so fucked up rich kids that grow up with trust funds are all fucked not all of them a giant persistent fuck died I knew a guy who was a rich guy and his parents were fucking billionaires and he grew up with two trust funds he burned through his first trust fund fucked that up and then they had a backup trust fund for him he was buying houses and flipping them and losing money and investing in businesses and they all went under he had no discipline no understanding of what money really was and no hunger because he never had a time in his life when he was poor he never had a time in his life where he's worried about paying the bills and if you don't have that and you don't have that real motivation I just don't think you ever really appreciate success the people I think that appreciate success of the people that worked for it you know what you you can remember back when you were poor like I've had people say to me like why do you do so many jobs why do you have so many things you do like what why do you keep moving why do you do so much because I remember being scared I remember being broke I remember having no idea where the fuck the money was coming from or what my future was gonna be and I was always terrified of being a loser that's that feeling of not succeeding is what motivates you that know knowing that you failed in the past and that you know there's been many times where like how many times are you bombed and you you get off stage you like do this I'm not a comedian I'm fucking terrible like I got to figure out what the fuck I'm doing with my life if you don't go through those things if you don't have those experiences if you don't have those moments in your life where you're unsure of the future you're not going to have the real resolve that it takes to make it the grit and determination that it takes to move forward and if you don't have that any success that you do have you're not gonna appreciate nothing comes easy and if it does come easy it's not you don't have it you don't really have it nothing comes easy so funny how I would never stick with you Jitsu for what's understand them I would have quit jiu-jitsu ass cuz it's so hard because I would have thought I wouldn't be able to do it yeah once you try something I can't do this you're dead right but we come how fucking scary huh how weird is it that you and I chose a career that basically for the first three years we're not gonna get it done not a dime and no no certainty at all I don't nobody understands that like nobody understands that that that you're not gonna get a fucking job not only that there's no pathway it's like if you want to be a doctor you go to college you get a degree you go to medical school you do your residency there's a pathway the pathway is it's it's hard work it's very difficult to do not everyone's gonna get through it successfully but at least there's a pathway what the fuck is the pathway for being a successful comedian your pathway is different than mine mine's different than Junkins Duncan's door Ari's we all have different pathways we all have different styles we all have different points of view we all have different ways we deliver material but all have different ways of writing no one can tell you what to do when you're first cut into this did you think of any success honestly what did you think the outcome was gonna because for me I thought that I was just gonna be a road comic and if I was an extra in a movie that would be the best I would get for me like that's the honest truth you know Fitzsimmons and I was talking were talking about this recently cuz Fitzsimmons and I started out exactly at the same time our number one goal was being a professional like getting paid not having a day job that was the goal being able to pay your bills that was Michael that's not having a day job yeah I didn't care if I made 80,000 of 22 no there was no no no no no it was no like I want to buy a mansion or no I just want to be huh I want to be happy I didn't want a day job and I knew one other thing when I got in that car in June of 95 and I got on 30th Street in Boulder and I headed out on iris there's a gas station there and I probably had when I took my cuz that I left on a thing of a Tribble run you know that right that's where you left Colorado yeah like the time people with Tribble all right I met a girl in Michigan that was nasty hot little dirty strike girl white girl Carol and then she came to Colorado threw me a little dose of that monkey got me all crazy and then she went to Seattle I was having so many problems in Denver that it just there was no listen I love my little girl I believe that I could've been a good dad it just wasn't gonna work it just wasn't gonna work this was gonna end of it this was not gonna hang good this and all I kept saying was that picture Mickey Rourke at the end the fucking angel heart when he's sitting there smoking his cigarette with a razor in his hand blood all over them that's all I kept thinking about I go you know what I'm gonna go to Seattle for summer hang out with this broad but in my heart I knew I wasn't gonna come back I knew I wasn't gonna come back so much that I had two licenses you know yeah you buy out you know you lose the license and then one day you find it and by that time you're already got license yeah I must have like $69 on me when I left bald and I had to get the Hodgdon Utah that was my first road Grigg ever for David Tribble armed in Utah I think it was like a 10-hour Drive maybe longer how long had you been doing stand-up at that point two years so you start in Denver I started 91 and now is 95 but you gotta remember from 91 to 93 I was a part-time comic I sold valiums you want to buy coke meet me at the broker I saw your coke when I'm doing 10 minutes I didn't write I didn't really know anything about copy I just knew I wanted to be a convict I had a business card and I told people in the big that was his wine but then I did a stent in New York for nine months in 93 and that's where I really got a hint I took a stand-up comedy class you ready for this the guy took the stand-up comedy class a New York Comedy Club in 1993 I trained with him now in jujitsu really moved to Boulder he's a comedy writer in town first couple of times I went to neighs my aides were both oldest fuck he's I think he's two years older than he's got white hair and one day I go he kept calling himself Frank Frank Frank Frank and I'm on top of him and I go you fucking Lee Frank I took your riding course I never forgot what Wow when realize why you were rolling with him while I was wrong with him and he told me he's friends with you he opened for you at the tree house a greenery or some kinetic yeah he worked with you so now we're tight now if I see him at jujitsu we talk about comedy and so I took his stand and when I took his stand-up comedy class that's when it hit because he said something that hit home he goes stand-up comedy is how your world collides with the rest of the world plain and simple hmm I took that home and I thought about it I'm like fucking make sense and then a week later I went into your old triple in let me yeah a little triple in for that yeah old triple in is a fucking dive they used to do an open mic from midnight to 4:00 in the morning in like alcohol ville can you look it up for me it's it it's our lines but it's closed what places it's in Manhattan it's not there anymore you'll see it yeah all triple wind and it did open mics there just people falling asleep you know you wanted that 12 like I will drive a limo man so I would get to the corner of 12 sign my name up and the guy would go three hours I gotta come back in three hours it's midnight so I would take the limo go to Harlan Dwyre package of coke maybe buy refre and then I would go there and do my last spot for the night look the old triple and Wow look at that place there's then an open mic there from 12:00 to 4:00 in the morning look wow that's crazy so I go well p.m. to 4:00 a.m. holy shit this is 1993 I got nothing going on I'm depressed I'm driving a limo I'm snorting coke every night I'm living in a little cot and I go in there one man who's in there probably John Leguizamo he's on stage just talking but when I was sitting there watching number I noticed something there was eight people in the audience but in his world there was Madison Square Garden like he didn't give a fuck Joe it's like when you do a Comedy Store late and there's six people and people you get off and you like people like that was great brochure was great cuz I believe I was at the god yeah if you think about six people at the store you're not gonna be you you can't think about it that way you know when Paul Mooney like when I Paul Mooney always intimidated the shit out of me me too because I always knew that he was a writer for Pryor and he was like the elder statesman to the comedy store back in 94 when I first started there and I always had this feeling around him like I was always nervous around him you know and when I first started there you know I was this young white guy in my 20s I wasn't very good you know I didn't I didn't get any respect from him you know and then one day he saw me doing a late night spot like 1 o'clock in the morning and there was only like fucking 15 20 people in the audience but I was just doing my best I was doing I was doing it and and I heard in the back of the room he was laughing he was laughing at my shit and then I got offstage and he came up to me after the show and he goes he goes you are a real comic he goes you did that show like it was a packed motherfucking room that's it and he goes and you killed those people he goes you killed those people he goes you were a real motherfucking comic and he walked away and I remember feeling so good like I can't believe Paul Mooney just gave me a compliment like he told me I was a real comic like I was in and then ever since then give me hugs every time you saw me you know and this is like you get that pat on the back or that you know that thumbs up from someone who your expect that that means the world man that's gigantic that's so huge I mean when someone does that to you that the just of the wind in your sails you know it just can take you to a totally different place cuz you you got the you got the stamp you know you got a stamp of approval from someone who's real I'll never forget that I didn't know the power of the commies though like I had no I read about it I heard about it from you and other people I didn't Miami with Mooney this has to be baby 2003-2004 and I opened from you know it's a two-man show it's just being him at the Miami improv and I'm on stage and I just happen to catch a fucking I just have my catch a fucking you know the energy thing just killing well you you used to crush there because you would do half your punchlines in Spanish I'm killing but I'm being dirty and I hear the door open and Paul Mooney I could see him walking in and he looks at me and I'm killing I don't having a good set he's killing me looking at me and he went out in the hallway bro and the door was open and he kept yelling to the staff look at him I'm like fuck maybe I'm being too dirty right maybe he's gonna complain about me I can probably complain the bomb they told me this isn't true right I've known him from the store for five fucking years Tom he's not I think when I'm too dirty and shit when I got there he mean when he came up give keep it going one more time for my little brother I got off the stage and I go what happened on the air he was he was back there yelling fuck the fucking him props you don't taught him how to be like that that's Mitzi shore motherfucker that's the Comedy Store he was back there yelling that's the Comedy Store you win props you don't develop dick that's the cop you listen to that that's the Comedy Store that's what happens when you hang on at the Comedy Store that's why that little fat motherfuckers killing me cuz that's a fuckin Comedy Store and that you know you're right that feels tremendous one fucked he's in your Kawana it feels great yeah he's he was something special he would own the room to Paul Mooney would sit down it didn't matter what time he went up didn't matter how many people in the audience who would sit down he had a little tiny bottle champagne and he would take his fucking time it would take his time so much oh yeah how to control a room how to control not not control overall meaning like you know you're control freak but how to get everybody to pay attention and lock into your thoughts like he didn't try to to do a song and a dance for people if y'all look at me look at me look at me he would just command presence with excellence this material was excellent his delivery was excellent he was calm and composed and you just always felt like you were trying too hard when you would watch him you like I gotta figure out who's doing you're right that's what he did teach ya because I give a fuck he didn't give a fuck but he looked legitimately didn't give a fuck and boy that guy got stole from a lot a lot man see I used to steal all his shit switch out the word nigger put in the word Mexican switch it up about Star Wars and about this and about that he just and you would see the different cuz Mooney would go on after Mencia to like Mencia would go on before him and do his shit and Mooney would go on afterward you can give a fuck just did his shit but he knew it he would be very frustrated by it you know he was uh it was a big influence to a lot of us that got to see and watch him because we all knew his history I mean he was one of the head writers for arguably the greatest comedian of all time you know I mean he was one of the you feel yeah Richard Pryor you don't think this I feel it too but there's a big argument people always wanna start an argument with the other dude who had all those specials what's his name I can't think it was George Carlin yeah I look hot - Richard Pryor Oh something odd to me it's clear it's clear as day it's not this is not a knock on George Carlin who was a great comedian he's a great communicator sharland to me was more of a social spokesman like he was a social commentator and he was a very great comedian as well he had some funny material for sure but George Carlin did a special every year every year he did a special and I think you know his body of work is certainly larger than anybody else's he's certainly one of the all-time greats but to me there was something about Pryor that was just so special and unique and powerful and just just resonated man I never I'll never forget listening to his stuff and I was a little kid me and my girlfriend in high school I think I was like 16 she was 15 and we were in my room listening to Richard Pryor on a cassette and just cry and laugh and sitting on my bed laughing and laughing and I'll never forget I'll never forget going to see him my parents took me to see live on the Sunset Strip when I was like 14 or 13 or something like that I'll never forget being in that movie theater laughing so fucking hard and looking around at people like walking back and forth on their chairs and all I remember thinking is I can't believe this guy's just talking like I've seen all these amazing movies like you know back to school or stripes or you know name the comedy movies that you've seen what all these years I saw these comedy movies that were great and funny but they were never this funny like this guy's just talking I'm like this has got to be the funniest shit of all time and he's just talking and especially when yes this is 82 okay so I guess I was 15 so it's 14 or 15 that's when he came out was he - yeah so I was 15 so watching this as a teenager are it planted the seed in my head like holy shit like how is it possible that this guy can do this that he can just talk and that talking and just explaining your life experiences could be so hilarious that's the seed that was planted in my head I mean I never thought I was going to be a comedian I never never had any aspirations you know my friend dr. Steve Steve Graham yes he just called me we just communicate he's still one of my best friends to this day and will be to the dad die because that guy is the guy talking and doing comedy I was training that's when I was competing and I just loved comedy as a fan just loved comedy and I would always make fun of people and do like impressions of people having sex like our friends like like you know I would just try to make everybody laugh you know we were all gathered around the locker room everybody be nervous before sparring or everybody be nervous when we're on our way to fights and tournaments and stuff like that and I would be the guy who made everybody laugh and he pulled me aside and he just said you could be a comedian like you're really funny it's like you could really do this and I said I remember saying you think I'm funny because you liked me I go other people are gonna think I'm an asshole I say fucked up things like I say fucked up things because I'm around all these savages you know I'm around like Leroy Rodriguez and I had a friend named major battle that was his name his real name was major battle he's one of J Kim's black belts Larry Jones all these guys were savages and they were just fighters you know and so I could say fucked up things around them because they were used to kicking people in the head they were used to fighting in tournaments and taking you know taking bus trips to go kick the shit out of people I mean that was what they did that's what everybody did back then so the way I felt about it was like I'm making a group of very crazy people laughs like these are like we're all misfits you know we were all like people that didn't fit in in a normal world because we were just fighting and I'm like they'll laugh because they're crazy and they're out there punching people and kicking people and this is a different world I'm like other people are not gonna think I'm funny but he talked me into it and so from there I started writing some stuff down I waited about six months till I turned 21 I went to an open mic and then after I turned 21 like maybe was it 16 days later I went onstage I turned 21 August 11 1988 and then August 27th I went onstage yeah but that was just a hundred percent someone telling me to do it a hundred percent I always loved it I used to watch evening at the improv and I would always watch stand-up on The Tonight Show but I just loved it like the way I like music now you know like I love watching music or listening to music I don't have any talent I don't have any aspirations but I love I just love music to me it's just it does something to me it makes me feel good I'm a fan of it you know I'm a fan of a lot of shit and I'll never do but stand up it was just one of those things like I just love doing it and I would uh you know it would just be my number one source of like release as far as like entertainment it's funny that you say that about words because for me I was listening to the Beatles with my buddy and I got an older brother that was a junkie that's how I discovered Richard Pryor oh really we were listening to the Beatles like I wanna hold your hand and we're like this is cool his brother came rising what the fuck you faggots listening to her well like we'll listen to The Beatles you know we're all excited he's like take that shit off they took this album cover out with a black dude on it I honestly put some on I hear this fuckin laughter and I'm like what the fuck is this shit awesome come and kind of stage you know Richard Pryor and you're like and after that first side I was done like once I heard the wino meets Dracula there's something I said that's what that's that was my I don't know what I'm if it's the niggas crazy well why don't meets Dracula I don't know what I'm exactly is this something I said all the niggas crazy those are the 12 I don't know which one when I heard the last cut on it which is the wino meets Dracula I was hooked I left there I bought the album I brought it home that I bought some Bicentennial mega and there's a there's a friend of mine ray Cannella who I still talk to he was a VP of sci-fi and he goes do you still remember coming on my house in the sixth grade and your mother catching us listening to his mother and I wasn't allowed now don't you remember that shit we used to have a band I used to be a singer Ben sixth grade really rakin Aladin lip-read John bender what kind of music the Beatles wow the Beatles I want to hold your hand help I need somebody yeah the dig is great but that nigger's crazy look at the title they put like an asteroid where the pie is like what the fuck is wrong with people but meanwhile it says it on the album like they have the picture where you see him on the album and it says ni Jie GE R but then they have the actual title for sale what's the website this was that's a yell peace calm oh that's an LP you can get that in vinyl oh yeah Wow look at that face - who's young then man he's like in his 30s Gaudi was good see to me it's like I have this is my version of my like evolutionary chart of comedy I think the guy who started it all off as Lenny Bruce Lee - so I have Lenny Bruce posters framed on my wall I mean like I just feel like I don't like I don't enjoy watching him or listening to him as much because I don't think he was as good today because I think that the culture was so different back then that it's not it's very difficult for us to to see like the things that he's saying are not groundbreaking today because he already broke that ground and then the culture shifted with it I mean it's not just him but a lot of other people a lot of other authors and politicians all these different people broke different ground and cultures evolved since then but I think Richard Pryor took what he did in the honesty that Lenny Bruce exhibited on stage and he brought it to the next level you know he took it to a new place and I think that that happens a lot when people are influenced by other people I think that's one of the things that's really important the distinction between being influenced and stealing you know I think we all influence each other and I know you guys influence me like Ari and Duncan and you and all of us together you know Tom Burtt we influence each other and that we inspire each other and that when you see someone do really stuff like you want to do more bird does it to me you know Louie you see someone doing really wood Chappell you see really good comedy you want to do more really good comedy and everyone sort of influencing everybody so I think that honesty that Lenny Bruce expressed was so unique for the time that there was no one had ever done any sort of social commentary in in a comedy form the way that Lenny had done so and then Richard Pryor took it and just blew it out of the water I mean Richard Pryor was raised the brothels he was raised in a brothel Joey he was raised in a whorehouse in Peoria Illinois I mean Richard Pryor was experiencing life in a different way you know in all his experiences with drugs and craziness and wild people growing up and then you know the the comedy of the time-shifting from the 60s into the 70s it became this thing that he was at the forefront of and in my opinion he's like the most revolutionary figure in all comedy he is he he was just so different and so unique and so polished you know I remember I was a I was living with my roommates and like because it was like 87 or something like that we have this place in in Revere we're all living together wasn't Malden malt we're living oh no it was Lynn Lynn Massachusetts near the beach and we all watched a Sam Kinison special which was hilarious it was really funny but then we watched prior after we watched Kennison and we were like wow like look how much smoother Pryor is like that's what I remember thinking and remember my friend Billy goes look how much more polished he is I'm like that's the word right it's like polished he's like yeah he's like smooth there he was smoother he just had a different sort of style whereas Kennison was just Kinnison was just kick-starting everything and just fucking knock you know this guy you see him coming but Lenny what's his name what's the first guy he's like Lenny Bruce I like Lenny Bruce I don't think his materials rages but I like this cadence yeah yeah man you know a man yeah I told her yeah I listen he's got some jokes that hold up listen champ you know yeah I come back in a little while see because he sent a word slap I don't know if you know the word see stamp is a great word because he's yeah my wallet and I like how they shot his specials I like how they shot him I like I like that black and white somebody just gave me in one of the towns gave me him live in Carnegie Hall it's got you know yes Wow after why you said thingy or should I shoot myself but there's a couple piece in there will you see it man I read that book that land ladies and gentlemen that's a book that that's a great hook the one about the hotel in New York and how he oh you know you did jazz music you know shooting heroin all day hanging file on the windows the windows copy that ladies and gentlemen love was a shit I love all this shit that's what made me become Ambani my wife sure used to look good standing up against this thing she's the lowest though I really put her down no no I really miss her I don't want some sharp chick that can quote Kerouac and walk with boys I just want to hear my old lady say get up and fix this thing it's still making noise what the fuck is this dog it's just this is godly yeah this one he was just doing weird shower fucking me out he was he has a joke today that still holds up about gay people he goes dig the homosexuals he goes they lock him up in jail before being gay where they put him in there with a bunch of men who won't have sex with him give you some volume on this [Music] no I promise continuity I'll behave myself I'll do all the lines where he hurt you know that's the thing you know I have a reputation for being sort of controversial and irreverent and also the semantics bear trap of bad taste and actually I do have and I will always be accused of bad taste by the people who eat and rest service you know that kind of scene to anyone yet but you might be interested in how I became offensive like started in school with a drinking and I was really I was like good real depressed kids you know seven eight years old I really get juiced and so the teacher would really get bugged you know with with me singing and carrying on calling Columbus of things younger and boosting Aaron Burr and then smoking I don't know if you can see can you see that from here I've got like them this tattoo here I fix a youtube I see I smoke Marlboros and I was six years old and it grew up there semantics there are words that offend me let's see Governor Faubus segregation offend me a nighttime television offends me sometimes the shows that exploit homosexuality narcotics and prostitution under the guise of helping the societal problem in the accept like for a few shows one guy on the coast has got like a nutty sense of you may know his name is Paul Coates and he found out dig like there were kids that eight and nine years old that was sniffing airplane glue [Music] you get higher you know and I had sort of a fantasy how it happened the kid is alone in his room and it's Saturday the child is played by George McCready what else do you know I were alone in the room and it's Saturday mother's away and what'll I do that's good in hospitals I'll make an airplane that's good out it's hard to like it's you know I'm saying it doesn't really translate today because just we're just this was irreverent and crazy back then but today we're like hmm very interesting yeah he was getting it he was doing it well this thing it's historic right so you're watching this and you're hearing people laugh and you got to put your eat it's it's impossible to enjoy this without understanding the context of the time that he was doing it like you have to kind of like put yourself at the time where all this was taking place whereas I think prior stuff still translates today you know there's a lot of prior material that you'll watch today and you'll still laugh your ass off stuff of him going back to Africa stuff of him shooting his car cuz his girlfriend's trying to leave so he shot the car like he's got some some bits that are still to this day like and you know he massively influenced Eddie Murphy massively influenced Chris Rock who was influenced by Eddie Murphy you know I mean he's I think he's the cornerstone I think he's the big cornerstone to stand up I'm happy you said that I feel the same way I thought that you were gonna I like George Carlin I think George Carlin a great Adamic sure but he wasn't my Richard Pryor Richard Bryan my fucking down I love for me for me is Pryor and then it was Kinnison after Pryor McKenna's I think Kinnison for a couple of years was just a monster monster that HBO special yeah still one of mine that was the first out the liner what's the name of that live from hell yeah yeah that's - other than hell fucking tremendum here listen dice is first special oh yeah it's a fucking tank there's some specials that they just they all that I used to watch when I used to go to that fourth they used to be a movie room rental place on 28th Street in Boulder it was three floors it was the biggest video store on the west coast years ago they had everything I rented that Rodney special from them so much you know what else I rented the best of B et for Joe Torre so tell Ari Joe Torre was the warm-up then before but when he had his own no no because in those days yeah what's his name was the host of the show for Def Jam before yeah who was the host of Def Jam they used to have Joe Torre it was Jack back then remember that he would do Slyke sleeveless shirts he'd have giant ass fucking arm Jack he was in that movie Janet Jackson yes that's what he was shot with Tupac and fuck in the the Janet Jackson's Mexican boy forget Steve you yet some pictures of video of Joe Torre hosting Def Jam like with he would wear sleeveless shirts like nobody ever dressed like that and he was funny he was funny bro I like that one where's that guy been I just flew with him a couple weeks ago where we still lives here recently you know he has his house in st. Louis he's got a house he's raising this kid and guy Torry started that fat tuesdays right that was the thing that was at the Comedy Store fucking great guys but I Tori's it's fucking amazing there's Joe see if you can find a picture of him write down nothing doesn't show I think dude he was jacked like unusually jacked for a comedian it doesn't show him on stage with like sleeveless shirts and shit well the cute Martin Lawrence band that guy was my nemesis not not in a bad sense but in that I would have to go on after him all the time the groom was touring oh my god Mitzi sure put me on after him 50 fuckin times those were like some of the 50 hardest sets I ever had like doing stand-up in the early days I would just fucking bomb just like the Hindenburg okay just go down in flames it's okay Jay I never really saw him at the store oh man he was so good I caught him but it was before your time this was like when I first started so I was at the store first got passed in 94 so this was like around 94 95 before you came along and he was on fire Martin Lawrence was on fire and he people forgot how goddamn good he is because he went crazy and he had all those issues and you know he's wearing a rubber suit and he had a gun he got pulled over and he said he was dehydrated he was on some sort of drugs and they locked him up in a psych ward like there's a lot of nutty shit with him right so people forgot how goddamn good he was when he was in his prime but when he was in his prime yeah there he is and bad boys but that's not the prize that's the standup though was what was up when I saw him at the comedy store and you know he would wear fucking like leather jumpsuits and shit and just rip that place apart he was on fire and he was another one that had a bunch of jokes that people had decided were offensive it's when MTV was getting upset at Dice Clay and when they banned Dice Clay for offensive material I believe he got caught up in a controversy about offensive material - it's like the early days of political correctness they decided to get pissed at certain jokes the other day I was driving I was thinking about news radio you so crazy you motherfucking hired not horshack but you know Steen Epstein to play your brother yeah Apollo I was 17 Nick DiPaolo and Bryan Callen oh my god where did you pull up Epstein well they hired Epstein but Nick DiPaolo and Bryan Callen I brought it okay I thought that yeah hi Epstein - yeah no no no no no no no I I didn't meet him until he was on the set he was a real nice guy though did he pass away yeah yeah I checked it I'm feeling good it was really fucking sick bro your buddy the one guy you introduced me to from that baseball show you were on the Spanish guy and I was on there with you nice guy Spanish guy yeah you are the baseball show yeah well I'm Kim's little Barney Whelan bar Mike Starr Mike Starr whoo the Spanish guy that came to visit at the store a few times he's second guy yeah I just donated to his there's a dude from Star Trek remember that that dude it's in Star Trek all the time fucking what is his name goddammit but he was the older pitcher and I was the young asshole ballplayer yeah she was in not Betty what was it Betty wait no the other lady from what's the cast some god dammit I remember her name see if you can find the cast yeah but you don't want images you want actual text don't go to images sometimes it pops up well see ya been Rose Marie yeah Rose Marie Ben Greenwood Mike star keep going scrolling left yeah Ben Greenwood he thought Giessen start he's in a bunch of movies now Dan Florrick he was in Law & Order Law & Order the other way that dunno Wentworth she was hilarious having a bunch of shit Chris browning he was on he's been a bunch of sons and he recently was he like fuck weird man what year was that what years would say it was more for that's when I had to move to California I was miserable I was shooting that's the first couple of I was like 26 they're so weird you know what man when when it first started out it was fun and then what happened was with with TV shows a lot of times you have like these really funny writers and these guys who wrote it originally we're really good but the they had written for married with children and the Simpsons and the network had decided for some reason they weren't strong enough to run the show and that they there were only writers they weren't like a real showrunner so they brought in this guy was a showrunner he was terrible and I didn't get along with him at all and they were actually close to firing me or him like there was like a real like impasse between the two of us cuz the guys riding was dogshit I was crazy back then dude I didn't give a fuck I had zero filter I never thought I was gonna be an actor in the first place I couldn't leave him on the set and so they would try to get me to do stuff and I'll be like what and they would like give me the script like well we made revisions to script and I would read it goes this is fucking terrible and they would get pissed at me and people be pissed I'm ready tell me how this is funny explain to me how this is funny and then you know like executives are going you know you're either were talking to my agent this guy you know he's he's very arrogant and and you know he's causing problems on the set I'm like I'm not causing problems in the set I go they took the writer stuff they rewrote it they turn it into dogshit you show me show me how it's not you know and I I was like very close to like killing my sitcom career completely just by having no filter but then they realized it they read it and then they came has watched some of the run throughs and the network fired him but it was close he wanted me out but I was one of the stars of the show it was me and that Ben Greenwood guy but and then I mean it was a it was an ensemble show but I played the the star player there was about a baseball team a fucked-up baseball team and I was the the guy was always causing trouble and wrecking his car and going crazy and so they were having a real problem with me but what it was because these guys that it originally wrote it these guys were genius they were really really funny and they took their words and just butchered it and turned into some hackneyed fucked-up sitcoms which is what they usually do well Jim Breuer was in the pilot with me Jim Breuer that was made like a baby so weird so Jim Breuer was in the pilot with me he played the mascot for the team fuck he was funny man and Jim and I were buddies from New York there's Jim that's Jim Breuer now Jim Breuer played a pioneer who he had like the the bait I feel like like he got in a fight Curren and Kevin Martin but back that up or that we see the white light of the screen yeah where you see the words like right there Kevin Kern rather in Jeff Martin sorry I fucked her names up Kevin Curran and Jeff Martin with the guys who who wrote it and they were really really nice guys and really funny guys but they were writers you know and this was something that they had created and then the network just butchered it and then it wound up getting cancelled then I was ready to move back to New York but I fucked up but I had already got a lease on an apartment I got an apartment on Moorpark in Studio City or it was actually North Hollywood and I was like fuck already got this apartment and like what do I do and so I'm like god I got to stay here because I got a lease and I was like shit I want to move back to New York I hated it out here I hated dealing with actors I've never been around actors and that thing that we were talking about before where people just like say things that they don't really mean because they think that you're supposed to say those things because there's like a pattern of behavior me to do yeah you know I thought he was amazing in that film yeah I thought he was excellent I thought he had a lot to offer I mean there was a lot of that kind of nonsense out here where I was used to real people I mean I mean for sure I was a flawed person I mean for sure I was rough and I said I just I wasn't didn't have good decorum like the way I communicated I was a rough guy you know I'd come from fighting and then went writing to stand-up and this is only a few years later I'm doing this you know I had my last fight in 89 so this is 94 I mean this is just a few years after that I was still very sketchy you know so I didn't belong I felt like I didn't belong there I felt like I couldn't be myself everybody was like reading The Hollywood Reporter and variety on sound like the fuck you guys reading this shit for I kids like this it was just that the whole thing to me was like this weird play that people were putting on where everybody was trying to pretend to be something so that they can get auditions and I remember going on some auditions and dealing with some of those people casting agents that had all this power over you and they they exhibited it like they exerted it when you were in the room with them they didn't communicate with you like you're a person and I'm a person they communicated with you like you want something from me I don't know if I'm gonna give it to you hmm let me see what you do it was just the way they did it was just so shitty it was just it was gross it was just there was still this funny oh it's gross I mean this is this is the thing that people have the real problem that people have with this Harvey Weinstein situation it's not just that the fact that he was a piece of shit to all these women it's his position of power that he had over them that he exerted he got himself into this position and then used that position to on some I mean according to Whitney like Whitney Cummings was talking to me about this she's like what you're hearing is all the women that said no to him she's like that guy fuck fuck talk about how fucked economy and it was part of the deals that he they even they even went after one of the girls he was fucking that girl from Donnie Brasco and she did the movie with Gretchen Moll yeah she did rounders oh I remember the blonde cute thing now if you watched Donnie Brasco she's in bounty Brasco she ain't got a fucking line in that movie not a line really not she's an extra in that movie basically Sonny blacks girlfriend but when you see her in fucking whatever she's got a bunch of lines now and it was because she was fucking Howie they just went after a couple weeks ago gretchen ma guy who went after just you know Angelina Jolie in the troop oh they're all saying yes there is a dick suckers listen they all got a suck a dick eventually yeah she's pretty look I had heard that there was a lot of them that were actually very successful that fucked him I mean this was this this guy's thing it's it's kind of it's I mean it's fucked up and it's dark but once that gets going and once that's what he does how do you stop that train other than what they did if they all know they all know and nobody open their fucking mouth so you could suck my dick a couple of them open their mouth a couple of them again they got swept under the carpet and that's always gonna happen but I rather fucking you know the rest of these like Angeline the rest of these people listen I'm over brother I don't want to hear this shit no more it's it's it's amazing like just a bullshit that these people create in their worlds and you're right when you go to these casting things and you see these things you see the fucking bullshit it pours out of a man well it's one of the reasons why the people in this town are so crazy it's because they're insecure to begin with right the only reason why anybody becomes an actor like why people want to be famous not the only reason but one of the main reasons why people want to be famous is because at some point in their life they didn't feel valuable at some point in their life they felt discarded they felt abused they felt ignored and they had this inescapable need for attention this this hole that cannot be filled and that was the driving force that led them in acting where they could be on that stage and everyone was looking at them all eyes on them while the microphone was on and the words were coming out of their mouths and they were in the play or in the movie or doing stand-up even it's a lot of the same stuff that propelled you and I being ignored as a child you know like the feeling like you were nothing and then realizing that when you're onstage man then you're something like that person up there with a spotlight on them that person is shining that's a something person that's not me I feel like I would but that thing that leads you to become an act or want to become famous is also like it's it's so fucked up with acting because you have to get chosen it's not like music or like stand-up where you can look at stand-up all you have to do is you do open mic nights you get funny you build up an act and then people come to see you you build up a career and the next thing you know you you become a successful comedian that's what happened to you that's what happened to me but with acting you have to get chosen you don't you don't have to work like if you do plays nobody is ever gonna fucking see you ever you're never gonna make it out of place nobody's going to see famous play actors nobody gives a shit about them you have to be in movies you have to be in television so you have to get chosen so you have this whole chain of like Hugh maybe I'll pick you but I'm not sure are you the one and so you have to develop this sort of personality that fits in with their what they're looking for you have to mold your sensibilities and your ideas if there's a lot of pee people that are in Hollywood that don't have opinions of their own what they have is a series of opinions that they've adopted and adapted because they think it's going to lead them to be successful they heard at Star book you know how many times I got an audition I hear this like mine this is my a lot of people don't like to audition I like to audition can I tell you why cuz I fuck with them cuz you're funny you know I've ripped my pants out you know if you watch what's that show on CBS that's been on forever I don't watch one Monday nights Big Bang Theory the one before that How I Met Your Mother I did how you know how I Met Your Mother I didn't you know you did it yeah if you watch the episode you're like Joey you're an extra I'm an extra you know why because I went into the audition I had no underwear on and there was just seen these things that pop out of chairs yeah decide things the way she goes get up to read when I when I got up to read and this yeah the fucking thing got caught in the hole in my pants and my dick came out all three women sat there and I go did you see the egg roll and then I lost him for sure they even told me they go you got the job as I was walking down the street on Fox my phone rang my agent goes go back you didn't read I didn't even read it they called my agent said we love this guy I went back they saw the Cuban I groped you know well it was probably not used to someone with confidence that didn't give a fuck you know I went to an audition one time Broadway the guy had to I never forget this the guy was a white-trash guy like this family moved there there was a pilot for ABC and this guy is one of those guys that he had a little circular pool in front of his house and he was he was water his ship but at the same time he had like a thong on he's fat he's got jewelry and I'm like one of those guys in Long Island I'll never forget I get to the audition all these guys on that Tony Lago got arrested so all these big Italian dudes and I knew they were gonna get the part bro I think I'm gonna get the part I'm not gonna get it but I had warmups on all right I had a warm-up side with the string and had white tighty whities and had a zip up jacket and I had away 380 so I walked to think oh I know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my pants off I'm taking my sweats off walk in and what do you think these two ladies say to me hold on one second we'll be back with you in a minute so they turn around that's my cue bitch I took those sweatpants off I took the shoes off and my socks and I walk closer and I took my shirt off when they turned back around all I had was boxer shorts on like the tiny Whitey's that's it Ted's hangin out stop it Hannah nobody on the way and then and they did I suppose a to another like oh my god I'm like I'm not putting on shit all right I'm breathing this motherfucker so you were supposed to like waves to say good morning all right they're like action and then I can't even look at me cuz I'm completely make it you know can't even look at me and I'm making believe I'm flipping burgers and they look over them I go living like a doctor that's it they booked me when I got for the audition it's that was the Reid living like a doctor they even gave my own line I wanted to they gave me whatever line I said in the audition like whatever they said wasn't good enough I don't know my own fucking line yeah that's that's probably why you got it look look at Joey he's just saying that's when you were in those big daddy shirt yeah look how big I was Jesus Christ you were enormous back then don't sound so must have been like what two thousand then right yeah this is mm mm mm when I met you like right after my chair brought you onto the set of Newsradio but
