hello freak bitches like way over the line yeah cuz then you can't do critical government stuff it's a legal precedent that's set that then makes the craziest shit possible well it's like oh this is words or violence these words are violence I'm raped now no one can say like our new president is horrible you know like now you can't even show dissent it's all just a way to tighten the screws don't you think that people on the Left though are showing dissent more than like a violent descent towards the president oh yeah like really like angry like in a way that I can't remember anybody doing towards Obama now to the point where it freaks me out like they're like it's weird well I didn't I wasn't obviously traveling in this the right circles look for people that really angry at Obama but even the people that I saw online that are angry and I'm they're calling them incompetent or a fool or spending all of our money and all those different accusations but not like what I'm seeing with Trump like I'm seeing just like flat-out insults from famous people all the time yeah and the media I don't get why people totally trust the media it's like you'll see them misrepresent something in such an egregious way mm-hmm and my dad is a rhetoric professor so it's like he teaches a class in propaganda this is like my whole childhood is learning about the shit it's not watching CNN I'm like you motherfuckers you know exactly like you can misrepresent things so egregiously that I'm like of course no one's gonna trust you and that's a problem right and it's not that you you don't wish that they were correct right it's that in them lying even if you were on their side more than you're on the Fox News side your CN n lies even a little then it's fuel for the other side and it vastly diminishes the impact that you can have because you're not you're not trustworthy absolutely that's all you have in news now yeah its trustworthiness because everyone can manipulate in Photoshop now that that that audio Photoshop oh my god it's like you have to just trust people I can't trust anybody though it's real issue and an issue with an issue with the left being so hyperbolic it's like when Trump is first elected I was like ah sucks Trump's crazy and then I saw their reaction and I almost like triaged it well it's like wait a minute what's crazier the guy that may like text a dictator is dick or like people like saying that democracy is bad and I'm like this is a weird battle so but that stayed with me and then when I started at Quest and we were helping all these kids are working with all these kids and I saw how extraordinary they were which by the way drug dealers some of them are amazing entrepreneurs and so it became this notion in my it's unreal dude I'll tell you some stories sometime sure absolutely fucking crazy and I thought Jesus you're a better entrepreneur than I am like they're telling me how they watch like the the cop cars and when they change shifts and how they know that they're being identified by their cars and so they change cars also as crazy and so I'm like Jesus it gave me this concept that I called mining for astronauts and I'm like in here in here somewhere in here being the ghetto are some of the most amazing mines I've ever come across and these guys could be anything it could be fucking astronauts right like whatever they wanted but they don't believe they can and when I would interview them it was nuts so imagine you're interviewing and I came up with just like a fast waited where I didn't have to think I could just ask the same questions and one of the questions was a magic Genie shows up is gonna grant you one wish and one wish only you can't wish for more wishes you can't cure cancer bring anybody back from the desk gotta be something for yourself what do you wish for universally to a person they all said a job okay that makes sense you think that's what I want to hear so you're trying to get a job singing tell me one job then when we get past that bullshit and I tell you obviously that's not true like what do you really want like what's a job meant to get you money okay do you want money or is it something else no it's money awesome man it's a magic Genie cast for whatever you want what do you want you know what answer every single one of them gave me well 1 million dollars you can't buy a fucking house for a million dollars ok was so crazy it's a magic Genie Joe like you can ask for a trillion dollars but their frame of reference was so small one guy this is like the one exception said he wanted an airport I found that's so weird so I had to push him out and I was like why an airport he said because business guys come through the airport I was like ok what what good does that do you and he said because then they can teach me about business now think about that first of all how fuckin many steps removed are you from what you actually want yeah but that's like they they don't how you say I'm a systematic thinker right so I had to learn that that's not where I started so I spent thankfully one of the things I'm most grateful for in my life I have to learn everything the hard way but because I learned things the hard way then I can show other people what I did where I fell down and how hopefully they can avoid some of the mistakes that's what you need is a bathroom with a door that faces outside the worst is when you go over a girl's house and you go to use her bathroom and you smell matches oh yeah oh no she was lighting this motherfucker up about her mess ever get to a girl's place and then you feel the gurgles and you're like I could I've had that before I was dating a girl once she had ferocious diarrhea ferocious so she regularly yeah yeah and she so she went to the bathroom and she just turned on to the shower and she turns on both things on the sink whoa yeah drown and I'm like what the fuck is going on I was very young at the time you didn't understand what I'm super confused the fuck is going on in there I had I had once in in college where I was at this girl's place and she was just like okay it's game on like go for it right like I have to take I could feel that it was a diarrhea dirt like an explosive diarrhea shit and I also realized there was no way to do it that then it would just be a black toilet and that there's no way I could cover so you know what I did I went back to my place I was like oh I'll see you some other time or what run the next day her friends like you're like the fucking like they gave me credit but they they thought was guy that I was a good cuz they're like you're awesome yeah cuz they're not getting fucked they don't want their friend to get fucked right so they use reverse psychology on you you're an amazing guy I got an amazing guy credit I hope you wait forever a circle that you love not even when you get married tell her we get married feel ever so much don't even have sex after you're married never it's not about that right it's about real love yeah like Twilight love if I had had how's that were intact it would have been a different story that night house boughs oh yeah there's a time when you know that it's in the sensitivity of your inner asshole region it's amazing it is it knows yes special you go to sleep out a fart right when you like you like about to cut a fart and and then also an alarm start going off oh no oh yeah oh no and you got a clamp shut like Jesus what is this we were having this debate yesterday about why are they sometimes hot like why is it hot and then why does why do you know that hots gonna smell bad spicy food bro is it but is that what it is so imagine I don't know I was telling you guys at one time my freshman ya didn't take a shift for a week and a half I thought I was addicted to steak I play freshman ball and we're playing Pattison Eastside was just a jungle over school like you got to be careful over there and we went there to play the Christmas tournament well what kind of bar are we talking right that's a basketball I hadn't taken his shift like ten days I laptop something I took acid something fucked my stomach if I didn't tell nobody and those days I was really scared of doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody on the way home we got on the bus and while we will wait that my stomach started hurting I said Jesus Christ I don't know if I'm I shit myself a fart well let me just take a chance and I blew this fart Joe Rogan that was so bad right we want a bus and people started running you know the school buses people started running to the windows right to swing down the bus windows but here's what gets better I fought it again had the teachers were going oh my god he's changing flavors the cheerleaders are crying that's how bad
