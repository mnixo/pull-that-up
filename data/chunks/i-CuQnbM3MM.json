UFC this is not it might be the podcast for you though because we don't know like we might start talking about the UFC and it might it could go anywhere it usually does these podcasts are like let you fight companion we you always tell them that it's different and all that but all the podcasts the last fight companion we always talked about the main event for like 30 seconds exactly we're talking about everything sex and drugs and fucking friendship then we goes decision watch that UFC on Fox all my god what a fucking card first of all I made during on it podcast oh you guys did a fight

yeah you know and to watch him blow the fog and purty insane and I mean I was blown away cuz yeah for those of you that don't know 10 planet Austin we had a grand opening it's it's at the honored Academy and man I'd never been there when I was fuckin floor that place is gigantic it's incredible yeah our bird doesn't do anything half-assed no no you puts his heart and soul and everything he's got a special knack for creating things and putting things together he's an executive producer man yeah but he's good at it on everything then go to dinner and it's like I've never had a dinner like this yeah I was on a boat and there's just hos everywhere I'm I've never been on a boat music this is how we do it his playlist is smart from the heavens yeah sure yeah it's the best he's just an unusual dude he really is very very unusual dude yeah and so Alex wanted to do a piece on me cuz he's got people that work for him that do Jiu Jitsu right and so he thought Alex found out that I wasn't be there and he decided to go down and interview he had a Infowars mic yeah he's at the he's sitting next to me during the invitational during the tournament which was fucking nuts and he's right there's like Alex Jones like holy shit it's pretty crazy that is crazy and you know him fell in love with jiu-jitsu he was there for the whole place for the whole tournament wanted to stay stayed afterwards stayed for the podcast he wants to bring his daughters to jiu-jitsu that's he wants to be ripped you ever see what he used to look like huh dude he was a stud he wants to get skinny and why don't I know this guy Alex Jones infomercials and for wars' infomercials he's the most popular conspiracy theorist he's like the he runs well he used to be a radio DJ a long time ago he's still kind of doing radio but it's now most of it is on the internet but he does a lot of it I guess on like AM stations I still think he's syndicated he does both right he does like the radio part and then he does because the the dirty part the internet part was when Joey came on and Joey was swearing the amount you've seen nothing that's all on the internet that's only he's internet version yeah he has a radio version - I just get his app and I guess in any time he's a conspiracy theorist guy like a heavy-duty over the top but he's been I've known him I've been friends with him since 99 I did I did my I did a comedy DVD in Austin he and I put on out we put on George W Bush masks I was George I was Bush younger and he was Bush older who's Herbert Walker Bush and I was George W Bush awesome and we we've ran around the fucking Capitol building like where the the state capital is what's in Austin and filmed it was just something targeted that shit me I became friends with them back then so I've know for 16 years now yeah I bet you and him just get balls deep in Kentucky he doesn't and we partied in Vegas when we can Joe took him out to the UFC he flew in and Manny he does not you would think that he was like dude we're out partying let's not talk about conspiracy theorists he's got so much fuckin information you know he's a funny dude yeah he's I love that that dude is so cool I fuckin I could sit there and hang out with them for hours good guy it's a really good guy just a fuckin crazy wacko everybody thought he was crazy back in the day but even the last time Joe was on his show on the phone you said man all that stuff that people were were accusing you of being crazy about all that shoes come and chew out she said that on the radio like the NSA stuff it was the first one he was saying like a long time ago the NSA was gonna be monitoring everyone's phone calls and was gonna be recording everything you do people thought he was like you're out of your mind there's no way that's gonna happen also the one of the big ones that I found out from him was he had this this video called 911 II I think it's called and a lot of it was about agent provocateurs and what it's about is how they would go into a peaceful protest and they would sense these people whether they're cops or soldiers whoever the fuck they were they were in government-issued boots and they would send them into these peaceful protests they were wear masks and they would just start smashing things so they would pretend that they were a part of the protest so they go in to protest they'd smash storefronts they'd smash car windows create havoc then the cops would move in and in the case of the World Trade Organization these Agent Provocateur guys these guys that got hired to go in and start smashing shit they all went into a house and waited and then the cops waited outside they all negotiated nobody rushed in and took these people and then they eventually let them all go but there was some sort of behind-the-scenes conversation but that's when they did it when they did it they stopped the entire protest they made it a protest free zone and they were literally and this is all in the news they were literally telling people you couldn't go in there with a badge on if you had a badge that's WTO on it with a line through it they were telling people you can't have that badge on as you go on your way to work she says you're not allowed to protest it was a protest free zone all because of these government ages now I thought like there's no way the government actually does that it turns out once I read that or once I watch that I started reading about it and it's a common tactic forever it's technique it's just like there's a bunch of CIA whistleblowers X CIA agents john stockwell for once youtube search john stock was written books he says it's his techniques the way they set people up the way they create patsies they'll bring in some crazy extreme radical people and go okay you want to you want to be in the CIA help us out and they set them up they got these dumb people that they always sell what they'll do is like exactly what joe said they'll get like professionals to go in there cause some shit kill people I'm not making this up this is what John Stockwell says they go in there and the more people they kill the more effective it is actually so what they'll do is I'll take professional like dudes that go in there take people out and then they'll put their Patsy in there boom blame them put some shit on the fucking media they run the media anyways and then they shoot those that the patsies we got these people Lee Harvey Oswald that's the Lee Harvey Lee Harvey also was an idiot yeah I mean he's definitely an idiot he left to Russia set him up the whole time that was enough he was deep it's no you know because when you we mentioned out Jones and you'd never heard of him and then when we said he was a famous conspiracy there's you say oh that's why I don't know Mike what I was gonna say Eddie when you are on your rant is most people they only know him from his broadcast so they assume that he's just like crazy guy who just is constantly look at first conspiracies everywhere when you hang with him in person he's like a super nice guy super sweet he's fathers doesn't shut up Brendon all conspiracy theories are or the way shit really is the way shit really is not every one of them not everyone just because just because not every conspiracy theory a rumor whatever is true does that mean you just forget about the other ones no no no there's something unbalanced about only looking for them oh no no like I know dudes that all they care about is conspiracies again conspiracy theories are theories on how shit really is run some people really like to know how their life everything everything that that these conspiracies are theories all of them affect our lives everyday and so when you think about it like that and you start thinking about my life this life is all because as a big effect a big effect on my life was stuff like 9/11 and all these these events like these these shootings these all these false flag events our lives are affected with shootings using their false flag events oh you're talking about Sam you're talking about your mass shootings school shooting hey you know what the teacher got fired four sentences baby listen to question we already know they're all crooks we know how they said the people that are really running shit okay the people that have all the power the generally are crooks not every single one drugs one of the things that you'll find in government is they'll make laws that don't make any fucking sense and then they're evil and then they abide by those laws a benefit that there's a lot of crazy learn answer here's a good one the Supreme Court passed a ruling that allowed corporations to act as individuals so they can essentially donate as much money to a campaign as they so choose so if a corporation wants to elect a president they can essentially bribe their way and get this person into the way that's insane well it's it's nuts that they're allowed to spend anybody how about that it should be the opposite it should be a person should be thought of as a person an individual we should we should be thought of as an individual and a corporation should be thought of as a soulless entity a group where people get together and work it should never be thought of as an individual like one thing that can act in its own interest like it's alive to stay alive it's gonna bribe people to make sure it has the cushiest rules and regulations so in that sense yeah those guys are crooks like that's a crook move you know I started watching it's really fucking good Wow need a house of cards I heard it's really good it's fun you would love it you would love it because it's all about the president and this guy becomes president no no spoiler alerts Kevin Spacey and then you find out all the inner workings and I was like I'm not into politics it's I just find it like it's like watching a fixed game of based exhaust I'm not it's boring to me it makes me angry it makes me angry that these are our candidates it makes me angry there's no one that's really saying something that really resonates with me everyone is saying something that's inside the parameters of the so they they do this show and Kevin Spacey plays the president he shows all the inner workings of like how deals are made and how they negotiate and all the behind the scenes stuff sounds dope it's fascinating it's fucking good cuz it's really good good writing and keeping shit I keep hearing you would love it and I had to bring it out because I knew you would love it CIA stuff all sorts of crazy deep dark undercover shit you would love it you would love it you'd go crazy and you know probably a lot of it is the case like who the fuck knows man who the fuck knows maybe they paid Nate Diaz to go off on Fox yes we're not talking about dos Anjos we're not talking about the whole dream is I'm not Nate Diaz that was where I was conflicted as a broadcaster I'm so conflicted as Nate Diaz fan and as a comedian and fellow marijuana advocate I was fucking howling yeah yes keep going keep going they're fucking screaming in my ear screaming here cut him off cut him off take the mic away cut him off and that was the best speech ever not about to cut him off I'm not doing it was not away I'm not being the man fucking screaming in my ear shot imagine you're gonna have to fire me some not fucking things I even give up on the mind me everybody it's what you do we won well no I wanted he looked amazing I agree looked amazing but we know it's fucking Nate Diaz if i if I'm if I'm Fox I'm like I you can interview everyone don't give Diaz the fucking mic I figure they listen he had a great fight I thought he was gonna be chill I thought he's gonna talk about Michael Johnson I know he's gonna talk about economy dude this is how badass Conor McGregor is three fighters call them out three dudes three fighters three that's the fight though is the fight well it's a very good fight if I'm data why I'm not saying what's the right thing to do I'm saying if I'm looking for the biggest show the biggest numbers oh yes can you imagine that world tour oh my god fuck and it's his first fight at 155 so he can sell that leave this line them up with their hands out on their knees with their hands out I want them to beg me first and a phantom suitable that's a phantom convertible son that's about $400,000 for the car this guy is so fucking unusual he's so on you three dudes call them out but it's so crazy that an MMA it took what 15 fucking years of MMA popularity I mean MMA is 20 what is it 22 years old now what is it when did it start anybody yeah so it's 22 years right that's not 20 years we're both retarded almost 24 okay so let's think about that in that time in like the past I'd say it's really popular for like since like the early 2000s maybe not really right X 2005 okay let's give it 10 years so in ten years of real popularity this is the first guy that emerges like this this first like superstar besides Brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar was pretty much a superstar but it was a different thing he was like a superstar coming over correct from the wrestling so he just carried all those fans over they wanted to see if he could do it and Plus you look out I mean to go jesus-fucking-christ like that's the guy that you with when you think of cage fighting you would think of a guy who looks like that got a sword tattooed on his chest right what are you left like yo see this dick up on Lesnar's just it's great yeah but Connor there's never been dude like that just all of a sudden everyone's talking about him everyone's captivated I agree and he pulls it off that's the craziest shit he goes on I'll knock bet Dana White that he would knock out Chad Mendes inside of four rounds he wanted a bet three million dollars he called the round he's in secular huh said second what dog yeah what's the same thing he did with with um although he said he's gonna knock him out inside of two minutes we laugh at it come on Dustin Poirier first world class opponent he's going I'm gonna knock you out in the first round it's crazy and everybody's like what Memaw crack yeah but there's some monster fights out there waiting for him I just think if I'm Conor McGregor's manager and I'm doing what's best for his career Frankie's a tough fight I'm not saying he can't win it Frankie's a very tough fight and dos Anjos is the toughest fight that's the tough but then you got Diaz in the middle and I'm 55 huge payday great matchup style for Conor that is the fight I take first of all how good did Nate Diaz look physically best we've seen him with Everett shredded full six-pack looked in tremendous shape and didn't even come close to winning in that fight I mean now it's throwing down in that fight John Johnson was beat he got beat inside the cage if you listen to his corner they go don't quit stick with it there's a man out of quit screaming I don't quit what yeah Henry who says that sometimes to guys he yelled that out to UM Rumble when rumble was getting beat up by DC he was yelling don't quit don't quit that is not what you need to hear I think maybe someone needs to talk to him he's a fucking fantastic kickboxing coach but you can't even put that out that was never in the coach Michael just vocab quit camp another out there you can't put that probably can't help it because it's probably what he's thinking well I was probably thinking don't quit true but and I oh I with Michael Johnson in that fight could see you starting to break and he was sitting right in front it's eight in one twos when Nate was popping them and then doing this dude oh shit I just rang your bell just stand in front of him he goes oh shit he's pointing right at his face you can see Michael Johnson was like I can't even shouldn't be there he should be staying from he's so athletic yeah it's been using angles using his wrestling he didn't know it I think people underestimated Nate Diaz that's what I fallible idea but he was a underdog in that fight like a pretty good underdog it's again idiot look I just don't think anybody who made the line went and watched him train if you see out what a good shape he was in and how good his hands look Jesus Christ that's as good as he's ever looked but before he fell the rankings what was he five before he took imma dos anjos beat the shit out of him a year ago beat the brakes off yeah that one of the things that I was thinking about was how heavy he stands on that front leg you know he stands real heavy on that front leg and dos Anjos just lighten that leg up Korea he was lighting that leg up cuz Nate fight southpaw right mhm and dos Anjos fight southpaw so it opens them up to that back leg kick and he was just chewing up the outside of that fucking front leg Conor would definitely be the favorite if they fight it's great fight though gonna be able to go up to Nate Diaz and go no but that might be a problem Nate Diaz might actually punch him in the mouth he'll wait for him in front of his fucking door in the morning yeah yeah like he'll find out what room he's in and he'll wait in front of the door and punch him in the face when he goes to get breakfast you know so with this shit talking what is he gonna think of like for Nate Diaz specifically is he gonna go cuz he goes real deep he he goes right to the core he brings its it won't work on Diaz though yeah well I don't know what a work and what won't work but I'll tell you what no one has got Nate more emotional or no one has gotten a cowboy Nate when cowboy starts shit talkin ain't knocked his hat laureate rather when Nate started shit talking cowboy and knocked his hat off was getting his face you could tell it was fuckin with Cowboys like his menthe round he was he was really emotionally wrapped up in the first round that fight he talked about he's like I'll never let that happen again that guy got inside my head I fucked up you know but it's the fact that Nate can do that to you I know he makes you're not gonna do it to Connor I would just let that I would just let it be like to watch a shocking epic that's why we need this fight the greatest show would be just Nate Diaz and and Conor McGregor just give him 30 minutes have like a mediator a little bit just you have to kind of just let them go just let me know Overeem and Ben Rothwell in between tell Ben Rothwell and Overeem look you got a big bonus coming to money they would just don't let them kill each other double Reebok for beat both of you you gotta somehow another make it so they can't hit each other you got to say listen boys there is millions of dollars in life it's secure and put a fence up and put them on either side of the fence and just let them go no that would be fuckin can you imagine the market you have four badass security guards all blacks in between wall the client's big eyes big Samoan well fucking snap defense those are the scariest ones do they don't get high agree can't really hurt it's like Mark Hunt put them on a phone like they're in a prison you know what I mean with the glass they just talk to each other on the fucking phone is actually a good idea to any Bravo with too strong ideas I wrote from marketing work at the prison you know why cuz you're the only one it's not high here I'm feeling his ideas would be the host that'd be brilliant dude but Diaz wants to speak fight because he's can paid 20 and 20 that is that real have weed this that's real and we we sure I'm positive that does I saw this house that the Commission now you might have on disclose bonus right as far as contracture that we know it's 20/20 now I'm not blaming you see I don't know what it's got me I don't hopefully is not in the tough contract that's bad management though that's horrible management speak of stars he is that motherfucker should begin at least one 21 2005 yeah I agree and more than that probably for a while Nate Diaz is a giant star let me tell you this when he went out into that arena they went fucking crazy yes that crowd went fucking crazy when Nate Diaz like raising his arms after every round they went fucking who are we talking about think about all the stars on the car who who's the number one most time ballot guy right now that one candy that one got well his performance first of all was outstanding against a guy in Michael Johnson who's an up-and-coming lightweight who's been really on a tear look Michael Johnson's look fantastic yeah I thought his fight with Peniel Dariush was a kind of a questionable decision he probably should have won it yeah maybe you could see it maybe that way I'm at their huge fight I'm a big Dario chenille Dario she's a bad motherfucker but a fight is a fight right no I didn't eight Diaz get that knee bar at the end he fucking had it and yeah time was over but you know he fucking second was after the buzzer yeah yeah he grabbed it and then the buzzer went and he extended Johnson just love he was saying I had your knee or something like that he's like fuck with him it goes way over homie I don't know trust me watch it we watched it in the truck over and over again it's definitely was that in the news law yeah I love it and then John because I was like why did Johnson kick him and then I saw another Angliss way I'm looking at them I'm looking at them from eye height say so where my eyes are that's where their body is on the other side of the cage I couldn't see the knee bar and I'm like why would Michael Johnson kick it the fight is over and then I saw the whole thing I go oh he deserved it because he thought upset he's whole nickel I didn't hurt him I think he's just fucking in further yeah man he was having a good time look we're all talking about him but I wonder how much if he I wonder if you can get fined because we're percent well the FCC the FCC Rick we I was asking someone online about this today because it's like radio like there's raw there's rules now and I think a lot of them got passed after Howard Stern because what happened with Howard Stern was Howard Stern he got fine for questionable subject matter which is fucking insane and it's it was one of the weirdest moments in like free speech time because really everybody should have stood up and said something about it the New York I mean every fucking magazine should have been talking about what a travesty it is that you're trying to stop a show that's on the radio than anybody could turn one way or the other and he's not even swearing he's playing within your rules yeah but for subject matter they were finding him like huge blow the subject matter whatever you talk about whenever anything sexual or anything they felt was offensive they were getting him on subject matter super weird rules like it's like you can just yeah I'm saying dick but if I say I put my dick in your mouth you didn't mind do you know you can say Jesus what if you say Jesus Christ you're not supposed to say Jesus Christ like there was a tennis match where one of the one of the the kit there was like two people playing tennis and one of them had to forfeit the match because they said Jesus Christ when they missed Jesus goes exactly like just saying that alone like I saved it it was so our story from years ago and I always wanted to do a bit about it but I would get so mad when I would read it that I'm like this isn't even gonna be funny like there's nothing funny about it was a blessing in disguise though because that was a big reason why he went to my love's I just got it I've had it for the last year I love it man just resigned a five-year dog yeah huge did such a good show is the best interviews yes interviews are excellent any ask man lately it seems like he's bigger than ever he just gives like he's getting serious a list stars to be interviewed I mean he's it's uh point is the defined for that into a late kid don't know well he didn't kick him correct holding that and he didn't hurt him with that that's but the fun but the swearing on the air if you do it on purpose I think you can get in trouble I don't know what the rules are I'm just talking on my ass but I've been told click on live radio that if you if you chose to swear on live radio if they went after you they could find you and they do find you a lot of money like hundreds of thousands lot of hours yeah that's crazy that's about what's just dark man it's just dark that they could take money from you and it goes where where do you where's ago yeah was it go anywhere helpful or just hates that not buy your red tape fucking overrun system you know mean where's that money go you're stealing money from me you're gonna steal it and then pump it out into this machine well it doesn't make any sense even if they charge them I don't think you should get fine let's say they find him a hundred thousand dollars but he gets the Conor McGregor fight it's worth every penny right there's a reason three dudes are conk on route because that's the payday brother his brother with the the pot charge they find him a hundred and sixty five thousand dollars and then they kept him out of fighting for five years that was really it's insane look beyond silly where do you see Tony Ferguson in that mix I could see Tony he's right there tied to the Barbosa fight I can see Tony and cowboy dude he be Barbosa holy shit people are scared of Edson Barboza no one is confident when they go into that fight they're like oh shit he's got in my opinion the fastest kicks I've ever seen yeah 100% he's so fat his switch kick off his front leg amazing it's the fastest switch kick I've ever seen in my life I've never seen anybody faster he's like a like a hundred and thirty pound Taekwondo guy like a little tiny Korean guy that moves like lightning that's how good he is like a switch kick is just it's insane it's like wow it's so fast I could see Tony and cowboy fightin fuck yeah that's a phenomenal Tony's ready for those guys right oh I said 2016 is Tony's year yeah I think he's a guy where everyone's like fuck I don't fight that dude he can't sleep on nurmagomedov off either that fucking guy on him cuz he's not healthy but if he can get healthy and he could figure out a way to stop Big Ang or other like he does I mean they give the last one was a rib which you can't really control but the knees he's done his knees a couple times now and I think he's done his knees after surgery I think he hurt his knee got it fixed and then heard again which is never good so people are a little bummed out because Mother Russia if he's healthy remember he slammed the champ around like yeah he broke it all he just tossed him around just did whatever he wanted to and once got ahold of him he's a nightmare if he gets healthy we're all fucked it's almost though like he's too tough for his joints you know it's almost like he's his style so hard and he put he's got so much fucking strength and technique and so much torque like when he arrived all's guys it's a very unique kind of rat dose of rag dong it's also these ragdoll guys and no one ragdolls I agree like when he racked out those on just I was like whoa I never seen anybody do this to dos Anjos insane man Clay Guida beat him but he got a broken jaw and clay finished him with his jaw broken cuz club member closed doing like an arm triangle yes and he had a broken jaw this is the Russian we're talking about no no no think so we're talking about a table okay he'd never been off the way he rag-dolled he does beat him he just threw him around man beat is that threw him around how long ago is that two years or two years the champ the same champion yeah yeah it was the last last loss until sign just rare no one wants to fight him a tab we was supposed to fight him who else is he fine but I gotta say I don't think that dos Anjos is the same dough scientists we're looking at I agree I never said his strength and conditioning program is fucking gnarly looked phenomenal you gotta talk to Nick curse on you should have him on your podcast he's that speed of sport commerce with Febreze over doom Ruslan provodnikov he works with a lot of Olympic athletes Oh yeah Joe shillings working with him now - he has these guys doing all these crazy plyometric drills with his rants everyone swears Bob yeah did I tell you I had this guy in and I talked to him and I was super impressed super impressed with his knowledge with his understanding and with his philosophy and I was like what is the big difference like woody what do you what's the most important thing is like foot strength I was like whoa he's like it's all about covering distance and all about the ability to move and balance in movements and it's all about figuring out how to close the distance quicker and he was saying that when he fought Pettis dos Anjos was just that much quicker at every exchange he pulled the trigger that much faster landed that much faster and he's like it over the course of a fight even though he's only that much better over the course of the fight that adds up you get fucked up and that's what you saw last night dos Santos would just jump the gun he was just there I think it's a combo of things I think talking you know know knowing cowboy as long as I've known him he just and he even said it in his post-fight interview he just said listen I didn't show up and in this business when you don't show up to work you don't feel like fighting get your ass whupped so I think it's he didn't feel like fighting so that yeah yeah he's been there before - man he's been there before and he ended up K owing dudes Cowboys always had a problem in the back reason I didn't like this for cowboy this cuz the time off Cowboys an active guys who don't have to think about it you give them six months that's trouble for cowboy you know man um I don't know if any of that would have mattered the way dos três pulled the trigger I agree hundred percent I think dos Santos lonzo's looked phenomenal but I do have to say that um there has to be some some sense made out of when fights get stopped in one fights don't get stomped I'm not saying that fight shit have been stopped but I am saying that Chris Weidman vs. Luke Rockhold should have been stopped I agree I think we have to figure out what is the when what's the win I mean I don't know when it is but I felt like cowboy was covering up in eating shots and although I'm not unhappy with the stoppage like I didn't protest it I was like man I don't know it is for a title but referees there he sees what he sees I don't um there's a giant difference between doing that and then what was happening at the end of the round where Rockhold was mounted on Weidman and just beating his brains I agree that was bad well that felt to me I was like Jesus Christ and I even I think I even said because it didn't stop me I agree because shots gonna take that the thing is with cowboy why least her black doctors coach Lisa R bowling and he goes man you think you stopped earlier and I said I don't because Cowboys were in the game long enough he knows when he's in turtle like that and he's getting punched cowboy knows man right that's not gonna stop they got they give you one do something I'm gonna stop the fight if cowboy would just roll to guard and manage distance or grabbed him you know and control them the fight would have carried on but when I don't see cowboy responding I don't want to say he wanted out but he knows what's going on trust me I bet I should like that happen so when he's covering up you think what he really should have been doing is moving and scrambling he should just Jeff so by just standing there and covering up he basically invited guest stoppage yes I'm not saying he wanted out he might been hurt he probably was hurt and it's kind of like you just you know man right they come in the back there listen if I tell you to move I'm close to stopping it right and you can hear it clear as day like my last fight with trash around I turned the ref I said I'm fine cuz I know he's gonna I know where it's gonna get stopped I know when I'm in trouble they're about stop it I turned my goal I'm good it's tough man yeah and so Cowboys has so much experience if you just went to guard you would've bought him some time I'll tell you what man he he had to be wrong because dos Anjos just teed off on to the body that need of the body was nasty and then the kick and then he uncorks and Cowboys had the kick didn't land I think he means the kick didn't hurt him it definitely land he landed hundred percent yeah but I think he meant it didn't hurt him that he said that me is what did it I think the knee like really hurt him and then the kick was just icing on the cake it wasn't you know wasn't what put him away but that barrage punches to where he's fucking terrifying terrifying man you know what's cool about him too we watched him get better like we saw him against Jeremy Stephens he got kayoed against Jeremy's start off own two in the UFC I mean he's he's a guy who just fucking capped on work he's the nicest guy in the world when I was in Brazil man I'm telling no one gave me the time of day this dude took me around introduced me to different gyms I'd be great dude man yeah I've talked to him many times backstage she's so calm polite and friendly he's got like he's at peace you know he's like he's an interesting guy like he's like he's just like you know just trying to heal my knee trying to get you on him to win you root if you know that you root for him to win I took not that I took Heat and I say this whether they're Brazilian or not I say The X Factor's and this is everyone and it's not dos Anjos I never said dos ángeles was on stuff but to me when I was picking dos Anjos and cowboy I said The X Factor is if someone was taking shit we're gonna see different fighters not get me for cowboy or dos Anjos but that's all around the board I'm not saying thing that's new if steroids wasn't an issue performance-enhancing drugs were an issue the UFC wanted implemented the strictest drug testing ever in the history of sport it's true and I want to say something without implicating anyone okay because this subject gets brought up a lot all the people are always like you guys are talking shit and you don't know what you're talking about let me just say that everyone behind the scenes all the trainers all the coaches all the managers everyone is having this conversation yes these conversations that we're having on this podcast are not unique in that sense these are not ideas that we have these are not theories that we have like Jeff Novitzky is sniffing up these dudes asses and he's not playing games why do you think that is because he was like you know what let's just make it the strictest drug testing of all time hell no there's a real problem man well there's definitely a real problem or was a real problem but the the idea that it's only us that's talking about it is crazy because we're the only ones talking about it like as publicly as we do but behind the scenes is a constant conversation Oh anytime I talk to anyone in the game it's the conversation week when we get done here I'll text from coaches other fine we can't even name names or there's sometimes people come up to us and they'll say someone's gonna have a hard time cuz he's off the shit hundred percent and then they'll go in there and they'll get crushed and we'll go whoa this is nuts I thought the thing is with with although I took so much shit for that you got to realize he was the fighter at the present time when we're talking about this I'm not singling out although I never said all those on steroids I said there's some things to me that were suspicious never what he's done for the sport is great he's one of my favorite fighters he's phenomenal whether he's on shit or not it doesn't matter my favorite fighter of all time was probably on shit van delays like if I had to choose like one guy who had the most fun watching the Vendela in the pride days he was a goddamn Berserker every fight was back rabid pillows me how many times did we watch Wanderlei fight in Pride just scream delay croak up of all time he just got busted last week yeah fuck yeah you got busted too why do you suppose the Japanese didn't care about steroid they wanted you on steroids it was a freak show better they want the Freak Show - well they also want you to fight like crazy they want you to fight like a wild man they don't want you to win like like a really close decision they don't want you to do that they want you to go out fucking Wanderlei style or Shogun Stowers ninja style don't you go out on your shield and they wanted you on steroids yes they literally wanted you on so we know we have a friend that went over there too they offered him a fight at 185 pounds he's like I find it 155 how much do you weigh now is like once like 71 75 goes you have a good frame for 185 Bobby Lee's act we do is dad but you want talking about peds especially when you talk around Overeem in dos santos oh yeah listen man Oh Bremen was on some shit we all know this screams oh he's a hundred percent so the x-factor was when he got caught yes yeah yeah that's not was how like what kind of remar we gonna get I'm still a big fan of over he looked really wide ooh I'm a huge fan you know people think that cuz you here's a thing like if there's this other sports where if you accuse a guy cheating everybody hates that guy like you know people will talk about certain athletes that got caught doing something and then people go fuck the Mary's a fucking cheater like I heard dudes talking about who's the deflategate guy what's his name Tom Brady Tom Brady look he's a fucking cheater he's a cheater nobody gives a fuck in MMA they don't give a fuck no but they want to know yeah all suspicious yes like why does over him look so much different fly sicko say it but even forget it or not he's fucking awesome dude it's phenomenal I was so impressed with Overeem on Saturday night that was a tough goddamn fight and did you see the thing we was doing the wim HOF method he got in 40-degree water for 30 minutes and he's breathing every HOF coaching yeah wim HOF is from Holland as his oldest right and they got together and he's like teach them these methods to optimize his body and I'll tell you what man just talking a whim off makes you feel I can go run around naked in the snow he's a man he's a motherfucker what do you use what techniques do is I use the breathing technique before I go on stage really yeah yeah I do it for about 10 minutes before I go on stage I get fuck Wow crazy you get like oxygen high you take a gigantic breath and you only let out like half of it and then you have flooded up again you take the biggest breath you can you only let out a little bit of it and you keep doing that you keep doing that for minutes I do for two minutes at a time and they just I mean you're just like one stage yeah like five minutes before so like right before so easy and yet it's like special weird Hickson breathing gigantic breaths that's it can you do the easiest shit for three minutes and still I don't know I do it if I start feeling sick too if I can feel run down or something like that I'll do it for a few minutes I'll just sit down do it for like two minutes you know what I really started doing it seriously too I started doing after you and I talked about on the phone well you guys have you been doing that wim HOF method I got now and you said the same thing we're so lazy nobody does it said yeah you know what all right I'm gonna start doing it before shows I'll just do it before shows oh my god I love it I had a dude off Abbot Kinney big big dude bald he goes bro listen to Rogen's podcast with what's the dude's name wim HOF wim HOF he goes hey man what are you doing tomorrow morning I'm like you know I got shit to do man yes well every morn at 4:30 we meet on the beach and we do these breathing techniques oh yeah cool see they're in London 4:30 a.m. but no oh can you schedule me for never you why don't you get in the water pussy yeah I think they do I do they do yeah they do that breathing shit is so cold that water in the Pacific and feels so cold feels fuckin oh yeah it's good I don't like water my eyes though does saltwater fuck with your eyes hardcore no yoga does that's interesting in it the probably hair care products do you hear no no I don't okay I don't do yeah you know what I used to fuck with me hard dude when I used to do fear factory's deploy your sunscreen on so I'd have sunscreen on my head and then I would go onstage that night and the sunscreen would drip cuz I would sweat onstage something you'd rip in your eyes and it's fucking fire it's awful that shit burns it's really bad for your eyes too I can't actually fuck with your vision it's super bad I feel like I sweat so much during yoga with all the sweat gets in my eyes so for the rent left for like the next day I'm like blinking trying to get it at night that's normal no I definitely get sweat my eyes yeah sweat is like so much better than sweat with with sunscreen yeah it's gonna burn yeah man I think that that whole getting in the ocean thing like is is probably something people have been doing forever to refresh their body like I think it's instinctive like did you know how they do those ice plunges those people those it's all part of the Polar Bear Club my aunt does that shit Polar Bear Club in San Francisco son you know how it feels when you get out of that a cryotank feel fucking amazing man feel amazing nothing now mix that with the ocean there's an energy in the ocean so and it's cold I love it oh she's alive you see that video in San Francisco Bay right next to the dock a shark mercs a seal purchase s mercs it just leaves this gigantic puddle about meets like a movie scene the shark comes out of the water with the seal it's a big yeah yeah see that can we play this thing yeah it's like all these fuck sorry 12-foot shark right it's a huge it's a blockage watch this damn he had a right on cue yeah watch this this is fucking to me bitch I mean come on sign it look at all that blood but he gets away oh yeah the little seals like not today motherfucker well he's dead now he's you'll see eating like crazy oh no he's in trouble but Liz shark probably just bit a giant chunk out him sees on the top he's dead we call the blood he gets away I understand but look at all that blood I mean he's not going anywhere yeah he's kind of moving away a little but he's not going I appreciate the effort good lord look at that puddle I agree look at all these fucks running over from the clam chowder oh yeah that's all I want to see in life fuck I'd love to see something like that so crazy that it's right there and that's what that's just it opens your eyes as to what that's really like because we've if we were just outside of the woods right and you would sit in your how lucky hits him again boom look at this now he's dead okay he's and I think that thing's just wiggling well he's kind of doing the damn thing thing is gonna get away with one fin I wonder what is happening maybe like let's it go oh my God look at this we're watching this folks and this is like maybe 30 feet away from people looks like jaws she's getting away though but then he didn't I don't know what's happening there I just see some motion well they can in order do you think he is 100% do you think he's there's more than one seal it just doesn't seem like that thing could bleed that much look he's up here now you know what more there might be a bunch of seals Joe he must be just jack and seals oh that's insane never gets old it never gets old see that seal looks so little do that again Jamie like watch he's got it in his mouth when he flies out of the water I think there's way better footage than that it's just in south childr yeah yeah what I'm saying is like if game makes it better I can't watch this watch this one more time watch this the up-close thing looks like a puppy another puppy because maybe we just can't tell cuz no it's too it's so little look how little go one more time it's so little in his mouth like watch when it comes out of the water it's got it in its mouth see that look at that little that thing's dead is fuck look at all that blood after we get enough of it I think that there's probably a gang in them in there and he's just swimming around jacking them just fucking full-on buffet Golic they just eat I don't think they've stopped getting too hungry we just eat is there any like ultimate footage you could pop throw from South Africa away from a hundred people just sitting there watching Fisherman's Wharf you're chillin and this fucking great whites next to you they like I was saying like if you look in your backyard your backyard was right there and you watch some crazy like crocodile tearing a part of zebra wreck right in your backyard you'd be like what the fuck I'm not going out there absolutely but people like let's go in the ocean let's go swimming around hey you know what I love man I love surfing I love surfing because it makes the well I'm standing on look a lot like seals I like to wear a wetsuit it looks like a seal make the wetsuits white or something oh my god Jesus Christ scary fucking animals nothing scarier than that nothing and it's really easy to get those shots they're just I mean they're everywhere and so what they're doing is they're dragging a face that's a fake seal that they pull in water sharks like must quickly you would he died show me no no he's an idiot do to be good way to go way to go 85 and they take you out their little boat when did they first feel realize that they jumped out of the water I want to say that that wasn't that long ago like only a couple decades ago I think there was just rumors that sharks jumped out I'll just hit Shark Week like two years ago we're like holy fucking fly I don't think they really necessarily wouldn't it be crazy how about this would it be crazy if they just started doing it recently like you know how we always like to think of human evolution and we think of human evolution as being like something that is like completely and totally unique like we got really smart we figured out cable and the internet and no other animals are ever gonna figure that out but what they're starting to say now about chimpanzees there's a theory about this that these these actually scientists were debating whether or not chimpanzees are beginning to enter into the Stone Age meaning whether or not chimpanzees are starting to experiment with tools to the point where it could be thought of as a natural trait and whether or not they're going to start teaching each other I mean that we know that human beings at one point in time used to be some sort of an ancient primate and we evolved and we developed and we grew and we became what we are today right we know we weren't this way no oh four million years ago yeah we became this over time why wouldn't we assume that other animals are doing the same thing and if they are doing the same thing we're seeing that right now with chimps imagine if we're seeing that shit with sharks to imagine figure you know what looks cool is fuck dude when you jack a seal and fly out of the ocean just to let those constant oh look at me it's like think about like what things people do to show off like those flips that those BMX bikers do I agree couldn't do that 10 years ago or 20 years ago they didn't do it nobody did it all of a sudden they do it well these fucking sharks are starting to jump out of the water what if like it was like ten years ago they just didn't do it what if one shark did it and the other sharks were like oh yeah a shark got a lot of shark pussy and the other sharks were like I got to start doing that - it's called peacock I smoke yourself retarded like a zillion a gazillion views where there's a monkey sitting in front of a screen with all these squares and this sequence of numbers 1 through 10 pops up in the squares and you see it all mixed up just for a flash and the chimp goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I couldn't do it now I don't know if it's a video I was trying to do it but I couldn't remember I couldn't put him in order but the monkeys apparently unless it's a hoax video it could be says chimps have a better short-term memory then humans or it's just me don't do it they figured out how to do it to get food and they teach them these sequences over like a long period time you sure about to do it and then they know they're gonna get food but they've been doing it for a while the treat dude you remember that dumb bit but look at the code it's just one two three four five six and nine see it's not like some super secret code like watch the beginning see it's 1 2 - oh well here's what's going on though they block out the number so you can't see what the numbers are exact but look at it at first he does it you see the numbers yeah oh this is just blah and then they do it again and then they hide then up they show it to him briefly for a moment and then they hide the numbers yeah look at how fast this I couldn't have done that I wouldn't done you know it's challenging watch him walk on the tightrope watch this again this is what's bananas watching walk on this fucking telephone cord look they're terrifying they're terrifying that plant of the ape shit imagine they got just smart enough to be like those things in Planet e yeah take him out before that happened Oh we'd have to take him out bro remember that lady who had like the boyfriend chimpanzee was she he was chillin in a robe and shit drinking wine then one day said nah bitch ripped her face off without her face her friends face cuz her frock rockin that's what it is I think that chimp was getting some pussy that's what I think's absolutely 100% shakin is dang with bacon steel paper so that's so with that lady I see I thought it was heard I got fucked up Oh powerful teeth bite in there I'm good I'm good let's just take that wrapper off though so it doesn't oh make everybody get angry at us let me know how it is so their friend was cock-blocking that's what it well the Frank came I was like oh what's up Jim right again my dad chucked any any went crazy he ripped her face off I wonder if she like said hey you get out of here if she got threatening to him music shit I wonder like if there was like an in exchange or if we said all right enough of this cock-blocking I'm just gonna pull his bitches eyes I get a robe on bro forget a diaper robe in the diaper do you see the pictures of him in a robe she like dressed him up in Cheshire's and then finally there's pictures of her to fuck me like rip her face and the faces are or something to her face apart completely and then the chicks on the phone right going yeah yeah my fucking monkey 200 pounds he was huge I mean he was he slept in her bed I yeah he slept in her bed she gave me she gave him xanax and she gave him red wine so even if he wasn't fucking her which he probably was for Conner Burriss had a giant dick giant chimp dick balls he probably horny all the time so maybe she just jerked him off every now and again you know maybe who knows what the fuck happened but that chimp was our kur companion like he loved out with her man yeah it wasn't fixed in a row think of a dude horny dude and he's cuddling with his girl all the time and he's never getting any pussy and then a friend comes over right when he thinks he's about to get the pussy the friend comes over and like you're sleep with monkeys like you fucking cunt your face oh god what a monster what a terrifying thing an intelligent super powerful primate that rips your face apart that sips wine and his fucking chillin and xanax she was giving it no matter how hard he fucked her after the wine drunken munkey sex I wonder if she gave him wine and xaniix no wonder she he's gonna rip that asshole up you know what I mean no wonder she's living that you're going fucking nowhere you're staying here there he is there he is look at her face son oh my oh my god oh my god like when you guys called me oh man I got this champ come and see it No fucking dumb he's terrifying Oh her face apart I'm chilling in a room we get the family photo they're in the well you know people are allowed to have wild animals that they shouldn't be allowed to they just haven't changed the laws in certain places there's actually a documentary called the elephant in the living room that's all about people that own wild animals like dangerous wild animals and there's parts of the country where you could just like Ohio there was this guy that had a bunch of them he had tigers and lions and elephants and shit and then he opened up the gates and shot himself in the head he was like fuck this open the gates let the animals out and then fucking iced himself and so the cops came and the cops had just started shooting these animals they had a fun to shoot them but they're all gone geez just wandering down the street they don't know where the fuck they're going they've been in these fenced cages their whole life it's horrible oh so crazy dude how about the the kid who his parents are I think it was his mom owned like a crazy snake pet shop and he committed suicide by lenok cobra bite them the Cobra bit him eight times oh but I commit suicide some gnarly shit man again good way to go I don't know about all that I'm just saying gangster way to go gangster yeah it's insanely painful I think that can't be good speaking of suicide have you guys did seriously guys got to watch soaked in Bleach dude I've seen it oh my god it's the brand-new Kurt Cobain documentary about Courtney Love it Courtney Love - she did it do least we got she did it do watch 30 kill them yes hundred percent dude in this doctor dude it's this dude one more time the Internet is gonna explode history is gonna be rewritten on how a like a Jimi Hendrix type I mean Rockstar it's been a change no this came out this year 2015 did so crazy that when you start telling people you have to dude them up just to get over there right you got a prepare room you got a dude how bad is it dude bro I agree dude you almost like with all your dudes I get like more and more prepared for crazy 2015 yeah but but what but what they do is they have they have the private investigator that Courtney hired to make her look good but she just went through the yellow pages and hired a motherfucker she hired like the detective all detectives right what was what was going bang Kurt Cobain had her sign a prenup and they'll come this is all real shit with the watches he was divorcing her and writing her out of the will he was in the process of writing out of the will and since she she signed a prenup she wasn't gonna get that much and he she was totally fucked up on her and he was trying to clean his shit up according to this documentary and then if if she had something it looks it appears that she had something to do with his murder based on that documentary it fucking dude they got dude here we go again - dude dude when he shot himself yes when he shot himself okay when you have a say and he didn't shoot himself don't know they're saying he did but they're saying he didn't do it because it he had too much heroin in his body with how much Harun they found in his blood system couldn't operate a gun there's no heroin in his body to cause 10 overdoses on whew it was just like it was crazy man let me ask you this um is it possible his tolerance was so high that he could just do it when you listen it when you listen to all the shit that's private in but she hired a private investigator to find this missing Kurt we don't know where he's at he bought a shotgun and he's gonna he's suicidal she was just putting it all out there and from day one this private investigator started taping everything goes this girl's was she was calling like TMZ she's leaking all this stuff cuz the blames either well nah she's called like the MTV MTV whatever Courtney was calling MTV saying he's suicidal he's got a she body she the detective was like how the fuck is his skin out and he tricked Tracy back to see that he's like this bitch is releasing it and then with that with the evidence yeah the way he shot himself if according to how he would do it mm-hmm that they found him the way the shotgun shell fell is all wrong it should have fell the other than be on that so all the conversation to tape conversations he taped everything mad conversation him and and her lawyer him and her and this is the shit shoots that she'd be all fucked up on her on in her voice would say see you know they're supposed to be looking for Kurt but she knows where he's at she's calling their rehab 13 times a day and he won't take her calls she's freaking out she's gonna get written out of the will she needs his ass dead but that's the way it looks she says shit like this to the private investigator on tape just say you know my elms coming out and and I'm I started this rumor that I had OD she's saying this but where should I go with this should I say it was an OD or should I say no it wasn't an OD that was twisted it was actually me being suicidal because I can't find Kurt what do you think and the private investigators go on I think that's a really really bad ideas but it's it's publicity it's how about their own daughter to invite her to her wedding look at them the daughter got married anybody in it it's a little they do a little bit of a not mockumentary but there's some reenacted scenes documentary with with every forensics the actual evidence I just fucking hate reenactments they drive me what I love when they have those fucking TV shows like 48 hours or something like that and they have a reenactment and then the reenactment dude doesn't look nothing good job with like the Courtney and they did they had a fake Kirko Bangz no it's actual documentary it's not the whole thing photos of Kurt Cobain weird or that Courtney wouldn't release anything to him Courtney tried to stop in this documentary from coming out it's her voice scheming and lying to this private investigator she knows where he's at she's pretending that he's missing she keeps saying that he's suicidal he bought a shotgun and then the cops like the former police chief of Seattle where all this happened he's on the documentary saying this was they got to reopen this thing they want a real Jamie talked to a really good detective I think he's from LA or he's been in a lot of major cases and he's essentially the head he's really like wrote the book on how to look at a murder investigation and he's saying look at this case again and why they don't is a little corruption in this show she was painted it all wrong they did it all wrong he said usually for them to say it was a suicide deserves like all the stuff that goes into it they let you know up suiciding the even the detect was like what the fuck that quick no one's gonna do any research how do you go about bribing cops honey a pill son but can you just do that like it's a high-profile case like that where Kurt Cobain commits suicide who the fuck would she talk to to hook up some sort of bribery how do you do something she was a gazillionaire did she hold on there was a lot of dumbness just a lot of bad procedure and a lot of circumstantial dumb things that happen sort of like the Jon Benet Ramsey case where they just kept the old Jay things like they write up a bunch of stuff evidence and then finally like I it's a suicide well the God the head detective the guy that was in charge of everything he soon got fired or quit forced to quit for some other scandals he could he easy was known for paying people off he got he got in trouble for other shit yeah the guy in charge the guy who didn't want to look into anything there was a private investigator the guy who put the shit together he went to the lead detective he was a former cop this private investigator he knows he knows proper procedure he goes up to the guy and says hey listen I've been I was hired by Courtney Love I've been on this case for the last month you need to talk to me and I got a lot of shit and the guy didn't want to talk to him you wouldn't talk to that's true I don't want to watch that run into her somewhere we're gonna have to kill her dude I think the world is gonna turn on today thank god this is a comedy park I know right but senator it is because we're just finding out about it it's just now but if when did it come out I saw John mm that's now it's almost over 2015's be coming mm don't they jump they just made it a bit about it now they just made it available I heard about it on the OB channel earlier this year they interviewed the director how long ago was this mm the summer see that's what I'm worried about but just get Netflix just now so it just sit well that might just be it Netflix is the motherfucker of motherfucker comes to spread and shit and then JRE and when we're talking about it right now we're talking about on the JRE I said oh my god with the one with the baby in the water that shirt man I can't believe you really think that she you know what's crazy to me I mean I've done my best and we've all fucked up in life but I've done my best to try to avoid total nightmare type relationships like that like that that seems like not just a nightmare relationship but the nightmare if that is true with a completely insane person who's willing to not just fake things for publicity but possibly you know they're insinuating allegedly killing him there's a lot of jealousy there too but look at her brilliant fucking musician he was Oh it's missing it just kills you the idea that it's some unbelievably brilliant guy gets shacked up with some knucklehead like that's what it was drove everybody crazy about Yoko Ono and John Lennon like how how how was that the way I don't know if that was the wedge and the Beatles we weren't there I'm just guessing but everybody says anyway could pick a hotter girl didn't even talk about the suicide note preach any the suicide note they were supposedly her are you Jamie it was first the first half of it it wasn't even about looks like about his music and all the shit wasn't didn't sound like a suicide no then at the end she pieced it together practices signature in her backpack they found her practicing her practicing she wrote that shit oh my god so a lot of it was other stuff and then she loved you I love you I love you he was divorcing her and writing her out of the will yes he was divorcing and that's a fact right about leaving Nirvana - supposedly yeah Wow so she's a Wyatt son she washed his handwriting on the paper and wrote something at the bottom of a paper that he had written yeah it doesn't match up they're saying forensic scientist 8 doesn't match she wanted to to make it seem like it was something that she really wrote so she was trying to blend it all in together oh my god it's fucking dark shit man this is possible reason Dave Dave Dave growth man I'm a hundred percent convinced she was involved in it somehow I'm a honey setter to and I movie the jinx how the jinx took down that murderer do that TV shows yes you think so now crazy would it be in our lifetime if all of a sudden Courtney Love one's of getting arrested and convicted for Kurt Cobain's murder and then you start thinking about all the guys that publicly dated her like Ed Norton Ed Norton that's right that fucking guy was dating her after the suicide alleged Sue's lot of rock stars Billy Corrigan yeah they were married yeah it was all of the partying have a giant falling out with her after like he helped her write that one brilliant first album that Kurt wrote that's a Nirvana songs that which one that still would doll parts that was a great house and every people on the inside know that Kurt put that shit together there she didn't want to news Bruins he dies that how blows up it was all perfect timing for she becomes this huge star doesn't want to put out I think it was doesn't want to put out another album and she's banging Billy Corgan this is according to Billy Corgan on Howard Stern he said that down he had to convince her to make another album she was afraid of course because she knew it wasn't gonna deliver a solution so Billy put that album together and wrote most of it and he convinced her to do it and helped her put it all together he's a brilliant role doesn't fuck with her like he don't take there's a HBO Kurt Cobain documentary which is brilliant the way it was done was amazing but he William take you want nothing to do with it this one or that one he wants nothing to do this is scary it is scary she stares shit yeah that's scary that someone could become a murderer and just integrate right back into pop culture and no one man away with it for so long she got away with it this is the first documentary I remember I watched one a few years back where there was another guy that was accusing her of murdering yeah and in that documentary was all conspiracy theory status back then this private investigator he hardened but he didn't he didn't release any of the tapes he had all the tapes he has hours and hours of their conversations were her just bullshitting and lying to hold oh my he can't discern so many lies yes I'm getting nervous I could nervous when I talk about this imagine like that someone alive that does that yeah and fills him up with heroin and writes his love can't do it twice the suicide note blows his brains out whatever the fuck he once did yet if she really did do it once and that happened and what year was that happened but 94 93 but check this out their nanny their nanny was a guy that used to fuck her bridge come on come on married or before they were all a while they were married oh my god wow they were married whoa the darkness contained those dolls yeah Kurt Cobain well the great dude when you hear her voice conniving and she she's a master at handling the press oh oh shit everything empty everything that back then was coming from MTV like all the news and it was all coming from her directly she was all over that shit so she was putting out all that everybody that knows him everybody that knew him really well said he was not suicidal hit her for his family they interview his family and friends like Kurt was 100% not suicidal like he he put on this whole like grunge thing oh and Kenny also thing they said a lot of times like he killed himself because he had that stomach issue that was gone yeah he didn't have that that was cured stomach issue he had a stomach problem issue he would say there was a statement he made that said that it made him want to kill himself the pain she ran with it she would run with that stuff but you saying he was cured at that time yeah it was all coming you gotta watch it we just can't fucking play I'm terrified what yes yeah she did it though did you ever see the photos they release on the Internet the autopsy photos I get in device oh well it's almost like what if you found out that Jimi Hendrix was murdered by the CIA or something no you know there's a jimi hendrix book jimi hendrix former bodyguard is a guy who says that Jimi Hendrix was murdered by his former manager because he was leaving his manager and that same manager killed Jimi Hendrix girlfriend Hendrix died after Jimi Hendrix died his girlfriend was thrown off a roof in Soho yeah they said she committed suicide but this guy says they threw her off a roof because she knows that they killed Jimmy because Jimi was leaving his manager this is one thing the manager did do okay the manager had Jimmy kidnapped had Jimmy kidnapped and then rescued him just show him to show him that Jimmy needed him Jesus so the manager had Jimi Hendrix fucking kidnap is this factor conspiracy thing no I wasn't there obviously but this is according to the this this guy and apparently the kidnap store has been sad before like the kidnap story's been said before but this is a shame sounds really brilliant artist well that happens though these these manager characters especially the old days of show business I mean think about what we're talking about in 60s the 60s is just 20 years removed from the fucking 40s sure you know I'm saying I mean think about the 40 the 40's are just 20 years removed we can go back and back until we get to Gangs of New York right let the crazy fucking movie with brilliance yeah Louis when they were killing each other with that like we're talking about a different era of humanity okay easy to kill people back then 1960s the people that were running showbiz there was a lot of gangsters in the music business like legitimate gangsters they would get involved in the career of Frank Sinatra yeah they were getting involved in the career of a lot of different artists it was very very common because they can make a lot of money and they like being big shots and they liked saying hey I'm Jimi Hendrix manager let me in the door please and these fucking people infiltrated like that fucking guy that was in the producer that was in with the Beatles the guy who shot the chick in the mouth the guy wore the crazy wigs what the fuck is his name the wall of sound guy the producer what's up Specter yes Phil Spector here's a guy who used to always pull guns on people he was that he was a producer for the fucking Beatles he had a very distinctive style of recording music they used to call the wall of sound right is that the real reason they quit well this guy's shot he shot a fucking woman in the mouth okay in Hollywood a few years back took her back to his place put a gun in her mouth and pull the fucking trigger right yeah some hottie that he picked up at um like was the Lake House of Blues or something or sky bar or something like that but right across the street from the Comedy Store she's where he met her took her up to his mansion blew her fucking brains out and they you know they tried him and convicted him but this guy was probably doing that his whole career because that was that was the rumor was that he would strong-arm people with guns like I think that was like super common in the music business I think violence and the threat of violence kept a lot of people in business I think what like people allege that Suge Knight did I think that's just a rap version of it I think people had been doing that forever it's crazy man so what she's done what she did is it's probably been done before if she did it I agree but you guys think she did it hundred percent you know the John Lennon assassination conspiracy theory you know that the CIA had him killed there's there's a lot of shit on that man I did you see the guy who did it though how crazy is that you can get someone who's crazy to do things for you like here's a perfect example the FBI arrested this guy in Dallas for making a fake bomb and and trying to detonate it but the FBI gave him that bomb it's the whole story's hilarious they've some really fucking stupid dude they talked him into doing something probably never would have done they literally sold him all the equipment to go and do this or they gave him all the equipment they gave him cellphone to act to do they're not well it was gonna blow up some building god dammit but here's but here's the thing he never was going to was never his idea they talked him into doing it they scheduled the whole thing they got him the equipment then they arrested him yeah but he's like they created a crime yeah but you don't think with John Lennon this homeboys crazy what you don't think he's gonna see we got a prison you got a look into it who knows you got a look into it listen you don't get the same if they don't let you talk was the last time you saw an interview with the murder yeah well well no you gotta look into it just as crazy as the soaked in Bleach you know what I mean I don't look then do it if someone would tell you about it you'd be like oh I don't know you don't think you don't think he was crazy he was from here you never say this I don't think I don't have any I don't even have an opinion on the John Lennon thing I've never heard it before until Eddie brought it up I never I mean I might have peripherally heard someone said to see I know no details though none zero zilch but that said if they wanted to kill someone II one of the best ways would be get some crazy person and infiltrate them even without their knowledge right you can provide them with a weapon talk them into doing it and there's a lot of fuckin morons out there thank you sir and the guy the guy who allegedly killed Robert F Kennedy he doesn't have any recollection of it happening he what he says is everyone says that I shot him so I probably did everyone said they saw me shoot him but I don't remember anything well how about that scopolamine stuff that Colombian Devil's what do they call it Colombian Devil's dust dust devils wrath there's yeah Devil's breath thank you there's this shit that they can blow they literally can blow it in your know they blow it on you if you breathe it in die you'll become a zombie you do what they tell you to do and you have no memory of it like I'll blow it on you Elsie Brendan Schaub help me move my couch and then all sudden you're fucking carrying the couch up the stairs like a family I'm not bullshitting man that's real 100% 100% real you'll put the couch down and here's what really crazy that same stuff that they use is the same shit they put in Dramamine and those little patches when you get seasick they give you like a little patch and it's like a little tiny amount of this I think it's called scopolamine and they think that's how you say it but it's the same active ingredient as those patches that they give you to keep you from fucking getting seasick Jesus Christ man this stuff I get my hands on if they have a blood they blow it in your face and they think that that might have been where the legend of zombies came from that's why zombies like it was always like a Haitian thing those we talk about zombies Haitian Colombia like they wherever I don't know if it's this area that had this plant but they think that people have been using this on people for years and it wasn't until like really recently that they realized the effects of this stuff like pharmacologists started to examine the effects of blowing this shit on because there's a short video of a advice has a whole documentary on light of the whole thing on very stuff but I thought Lord it's illegal but I didn't see I didn't see a documentary I didn't see like a test like testing people or any kind of sad I don't remember it's quite quite awhile ago where I saw a test I've watched too many documentaries y'all go in there's no room I have no room in my hard drive I got to start deleting memories in my childhood oh I'm filling my shit up I'm trying fast guys yeah but the problem is like stuff goes in and out now it's like some stuff stick like MMA stuff seems to stick like glue and there's a few things about other things that stick like glue but then there's occasional documentaries that are really interesting that just in a room you know it's weird when I was a kid I collect football cards and I can remember almost a tee every player what ecology played in it's useless information for the reason it's stuck with me I remember liking weird man I remember weird shit we all do those like stuff that doesn't make any sense how do I know this so sure what I remember is sleep yeah come on man yeah let's go here like the plotline of like a Tom Selleck show you know like magnum p.i I can remember a whole plot lines but really why do I need that why don't we need Wow the fucking dude for the helicopter and he's helping him out and then there's the guy who lets them use the Ferrari and gets in trouble with it most of my vocabulary's from Ace Ventura Sandler how fuckin weird no that's hilarious weird my brains like yeah let's download this he might not I mean you know I'll use all of it man yeah all huh alrighty then you know when he does the thing recycle and maybe he has a dream he's like it bit me right here he goes I do that all the time all the time if I was you I'd say for sure stop doing 9 I caught something quote Hollywood shuffle man that have you ever seen that it's only LaBrie winds and Robert Townsend their first movie that they put together with credit cards and should super crazy low-budget it's fucking hysterical it's called Hollywood shuffle remember I'm gonna get you sucka yeah that's when they started making money because of Hollywood shuffle you know that kind of was an underground hit shot homes in dude he was he had a hit TV show he probably has a billion dollars yeah but a guy what his TV show do you have what is it yeah when the WB just started up wisdom he definitely didn't make a be used to do like these comedy specials like Robert Townsend presents yeah I never like Damon would go on and do like 10 minutes all these different comments go on but he was a famous like celebrated guy back then yeah tired of the bullshit man maybe just got tired of the spotlight said fuck it that happened to a lot of those guys they realize it's not working shit very well because that's what Keenan's do Nikita's behind the scenes yeah they probably get tired of the bullshit man right Mia yeah there you go what is the benefit of this yeah I gave Chapelle look at him yeah what he's doing man stop doing anything he doesn't put anything out no specials he's doing stand-up kills it still doing spread-out still writing let's yeah I never got to go see him live to see it which is kind of crazy that's kind of cool the one time he showed up at the Comedy Store maybe eight years ago at them in the main room man I never seen you so blown away who was ever seen usually you're in the back on this guy fucking eats dicks that's a gross mischaracterization of how I look at comedians like bad but very few are really good that I'll sit down there and watch yes but like for everyone that like I'm just exaggerating well that's not good graduation because yeah like there's like guys that I'll definitely go see if they're like Bill burr I'll see him every time it's there it's hilarious he's like there's a few course dude you when it was over we were dying so when it was over you turned around and you had this look on you you walked out of the comedy store and said I've never been so inspired in my all my life you just wanted to go home and write jokes and shit you were really an icy someone really good that's the first instinct right like yeah yeah I want to hit another level now yeah I want to go home and write I want to get my fucking thoughts in order and like when you see someone that just that's one of the best things about living in LA and you get to see all these like really great guys go up they'll get the CDs people go up and you go god I'm like I really think everybody like sort of feeds off each other in that regard you know like you'll you'll watch like Louie CK did two nights at The Comedy Store this week you know it did like I think he did Sunday and Monday night and then you know like they'll have a show on Tuesday or Wednesday nights a girl will be there you know something like great guys that are in town B's it's just one of the places one of the few places maybe there's only one other one I think maybe New York wait that could happen we're on a regular basis you'll see like top level headliners like over and over no don't you say it's the best time I think it's the best time for college I think there's no there's never been more really funny comics than right now mmm like as far as like me as a fan like say if I never did stand-up again or never did it at all I just watched it I just looked around and I compared this era to any other era even people I don't people I don't know it could take re out of the mix and Joey of the mix and all the people that I think are hilarious I still think is the best time ever I think I look around all these fucking people so many Gilbert Stanhope and borough and Dave Attell louis c.k and Chapelle and you fucking you could keep going Ian Edwards a lot of people even nobody in Edwards he's a beast it's a and monster he sold super-nice he saw and there's a bunch of those guys man there's guys like that in Austin Texas it's guys like that in Denver there's guys like that in New York there's guys like that in Boston there's a really unusual time super unusual time I think it's cuz the internet because people can watch other people do stand-up now like you can see like everybody set ever you know like you could watch like a Richard Pryor thing that any Murphy thing and every guy you mentioned right there I wish I had a YouTube video that was again three hour video of just all the guys you said because anybody that impresses you that's the one thing I knew if they impressed you they gotta be good well they're on YouTube Eddy video a mix of all those guys burn presses the fucking shit out of me right now as the Stanhope I need to every time I see Stanhope I want to go right you know he's another guy that inspires the shit out of me we had bird on the podcast today and you know I love comedians man i watch all their stuff all you guys and I think was the is the first podcast it's the least amount of time I've ever spent talking he just went oh yeah you're fucking well he's he does out of my podcast too he's he's hilly joke around about it being OCD or a DD or whatever the fuck he is but it's real it's like oh he'll go from one subject to the next subject to the next subject before you even get a word in he like just keep senior subjects oh but it's one of the reasons why is cuz he does his own podcast by himself he's one of the few guys that does a podcast he does it call the Monday morning podcast and doesn't on Thursday too and what he does is he just turns on his iPhone or his microphone and just starts talking and goes it just goes Bill burr huh so for an hour and a half he just ad DS the fuck out and talks goes hill to a fucking I can't I don't watch football so I don't pay attention but he'll do fucking an hour on the Patriots you know and just go off about scores and but he's crazy but hilarious hello his his podcast is good his stand-up is amazing his stand-up is amongst the best ever right now you know he's one of the best ever and I think that between him and like I said you could just keep going down the line like Kevin Hart Kevin Hart it's he's the most successful guy ever most successful tour yeah ever yeah ever ever by far I think I think he's doing a thing in Philadelphia or did it I don't know if he's gonna do it or did do it it's gonna do 50,000 seats and it had already sold like 40,000 seats three months it's insane he's giant he's just giant who's that black medium that kind of went crazy cat well what's it what's his current status he did a special like I want to say a year and a half ago with Spike Lee like Spike Lee directed it and it was pretty good it was pretty good but you know yeah he went through a real bad spell where he was seem like he's kind of losing in mind yeah I'm live in Bakersfield bad oh yeah he kind of melt recently or no this is when all that shit was going down maybe two years ago saw him out yeah there was no comedy drugs or anything that's what he filmed is special I think no no no

good they just had a baby I know interesting little Tommy he's fucking killing it he's great he's dude he just did his second Netflix special he did one Netflix special and it changed his whole comedy like his whole career one special he went from doing really well in clubs he was doing really well because of his podcast because of word-of-mouth like people had heard you know he did you know you build a market like you go to Dallas you kill then people you come back and do the radio I remember that guy's funny if you do that over a course of a few years you can build a market yeah like there was a couple of places that I did that like Houston before I ever had anything really going on but tom was doing that and doing really well and all sudden he does his Netflix special boom now he's selling out theaters that was the tilt mm-hmm yeah people he had the product he had that his the tiny comedy share and rere just sold out 1,200 seats in Toronto holy shit 1,200 seats Ari Shaffir that's incredible I know I was like dude what was that like and we were talking about he's like it's amazing like Ari was ready to throw in the towel just a few years ago with life he's even alive he was suicidal yeah yeah it was unhappy you know and one of the things that I don't know if I think pretty sure he's talked about this on the podcast but um he was taking propecia and propecia one of the side effects for some people is depression I fucking told Callen it's bad it's depressing is Callen taking that shit yes and that's when he's been kind of fucking here lately short he doesn't want to wants to know must act what's the stage acting he doesn't admit if he loves it on sitcoms and in television shows and then um in movies like those parts he does it's great bachelor or bachelor has over hangovers fucking funny yeah it's really in Chicago he'd fucking ripped my soul apart man his fucking he was on fire that's my point so his stand-up it's really what he's best at yeah God's gift yeah and the more it's like one of those things is like he likes doing it but it it's it's it's tricky like the more time you spend doing other things like acting like acting especially like 16-hour days on set that's a look if especially you get a sitcom or something like that yeah there's a lot of time when you don't get to do Stan he's doing that our podcasts on motherfucker now without everything we got going on just all often you guys go away two or three times a week and then we have the digital series which that you know it takes that's me doing it two or three times a week yeah Wow it's crazy isn't it isn't it crazy that podcasting was just like a goof just a little while ago just started her wife beaters in Brian's garage just like fucking around like this is a terrible idea I don't want to do this these things work to wife beaters these things work because you're fucking around like a show if this was produced on television right and your show was someone came up to you and they said this is our idea we're gonna dress you up in the finest fashions and we're gonna light you I'm gonna put your makeup on and then we're gonna you know tell you what to talk about ready go you'd never be able to cry self big dick bandits who start singing stupid songs and Cowan would start singing a song about something and they would cut you off you can't sing a song about the muscles in your back you know they would say but since it's just you guys and you're just fucking around then it becomes what it is and then after it becomes what it is it gets bigger and bigger until someone comes along and says hey um why don't you guys do that for us it's crazy yeah it's insane it is insane oh you guys think baby do you guys ever got it get in trouble for anything you say no Fox because our numbers have been so good they're kind of like let them do their thing I don't know if they look like he's tried to get you guys to stop swearing oh yeah which is hilarious yes we had a meeting like is there any way you can say dick less and stop swearing is that all I mean count like know a few sensors we got to go somewhere else they can't they're like do your thing they can't stop it once things get big they can't stop it starts rolling they can't stop it and then and then once you stop fighting for the UFC nobody nobody can tell you what to do it's weird it's like there's no strings you're like fucking Pinocchio I have no strings to hold me down to make me sad it's weird man I mean camp this time last year you know I was trying to decide what the fuck I'm gonna do yeah it gets tricky man trying to plot your life out it's like when things start getting going then it's like once you find something and starts getting going just follow through with it and and stay on it and stay focused stay the course but for a lot of people like young guys like I got a nephew and talk to my nephew about like what he wants to do like you gotta find what you want like what is it you want yes but for a lot of people it's hard to find a thing once you find a thing then you like fuck I'm going for it you know like once you find a thing then you go for it but it's hard to find a thing for a lot of people and there's a lot of people that have a gig so they have a thing that they love but maybe they like tattooing or something like that but they got this job so they can only tattoo unlike Saturday more and their wife gives him a hard time then they were like I'm thinking about becoming talk to us you know and they have a hard time ever finding their thing and making it a gig so when you get something like what you guys have you found a thing and it's taken off and now you're selling out all these shows like you guys are killing it everywhere they're selling out everywhere they're selling out all over the country they do these live fighter in the kitchen I see a fellow on Instagram you know what I like your flyer that was my favorite so far is your face on Cal installed and his face on your head someone photoshopped it fan is it an awesome I don't know who was it might be I don't know it's really good it was weird you thinking like I look like a pedophile I look like I sell Subway sandwiches I look terrible yeah things are good we barely talked about fighting you know what's interesting we haven't at all great life you know it's interesting man is how the UFC hasn't done their own podcast yet we talked I talked to them about doing it a while back I think there was some mention about it but I think the swearing thing was also an issue with them like there was some concern meanwhile Janus where's there anymore doesn't anymore father said bitch please he very rarely swear it's like you used to like you know you used to have those press conferences and you would swear I think you probably still does a little every now and then maybe be early but I think he also realizes it just causes more problems than it is it's like the freedom that you get from speaking your mind saying whatever you want it's almost like it's not worth it because it causes so many so many hassles and so many fires that you have to put want to be taken serious you don't seem like you know Roger Goodell cussing about Tom Brady I don't think people look at the sport serious have you kept doing that that's true well you know what man I don't want his job Dana White's job is fucking brutal that guy worked so hard and he's constantly working and she's constantly falling apart there's always constantly like a new blowout a new this and new that a new fucking fire he has to put out and never stops it never ends oh that's a it's a pays well like 40 million is pretty good yeah I don't know what it pays would you you fight you take that gig ah no you wouldn't you go right back to podcasting cast everywhere well I think yeah I like the freedom to do what the fuck I want to do things you wouldn't get that kind of money unless you did what he did which was like build it from the beginning like you don't get that money if you come in as a fucking executive now like if they had to hire some new guy no he's not getting shit no I got a good salary I'll make some good money but the Dana White effect is when the sport is like non-existent yeah and you got two rich friends and two runs they put up mad cash they lose a fuckload there were 44 million in the hole before it turns around with the Ultimate Fighter and then it takes off and becomes as Giants poor the rich friends were key though gigantic just rich friends but Eddie and I talked about this it's almost like it's almost like we're in a movie because we would always say the same thing we would always say the same thing what we used to say there's no way the sport isn't gonna take over it's impossible yeah but what did we say we said this is what the sport needs - super rich dudes that are worth billions of dollars that don't give a fuck just throw all this money at the sport and make it big yep and that's exactly what happened them it's exactly what happened and they fucked up along the way they hired Carmen Electra to be their spokesperson at one point in time see I dug that remember that oh yeah I dug that was Paris Hilton involved as well no what no anything Chuck was pret was uh the the King back then I think Chuck wasn't the champion I think Tito was I mean you gotta mix things out remember when they had girls - good pose for a while I forget her they were very nice girls it's Carmen Electra with Tito and Vitor dude she was a dime piece oh that light light heavyweight Vitor fuck yes yeah Wow crazy I am not mad at that mm-hmm yeah interesting they tried a bunch of different things he just tried to get pay attention to it and it wasn't until the Ultimate Fighter what's crazy is the Ultimate Fighter almost didn't even made almost didn't get made they had to pay for the whole thing that's basically the giant infomercial right there to essentially pay Spike TV nobody gave a fuck about Spike TV at the time yeah and then they put together the show and they're losing so much fucking money yeah take risk though and then they get to the finals and Forrest Griffin is fighting Stephan Bonnar and the whole fucking world tunes in calling each other then it takes off it just grows it was like the seed that got plant look at that Carlos Newton look at Jen's Pole forget Randy we get it though oh my goodness pedro rizzo y ro SIV pedro just fought his last fight just retired a couple months ago get ready for a lesson in submission that's knuckle is it that's a fuckin that's the whole leg knuckle that's the home thigh that's a moose ham dude she is a design she was very hot which is very nice - I did a spike TV thing with her we hosted this car show together she's super like down-to-earth she's married now I don't know I'm not a gossip pound jamie is Oh ask him he probably knows she she's all over she's probably still hot as fuck oh I agree she did post fight anybody's right and didn't like there was a playmate Casey Kasem's daughter did Harry Kasem they were just they were doing a bunch of different things who they got on best damn sports show remember that yes and Lee aunt Whedon did part of that as well was super nice - she's super cool very smart - smart she's British she's fucking sharp easy so she was she but she was only involved in the one because it was with best damn sports show well what's up with I don't know if you can talk Nigel what because domina they trying now where this first time ever in a main event the Adamic crews in there with the three was awesome I would like to do with him all the time he's fucking great he's great he got me fired up we didn't see our dude he's great he's smart dude and his knowledge of MMA is just fucking outstanding especially footwork and positioning and and striking the technician super technical and we did the Fox Sports prelims together or the excuse me the fight pass prelims together and you looking for the joint we did the I was one right in front you dude oh we did the fs1 no fight pass fight pass prelim together to three prelims and he was outstanding man and we also did a lot of talking backstage he and I talked we we we shared philosophies Nam good dude we were talking about upcoming matchups like how we thought about this fight of that fight what do you he really favored cowboy overawed dos Anjos which I thought was interesting I think yeah I think a lot of people did yeah um I thought it was who the fuck knows fight me too I felt like the way the pressure that dos Anjos put on Pettis I felt like that's gonna fuck with anybody man I agree he's tough to beat that guy yeah very tough with all that jujitsu too yep gonna have to catch him when he's making that mad charge and I think someone with like the kind of footwork that Connor has might have the best chance but we're gonna see if those two do match up you're gonna see pressure that Connors never experienced before and he's also got ha feel Cordero which who's a phenomenal striking coach one of the best in the world he's gonna break down like what Connors doing and Connors movement down right because we haven't seen enough footage to really break that down and we haven't seen Connor with that pressure you know I'm saying the other thing is is when Connor hit speed with that left hand it's game over oh I don't think it's game over for dos Anjos he's too big my guy it might be but yet stop you talk about a different class now does he take the power totally into the lightweights and then he loses it at welt week and he still knockout welterweights well now versus knocked out Benson and Benson's fighting Walter Wade he fought Brandon thatch and thatch is a big fucker he's big and he hits hard well to attach didn't put away Benson but dos Anjos did dos ah just fucked him up he was the first guy to stop Benson yes I think dos Anjos has like the kind of power that he takes wherever like he probably 1:55 is probably optimum he does look very thin though on the weigh-ins he's definitely sucking some weight but no IVs either now no but he looked amazing amazing you know and the other thing is like people are talking about people looking different before the the PE d scare or before the other testing he can't say that about him he looked exactly the same he looks better than ever I agree and you also there's no radical change from the first time he was in the UFC well you see with dos Anjos there's a slow steady progression until like the nick curse on days then you see like a little little stronger a little faster like and then you see the the pedestal cardio that's the thing that blew me away the most about that fight the amount of cardio that he had to have to put that pace on Pettis for five rounds I mean that's just you got to be an insane condition can be tough to beat that guy then you find out that in that fight for the two weeks before the fight he fucked his knee up yeah so he had to do airdyne Sprint's that's all he did for like the two weeks before the fight he couldn't do any sparring on studies it'll put it to him since like there was nothing wrong and then you saw him in this fight 100% healthy he's a fucking monster I talked to Ryan Parsons about him and Brian Parsons said he was telling him two years ago he's like if you keep going you are the champion of the world like it's just a matter of time Ryan knows his shit Ryan knows his shit and Ryan was telling me he was watching him no names but just fuck dudes up dudes that are like really high-level UFC caliber fighters and dos Anjos just fucking them up in the gym he's a horrible matchup for anyone including Carly it's a tough matchup well he's free to die with that pressure and can grapple and nasty Power Man powers nasty the question is would he be able to have that same kind of approach on Conor who is very elusive very light on his feet like you see solve the Aldo fight who is he's movin is moving back throwing side kicks of the legs he's moving back like would he be able to just do what he did with cowboy to to Conor would be do that same approach like look for that straight shot throws that straight left hand a lot the other thing to take into consideration this is a big thing is that this will be Connor fighting a southpaw a super dangerous southpaw tree one of the things about Southwest fuck you up man they confuse the shit out of you everything's giving the wrong side everything is weird the the right hand is now the jab the jab is the right hand like what there's a lot of huge factors yeah hey it came dos Anjos deal with Conor speed yep does Conor have the knockout power at fifty five against a bigger guy think he does already I think he does because he's my weight and his power so substantial and angles he's surprising guys with his angles yeah there's a there's a lot that goes in that fight man and again I'm a team of dos Santos he's amazing champion I don't know if that's the marquee fight though as crazy as that sounds but here's what the thing it might be after Fox because you got to think that UFC on Fox got millions of people to watch and we saw a destroyer and dos on well what are we talking about what's everyone talking about Diaz we are talking about Diaz that is true that is true because of that post fight interview yes but I still think people are talking about dos Anjos to a little bit because he just kind of murk cowboy and they both work but Nate Diaz just you know dos Anjos has the belt you got daddy you know but it makes sense that you go with Nate Diaz because of all the shit talk and all and maybe that makes sense and and also you know you may be you know some people say you can't go up and wait and gink and contend for the belt right away it's a good fight before does the thing is it puts 1:45 in limbo yeah the one of the things most UFC though is they don't give a fuck they don't have to follow the rule one of the good things about not being constrained by like a WBC or an IBF like boxing good as bad yeah we were talking about the Vladimir Klitschko fight that they stripped of a lot of mirror of not vice Tyson Fury who beat Vladimir Klitschko they stripped him of one of his titles like immediately because he didn't want to fight the mandatory number one contender so they immediately stripped I'm like within two weeks right yeah it's like really quick and that wouldn't happen in the UFC just could happen and in the UFC like there's the mandatory contender is whoever the fuck they say yeah so remember to sell yeah if they say yes this is all about making money and they do and I have no complaints about that I like that yeah but if you're a fighter that would drive you crazy you'd drive you fucking if you were is number one but but if you were the number one contender like Frankie Edgar and you've been beating dudes asses and you've been fucking up everybody and just knocked out Chad Mendes in spectacular fashion and before that you beat your wife Faber clearly and then beat the brakes off Cub Swanson and submitted and you're like champ and before that but it's not gonna happen right now and it should happen right now if you're Frankie Edgar and you've been a respectful guy who just been going out there and fighting his ass off put him in and beating guys asses you're like that fuckin guy deserves his shot at the title what about Jose day he gets fucked out of all this yeah my bad I was undefeated for ten years one of the best champion of all time and I don't deserve a shot nope you know what here's the thing about that here's a problem with that the only problem with that is in business Conor could fight right away Conor knocked him out with one punch she's fine Jose for all intents and purposes should take a long time off like at least five or six months right agree he has to I mean you really should because if you don't you got flatlined like that you come back quick we all know what happens you can't take a shot at when he's healthy should get a shot but this is where it was like contractual agreements have to fall into play when it comes to champions right because if this was any other like situation like I guarantee you if Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao if Floyd Mayweather they got knocked out by Manny Pacquiao there's got to be some shit in the contract that says that Floyd gets an immediate rematch and he gets it within I think he said he I know what the contract was so if Manny won there have to be two more fights if Manny won if Floyd wins there's no more fight there's doubt the contract they signed how crazy is that well you would think that Aldo would but you can't it's not that they don't have the power that's the thing Daniels here's your contract sign it there you go yeah and you're gonna get paid and I'm sure you got paid I'm sure you made a million bucks at least although yeah II think Connor man oh he probably made dancing I would guess that but that's what I've been that I've never I haven't asked I know too much that I can't talk about that but I haven't asked his actual salary but he got paid a lot of money I would guarantee lien but he wants even more he deserves more now he shouldn't fight for anything less than 20 million dude he he shows a photo was underwear on Instagram it gets a hundred thousand likes I mean he do whatever he's the biggest star we were head if I'm Connor I'm his management and I don't give a fuck what his current contract is I say I'm not doing anything tell you 20 million a fight he was a giant star before he knocked out Aldo now he's a mega star he's like he's eating sons he's the biggest thing following up galaxy's badasses call them out every three in one car one night yeah dos Anjos Nate and Charles Oliveira he's the Floyd Mayweather of the UFC right now fight him for the beta but he's because no knocking guys not the same fighter I'm saying yeah as far as oh yeah you want to fight him to make that money yeah but even that like do you ever remember a boxing match where three winners called out Mayweather like that's never happened before this is like everybody sees like gee they're all like your shirt scrooge mcduck scrooge mcduck like come on son that's two men well I never seen like it you know they want all the stardom they want all the perks they want all the cash and they want and they think that they could beat him look at that this is hilarious yeah he says that people think that it was a it was a clean knockout but is actually a fight against multiple attackers how he's hipping away from Big John he's every single video were Big John knees him in the face no he didn't name in the face is his shin brushed over the top of all those face looks like you hit a mark John's the best in the business that's crazy to look at isn't it that he just knocked him dead with one shot I think what it's interesting that there's this this new emergence of this one guy who shit talks and it sort of changes everyone's approach boy did we need him though oh why did the UFC need everybody every mean I think the Ireland needed him to you know they needed like a hero like this world needed them the UFC's the UFC's a better place with Conor McGregor you can't say that about here sliders but here's the thing okay when we talk about like Ronda right like Ronda did a lot of shit talking to and Ronda was his over-the-top personality but when she lost like there was so much hate against her so much backlash for her behavior she brought in her so she did but my point is Holly emerges as this perfect opposite of that perfect opposite of that she's super nice like she's really friendly and respectful and it's legit like when you talk to her no there's no fakeness off-camera she's exactly the same way super confident and also like really nervous about letting anything go to her head like she's talking about I want to get back in the gym and also paid her dues yeah she's like I didn't want to talk about this I don't even like all this attention because I don't want to get carried away but isn't that like that the UFC needs that too like the UFC needs someone comes along like Holly now and they also need someone who comes along and shows the multi-faceted approach of MMA that we all know and and see everyday in the men's divisions is now making its way to the women's division at a very high level instead of having the one person like hoist Gracie was in the early UFC's would dominate with jujitsu right nobody knew what the fuck was going on he would dominate nobody else could keep up with him technique wise there's a very similar situation with Ronda like Ronda is dominating all these girls with arm bars everybody knows the arm bars are coming they can't stop so she starts to evolve her game starts knocking out people like Sara McMann Alexis Davis and her game starts to evolve and then someone comes along who has the perfect solution for that and that perfect solution is very similar to what we saw in the men's divisions when men learned how to sprawl and brawl when we saw world-class kick boxers like nori Smith yes when Maurice Smith entered to the UFC against Mark Coleman when oh look at this and then we see this sort of progression and now you see in the women's division in the women's division - it's like girls wanted to fight Ronda but they weren't it's not like the Conor effect where if you fight Conor you're making fucking Bank the girls a lot of them they got smoked so fast they got maybe a couple hundred grand maybe not not even that and just get smoked it was more of the Rhonda show you know I'm saying there's a different animal well she was that dominant she was that dominant and I don't think you can compare at all competition-wise what's available to a man's 145 pound champion versus women's 135 not close that's why when people Ali Frazier no it's not it's there's no we're nothing like it there's some good talent in the division is shaping up you've got that new russian chick who just entered the multiplet she's a seventeen times world Muay Thai champion she began Jay check seventeen did she fight 17 different is that question org different organizations that the chick that Sarah Kaufman I didn't notice that learns that's only difference yes she fought Eric Rothman on eight days no scrapping out grappler yeah and she just kept stayed in the gym luckily she was in pretty good shape but to take a fight on TV yeah for the women's division she's really good and her striking is fuckin super high-level super high-level striking and you know they're gonna see those my point you're gonna see these these maurice smith types but now they enter into MMA you're gonna see the Kira Gracie so cured Gracie doesn't want to do it like I don't think she has a desire to MMA what you gonna see just I stopped raining I don't think she wants a fight I don't know if she's training she's so pretty Bob if she's smart she would just keep training be on don't start saying that she's not into fighting though not anymore Amy maybe he was just a bad I don't know what Ansley she changed your mind I don't know I know she was into it for a while but I don't know and if we haven't heard anything from her it's probably a smart thing right on her behalf just disappear and go train for a few times we just imagine if you get someone like a female Gary tonin who decides like you know what I'm just gonna start strangling bitches I'm just gonna make my way into MMA and these girls can't fuck with my judges that noise what did you get a Sarina William what yes let me see the armbar you got it but dudes just ripping bitches faces off yeah if you get that level that level athlete who commits to it or a Marion Jones like me and there you go wait I can make money over here oh yeah I'm gonna do this I book you want us to track and field's chicks and I'm out a kick good fucking Lord does but that was one of things about Aldo you know Aldo started off playing soccer yes it's one of the reasons why his fucking leg cakes were sown a soccer then jiu-jitsu mm-hmm he started picking up yeah stand up his leg kicks were fucking ridiculous critics because and his kind of fuck that he gets kind of left out of it he gets fucked in this what what do you do when a guy gets knocked out like that in 13 seconds in in the fairest world possible as soon as he's ready to go he gets to fight for the belt but you owe it to him you do you ought to but do you allow him to choose between a rematch with McGregor or if Frankie beats McGregor he fights Frankie for the belt again he fight favela no matter who has do you let a fight happen in between his fight do you give him the time to recover yes or do you do you put the belt aside put it on hold and say the belt does not get fought for until Aldo comes back that's what you're doing with Ronda it is what you're doing with Ronda it is this is exactly what you don't say you know I'm not saying you I'm saying screws me right but that is how they look at it they look at in terms of finances they think that if you look at Holly Holly almost lost to Raquel Pennington InterPro debut or UFC debut rather yeah she won split decision - Raquel in a fight then she fought Marion Reneau is that who she fought hmm beat her and beat her decisively then just pulled out the fucking performance of a lifetime against a charging opponent someone who really played into her strengths have you look at the aggression that Rhonda had none of the other fights that she had no one no one was that aggressive chasing after people are much more respectful of her striking ability but Ronda discharged right out she also didn't fight a very high level Ronda strike no no not at all they're all very amateur and if you look at like at least on paper like credential wise no one's as high levels as Holly in MMA and in the women's division other than you wanna go Jay check and this this this new one polevich yeah Shevchenko it's a tough in a man yeah it's rough there was a couple tough ones on that um yes on that card but but Holly is like a 19 time how many times a nine time world boxing champion this chicks 17 time world Muay Thai champion then you've got you wanna go Jay check six-time world more Thai champion I just think with Jose Aldo what he's done for the sport give him time off let him go and then let everything else figure itself out make these huge fights and then when Josie goes right I'm ready year from now give him the time no have they made the decision or no it wasn't their quote that Dana said the winner of Cerrone dos sonhos gets come I think what he said was that Connard could fight for the lightweight title next that could be a fight they know he never guaranteed anything thing but even if he does they take it back to me show us Misha was guaranteed the Tigers if she beat Jessica ah she beats just Kylie look man we're good change of plans they just changed it honor it's time look ma'am but you know make it happen I think I think he might have been high as fuck what he said that he said an interview right after he goes do silver guaranteed me I get caught I'll tell you one price of shit I gotta give props to Jeff Novitzky not just for what he's done scare the fuck out of everybody and and make them all get off the sauce because he's definitely done that that's the word but also he was outspoken about Nick Diaz about Nick Diaz is a suspension he says not refined it's bullshit yeah here you got a guy who's the fucking us a DEA you sada drug guy and he's saying it's bullshit and he's saying it's a bullshit decision fuckers you're talking about Barry Bonds land so I'm trying big variances yeah he went after everybody in cycling is there oh you say they test for weed and cycling I think they do you know there is a study recently that show that ultra marathoners benefit from weed I think they eat it and then they eat it it helps them run more and not all of them not all of them well not all marathon runners smoke weed no no no but the ones that do yeah do you say not all of them means I'm gonna eat weed and doesn't do shit for them they run up Joshua trees hi it sounded like you said all marathon runners no I said ultra ultra ultra marathon runners here it is the debate over running while hot for ultra marathon runners marijuana has enormous benefits but is it ethical what is this in Jamie was the Wall Street Journal Wall Street Journal well that's pretty powerful Wall Street yeah that's me some bullshit world's changing any problem since you first got me high 15 years ago the world has changed radically yeah yeah and he Bravo's the catalyst that's El Diablo right there crazy stoner man I was like god I gotta get Joe if I could get Joe fuckin stoned they won't think I'm crazy yeah I mean shit well there's so many misconceptions so many people have misconceptions to this day that kind of fucked you but you know what it is man there are some people that are just fucking lazy and the ideas that pot gets you lazy yes that's not true I you know I think it does the opposite to me at least everybody had some reactions but to me it makes me paranoid of being lazy how about that so my guess I want to get things done oh my god I gotta clean my office Wow some people get high and just don't move and eat Cheetos those people and then blame it on that really believe those people would just do the same yeah they're lazy no matter what I really do I really think there's a lot of people that are lazy there's also a lot of people that are just not thinking right they just they they just not like you don't enjoy rest unless you deserve it that's the reality of life if you just fucking off your whole life it's not as fun like rest is fun when you deserve it yes like it feels good to eat after you work out like if you lift and you fucking beat your ass in the gym and then you go have a steak ah it's the most delicious food ever this but if you just have a steak yeah it's delicious but you don't even know how good it is you don't all good it is if you just pushed your body before you ate it you would enjoy it so much more I mean you might not be in the lifting and lower your any kind of working out that might not be your thing but my point is it like if there's some things that you really need to do and you say you fuck off and you don't do them and you get laid you can hate your yeah it's gonna be a part of you that knows you didn't do the shit you were supposed to do and if you fuck off and you get too lazy and don't accomplish things you're not gonna enjoy the rest as much as you do when you do accomplish things like you talk about it like you get home from class you work all day teach class you get home and you watch Netflix it's a joy I love I'm almost done with Breaking Bad tell me dude you gotta see it you haven't seen it dude you got it's the greatest show on TV bro I gotta hear that a hundred times I'm like cool I want it to be true I just need to hear it cuz I can't get into I watched one Breaking Bad you got it go back go back I watched the first one to the pilot to mommy neither but people kept saying you got to give it time time yeah the characters it's a great show I watched the whole first season ones getting my right arm done ones getting my right arm tattooed I've watched it all on iPad that's the best is it getting tattooed while you're watching a good show because you don't even notice it it's annoying thing on my arm I look good it shits the bed for one season them the tightest right now and I want to tell you when there's a part in time I was like these motherfuckers I'd rather leave this show and then they fired everybody and they hired all the new writers and they just reach back brought it back from the dead hit a rough where a lot of our coasts what they recognized - of course no I haven't seen our coats gonna be hard to watch no seriously you have no greatest I'm in the middle of this fucking president show though I'm in the middle of okay I'll jump on that dude I'm too episode one and a half actually I watched it on the plane an American Airlines they had a little screen thing in front of you they had Netflix on TV till it brought it in HBO and the Internet uncensored that's what that's what made it back even when like you're watching those shows like breaking bad it's cable they can say things you can never say on network and you can - I can't say everything but they can get close like Walking Dead they get close there way they could get away with way more but they still have commercials like the commercials fuck everything up together you got to watch it on Netflix or on on Apple TV I subscribe to us on Holi the best I need a new show man house of cards one episode 10 minutes into the first episode I was like oh yeah it's good I gave up on the last man on earth man it sucks I got like a season and a half I'm like fuck I can't do it I heard started off really good yeah you know the performance the head guy he's fucking brilliant so far so good but he's so good at annoying you you hate that character so much that and then you end up hating the show because you hate him so much Wow Tim and Eric stop he is oh shit you know what else is really good the new Bob and Dave show like the guys who did mr. show with Bob and David yeah yeah Bob Odenkirk and David Cross yeah the new one is fucking hilarious it's really good I watched one episode of that that's another Netflix I was balls-deep in the wire for a while did you watch the wire I watched one episode I never got into it why I know it's supposed to be awesome I think I went into second episode but it was years ago everybody that keeps saying they need to Jamie's nodding I know I know I need to but I need to watch all these goddamn documentaries - everybody's always my favorite thing people tweet me a good documentary get overwhelmed well I'll just stay here for the fucking cavalcade of chemtrail documentaries your phone right now let me ask you this heavyweight what where do you put Allister over him now he just knocked the fuck out Junior knows to guy not only that he's the first guy to ever fight Junior and not take any damage who does zero damn who those fuck else has ever fought Junior dos Santos and not taking any damage you had great footwork dude very smart how much each other was drunk but you know what's not stated I'm in no agent smart what cuz me started opening up in that second round people were booing but you try fighting a knockout artist yeah with the smallest margin of error you make you turn you dodge left and set right the nights over yeah so when I see that like I get it they're just trying to get a vibe here and people are born on my you know just fucking wait for and not only that but Junior is like taking his time too and he's just disrespect him he's balled up looking to uncork bombs it's respect yeah when juniors throwing those punch of them face they're whizzing by watters they all have definite there's no feeling it out with those know so I respect that first round and then the second round I mean that left hook was from Duncan he opened up a bunch of shit in that second round first of all we started off selling start off Orthodox he started killing that front leg he hit him with some zippers he's a free agent he's a free toaster is yes that's big and then that body shot oh my god he kept hitting him he was switching stances real good and it was constantly moving and he was saying he said to me after the fight first thing he says that wim hof breathing stuff works like we were talking about it before I did the interview with him and he goes that wim hof stuff works dope he wants to do the podcast we gotta I gotta get on the park yeah well yeah that'd be great you want to talk about a guy has been stopped a lot as far as he's gotten if you go back and watch kickboxing and then Strikeforce or nut Strikeforce he didn't get stopped any ones but he died he got stopped in Pride I mean you look at the stoppage losses that he got in k1 and in Pride and Strikeforce he was the champ he never lost in Strikeforce I believe he beat for Duman Strikeforce he fucked Brett Rogers hooked up that was when those uber uber eat oh my god was a totally different and looking through Brett Rogers to the ground oh my god he kicked Brett Rogers in the beginning of the first round with a with a right leg kick well you see the look on Brett riders face he was just realizes oh shit it was just a completely different level of striker that he'd ever faced because he had beaten Orlovsky but he caught arlovski like nervous and tentative are laughs you standing in front of them and it was scared Arlovski yeah Arlovski had this period of time where he was in a rut before he went with Josh yeah I'm straining with Freddie Roach he just was he was in a rut he was in Chicago he wasn't training with Jackson and Winkeljohn down in Albuquerque and then they took him on and he even had a big loss when they took him on kharitonov Sergei Kharitonov tough fight especially had time when he fought him Thomas was on fire Carroll for the team I'd like to point out that was branded Chavez I don't know I think he fought in glory right yeah I don't know what he's doing these days she did some kickboxing for a while I think he had a back injury to that set him back a bit I don't know what he's doing these days here in yellow book page how about faders opponent just gets announced like a day ago the worst marketable when did that get announced he's irrelevant now I don't give a fighting that kickboxing the Indian kickboxing guy people thought was a joke when they announced it don't know there's no way nah man no one available there's no one available it's silly bloody if they made the Overeem vs. phaidor fight Sergei Kharitonov I'm currently negotiating with UFC Bellator and glory posted a OH today thicker than a Snickers sausages he looks scary as fuck well he's dangerous he's a motherfucker Barnett fucked him up though yeh did Burnett fuck Burnett gone down yeah but you know when I remember man I remember him holding Semmy Schilt down and and hammer fisting him in his eyeball me that shit shoulder screaming his hammer fisting in st. the same time and he's like mounting him he's like mounting him high on the chest semi wasn't like the best grandpa in the world he was just nasty kickbox great kid gets great risk control look it up dudes that would mount him and he would just hold there he was you know strike off his back Pete Williams had him in the mount was he couldn't do shit to him and he survived the round ended next round throw some front before front kills the body right to the body boom and we thought oh it's because he's seven foot tall no nobody and you know with the with normal legs can get away with shit like that it's crazy how that's taken off like that the earliest ever kick that you learn in traditional martial arts is like one of the most recent kicks that people are successful with that's crazy no one was there was a video just a few years ago view and I am I garage you're asking me about front kicks my thought was like man you got a fix to the John Anderson Silva dude was downloaded that data that slow motion of Vito's head snapping back from that front kick and his legs buckling and him going down Anderson beating on him ever since oh yeah who's Anderson because Vitor doesn't want to find him he's not gonna find a veto I won't fight him and Rockhold's calling out Vitor which is very fascinating because what do you do there here's a good question I can have a rematch with Weidman or do you have him fight you well before ul turns 50 no yo-yo was 63 years old have to be like now like tomorrow no bullshit he's 38 like at what point in time I mean if he's clean he didn't do enough for me to earn that title shot yeah I think I think Wyman Rockhold 2 is the fight 100% that's the fucking fight because if Wyman until that terrible spinning heel kick here where the fuck that was you don't know that we have different fighter hands yeah people give me a hard time about the difference between saying turning side kick and spinning back-kick you're totally right I say spinning back-kick because that's what everybody calls it but the real spinning back is like a donkey kick because that heal up I always call a stirring sidekick a spinning back-kick or sometimes people throw it like a spinning side kick but the difference in people also give me a hard time about the wheel kick spinning hook kick like I had a conversation with this dude about it online but that's the same kick the difference you know hook kick in a wheel kick is like the definition a long left hook and a short left hook it's the same kick you're spinning you're using the heel but there's two different types of wheel kicks there's a wheel kick that's like with the leg is bent and then there's a stiff leg wheel kick which simples do it missed right no he landed it on heart come but he kind of calf dumb well not not you tried it against over in the female oh yes yeah but the stiff leg wheel kick is very rare you have to have a sucker like you have to guy of a guy who's like really standing in front of you but it's so powerful just like you seen me throw a stick like one on the back and they but they happen stiff like ones rare it's a I said he throws the wheel kick it's a bad leg that's a wheel here's what happens it's bent up until like the point of contact and then it sort of snaps out it with a stiff leg one like you see me through it on a bag your leg becomes stiff way earlier it's way earlier your leg gets stiff like halfway and again this is like this is a big time technicalities they're basically the same kick but the back kick and the turning sidekick they are different like Chuck Liddell throws the back kick he would throw it like he's like thrown and I'm bags but shows people like holding the pad for it and he'll throw it and so he throws it like donkey kick style yeah he lives up and toes her down this the way barbozza throws it he throws it spinning side kick or turning side kick where the foot is flat and the heel and toes are parallel to the floor nasty it's nasty to answer the question about over him though you could make a good argument that he deserves the title shot he's won four hours last five he's marketable as fuck but Ben Rothwell knocked him out just a couple fights ago and he's unbeaten too little bit but Ben Roethlisberger yes he fights Barnet and maybe the winner of that huh fight then they decide because Barnett verses about brothels in New Jersey in January right what about steep a Orlovsky it's a very good point what do you do with Arlovski ones that fight well steep a went to war with jr. right it fought five hard rounds last war lost of real close fight but got dropped and legitimately lost he's right the head of jr. now by the way o loskis ego so it goes Kane won right for Doom champ Keynes won or lost keys to steep e ste pays three forget him Forrest that doesn't make any sense to me I think of jr. beat'em jr. should be ahead of them even if jr. just got knocked out Alistair how stirs right behind jr. and okay that's insane that's insane that those ratings are fuckin bananas isn't it funny here's even worse than this when Conor McGregor knocked out Aldo there's a Brazilian judge or writer or whatever the fuck journalist whoever gets to vote on these things that voted Connor down four spaces on the pound-for-pound it was like his things are a joke but that makes that guy he is no longer credible you cannot have that guy's grace it's gotta be enough if you go back it has over him under its current this is current even though he just knocked out Joe Santos he still ranked below him and Holly Holm is Rhonda yeah Eddie do you understand this they have like some goofy system of how they do this thing and there's a bunch of dummies out there that somehow another thing Ronda should be ranked above Holly after Holly knocked her out because Ron is beating so many people he's the same insanity these same silly hoes wait for us to do these podcasts and so they can start us yeah well this is this is clearly the most nutty thing ever if you look at the heavyweight division Jamie scroll down for the heavyweight division please who do you got on the ring man hold on let's go over this real quick look at this Cain Velasquez make sense of course he was the champion he lost it for bricio he's beating everybody else right that makes sense a champ Arlovski he's done really well but number two boy that's a tough sell there's a tough sell when you the difference between the guys he's beaten and then you look at the guys that Alistair is beaten if you look at Alistair just beating jr. I think you gotta put him right up mr. Lawson Thomas Brown or last you beat Travis that's true that's a good point that's a good point Jr beat yeah okay it's fucking it's tough because jr. like in our laughs key never fought so you know that would be a great fight that's the fight that's gonna happen if Andre loses if Andre loses hundred percent boy who knows what's gonna happen 1 jr. now though when jr. get killed like that you got to take some time he's never been the same to me after the cane fights he's just not too much it took too much honestly I look at the fight with her laughs can you that's a super close fight that was so close that was anybody's fight anybody could have won that people say job one but and then those people I mean everyone and then our laughs Keys last fight against Frank Mir that was another knocked out remember he not after me knocked up Brown he knocked out a big foot which was be Frank Mir Travis brown slight and steep it we didn't knock out Frank Mir him and Frank Mir had all that's right really boring so that's two fights that he had that we're like really like slow to pull the trigger not much happens Travis just went after him and he went after Travis and I think a lot of that might have been familiarity because both those guys knew each other really well from the gym from training together and the word was that Arlovski would get the better of Travis and sparring when there's nothing on the line it's all just skills right when you're just in the the the the cage you're training together there's no pressure there's no media there's no nothing they need to see skills Arlovski has some vicious fucking striking skills like if you go back to just skills you go back to his early fights and you watch his knockouts when he was the UFC heavyweight champion funny dude dude his right hand was a piston well there was no fat to it he would just uncork that motherfucker on dudes and just slowly whoa Wow I think the reason a why my fighter Lasky's was so boring is we trained a lot together too and they were I mean you it was a if judges are scoring it was the same fight it was very like super close right so we knew each other so we're both so nervous when we fought because it's when you're going anyway anything can happen ah it's gonna be tough yeah yeah and Arlovski knowing that he had that advantage over Travis Brown from training looked real confident in that fight too he looked real relaxed in that fight what a fucking crazy slugfest that was who the Travis Browne arlovski fight might have been one of the greatest first rounds or one rounders ever in the history the heavyweight division I agree especially the rank and now you got brown first Mitrione that's a motherfucker for a fight Travis Brown's fightin Mitrione Boston Sun on TJ and your boy Cruz's card whoa that's brace yourself that's a good advice a lot of people are overlooking that it's great but I feel like make sure I was fighting so many else that's a great fight oh that's a stand-up war you know what else is a great fight that's happening in in New Jersey Roy Nelson and no I'm sorry Josh Barnett and Big Ben Rothwell it's a great fight that's a great fun a veteran whoo that's especially after Josh Barnett looks so good against Roy he looked fantastic it was amazing five we got taking down a bunch so what nothing happen you know yet Roy versa Jared Rosholt yeah that's a good fight - it's not really a blockbuster I'm just sure it's got a you know he's got a - P's and Q's against Roy yeah it's gonna be like Rob he's gonna be in front of Roy he's been knocked up before yeah and he's gonna be in front of Roy you know he's not gonna be out sir / aiming it way over him fought Roy he got knocked down to remember that he's a very good wrestler and they could put he might we might see Willie Nelson on his back a lot you're right you're right we might and it's his game plan understand yeah it's really he's a high-level wrestling right there that's yeah that fights not gonna break any records for our style points I can promise you that unless Roy just knocks him to fuckin next week did you see that fucking new dude and you know the French guy that DJ from Street Fighter he looks like you body up so dude that guy is fucking big he got on the scale and for all I could look at it as the size of his feet this guy's got canoes he's got canoes under he's fucking it's turn two but he got taken down off of a kick but the dude who took him down couldn't do anything with him and then he got back up and just boxed him up man nask him home in that DJ is it DJ Louis the beast him and DJ is like some black on black crime oh the boxer no no boys you know the the Lewis who knocked out it was like in his chest and then caught matryona Mitchell's like huh yeah Derrick Lewis oh my god black on black crime yeah but this dude is anga know is a nasty strike boy he's bodied up he's also really good man his striking is fucking strong I really enjoyed watching his striking I was like ooh this guy with a few fights on his bowels his ground game well he had good defense he's French he got taken down you're right he got taken down and he got control on the ground but not much happened to him there and once he got up good lord he hit that dude with a left uppercut that just shot the lights out no it came right through the arms - right through the guard like right up the middle there's a better uppercut over the weekend not to change subjects but you see Ortiz were strandings and the heavyweight bout yes I did Jennings has never been knocked down Ortiz's the uppercut was fucking filthy yeah he's nasty man he's a 36 year old Cuban no one wants to fight southpaw mm-hmm everyone's like what the fuck and they couldn't believe James took the fight cuz he's over like 350 amateur fights well Jennings was he fought Klitschko to a decision yeah and had a real good fight with him and you know he's got to take that fight because this is a this is a fight that if he beats us to it it sends and it sets him right back up the only thing is they're saying with Ortiz like no one really knows of me super dangerous southpaw 350 amateur fights just this monster in Cuba this is the technique oh so clean he is fucking nasty so good he's older so it's time to get going yeah well that's what I feel about you over Mero but yo Romero is there a guy alive built better than that man I mean if mr. universe was real I agree like if it wasn't some freak who just shoots D ball into his dick hole until his fucking neck explodes it was actually like what's like the best looking body for an athlete it's Yoel Romero or Woodley woodleigh's right up he's right there he's right there Oh yo Romero's weirder though he's weirder cuz Woodley almost makes sense it's all like it seems like a fortune yeah he's like really well-built but it all makes sense there looks like a super like it real no first of all he's got all this extra neck and shoulder my second ninja turtle it's all like built up like a shell yeah like a ninja and his waist is like that's home and it's his abs are just retarded you know this only makes sense and oh yeah it's like if you saw him in a comic book you'd be like why don't they make more realistic representations of man you're fucking with our body images you're ruining meds are so racist looks like those actions he looks just like a tree house a racist I don't think it's the tiger shot the fight was - boy they should make them fight he fought sick apparently he had the flu so they're saying they're saying he was sick well right up until Rockhold's foot was about to fall off and he still did where he had staff yes horrible staff know anyone my stoppage yes so the rematch if you're the if you are from jojoba well you're either one whoever makes the call I gotta be connected calls okay if you have your Scrooge what do you think Weidman Rockhold - I could see that easy that's not easy everything else doesn't make sense and is in a big fight the only thing I would like to see you Oh Romero fight for the title because of his age I feel like with your so good he's so good and he's doesn't have much time left at that level when you're that level and also he relies on speed and athleticism you're not talking about a Bernard Hopkins that's like this super crafty technician is once that stops yeah Bernard like he's the perfect example the different Sheen Bernard and like like say Roy Jones jr. like Roy Jones jr. was athleticism and speed and all this crazy power and technique but he wasn't like the classically trained boxer like Bernard was so he beat Bernard early in his career but then when they fought late in the career Bernard was older than him by several years and and Bernard beat him and Bernard just outbox them just fought with better technique when Roy speed and power was all gone and his chin wasn't the same did you see him just get knocked out last week for threats bought again do abed how not what in Russia do we have a video there's like 18 people my god oh no no there's a popular writer how old is he he fought a cruiserweight contender that's the problem oh that she won 95 for the 195 he was the champion he's a champion at 175 and then of course he went up to heavyweight he fought John Ruiz won the heavyweight title but see wasn't that 20 years ago a long time ago he's holding 46 year old Roy Jones jr. knocked out in first bout as a Russian citizen that's so rough they have a throw Russian citizen their note the red white and blue theme of Bloody Elbow calm it's like they're like fucking it's like this that statement along with their colour layout it's just coincidental but it's almost like fuck you you fucking traitor yeah it's a bummer to seem get knocked down what if they paid oh oh they knocked down no no they you don't think it's not a legend they would never know he doesn't need money well no it was a good fight up until he got he got tagged dude I mean it's real ah you won't see it I would love to find find the visit now find the air that fucks him well I first got drop with an uppercut around he fought a real good guy he fought a legit contender in the cruiserweight division and fighting a cruiserweight is like you know here it is that Duty fought is fucking good and the guy's long and it was a good fighter for a while but like look at Roy's body like what happened he's 46 second time happy I know but look Bernard Hopkins is 49 and he doesn't have as wide away sis ro does that doesn't look like a man who's in shape wow he just doesn't look in good shape looks like an HBO commentator trying to fight a fucking monster means still very smart but this is this is not look good to me like I'm not it doesn't look like he's in the best shape like being 49 doesn't keep him from losing body fat at 46 it doesn't help it doesn't help but how come Bernard looks so much good I'm just Riddick they're just a girder you did I'll take it look better but I wasn't the wrong so Bernard genetically is a freak that nasty left hook to the body that dude just threw mean why don't even a dude's name so yes he gets not look at the crowd like Nam good man and homeboys like nah who remembers Kevin McBride you remember Kevin McBride I don't he's the guy retired Mike Tyson nobody remembers God dang yeah we don't want to remember him well it's rough I mean he's Tyson quit on stool against this guy yeah so Roy's still trying to same old tricks like with that leaping left hook he's just something here comes here comes the uppercut dude get some in the corner here what you do how dare you Oh Oh see now watch when he gets the crowd he still has been you go you gotta love it Liam he's like this dude it's all good I don't think you look in the crowd I think he's like scene 30 stuck his tongue like it's all good baby yeah stuck his tongue out to the crowd these stick his tongue out or is he trying to put his mouthpiece back in no watch he smiling like he's smiling oh yeah you're right stuck his tongue out yeah he might have been like moving his jaw to him I felt like this way he's talking the ref he said I'm fine who's looking but look at this yeah this dude it's behind the air that fuck yeah Bing Bing Bing look how he mixes his combinations - all right and here's the right hand oh it's so hard to watch it's a bummer man it's hard to watch him get felled like that it's like what you can't get beat up and then the guy does the cross thing to make sure he doesn't die and he's like groaning and moving around while he's on his back just like that I don't like looking at his legs like look at his legs those are like soft mushy legs you know I'm saying like but I think of a guy like Roy Jones jr. I think of like Sen Yuen Li sinewy fast twitch muscle fiber I think of a guy in shape I'm looking at his legs and I'm like that's a guy who's not in shape like his boxer although look at the definition like it's all missing like look at his body but a lot of boxer that like George Foreman George Foreman when he fought Muhammad Li was fucking jacked right when he got super fat the difference is George Foreman was a heavyweight and a heavyweight who gets fat is not giving up any weight you know I mean George still losing muscle three husbands yeah but he was enormous even when he was fat they get enormous muscles big bully what I'm looking at here is like a guy looks like he's out of shape he just doesn't look at all like he's in shape he looks like he's an analyst for HBO that jumped in there with a killer it's just exactly what's going on you know what did it look at this fucking uppercut looking this the look in this guy's face - he's looking at murder look at this Oh oh my god that right hand that put him away is terrifying show that one more time god damn the way that looks at slow-motion look at this look at him just a killer just uncorks the perfect right hand the side of the Roy's head and watches him drop it's same story that plays itself out time and time and time again that's fighters though right the ground the shield man most guys I mean that they become don't become fighters because they don't enjoy this you know but it's just so weird to watch it's so weird to watch it happen to Roy for whatever reason like here do me a favor and put on Roy Jones jr. versus Virgil Hill let's go back to the prime go back to when he was the light heavyweight champion and he iced Virgil Hill was like yeah Roy Jones highlight reel that's even better they had a song dude this I mean who the fuck was like this guy the best of all time to me I love them he's my favorite my favorite to watch for sure right up there you know the only other guy that was one of my favorites to watch but for a different reason well Roberto Duran for sure but also look at his speed but um look at his body son look at him dancing robot he was a man hunt got lucky but he also had a weird body work he had like giant bicep muscles like his biceps were giant like Jesus Christ look at that left hook he was just so fast but he relied on this look at that come on son fast and powerful but what that goes away look at the bite look at his body oh look at his body here and compare it to the body of the dude that we just watched get knocked out I mean this is a fucking look at his body there yeah he was 46 bro I don't know I understand no I mean I'm not saying that you know here's some sort of working problem I'm not saying as a workout thick problem or anything I found is saying it's just so fucked up this is no way he could train the same no 46 fini pans they had around where Vinnie didn't land not one punch he was the only time ever in compacts history that the opponent didn't land a punch at all dude he was insane he would punch you and just be nowhere near you when you wanted to punch him back he was just on another level speed and and like reflex wise a completely different level than anybody everybody is that white boy doing it's just so sad to see this guy become the guy that we just watched cuz I mean he was oh that's what happened no right Joe if you keep fighting this happens to everyone man I just who doesn't it happen to I don't understand why especially near famous that's him you can fight whenever you want this is like when nobody knew who he was dude he was insane he was so I was there for that fight I was there alive for this really yeah I forget to do his name he's like this light-skinned black dude I saw that dude fight somewhere else too I saw that guy fight live in Mount Vernon New York ordered Malvern our Whitehill White Plains rather one of these local boxing events I saw him fight I was like wow this guy's good and then I remember years later Roldan oh yeah maybe bottom he fought one Roldan wow I can't remember that I thought I know didn't haggle or fight him got one role Dan he's one of those names like Mustapha Homme show you gotta go oh you know what maybe it was maybe it was you say Marvin Hagler yeah I might be remembering Inc it was I think it was but I I'm not I don't remember either I feel like one Roldan was from a different era Siwan Roldan fought uh Marvin Hagler looking Marvin Hagler's record such a monster man one myself I thought he fought Roy Jones but I could be wrong you might be right though I think early as in Roy Jones career come on oh that was way out oh it's no Marvin Hagler yeah I think that was quite a few years earlier now check Roy Jones Jones jr. yeah Ron Roldan no it just keeps showing Ron Roldan vs. Hagler and her and some different fights he fought Hearns too huh Thomas Hearns vs. Hwan roll down I enrolled dan was a tough motherfucker so was Mustafa Homs show there's a lot of tough guys boxing's good right now man it's great right now accidents phenomena I saw this saw was the name Walters Walters versus Sousa bullshit decision though oh yeah that was bullshit Ortiz oh my god yeah I mean boxing stuff that that was a bad decision it was really bad I was I was watching I was like this doesn't even make sense how the fuck did that happen even Max Kellerman was like what the fuck are we doing where do you fit watching anime in your in your schedule like where does it go how do you guys retain all this you must be watching these fights at least twice right depends on what the fights like obviously I do it for a living yes so you so the u.s. I watched the I watched the cowboy dos Anjos fight three times okay yeah I just wanted to watch it again because I'm just so impressed I'm sorry he's just such a destroyer like the way he unquote like the combination then he threw when he had cowboy hurt up against the stage nasty and tight like not know wild stupid shit it was just controlled aggression just super so super aggressive super fast those guys you see get home while boxing to watch this last night it's a fight man yeah I recorded everything I watch a lot of fights yeah kickboxing I'm deep in that's my favorite shit my favorite is glory that's my favorite shit to watch rock sounds my favorite right now really more than a MMA is 100 percent number one Oakland other shit what I should have clarified that other shit glory is my favorite and woxing okay Rico Verhoeven do you see his last fight yes to the monster Lord he's a motherfucker he's a motherfucker dude and for guys like like stand up like only watching like look get mad when UFC fights go to the ground you watch glory let's watch that man those fucking fights are behind partners they are good to me there's just so many matches to make in box there's so much good shit yeah about tans Crawford why is that dude yeah good lord Nathan god damn that dudes good oh really good he said good adjuster - he justs in fights and switches stances really well from Orthodox to southpaw you see his last fight yeah soon as he realized he switched southpaw and caught that dude with a right hook it's like oh we're gonna be fighting like this from now on sir yeah man this beat the fuck out of Brad yeah close fight in the beginning of the first round until he found the rhythm and then figured it out I said I'll just switch stances up on this dais thought he was gonna get a mega fight next against Floyd or something they're all scared nobody wants that no one wants to fuck that nobody knows who he is outside of Nebraska everybody in the Brassica knows he is a lot of hardcore boxing fans know who he is but like the average Joe on the street the average person you know Boyd may where there is no Pacquiao is that's the next fight I guarantee again I guarantee you I'm gonna make a prediction this is my prediction in April they're gonna fight again I saw pictures of Manny Pacquiao shrimp back to training again Manny Pacquiao on his Instagram page today is hitting pads so he had a shoulder surgery they probably shot him up with the same shit they shot me up with he probably healed 50% quick room they fucking stem-cell I know a lot of dudes are doing that now ever since I got my stem-cell shots and I started talking about it swear by it a bunch of other people started talking to me about stem cells - yeah look at Manny Pacquiao shoulder surgery a few months ago he's full blast dad's full blast power punching on pads now man come on that's you're supposed to wait like a year probably juiced fake photo they probably whack this ain't the UFC bitch say no drugs Destin so not in between that's one of the beautiful things about these guys - in between camp like they get injured that's what steroids are for boom what's what they're for they're supposed to get you back out there quicker dude for a football player or any sort of an athlete in another sport that doesn't get tested outside of seasons you're supposed to do steroids they make you look at he's back go tiny be nice guard OT they think you little baby so I can put my head on that they're gonna put Eddie Bravo hedaan that tonight hey when you had that goatee good luck honey dick in the fans and uh Floyd - it's gonna happen there's my nowhere nowhere I made me wrong I'm wrong about a lot of shit but here's my prediction they're gonna open up that new arena in April the new arena in Vegas okay yeah and in April thinking uh they're gonna have Floyd Mayweather Manny Pacquiao dos a lot shit I like it I think I'll like if I think of it I think Floyd Mayweather starts talking it's right now that means December I think you start talking somewhere around January the end of genui quit his darts start saying you know what I'm thinking about coming back and then he honeydicked Terence Crawford and Canelo Alvarez and everybody else hunting dick suckers Canelo Alvarez a little coud he little good against Miguel Cotto you look good you look good he thought he look real good Koto's a motherfucker dude he's a craps older he's older he's still very good yeah I think I think and then Manny Pacquiao you know they start going over the fact that he got the shoulder surgery and they show him hitting the pants they get everybody to believe again he starts talking about Jesus the first time he was injured on that guy yeah on that guy they can get me I watched one countdown show I'm in take my hundred dollars you know what I like I like the ones with Max Kellerman when they sit him across the table and they make him talk to each other face off those are my favorite and Max Kellerman says like he said that you are this like he said you have no chin how do you respond to that yeah and it's usually some dude speaking Spanish like AC Slater with the chair backwards stare at each other it's sick those are great I love those those are fun man the UFC needs to do something like that phoof well that's the thing we're talking about like Nate Diaz and Conor I think Eddie's got the best idea got it right no reason glass with a phone or Thracian gentlemen Joey Hostin no you got put the three giant dudes in between them might still sucker punch him it's gonna hype to fight up even more okay Joe why are you against this yeah but why are you against it what do you like do animals I kind of like your prison glass breaking the fucking phone and shit I have to have a tech like us bunch of them maybe a bunch of booze yeah yeah the Joe Silva told Nate Diaz the Conor McGregor is next or do you think that Nate Diaz is being real smart and talking some shit and getting people like Joseph was a smart guy he knows damn well I don't have the power to make that fight ha that's not the fight Yeah right Dana protects him did you tell him that Joker no I didn't sir well but ninja versus ninja Diaz says UFC match yeah that's what we just said yeah I just don't I don't see him doing that I think Nate's being smart I think he's talking to you I think it's great I think he's talking shit you know not talking shit that should Oh Frankie Edgar he should he did he said that he said if you're scared get a dog yeah I saw that you gotta be relentless though you know I'm saying I know I guess it's not his style honestly he's fighting should speak for itself but that's not good that's not the game plan now I feel like there's only one fight to make it for either wait there's only one fight it's 100% Frankie Edgar hundred-percent I couldn't couldn't be more in Phatak about that but fucking as a fan that's what I'm saying as a fan I don't mind this fucking Nate Diaz fight I know I'd and I love Frankie I want Frankie to get that you know Frank if you're the king what do you do if I'm screwed up Dana like all the fucking calls well but no I'm Dana I'm not no I mean I don't even mean I don't even mean you're not even Dana cuz Dana has talked to Lorenzo okay what if you are you're just the king you're the king what's the call are we in trouble here but if I'm trying to get if I'm trying to sell the fight I want as much money possible it's Diaz Conor on a world tour but if I'm a good man and I have morals I make Frankie Edgar Connor and then the winner that fights Josie well when Josie gets healthy here's the question though can they tell Connor who to fight now or is Connor so meteoric he's he's soul out of control is he so off the charts what if Connor says I want to be a promoter what if Connor says he wants to go money team he wants a co promote and do like he has all the power he almost does he does does he 80,000 Dublin what oh he could sell that out in about a minute literally a minute a minute yeah sounds like Ron is nobody was gonna write a card information and then at the stroke of midnight 11:59 they're all gonna press Enter the same time well um the Guru's gonna overload all the servers gonna crash I for reals I'm terrified to fly cuz Isis I'm fucking I'm they're buying it front row fucking what I'll do you'd be my guess you'd have to come it'd be amazing it would be amazing if they go we want to fight dos Santos he goes no I'm good notorious promotion the wonder he's gonna he's gonna have his own fight notorious notorious yeah look man I don't know he came for the sport he wants here's what's crazy it's almost like he can't get any bigger so what happens now does he just go veces you go parallel does he just keep staying fuckin Satan of Hollywood don't come here I want to do final fucking Furious Fast 9 come here let's fuck your career he's gonna ruin we're gonna put you in fucking transformers 13 next thing you know he's dating black chicks big juicy asses and a lot of jewelry that sounds awesome that sounds ideal and he's driving a Mustang off the top of a building hopefully thrown is it is there tone that's fun it's a fun time it's fun time to be an MMA fan that's for sure especially for you Conor McGregor if I'm Scrooge McDuck I'm the king of the world yes I make the Frank yet your fighter at least I make an attempt to I don't know how much influence they have over them but what I would say is I would say honestly your future probably is 155 pounds you struggle to make 145 but you legacy will be complete if you beat Frank okay what if Connor goes I 145 too tough for me I have invited van in abandoned 145 pound title and move up and fight who Josie Aldo meets Frank Jager in a rematch okay for the title I like that and Frankie or and then Nate Diaz then you have Nate Diaz versus Connor its first fight a 55 if he gets past Nate Diaz you 100 percent haven't fight dosanjh correct dos Anjos fights have even member gomad off in the meantime you know it why not he hasn't fought for every has been injured that's true that's true if anything Tony Ferguson exactly don't forget about Tony Ferguson dos Anjos that Rome motherfuckers right especially yeah that's true that's true it's already there he made it look at that name say just casual just on TV with the titties get on TV yeah that's my message boards filled with barbarians really they're animals in a good way yeah say okay so Tony Ferguson you have fight dos Anjos snacks totally agree with that yeah great fight great man like for the money though the real big money fight for dos Anjos is obviously Conor but outside of Connor who's a big money fight Habib we don't even know when Habib's gonna be back right you can't say you have to give you have to give Habib a fight against the top guy before he gets a title shot sending us to fight again okay so if so who do you give them Tony Ferguson cuz they're supposed to fight right who's Pettis fighting again Pettis is fighting someone ready Alvarez yes that's on the Fox car you know the FX FS one in Boston correct Wow Ben Saunders Patrick Cote ATS I'll be there mmm I was gonna be in Boston yeah awful Boston yeah I get there on that's a motherfucker that's a weird weekend for me I'm not there for the Wayans I've got um Atlanta a Theatre in Atlanta I'm in the theater in Tampa and then I fly into Boston you know another fight that could sell like hotcakes at 55 Connor and pedis Pettis gets by Alvarez boy that's uh that's another blockbuster there's so many blocks of ice that's a good fight that's a good fight for Pettis versus uh Connor is a good fight as far as like styles and on paper and stuff I think that's a really good fight but man it's a tough sell after Norma camed off or after dos anjos rather beat up Pettis like Pettis has got to get a victory under his belt in order to I'm sorry like let's say it's a headkick ko that's like oh shit yeah if he beats him like like you beat Lausanne yeah or cowboy in Japan yeah I mean look Pettis when he loses usually comes back a way better fighter and that's what happened when he fought Clay Guida Clay Guida stuffed him shut him down he came back away better Pettis well my favorite fighters to watch ever he's fuckin ridiculous why did they separate the prelims in the main card of it's on the same Channel I'm just so that people can time it so that it's like there's two different blocks of shows okay so instead of having a six-hour block of fights they have two three-hour blocks mmm in this case it seems like less than that seems like two hours cuz it's only for fights and for fights first of all your Felder bursts crush all crankshaw at the franc shop it's
