back up ladies and gentlemen powerful Franky the answer edgar hanky who's got more heart than this motherfucker how about nobody ever I mean you might have as much hard as him but that's all that's available as a human that's all the developers no room for anything else you get to the top if you get to the top you got Frankie Edgar Hart yeah but you don't ever get to more than Frankie Edgar Hart that level doesn't exist on the game but you write a favor man you write favors got some fucking mad heart - dude that Aldo fight that guy took bombs from Aldo leg kick after leg kick after leg kick boom boom boom made it five rounds after it's over his leg swells up like more than twice the size the other leg he took all these with Twitter photos it was terrifying man favors a gamer to everybody who trains with him says he's better in the in the cage than he is in training he's getting painted he's gay nice fuck he's an animal man you're right favours an animal but I was so impressed with Frankie a guy's cub later I was like Jesus Christ he's so relentless mmm I mean he would not stop just wouldn't stop and you can see cub there was a certain point in the fight where he was just like fuck like what is this guy made out of he just doesn't get tired doesn't get tired cardio for days nobody works harder and unstoppable heart yeah you watch those Gray Maynard fights did he get hit with bombs best fights ever oh my god the two first rounds of the two second fights yeah the first fight was a loss you know so it was like he lost a decision but that was like early early back in the day but the second two fights man were just fucking wars they were so crazy right that's what they fought three times right yeah mania never been the same right after those no now he's well he's definitely taking some serious punishment he got stopped in his last fight right yes who stopped him uh who do you mean your fight I'll pull it up this is a smart move by the UFC cuz Frankie was just kind of chillin sitting on the shelf until Aldo McGregor now he's got a fight to keep him fresh mm-hmm good move well it's good too because it's not even in the weight class that he normally competes yeah so it's kind of matter what happens he still has that fight available mm-hmm well they offered him a fight against each and he's like nope not happening dude who says he's open for it though is he yeah but he didn't take it that's a tougher matchup because he's not faster than TJ for sure I wasn't open to it if he didn't take it he did an interview saying he's not shutting the door on it like he's open to it after this but he said Oh after this yeah but he said no to a title fight at the time yeah but I guess he said he's open to it that's what I read an interview on happen I wonder what happened changed so Alexander yak of you is the the guy that be stopped him stopped him in his last fight that's tough to watch Ross Pearson stopped him before that Oh actually it looks like his decision Yaakov Yaakov you was a decision Ross Pearson stopped him sorry oh that I was in second round Nate Diaz stopped during the first time the Nate Diaz one was bad as a nasty Jane I had one at the cage yeah the TJ grant one was bad elbow yeah so he lost badly twice in a row tjk Odom in the first round Nate K Odom in the first round then Ross Pearson tailed him in the second round so three ferocious knockout losses in a row degree Maynard it's tough to see right and then he lot yeah it's right he's a nice guy - I really like gray and then the last fight he lost by decision to God that you know he never heard of before and he's I mean not that the guy wasn't a good fighter I'm sure but me you think about he was fighting for the title fought for the title twice went to a draw with Frankie and they had a incredible incredible fight but then the battery got drained man lights go black Frankie Edgar's about to step out oh shit here we go biggie boom boom bump here he comes charging run fucking ready his coach behind a man Mark Henry is a fucking ridiculous coach so good huh dude lit it's tough to hear but you can hear him yelling out they switch up their signals every time they have a whole language for each camp front combinations you'll see I'll nervous the coaches and he's sweating profusely because he's yelling out combos and Frankie listens like a fucking video game it's insane wow that's cool four wins by knockout for bus admission three fight win streak me BJ Penn three times jesus fucking christ did he be BJ Penn three times how crazy is that and the last one was just a demolition the last one was hard to watch remember his fights with the Hendo yeah those were good too man they were great yeah and he's so under size compared to Henderson I mean Benson's a big 155 or in Frankie makes 145 pretty easy I like Benson at 170 man he looked great against - I agree I love how he's willing to fight other people he's like you know I'll fight anybody was trying to fight tyron woodley was calling what are you gonna fight - great fight will he's trying to get that Johnny Hendrix fight mm-hmm yeah it's very interesting that very interesting Hendo doesn't have a fight right I don't think he's gonna sign right now whenever say you say Hendo though I think Dan lot up confuse the shit out of me Sun Bay we go number two and number three will 3 at bantamweight Uriah number two at featherweight Frankie the motherfucking answer Edgar reaches about the same and the same height yep super fucking else's but virtually identical it's crazy that he's 36 cuz to me I was 36 and your eye Faber when I was working for the FC he was like the kid that was 20 to 23 and now and even 36 back then you were like 30 when when you were working for the key in the cage now I'm talking about when I work for the UFC always work for the you 35 six weeks all right when you first saw him fight that was king of the cage right as I remember you were telling me about him he bought the WEC was that I went yeah no he found King in the cage do did he yeah yeah he Charlie king of the cage once yeah and then he went to WEC and that's right I'm so curious about this first time I saw him was he fought Naboo Dhabi has a blue belt he wrestled his whole life but he was a blue belt when he fought bottom bean from American Top Team that was the first time I some powerful Justin buckles shout out yeah he's right there yeah I'm really curious to see how this plays out predictions breaking this is your eye all the way Frankie's gonna win that three you guys bet on double or nothing oh damn no no you can have the double on you we have to get you later yeah we have to let you get half of it bro your night times not a plan yeah you're not getting us I think in this you think I think Frankie wins three to two that would suck me close by I imagine the means if you lose oh I know I'm gonna be tough to beat that Bruce Jenner won no that's it is pretty goddamn funny haha here he is I instagrammed 15 seconds of that interview the part where she has refused gay are you gay no I'm not gay that was hysterical so Cruz the circle he's like his eyes are fluttering and twitching up all these pantomimes he's like no I'm not gay I only I've only been with women even it was so believable what's up would you yes you have something like that like you're transgender they immediately ignore all the other ridiculous aspects of your behavior like the fact that you fucking killed somebody a couple weeks ago by pushing their fucking car in the oncoming traffic I hope you weren't paying attention yeah I mean that some level another and what I'll win no nobody talks about that no more poor lady they said he laid Xing dialed now he wasn't text but sure wasn't paying attention though he wasn't paying attention when his driver was in after about an hour or before he was before before he came out yeah maybe this is the biggest job no no he was already transitioning hormones forever what if that's not like $20 here goes but if it's also the fact that he's living with attention whores his whole life I mean it's like he lives in a ridiculous household I mean all these things come into account like what's the greatest athlete of all time no no he definitely was no no no no no everybody when you win the gold medal in the decathlon Oh whines you know real athletes were competing in that shit yo oh really is that the boy Michael Jordan was not in the fucking decathlon too many black guys could be in the decathlon okay here we go here we go here he was the greatest shut up okay how's this play out inside leg kick by Uriah Frank you got hit in the sack come on come on oh that would be nice I think I think your eye has the power advantage with you Green hundred so Eddie you're you're free right here right you know what you're taking your right eye I don't forget the back things are bad Oh Frank I got I got your eye on this one this is we bet double or nothing Eddie Bravo has your eye I got Frankie I can't believe you made him take your riot double or nothing even though you were you were very strong coming into this is it me or does Frankie Edgar look way bigger then you're Rocky's big well there's the same height the same body looks bigger I think your eye looks thicker yeah he's thick I guess it's a camera angle it's a little way tanner it's interesting like they're they're moving like this is a five-round fight like Frankie's like nice and paced slowly a lot a lot of footwork and movement but nothing crazy as far as output it's gonna be a really close fight mid it's interesting seeing Frankie not have a speed advantage now I agree your eyes fastest fuck man and then 145 you know he's used to fighting those 135 hours I think I like the fact that he isn't it to cut as much weight for this fight too hmm again at 36 it's probably he goes hard and smart like I said I think your eye has a power advantage in the he comes off of weigh-ins and has a picnic on the ground like immediately out doesn't I does yeah he's soup eating salmon off the photo spinning back-kick were easy teh what your eyes a smart guess where his business wise goes very smart guy yeah well he owns a ton of businesses uh-huh got his machine Oh in Sacramento in cartoons he's got a casino yeah like part of a casino build torque so he sold uh other companies of k-swiss hey tell you what man torque is a fucking great company they make really good gloves man they're their boxing gloves are my favorite boxing gloves ever really for working I don't know that made fight God's know they made shirts I'll dude when next time you're over my place yeah I'll give you a pair of the gloves he gave me a few pairs and they're really fucking good man they're super comfortable like they're the most comfortable bad gloves I've ever used am de nice just always connected with the right people a smart yeah well torque is a real good one they make outstanding equipment there were great hand wraps great everything his other company was full oh that didn't land as Duane Ludwig working with them for this fight now your eye and Duane don't see eye to eye these were our master Hong and Martin who rank you with the takedown hey this is gonna be a long fight it's gonna be close this one's going down the judge is Eddie yeah this is gonna judge it better not fuck me I swear to god man I'm gonna freak out freak out they're just me then trust me just seems an $1,800 it's weird you see these like these logos all over people's shorts is the last time you gonna see this I got another month of this gonna miss him me too some companies are like hayabusa man I mean they've been around a long ass fucking time they're all just gonna go to Bella Clark right lunch thing they want to be in this business this going over to Bell to shore I mean they're already there in Bellator it's just not does anybody watch Bellator last night I did who won the Kendall Grove fight Kendall laughs he got beat up man bad yeah the dude didn't get way tonight so they stripped him of his title yeah Kendall got finished what round third round Wow was it a fire forced inside fourth round so was i round five round oh yeah okay he just kept taking Kendall down over and over well he's a big fucker I heard he's muscular he'd get ate up in the OC though good little good Frankie going high with the kicks I was really rooting for Kendall he's a good dude great guy great darts jokes yeah he's been around a long time really has had a lot more experience than that guy thought I was super annoying on on Spike I'm super into oh yeah you see those heavyweights y'all I'm a big fan of glory dude Glory's a shit yeah I don't miss him yeah Nikki whole skins one of my favorite fighters for sure in any sport yeah thought on that last one right did you see the artem levin Simon Marcus fight went to a draw oh it's fucking amazing Clara do you see those heavyweights no there's no girl in glory but there's no famous girl fights no more time Ronda Rousey no Moxon huh it would be cyborg we're seeing a Dom beat cyborg well who's that Italian lion who's that Tiffany time bomb she's a beast man Tiffany time mom yeah my last name but she's she's easy on the eyes and she she's a beast yeah there's some pretty girls that fight in my time yeah men but it's um it just doesn't have the eyes that grappling that gnarly sup your face I'm curious to think elbows on arms for me there yeah muy Thai true I'm curious to see to hear your critique of Cathy long striking and how she moves and all that cuz I never really paid attention oh she's badass I'm sorry highlight reel man like maybe a year ago and I work with her we train at the same gym but I just never followed women's kickboxing I knew she was famous I just never seen any of her matches and one night I put on a highlight reel Cathy long I'm unfamiliar with holy fuck dude poor boys daddy long I was dynamic and just so full of fire to run walks her ring walk sir smells like she comes out Oh like fucking on fire she's here we go mad at that round two so who won the first round Frankie I think so yeah we're down that takedown there's barely a takedown but it you know chick to the body when it's this close those takedowns in cage presence and the pressure when she rounds who Frankie Brittany I mean are you Ryan rather with a knee you ride with a kick to the body and you ride with the cage of the knee I think I said Frankie Frank you barely won that first come on favor yeah if you riot can make this more of a kicking contest that's not like Frankie strong suit oh but look at that Franky throws a spinning back case for it though Oh got out of it Danny's quickest noses bleed I think it's always bleeding if he sneezes and starts bleeding that's like me mid well it's just normal you know you get punched in the face all the time I'm just dry enough to have no surgery I blow my nose blood everywhere when you had a nurse no surgery and you had your your pipes opened up did you blow some insane boogers out of that that was awesome oh I felt the best thing in the world I took photos of them and I put them on Instagram I almost made Tom Segura throw up and heal it's terrible in the airport oh it wasn't Instagram I don't think back then it was a Twitter but I almost made Hoch head kick by Frankie I almost made Tom Segura throw up so I showed it to him Oh anybody else and that's a new Frankie Edgar man he's doing some serious kung fu kicks yeah he's throwing some kicks I like that that's that Mark Henry and Phil nurse man I would blow some boogers that were bigger than a quarter like I couldn't insane big dance it's crazy whoa and they were bloody and feels like aliens when they when they took though the things out of your nose right like stitches it's the best feeling in the world yeah because I had plastic splints Romano like two little stitches it made my nose wider yeah the actual the actual space opened the dude who did it he was a wizard he retired but he knew his shit he cut out all the think they're called turbinates the inside of like the bump the bone bump cut those down and then like cut out all the scar tissue add a scar tissue and put these fucking tubes in there and then splints these plastic splints to stitch it up and when it was over like my nose is wider like all this shit like he like opened it up like and changed the shape he brings it down oh my god it's amazing my doctor sucked no I don't breathe great man well you still get punched in the face I haven't been punched in the face that much since the surgery yeah the trout's Brown uppercut didn't help that's life though dude for most of my life I couldn't breathe out on my new prank II with overhand right that was very nice yeah what you call a mouth breather look at this that's a that's a nose I'm jealous right now I have to yeah you got a hot gun you better breathe it efficient I love it I'm so happy with a search I didn't even bark much I got two nostrils that are totally different they're all fucked up inside like it ones like real like the sliver and one's a hole yeah I had three-quarters blockage on one side and almost a hundred percent blockage on the other side yeah my nose was useless I had a quarter of an astronaut's it you remember they were they going with the drill and just kind of get it out of like all the shit cuz I see I used to not addictive I'd use that every day I'm dancing yes I'd use after that I clogged everything man was addicted to that shit to my ex yet I was you know I just do it every since you are Joey Diaz is addicted to it he was joking around about it on stage it's horrible for him is when I did coke I could fucking breathe perfect now I'm addicted is fucking Afrin can't breathe yeah that Afrin stuff I don't know I won't stand up yeah it makes the veins smaller so then your nose doesn't work as efficiently yeah when you get addicted to it when you don't have it it literally will make your nose the inside of its well yeah what's just so crazy so I had to go in the head like this little drill and just caved out poles oh yeah like quarters where they caught cauterized yes that's what they're doing Wow it was nice did it help hell yeah then I get punched in the nose again back to square one fuck so many fighters talk with like nasal Uriah talks needle do I sound nasally a little bit I can't stand my list myself talked this is the most nasally Wanderlei what used to be but then he changed his nose to me and van changes you gotta face off son you gotta go generalize overdo it it's like face off Nicolas Cage style who have see the problems as you see it's like a little Arnold huh that is how he sounds uh I suppose do a podcast live 18 9 this whole showed up two hours late it's very good two hours later it's very good got to food he was two hours late I left really he sent me texts sorry cool man okay thanks Bros this Oh but Wanderlei Silva he was late - two hours - I - what apollyon Brazil tiring Brazil my friend of Brazil there is no time not for real so he changed his entire face face off style I'm thinking about doing that I wouldn't mind a new mug here's captain lon here's the highlight reel yeah check check out is she old skills oh yeah fuck timeout right now no no no but she actually is 50 years old and wants to fight she's in great here she looks good she's in great shape still man she's the best female fighter I've ever seen so Chuck Norris Chuck Norris cut cut through all this shitting it's some actual fighting holds black belts in three styles her in Bryan Callen and she goes ever had she is badass though oh look at that girl she's fighting looks like my mom boom bitch there's some high level shit this is like an eighties dude yeah it's a pka karate days ok here we go well incorrectly like some bullshit come on don't show me that you gotta watch her fights man she's good my mom my mom would fuck her come on my mama puts up a heavy on hurt son so funny this fight is good super close man these fucking challenges rewriter not cost me 1,800 the riot pulls it off if he wins the next three rounds well that last round it's tough that last rounds a toss-up right well if you riot wins three out of five that's all yes to do that's what I think slow hello Frankie Wentz three hmm who the fuck knows man who the fuck knows they're in round three yeah Edgar's probably gonna get the decision this is a weird fight for Frankie to man Riley you see Ryan's not even ranked at 145 he comes back to 145 and he beats Edgar he's right in the mix it's about your legacy though right oh right good try Han it's about your legacy though you know beating a guy like you're out of these super fight - so like what's left for you Ryan Frankie to do yeah title shot be nice they both been there they've both been champs right you know what's crazy here I've been a champ WC was but you know it's crazy seeing this fight man is that like thinking like man Uriah almost could have fought BJ Penn that would have been sane when Ryan throws a wheel kick that you're riot fighting against BJ Penn would have been insane how cool is super fights though with it with these mazes legacy of these guys this is what it's about him yeah like I don't want to see Frankie fights on his weight class I don't want to see your eye fight someone they've been there they've done that I think this is your eyes weight class what would be your all right there look at that only this looking for the guillotine nope oh man Frankie got ashes you don't think Frankie drill touch piss out of that every damn horse you dead but it's still impressive nonetheless hard to keep him down Yeah right back up he counts though those count the judges check one for the Frankie check one for a big brown sorry Eddie you can see any super this is B how many super fight yeah Jon Jones rich Kane yeah I think so too I'm in John Jones vs. Weidman come on son I like that I was too small how dare you are you serious how dare you John Jones Kane I was asking Square Garden I want to see that too but I just I don't know if Kane can get through a training camp you know somebody was like putting this out there they were like you really think about what Kane did as far as like Kane make no mistake about it the baddest motherfucker on the planet in the heavyweight division in the heavyweight division but the guys kind of like all of his injuries have kind of left that whole division in turmoil it's like he's only fought a few times he's only defending my title at nine months um yeah yeah the the the heavyweight division is wide open uh uh uh it'd be nice Seaver doom win I think I think it'd be better for the sport ver dooms a character he speaks well he speaks Portuguese speaks English she can speak Spanish Flu he's on TV skillful as fuck - fuck yeah you're right looking for the guillotine again Kane's like a robot all I want to do is wrestle and not talk let's do trestle and not talk it doesn't work well when you're trying to make money in this game you know there man Frankie's a heavyweight champ son it could be no you know Muhammad Ali shirts like Kate you know I'm saying Kings are gonna have that never know he's just a matter of whether or not he can stay healthy Frankie said John would kill a man we're seeing how great he is right now yeah I was another hen zou Guymon and Ricardo Almeida he's shown that Cub Swanson relentlessness now you better get up son slipped I'll tell you what's a dope-ass super fight me that's a little early but I'm just saying hear me out Conor Pettis that would be interesting I'd be cool fight right pet is gonna be out for almost a year I saw bat he fucked his arm up I like left target I like medicine lot yeah I do too Pettis got a new girl smoke show pays to be the champ man pays there's not a chimp anymore well you know I'm saying though I hear you still has that bet his house don't melt she walks in and she's seen that belt son well yet they don't let me get the matter I've been here right now over my shoulder you walked in my house it just be on a straight fucking display just with a highlight tape of my entire career just as the belt spins just simply used to wear at the clubs that was always the joke Tim Sully was to show up at a bar with his fucking belt on I'd do the same shit ah dos Anjos man holy shit is that guy good huh yeah I fell dos Anjos versus Pettis was I I open and fight well next week dos Anjos I don't didn't have anything no um he's injured maybe cowboy maybe mean cowboy he do if he batters mekdeci that she's 100 sent well I think and if he does give him a title shot with that seven in a row yeah you know who's fucking flourishing of this Reebok deal is cowboy like damn I fight 12 times a year I might get paid son right TJ like that deal too I talked to him about it yeah worked out for him works for some people Tim didn't like it very much yeah it's um it's great him was only getting 2500 bucks yeah so this is an interesting fight heading to this fourth round Frankie's up Frankie's up at least two to one you think so yes these judges thought man it makes me nervous Eddie you're super quiet over there you piss you made this bet yeah are you press yeah I'll tell you what good okay the money right now doesn't look good that look fine yeah it did here we go bro bro how about that bet with me not the bet but the matchup with Machida and your boy Joe over America yeah that's a fine it's interesting it's very interesting you all Romero though he keeps getting hurt right yeah he gets hurt too he's not young and all that wrestling's and ketchup he's 37 he had a significant neck surgery look he gets on the scale he's got a big scar in the back of his head like where's back of his neck rather like where they get the disks fused I don't know you know if you had discectomy or I don't know where he got it done America or Cuba but there's that and then there's the last fight with Jacque ray that he had to pull out of who have to get fight to me that was a great fight but ham rock Cole gets the next title shot mm-hmm and then you got fucking jock ray I don't know what's next but you can't beat Camozzi he already beaten that's right title shot there's so many fucking killers at 185 what fucks sakes it's so stacked Frankie's thrown a lot of spinning back kicks in this fight it's crazy your eyes kick you more than usual - well I expected that I thought your I would have liked if he had an advantage of being a kicking but apparently Mark Henry thought about - Toni Man Mark Henry writes novels on his fighters absolutely notes and shit there's a nice leg kick yeah he just pulls that thing out so quickly and easily that's the second time you're I had like a little play on a singular whoo nice left to Frank Frankel retract I love Frankie this is a very good fight though this is a very religious man this isn't like the Cub Swanson fight which is just a Frankie Edgar show this is a good fight no bro this is the to the highest level athlete we have in the UFC Frankie Edwards footwork he's so consistent he just every night he doesn't waver he does the same shit he doesn't slow down never slows down same pace for five rounds and never stands right in front of you is constantly moved only fight he stood in front of me was the great Maynard fight in his coach when he comes back to the corner market goes what the fuck did I tell you not to do what the fuck did we talk about my bad man goes out there and beats the brakes off him really yeah after the first round you like how is he even gonna fight and he came back and won the second round of saying that heroic slam and everybody go crazy there's certain fights that they really need to stop in between rounds and if you looked at the beating that Gray Maynard put on him in the first round you would go man I don't know if he's gonna be able to make it I agree but then like look at Machida versus Rockhold but they could have easily stopped that fight in between rounds they wanted to the well they should've they didn't even fucking put his mouthpiece in I know what everyone thinks that Machida was tapping verbally tapping but he's saying I don't have my mouthpiece trying to get a break and get the mouthpiece yeah granted he was Guiness who's guys rush yeah he got hit in the temple you didn't know where it was so you got beat up yeah that one elbow-to-elbow yeah lucre mean he landed a lot of ground pound but that one shoe at the end of the round was so loud it was like spunk like you could hear it like coconut style 185 man there's not there's not a better division so fun right now you're right I think you're right between Jacare luk rock laying through this nice take down Frankie Edgar yeah Jacare got rock hold Wyoming Vitor Belfort why men in Belper men man I'm Vitor has some very fucking sophisticated striking that's one of the reasons why that's an interesting fight wildcard striking for sure if that shit lands are going to sleep yeah he's striking very sophisticated very tricky he's so explosive to out but will he be though that's the thing that's host TRT he looks good now have you seen him a little bit in it the Ryan Loco yeah photography yeah well Ryan said you know the photography is obviously him in the middle of punching but he said he looks good he lost a little weight for sure but I've seen I've seen a lot of the video footage of him sparring in one of the Nikki holtz-eakin videos just him spar in the background he looks fucking good dude this is the thing though man as good as we think he looks if you're a guy who's been on TRT or whatever testosterone your entire career now you're off of it and you're fighting the baddest 185 in the planet where's your mental state at how you gonna go in that fight went to the second round and you've landed that spinning heel kick and you've landed that left hand and he's not going anywhere that's a good point it's a real good point yeah the real good point where's he gonna be at mentally yep that's the difference because Chris Weidman ate Chris Weidman said he got his blood checked instead sauce was low he's like fuck and I feel fine say clicking me man well his testosterone was low but I guarantee you a lot of that was due to hard training 100% hard training just jacks your levels you know if someone says like got my levels tested and they're really low okay how often we training how often did you train the window and yeah when did you test yeah when you're in folk like remember when DC and John Jones both tested like super low yeah I do what do you think about that because a lot of people said that that was so low that it was indication or indicative rather of them doing something yeah because well I don't know enough about it but I read all that expert stuff well whoever they interviewed and they said for them to be that low there would have to be some sort of abuse right of yeah but I don't believe that I don't agree they know because they both tested it was low testosterone to epi' testosterone ratio which is the opposite of knowing someone took steroids it's low is the opposite of that but we don't know where they started cuz DC's older he's been wrestling all his life Johnson compete in all his life so before camp where were they at we don't know we don't so for them to test it maybe that's normal for them because they've been competing on the left so to jump at those accusations is fucking crazy I don't think it's a stew I think it's the training camp it's like well do we know like what a really fucking hard ass training camp does do testosterone levels is it been like is it consistent is it provable I mean is is is there a baseline that they measured before he went into camp and then in the middle of camp we just test him randomly in the middle of camp you're just getting whatever he is right now kids really though yeah we don't know what's causing it you don't know how they were sleeping I mean that was a stressful fucking lead-up you know a lot of lot of shit yeah I think fighting at the press conference if you take a guy like you test Hershel Walker about his fucking levels are naturally really high you test them randomly people are like oh dude he's on shit no he's just a freak you don't know what is level that the appetit astana testosterone ratios even if you're a freak there's like a natural level that you never get over true that's how like when you see a guy like who has like a ten to one testosterone the advertised drops mean he has to be on some yeah but they allow you like a two two one three two one I think four to one the body six to ones you still out set used to you see the new rules no what are the new Nevada two steroids three-year suspension whoa that's serious three-year suspension test for diuretics or weed what three hours four years for weed Wow that's no way we're gonna lose how you Jamie can you bring that up I say you're not sure I'm positive I just read it three years for weed pretty sure oh no I don't I don't think then we're moving away from shit like that yeah but they changed Nevada's son they changed no no Nevada changed the requirements as far as like how what's positive and what's not like what would level the metabolites have to be they essentially don't want people fighting hi whoo that was a nice did you have bye Frankie now yeah I'm pretty sure man okay this is a fifth round already fuck man how'd that happen look at this first offense 18 months suspension that's for muscle relax sleep aids opiates cannabis cannabis at 18 months yeah second offense 30 to 40% of your purse third offense you said didn't you say three years I did you're wrong son well well you write for third offense if it's the third offense and am i bad how about a fine of 75% of the fighters purse why don't you steal money from him didn't the guy fight yeah why stealing money from him cause he was on one weed diuretics I'm two years Frankie takes him down look at this cocaine two years damn how good is your rockets terrible three years good left took their first offense steroids yeah three years first offense months 75 up to 75% of the
