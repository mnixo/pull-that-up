think that I would ever have written my books of historical mystery if I had not encountered cannabis but like you mean you guys are both in better shape than I am but I work out 45 minutes a month I did my whole body vibrate 45 minutes a month yeah I'm not kidding I do not a minute less that's ridiculous that's five really you busy I have some theories about that I was doing I invented bulletproof intermittent fasting during that time which is when you do bulletproof coffee during it in a written fast I'm sorry but you could be a hilarious Saturday Night Live sketch if you get any more famous you're in trouble because we're gonna do a sketch where everything honey I'm gonna take a bulletproof shit get in my bulletproof car and go to the bulletproof office you know this is my bulletproof secretary I'll stop bulletproofing stuff job but no more all right fair enough I got a buddy who's a billionaire real live billionaire so years later he came into the money like where it was his in one year he went from fucking zenith the nadir like he he straight to rehab he was he would call me and be like I'm in Vegas I got the top floor the Wynn rented I got slip and slides down

what is the arch Adichie doesn't have arms I'm just letting you talk to all right I'm fine the opening act up Chuck the clown is trying to calm my nerves now there's there's no you know they're there they're their own security so there's no security it's just it's just Juggalo law on this huge piece of property up Chuck's trying to convince me that it's not that scary of a gig and he's driving me around on this golf cart and he's like you know you got it and this huge clown just this this guy just jumps out of nowhere it starts punching up Chuck on the golf cart he's running along and hitting no reason he's like fuck you yeah and he's gunning it okay so we lose the guy he's like I'm here every year you know they know me I'm like family and I'm like okay can of Faygo the first can of a go comes in and it just sprays all over us and and he's like he's so familiar with you getting hit with a coca-cola he goes he goes it's diet it's not gonna stay then one comes in and in the oh nines got it on camera it's like this is a prude of fun we got this can of soda this guy does a baseball pitch and you see it whizzing seconds before it hits generate the temple no crack he's mid-sentence because you know something like that when the soda it's not gonna happen at a Dave Matthews to Rack any slum so he's like I'm hurt I'm hurt bad Bob he's company Bob's I know it's really fucked up not five yeah we walk in and you know everyone's gone but Sam and like three other people and they're still doing blow I I first walk into the kitchen I walk back to mom I see the doors open all the guitars are gone my bed's fucked up like the door had been broken and kicked in and Sam looks at me and goes that pissed on your bed man do you want to know why and I go yeah yeah I do he goes cuz you let that fucking moron sleep with my guitars and like then there's this weird silence and and I turned to Bill and I said I told you I knew him huh I could do John Mayer well no I could you to know I think he's great I think he's very talented but if your wife is really into going and I'm saying like she drags you there and just stares at him right Buble you notice she's not clapping because one of her hands slipped down her jeans oh it sounds like some stabbing a seal just she's just herself she's all the way to her elbow just grit her teeth pounded it in there you could see her ribcage expand as a fist goes up there okay let's go yeah and if you break down here more like that like you said fine-tooth comb mm-hmm every single joke or 90% of the jokes you do unless you're talking about balloons or bouncing a ball I've hurt somebody if we get that literal with humor then almost all jokes comics tell are going to be up for a careful examination contributing to a fucking rape culture is nonsense and it is to say comedian contributes to rape culture is simply bullshit and it's it's simplistic thinking it's a way of saying I don't like what you're saying and I don't want you to say it but I can't come out with that so I have to find a higher reason which makes it sound like you shouldn't say it for this reason has the ban against these weapons or roads other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using them cheese over time this would again face the prospect honestly we don't attack yeah I'm gonna get some poison gas it could be easy with terrorist organizations and the day after any military action we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism Joe Biden beat me at poker used to run Raytheon they sell how Hellfire missiles oh now he's leaving the same way came in oh my god nice and dramatic that just that alone all of this really a trickle shit was orchestrated folks I guarantee you there are some people that are involved in this there's some producers there's some there's an artistic director they want that was a that was a well planned out scene he walks up he walks back the fact that they do it in this ancient stupid house where he supposedly lives meanwhile you know he's in some fucking seven mile thick bunker down you know deep into the ground the the earth where Dick Cheney was hiding all throughout the Iraq war here's just a metal slide he jumps in a chute like a laundry chute he jumps in and slides through and lands and the towels and just just himself off surrounded by lizards who are like excellent work yeah it's bad Batman's lair how much time between her putting the saran wrap over your butthole and you shooting a load how much time 15 seconds to put the foreign rag ha ha 5 seconds to shoot oh my gosh you know I mean surrender didn't you call feminism Marxist with Penny's socialism attest but that was a bad character in one of my novels but I just thought like feminism as a socialism and panties and it's very true because I mean and then people call oh my god that's so terrible if I just went through all the founding matriarch of the feminist system they're all Marxists all leftists and so on and also a feminists are so pro woman then where are they with Margaret Thatcher Margaret Thatcher was like the first leader of a Western country she struggled up from nothing I mean an incredibly powerful woman but she was on the right you see so they hate her what about Iran Iran wrote wrote the most influential book outside the Bible and the second most influential book and according to the New York Times Review of Books after the Bible you know reshaped Western philosophy in many ways in Western politics and the feminists hate her why cuz she was on the right cuz he says what they think she was not actually on the right but so I mean I have these sort of suspicions when they're sort of is it the leftist ideology or the probe woman now if it's the problem and then they should be incredibly positive where are the feminists when people insult people like Ann Coulter where are the feminists when people insult Sarah pale you know like Bill Maher called her a cunt I mean that's really pretty vicious like publically openly right I mean where are the Fed because they're on the right and culture and they're considered be on the right so they get a pass when people go you know but you then you say something bad about a woman on the left and so I think that it is more left than it is Pro woman because when they choose between their politics and the gender they always seem to choose the politics over the agenda that's why I say it's left is rather than then per woman people always take things at face value to get to know you or I mean I'm sitting right in front of you now would you say that I am a woman no no I say you're a woman you're a beard no you're basically a man thank you I appreciate no problem in compliment first people steal everything just see this is yeah this is not control yeah I saw that Joey's in the far right that's insane we were so cute sexy lucky seven yeah can you get it so just his whole body frozen almost 44 yeah like that look at that wow that's so crazy Wow look at you dude so how old you in this picture 14 and that's when I wasn't innocent I was smoking dope that I was no innocent and I was smoking dope I was finger banging people it's like the hardest thing in the world is to say somebody says to you relax write or be yourself or just be yourself Joe you know I mean and and yet I think as we become more professional and better at what we're doing when somebody says to you be yourself you can you can you know you're not burdened by these false selves and these things that that you think you ought to be or ought to say or how you want to look or what you ought to be and I think in many ways that's what any artist does as they become a professional at what they do they learn to kind of get out of their own way and it's the hardest thing of all I think do you feel a responsibility for that or towards that as an artist do you ever feel like because of what you're doing because if you're you're so motivated you get so much done you have so many different projects going do you do you realize the impact of that because a lot of people are inspired by though not just the work ethic that you have but the how much quality shit you produce whether it's wine or music or I appreciate the compliment um I think I think you can't really worry about it you just got to do what it is you're doing and for me I just have to do what I'm doing there's there's there's a sense of responsible for the art or for the process and just for myself I just I care about what I'm doing if I start caring about what you think about what I'm doing whether it's gonna be helping you then I'm a that I'm an assisted living employee when I was on the space station the second time one of the other crew members her name's sue Helms she and I were talking we'd known each other since test pilot school and in passing a throw away thing she didn't even think she was saying she said hey you know earth said that we're supposed to do this next and in my mind I heard earth said I heard those words come out of her mouth and it was like she has in her mind completely split off from the other 7 billion people there's her crew and Earth is one singular identifiable entity on the other side and that was a real bellringer to me of what it's gonna be like to go to Mars those people are gonna be a completely discrete unit of people and they'll be Martians they won't be earthlings pretty quick in their heads and how do you deal with that how do we plan for that and it's still a long ways in the future but it's one of the many things we need to sort out before we because as you say once you get the engine's going fast enough that you're you're headed for Mars you can't just turn around I think you're an attorney right yeah in in Houston I was an attorney then in Dallas I started a computer company I had a personal computer company that well in 1981 we out-grossed Microsoft you know I had for color picture in Forbes magazine made the front page of The Wall Street Journal and really then IBM came in and crushed us like a bug Wow we just sort of sold ourselves out of business and by the time we were done the last six eight nine months I was financing the thing by selling ecstasy what I knew a guy my acting class you know how long I was in acting class years there was a guy really good guy normal guy so I thought and he was and I hired him to shoot me to shoot this audition so I go to his house and he's got this great camera and on his wall is a dream board and on his wall is his no no no he's put his face he's put pictures of his now I'm the cover of Vanity Fair and those magazines he's got slogans saying you're the guy you're the one and it's a dream board Wow and it was big it was good cover this whole wall man you yes you should dream big but you should also be realistic with who you are he's gonna do it right but see that way don't let him see you doing that he's gonna hurt you what is this 10% you keep saying why do you keep saying 10% well why is Brian keeps saying 10% it's a running joke based in truth I had some issues I had some situations in my life and I like to put numbers on things and based on these factors and experiences and thought processes we came to the number of 10% gay I'm open with it you know what did you say it's not I understand what you just said what you just said was a statement that would really work if everybody knew what you were saying but I don't know we're saying so what you're saying is a 10% gay I'm open with it what does that mean does that mean you're 10% gay yes I came out on my podcast probably like six months ago you came out 10 percent yes what's so funny oh no this is insane I just want to point something out of how we are so weird like as a culture that this is a part of like normal everyday office life like we got to make some decisions here like okay look at this woman she's showing everything but her vagina I mean her knee is just strategically blocking her labia her legs are wide open and she's hot as fuck now here's the thing if you put the chyron right in front of the vagina then everybody would know the news exactly we'd be a very informed four country and women would get angry if you knew oh you were looking at a vagina and you read the fucking news huh this is like something that I like that Rhonda says which is like duh if you don't feel like meditating don't meditate don't force it don't impose this on yourself keep doing the thing you're doing that's upsetting you so much have the balls to keep doing the fucking thing that you're doing keep doing it the society is going to tell you don't be like this stop being like this you have to change that's what your parents always say the idea is like no sink into what you are right now just be that thing stop resisting exactly where you are right now is perfect and that's a hard truth to grasp I've been listening to Dan Carlinville Indian barbecue my ass Dan Carlin was the our guest on Monday and he has a podcast called hardcore history and right now it's all about the Mongols and for the next hour home I listen to the history of the Mongol Empire which is fascinating yeah Dan Carlin's hardcore history I'm really into this Dan Carlin podcast race line he's got this podcast called hardcore history and he does this really detailed history of the Mongols over like five five episodes well I told you I'm fucking in love with that Dan Carlin hardcore history podcast you know that's one of the really cool things this Dan Carlin thing on on the history of the Mongols you know we had Dan Carlin on from hardcore history you listen to that podcast I have heard about it finally one of his most badass podcast is about the Mongols Genghis Khan was a motherfucker like he definitely killed ten million goddamn they're talking about armies that we're coming towards China where the Mongols had been and in the distance they thought they saw snow covered mountains but when they got close they realized they were mounds of bones and garlic and the garlic is just gangsters just killing everybody anybody that's anywhere it's like the Mongol hordes yeah it's like something out of ancient times that we have that you know yeah that's like the Mongol horde yeah exactly that's pretty preposterous the world has actually never been less violent than it is today look at Syria hundred thousand people like it's a lot but I got to be worried the Mongols killed a million in a day right there's a lot less murder then there was like in the fucking 1200 s back during the Mongol days and shit like that Brian look go to my Twitter and there's a thing that i retweeted earlier today from Dan Carlin a hardcore history guy he put up a trailer of Genghis Khan and the Mongols from like the John Wayne era they did a movie John Angus Khan the conquered everybody yeah the Mongols came through Moscow in the winter they came through the through the fucking attacks Russia in the winter because nobody else would do it that way and then it's they didn't see it coming did I tell you how they why they were so hard to follow into the desert who the Mongols you didn't have to tell me I know a lot about them but go ahead if you want to well just what are you a fucking edge well no because who did I tell you go there like if we cuz some societies would get their armies together I think we talked last time about how there was there was there's pictures of Afghanistan with with Western ideal type Western idea type cultures you know there was a massive culture shift in terms of you know women and with education and and your state of dress and and things that would be allowed well there was a fantastic episode of hardcore history the Dan Carlin podcast where he talked about the Mongols invading Iraq well that's the second time that someone has done that to Baghdad it's I've been listening to for the past couple of years Dan Carlin's hardcore history when Baghdad was raided by the Mongols and they crushed the society they basically started from scratch after that killed everyone and threw all the literature away so that they say that today they're just getting to the point like culturally of where they were in 2012 av the Mongols were throwing trees at them they cut all their trees down and then they stacked them up with giant catapults and hurled them over the gates destroying everything in the city and what they would do is take the survivors and put them in the frontlines and use them oftentimes as the the front they would push an army into the town and people would be shooting arrows at their own friends thousands and thousands of people just be forced through the door of the gate of a city I listened to your Mongol podcast at least four five Joe Rogan stopped telling Joe Rogan to talk about your Mongol podcast only she talked to this poor comedic woman about it and you said something and there was and we went back to her there's this long dead silence where she tried to absorb what you just told her who was that who do you think that would have been female comedian she's got a show on consumer long pause like what do I say after that yeah I got a meet someone with some fucking crazy man that must be broadcasted to record what the fuck I am broadcasting you cunts there we go now it's know we're on ladies and gentlemen we're sort of on time we try to get it right every week but every week we fucked something up and this week I made sure that I turned off the sound on my computer the one over there I haven't even turn off the sound on this one yet so for you it could have easily been me that just fucked up which is that's the reason why I fucked up it's cuz because I'm here cuz I always fuck it up i fuck it up every week we've done this goddamn thing like 22 weeks in a row I fuck it up every single time but this week it was Brian you know I've been thinking about this podcast a lot ladies and gentlemen and one of the things I've been thinking about is I appreciate the fuck out of everybody listening and I we do try our best to make this as interesting as possible and as smooth and professional as possible but I gotta admit that I've been too stressed out about this I've been taking it too seriously I mean taking it seriously in a good way whereas we improved the sound we got a real mixer we got us I mean we're sitting on couches and shit and we're gonna get a better cameras but that like it's not like there's a part of it that's really fun but there's a part of it that wasn't fun and I don't think that should exist I don't think I should ever get too serious about this this is for people who are working who are just being distracted that just wants something because they're doing mindless shit this is for people that are driving in their cars and you know want something to listen to this is for people on the train this is for people at the gym whatever the fuck it's for you guys alright and if if we take it too seriously you stop being yourself and in start starts being like this professional thing that you're trying real hard to do and I think I think I've fallen prey to that a little bit I was thinking about it today after a weed and I was thinking about it and I was like you know what man this thing like I'm like I paid too much attention to it it should just be a weekly fun thing like it or not you know for for anybody who's like minded or anybody who's interested in some sort of a distraction from someone who's not like-minded so thank you very much for tuning in everybody love you bitches later
