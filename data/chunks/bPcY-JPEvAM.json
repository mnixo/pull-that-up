yes yeah - I put your phone you're trying but this is hard it's not coming up there goes this interface it's very hard it's very hard are you guys worried that by calling your tour endless honeymoon you might put the jinx on it sort of like how Rob and blac Chyna jinx on what our marriage or the tour we can pivot we can pivot into the endless divorced or very quickly right because you guys would be friends even yeah you hit the rocks strictly homies tour well the way we thought of it is we were in Newport Rhode Island we learned about this rich couple who went on a ten-year honeymoon and then they came back with four kids and I just thought that sounded so romantic to be so rich that you just like went away for a decade yeah you have kids on the fly you go away newlyweds you come back grandparents that's Superbowl didn't know their doctor they're in fucking Sweden and those people were so rich man do you know about the new port that the the seat of wealth that was Newport Rhode Island oh yeah I used to do a lot of gigs in Rhode Island this is insane mansions there in like 1900 basically 90% of the wealth in America was in Rhode Island and then everyone else was living like you know in squalor they hadn't established personal income tax yeah it was like the years right before personal income tax had been established in this country so people had like 35 indoor servants fifty-five outdoor servants like you could people like would come from Australia and boats and you would just make them yours it was like slavery but this is the show at the endless centimeter we do an extended lecture on personal income tax in the history and slavery yeah another period is based on that that's how we know about it but yeah they were like these people it was the Carnegie's and the Rockefellers and these like seed of power like Illuminati old you know Carnegie had a billion dollars a hundred years ago like these people or they were just but now we've come full circle and people have figured out how to legally steal money and income tax oh but not that many I mean but don't like the Romneys of the world don't they know how to not pay or like well like the like politicians don't they kind of know how to you you're talking about she's talking about big old corporate oligarchy billionaire people never get up any super-rich people are gonna try really hard to hold on to their money and pay his little taxes as possible and form LLC's and corporations I don't kind of jazz but it is funny the comedians are like mostly super liberal yeah right and they're all like man we got Bernie and we gotta like pay these high tax rates and anyway I'm incorporated on my LLC's name is like you're doing the corporate fiction to Center for for entertainers but here's the problem like where's the money going like I'd be willing to give away more money in tax dollars if I knew that it was a rock-solid establishment they really knew what to do and if you can take if you could take like little Phil little bubbles like I like most of my money to go to education no nothing to that Oh that'd be amazing country be fucked yeah everything would fall apart you know cops would be out of business well no because half of the country at least would be like all my money the cops all my Monday defense I would love to see I would love to I know I wouldn't love to do it because I just don't think that that amount of power should be in people's hands without a lot of research first you know I think that's a big part of the problem even running for president and voting for president you don't have to have any research done before you choose a candidate you just like them and also you don't have to have done any research to be the president also there's like no choice like okay I guess I'm a Hillary person yeah yeah you could become a Hillary person just because you don't want a reality show what contestant or whatever the fuck you was but that's a crazy thing about and I I do think I think we're talked about this last time I do think Trump in in if he's doing anything good for American society he's pointing out how ridiculous and arbitrary the worship of the American president is oh yeah that's not presidential whoa presidential means that you look dignified while you bomb a village in Yemen like a so we should just destroy presidential an idea gore Vidal said that he called it the uniquely American religion of President to worship president worship yeah that is really I mean it's really just a new version of Kings oh that's so funny that our whole foundation mythology is based on the rejection of the king and we immediately established King kingship which is what they did in in Christianity I think of Christianity this way like it's based in this Judaic religion that says let's get rid of the idea of a man that you worship or a figure or a God that you bow in front of there's one right in front of us right let's get rid of a statue that you've bowed out in front of and the next religion was like let's worship a human being like it's so bad so in us well it's alpha male chimpanzee stuff we always try to look to the number one the one that knows the most the oldest with the most scars it's gone through the most battle has the most wisdom lead us because you want to know which snakes are poisonous and what plants you can eat and what's gonna kill you right and and and everybody worships the past that's what's so funny to me about American it's the day after July 4th when everybody talks about the founding fathers is like those were dudes who had the education of they they were brilliant people in the 1800s and 1700s but I'm not like trying to I'm not trying to go to a doctor from the founding fathers days or like yeah people probably dunk people probably did Stan Thomas knows it probably Stan they probably just would what people smelled like back then like if you caught a gal after a bath you were psyched its asshole and vagina soup you sitting in a big tea pot in women put their vaginas in but yeah men if they hold up their assholes they're dicks and balls so they doesn't concern me what a guy smells like but what a girl smells like concerns me and but maybe it wouldn't have back then maybe it wouldn't know yeah maybe just your standards change means you're horny enough you don't care that is true I'll never forget this past yeah but you're an incredibly horny person let me just say guys my wife is so horny I love that word like being mobile is gay is gay yeah if you just start going like this people go as gay as fuck there's a story about Tom Cruise we heard this that he came to I can't remember who some comedy person who's like a normal human being right like but famous but not like Tom Cruise famous Tom Cruise like connected with that person I can't make it a better story fighting it remember who was but is somebody like that like your level or like or like a mark Duplass or you know I'm saying like a marked applauses well he's guy at your level know everybody there they're there made the show together nice on HBO my point isn't about the Duplass brothers is like they were just like semi-famous not like you got invited to a Super Bowl party at this person's house right like imagine if Tom Cruise come to your house for the super super super bowl party he was like asking Tom Cruise and he says yes yes we do right Tom Cruise be like I think I will be among the humans today with a brand new like clearly fresh football that his assistant like you know he's like tossing like a literal brand-new football in the air right and they're all talking about marriage at some point in the day and goes you know what the best part of being married is though right fucking your wife am i right you just fuck your wife and everybody's like sort of like a robot like an alien visitor fucking wife right I mean when you're that famous your work ethic it's like you just devote everything to that I think because like I have my agents were like they know that the agents who are Tom Cruise agents they said Tom Cruise always gets back within an hour when we send a script because I like keep a script for like three weeks and then by the time I the parts been cast they said Tom Cruise will read a script in an hour and get back to them and either like it or not like it like he's just like on the ball yeah he's like he's trying to win he's won and it's an inhuman instinct because our human instinct is to just atrophy in a way I mean you have to kind of fight it but easy to be lazy to procrastinate it's definitely easy to be lazy but it's not if you're gonna be Tom Cruise you really have to be on the ball there's no other way it doesn't just doesn't but that's not just what's going on and there's this some weird alien sort of behavior patterns that we don't recognize as being normal like when he jumped up on Oprah's couch as I come and love him and love him in love and it was like what the fuck is going on here person no it's like a person who doesn't understand French but you're speaking French to a French person you're saying all the right words it seems like every choice he makes outside of acting is based on what he's assuming normal human beings think is the normal behavior right because love is when you jump on a couch ago I love her which is informed by movies really right like that's more movie like right that's like John Cusack I'd say anything like oh that's what love looks like it's not yeah you know or telling a bunch of the fellas you know oh we're gonna have sex talk with the fellas oh no I like to fuck my wife huh the friction of her vagina makes me just splooge all right guys we're sick of fucking her was never I've just don't relate to that joke that you made yeah what a fucking strange guy he might be one of the strangest guys of all time I wish she would just like come clean what like one day just just to sit down and just be like give him some ecstasy and just talk about who he is like I don't even know the fuck I am and I've been in Scientology for so long yeah I like 13 guys last year they're gonna tell well he did a Chris Hardwick podcast right he did he did 101 interviews I wish you get could get him on here cuz you you you get a we get in but I don't think you could pierce that impenetrable I think he'll be fake with you too but even even if he's fake you find out of his face he finds himself well this he still appears he was telling Chris like I love movies you know I'm passionate about movies and Chris goes oh yeah like what are some of your favorite movies this is how politically like constructed he is he goes yeah just movies all movies all movies like movie star couldn't pick three movies that have inspired because he didn't want to Bick like you know a steel burg a Bruckheimer and a blah blah blah because then he piss off Coppola and Scorsese you know I mean it's all a construct I can't believe you did Chris's that's so cool you should have mommy show you could get him I think I got I got faith you to get him on Ron Miscavige who's David Miscavige's dad oh wow you can't have Scientology and I had Leah Remini on and we talked for three hours about how crazy her life in Scientology was and you're a classic SP there's no way you're getting times I'm suppressive person no I'm not the more I learn about the Catholic faith and all these like kid fuckers keep coming out the more I'm like that's the worst one do you see the new one keepers don't know the new encrusts there's a thousand cases of child molesting that they just uncovered I mean let's just shut down that religion was it Catholic no no I'm not doing a bit but all 8,000 of it was connected to her JJ Mia find it was just some I mean I didn't even read it because I looked at the headline and that first thought was duh and second thought was oh I just can't I mean it's so much worse than like making someone believe they can get acting work like their fucking little girls and boys and like permanently ruining their lives making them have like terrible flashbacks making them have like wide chunks of memory that they just don't remember then they do remember and it's like it's just the worst thing you can do and have you like sexual problems I'm not Catholic or Jewish now but I know the Pope the last Pope Ratzinger that guy one of the things that they one of the reasons why here to step down was because it found they found out that he was one of the guys that used to move people around he was one of the guys when someone get caught molesting children he would move into a new new precinct or that's that what do you call it that's what takes retract away we live actually right next to a rehabilitation to form a rehabilitation center for wayward priests on our street no way right and I was like oh I always thought oh wait word priests like I wonder what that means then after we saw that movie spotlight we looked it up and that's exactly where they were housing people it was one of the places they were housing the molesters Wow it makes this really interesting point about the church which is that the commonly held sort of folk belief about the Catholic Church is that when you take away someone's ability to have sex you will you will concentrate their sex drive and pervert it and you'll become a child molester now what spotlight the movie sort of point that it makes is it's the other way around it's that that basically when you're a child molester you go to the church because you know those they'll give you a Haven they'll feel colorful that's true though like it is hard to become a priest you have to like study scripture for I mean how long has the child you got a groom um you got to hang out you know I mean but serious you know how true that is so Ratzinger moved to god that went on to molest a hundred deaf kids because they couldn't talk about it there would be they can sign yeah but no one's gonna listen to them it's not like they can just start talking you know I mean it's like it's a way just I mean he was working with deaf kids like deaf orphans well it's just it's not that nobody would listen to a deaf person it's that I this is how scams works one step removed exactly it's one more what you want little easy what you want as a predator is is the the most vulnerable person that you can really predatory towards in the documentary keepers it wasn't until this girl came to the priest and said I actually have been molested he was like oh you have have you and then he started molesting her what are you waited for her to come into found that she was we commissioned she was weak and then that's who we picked so it's like why remember these Nigerians being a psychotic it's insane yeah and but that's what they want that's the the child molester it loves the weak the weak and vulnerable because if they go to a strong confident child who they know would just be like if you touch me I'll tell my fucking dad that girl's got a big mouth also you do not tell I've seen your baby pictures you weren't a hot kid and I was always trying it yeah but it's very much always boys right no it's very wise to keepers yeah yeah it's girls and boys it's like I've only seen documentaries on boys but the boys thing is weird but I kind of I do believe there's a math - like suppressing someone's sexuality and then it's just gonna come out in these other ways well I think that also monsters our orientation is spread equally across monsters yeah I think that I don't even know are you even gay if you're a child molester likes little boys is that even gay that seems like a third thing you're you're not even in a sexual zone anymore now you're in a pathology zone but since the cases are so there's just so many cases like maybe we should just let priests get married to change well they used to be able to but they were rock stars the problem was back in the days like in the during the lutheran days when martin luther was around priests controlled everything I mean they fucked everybody's wives they hope had wives and children Pope's had wives their children they had money they had armies the the the Roman Catholic pope controlled armies you know if they controlled troops like it was a totally different scene and then somewhere along the line they were fucking so many women they were like hey here's a new rule if you're gonna be a priest you can't fuck any chicks and then just the whole thing one has anybody know why that happened why the changeover happened cuz they were rock stars because they were banging everybody no sure why they made Sinatra okay so it was they were too irresponsible this is what I've read what I've read is that there were there was a real concern amongst people that were you know under the tutelage of these priests that these guys were out of control there's banging everybody find out what was the reason that's why they made them not able I wonder do you think that is it wasn't that long ago well he was like a thousand years ago it might have been less that's so interesting I think was less than a thousand years ago because I know that during the Genghis Khan era the Pope still at armies and I think still I think they were still allowed to be married yep true and I bet they were using their religious status to abuse their power probably probably women would like fall for them too like there was no thing about if there's no musicians there's no comedian oh the gestures of that comics back then but if you do with like a floppy hat yeah but they were like cruise ship comics they couldn't get they got killed no rock stars they were just like had white hair and what's the deal with the latrine that you have to shoot him what is the deal with Cornish game hen the white hair play the piano that was later that was okay this is like a dude plucking a lute I'd like to find out you have a time line there is this idea that the guy the itinerant singer that would come to town and like pluck the lute until like the tail was always fucking everybody everywhere who we all came from who's like Robert Plant we came from the jesters that's rock star versus comedian right we were the people who would like coming in on wagons yeah like juggling manure you know like the king do you think that you guys have like genetic ancestry to former comedians I believe in that more than motion does again I don't believe I just feel like I have a blood memory of like like for example I do think there are people in comedy who are doing it because that's where like the energy is right now and they're just like trying to like make money and write actors I think it's move beyond that it's like now it's like everybody that you would have been a DJ when I was like 17 is now a comedian right well what I was gonna I don't really care I mean I think you just have to like bother yourself doesn't bother me I think it's cool because when you go big then the ten percent of geniuses that wouldn't have started if it wasn't cool will start and then the 90% people that were gonna be garbage that what do they they don't matter damn ninety ten huh uh probably less probably ninety nine one now a genius yes and that starts comedy that to becoming like a forget genius person that starts comedy does a set at an open mic too becomes like one of the like great comedians like you know even in the top 10% of comedians that's what that's that's got to be 1% that's the point that but the problem with is like you say once they start because the 99.9% that start never even make it that's part of it yeah but like it's like the 1% that do the 0.1% that actually become professional communes like how many people out of your group of open my Kiersey used to hang with how many are still doing stand-up because how many of them have a TV show all of them now so your ratios are a little off I remember when I would makers well ya know that the the numbers are very our start I I remember when I first started like I would have I would have fucked a let a man fuck me 50 times to get like a Montreal spot and now it's like guilty yeah 50 times I thought about it a lot and they would they would rub my back very gently in smelly pig man like Alonzo Bodden okay that he could do 25 times I looked at Alonzo Bodden fingers once and I was like there are men with dicks smaller than your finger your finger yeah oh well that's rough if that's true it's true anyway Alonzo if you're listening every time I look at your hands well I think of his dicks small dicks but my point oh is that I would have done anything for a Montreal spot or or a spot on on The Tonight Show and now there's young comics who like like nah I'm not really trying to like be a second lead on a show right now I'm really waiting around for my vehicle things have changed I dated girls like that it was like I don't want to do TV I'm holding out for a film because I was on a television show at the time and she was uh it's like saying that she didn't want to do TV it's like it was beneath her oh and you're doing TV at the time yeah I'm a fan of that show I took an acting class of Paris Hilton and she and the teacher was like who wants to do TV and everyone raised their hand except her and it was like who wants to do this movie yeah I guess you know the Paris Hilton is one of the top highest-paid DJs in the world she can't have good taste in music so she's not a DJ she also has like 20 perfumes I know a sock should go into DJing it seems like it's an open market guy who's got a billboard on sunset most is like he is like DJing at a swimming pool in Las Vegas it was a huge famous celebrity DJ you know how in LA we'll always know what's happening Vegas a bun like Paul Harris or one yeah and it was literally you look down and it's like Vegas Swim Club it's like teaching a pool but those pools will have 15,000 people stuffed into the area dude that's probably where I would hang what about horny girls she's gonna go hang out she's on her way she's going we're stopping there on the honeymoon tour we're a Nixon mask just go crazy beautiful naked woman body yes Nixon mask oh yeah I heard that they recently this could be bullshit started making more money on their nightclubs and on then on the casinos that's got to be true um it may be I don't know I don't know what the numbers are but I would imagine they make a lot of money on the casinos because there's people like what's up I just heard Jon Taffer that guy that does bar rescue talking about it on another interview he said they'll go in on Friday night and make about 500,000 bucks for their club show and then wake up the next morning and do the pool at noon for 150 and oh no no no you're talking about the actual performers we're talking about the club itself I'm talking about the casino that the casino makes but imagine that if the DJ makes 650 thousand dollars for a weekend you got to multiply that by what 20 a hundred percent well then they have the odd person like I am on that show dice about Andrew Dice Clay have you ever heard him do this you know I mean I deserve a real thing but in the show the whole premise is that he's paying off his gambling debt to the casino because it's like $800,000 and it's the only way you can pay it back but that's a true story yeah he was debt like he would lose on $800,000 in one night so as long as they have people like that they must be making a lot of money right yeah there's always gonna be there's always like the old lady like putting in nickels but then there's also like dice but you also have to think like how much money does it cost to run a casino the overhead is insane right it's also they also exist in this odd like Venn diagram of like a legal business and an old world like criminal enterprise and I don't mean that in a Mafia way like don't they have like India like why is it even legal for them to let someone rack up an eight hundred thousand dollar debt like a normal business business would say sir you're 20 dollars over your limit so we're gonna would they just know like he's got credit he's the ice he's gonna make money he gambled away the deed to his house at the Riviera and like they just lost it might hurt my Nonna's wedding ring and then someone told me when I was at I was at Foxwoods and they as I was performing and they said that at Mohegan Sun they're like yeah it's really gotten really bad at Mohegan Sun when you gamble away your car they won't even give you a ride home but we at Foxwoods are giving people rides like people are just like they run out of money and they're like okay I could win it all back if I just sell the car right and it's done yeah here's what's interesting though if you win they ban you like my friend Dana if you Dana White is a notorious gambler but he wins millions of dollars sometimes he's won I think he said he lost as much as 1 million dollars and he's won as much as 7 million in enough Oh has he gotten banned from place yeah really yes Dan yes he's a celebrity so really does he get banned but he gets banned and then he pulls the UFC out of them like these two do UFC at the palms and he killed the palms and the palms banned him so he's like fuck you I'll ban you and I moved to the Hard Rock or wherever the hell they moved to next but yeah they they've banned him from a bunch of casinos because he's really good at blackjack Wow can you what stakes is it what what's the minimum bet for the Dana white black don't wish I know that sounds fucking crazy is that legal to ban someone once they win at the thing you're saying I'm saying these casinos are not fully legal they're like in this weird area they reserve the right to ban you you kicked their ass which is crazy can they say your card-counting or something card counting I mean even if you are it doesn't matter it's legal I mean you can do whatever the fuck you want I think I think it's as long as it's on your head if you're not using a calculator or something it's technically within the rules of the game because your job is to sit down I guess card counter but blackjack they haven't no I mean do you suppose to not know like if you lie if you have knowledge suppose to ignore it right if you know how to count cards that's so stupid it's like going to a bar watching a guy roofie or drink up can't pay attention to that it's not the rules like to know what the fucking rules are right the rules are like if you know how many decks they're using and you know what you know words go in there and when not to hit and just play it smart and count and think and calculate I don't know why just analyze retry why does they know the rupee thing and we all accepted it sorta it's your house we were like a hot Joe you got that but I was like why why does dana white gamble Oh Rosie the famous basketball player that like okay Charles Barkley what drives those people they're so rich why else what do you also people have been hit in the head a lot Dana's been hit in the head a lot notoriously impulsive and notoriously susceptible to addiction whether it's gambling addiction alcohol really yeah yeah it's a big part of CTE with chronic traumatic encephalopathy and a head a big part of it yeah is he a fighter or something it was still on boxing when he was young fellow has dumb rattled yeah the times got that dome rattled you're not supposed to get punched in the head ever right you definitely that's where I get punched in the head multiple times a day for the worst what about like you train right yeah I don't do any kickboxing sparring at all no because of that yeah and even in jiu-jitsu you like slamming to someone's knee accidentally or a head you get your head bonked you don't rub but it's not that common but when I was kickboxing boy I got hit in the head a lot to the point where I just like sometimes I think about some of the decisions I've made I'm like what's going on in there huh what screws are loose it's even with headgear you're saying you've still worse it actually makes an an artificial lever like save your head is this large that means if you clip it here it's got more love a fulcrum effect wears of your head is smaller and compact and you just take it ah so Richard Nixon mask would be bad because you had a big old tin knocking not to miss Novak's the rubber isn't the mask but the the idea is not necessarily just the initial impact it's how much your head moves like how might like the stronger your neck is the less likely you are to get brain damage so those guys do a lot of neck exercises just just just to keep their head stay but when it gets hit the idea is like the more your head moves the more your brains gonna swish around inside your dome and break off the connective tissue that's also part of the problem this connective tissue that's like really soft almost like cotton candy like tissue that connects your brain to the skull where stuff gets ripped up would you rather be a NFL whatever the guy that linebacker so today sure or like long-term prizefighter long term prizefighter for sure really long term prizefighters can get through it like there's guys like Bernard Hopkins that you know fought into is 50s who speaks well you know and there's see the problem is even guys that speak well there's the weird shit that they do the impulsive stuff there's their like if you talk to people that are CTE experts they tell you some really disturbing things about brain damage about how it manifests itself and the weird things that men find themselves doing they don't even know why they're doing it they're just doing it and like real impulsive behavior and just stomp it on the gas on the highway and just like weird gambling stuff and sex stuff and drug stuff and a lot of it is connected to CTE but if you looked over in the Tasha was crying watching is it MMA like where they're like doing 69 and just writhing you're like yeah it's like like one's got the head and in his dick and then the other ones got his superhero trick and they just kind of like ride back and forth like one of the main commentator that's what you say he's got his head in his dick and there writhing times I have said things along those lines I see I listen sport you have to understand some a woman who's like not into sports and then sees that it's it's I it's like I don't understand it she comes in and she says always did derisively did your team win I'm like the video game lets you get a little gayer than the actual it's a great game could be no it looks like a dude that's that's a dude kind of triangle so it's people who don't they don't care about brain damage though like these this sport you get this sport break is not funny like you don't you think that's important or the connective tissue connective tissue it's not that it's it's not that they don't care it's just that this is something that they started doing when they were young they got really good at it and they see it as a path to making career and they like thrills they like doing things dangerous and excitements and exciting some of them just accept the risks and some of them say I would rather live a dangerous life that's exciting then I really fucking boring life I can respect that sitting on the couch atropine I can respect that I mean like of course this is funny though this is like is like going to like Devon DaVinci's podcast and being like I don't know about this art stuff Joe can take it I don't think you're right what my perspective is when I see it but I now you put it like that too it's like what what's the alternative get it get a job in a factory or get a job I'll die I mean this is temporary this is not gonna last right so for them it's like how am I gonna use my meat vehicle yeah and am I gonna use it for fun and just go crazy and I mean that's that's the thought process behind it is like yep I know I'm doing damage to it and you know I know a lot of guys that I've known when they were in their prime where they were just killing everybody and now they're broken that's looking like these I know guys who can't even brush their teeth really their shoulders are so shot they have to like brush their teeth left-handed and they suck at it and the crazies gonna fuckin move their head and how old are they in the 30s yeah there is something about the human animal that wants it's an interesting facet of humanity that wants to achieve greatness for some reason I was the glory of winning in that too is also directly related to the danger of doing it's like there's something dangerous about it that makes it super exciting if you pull it off it's winning a fight is it's a crazy feeling it's even more we're making all these other people happy too because people have like voted on you know or how do you do it you vote on them it's so many people just I've noticed so many people get their moods is changed if their team wins so it's like oh that's the problem a though I went uh Cadell started losing is when I stood I realized like MMA is not a good sport for like having to have your guy win right eventually your guy will always lose oh really always because they'll get older that's like just the inevitable reality as opposed to a team that's people exactly the dynamics your team can always be a winner but if you root for one fighter that fighter will get old and the young people will come in and it's like 38 yeah no that's way old oh really 38 is Wales so like 32 I see now with drug-testing he used to be back in the day that when you would get tested you would it was really like they would say it's like an intelligence test it's more than a drug test like you just don't take anything the remaining few days before your test and they're just testing your pee for like really obvious stuff but now it's super comprehensive and they use you sada the US anti-doping Association and they fucking crawl up your ass with a microscope people wake you up checking for what people want okay yes they're in the room we look at your dick because guys have used rubber dick yeah I went to rehab kids I know I knew all the tricks the whiz inators I remember you'd get your homie to piss into a bag and you'd have the bag in your pocket what kind of drugs our MMA people doing oh right it's not like Joe I gotta say your impression of Natasha's now I'm Lorna okay hold on I just thought that people had you know standards and that they wouldn't do that but that you're saying they would all do it if they could no not all there's definitely a core group of champions who have never thought about taking drugs and still don't thank you what steroids there's a lot to do the problem sir is also is that when one person starts doing it yep the person beneath him will lose or has to be pressured to do it and so it creates this like I'm sorry if people out there are upset that I'm not a sports fan don't think about them they just talk do you believe that's what you do you know the back don't sweat it you do though I don't I mean I'm just like you thought sports or holding hospital I don't know she's doing a bit what's elevating us that's holding us back what salivating I think making sports like our main thing I hate when sports are on and any sort of public establishment I think it's aesthetically ok I won't know it's okay you don't like when you see sports in an establishment I find it depressing depressing what about law and order when you watch that there's like one notch down very depressive it's been dead for hours Natasha I will say is is extremely connected to aesthetics more than any human being I've ever met in my life I think tennis is a nice aesthetic there you go aesthetics okay I would I was oh that's a sport I know okay I think like a tennis match yeah I could handle that why is that okay and like honestly because I like how they like how they dress what about basketball no actually he's someone there's a darkness yeah it's a couple of chicks they're really good at it I mean I think it's probably because I grew up and I was always the last to get picked for sports maybe that's why I really want to go dude when I hug you I'm more always where I'm gonna break you you weigh like 80 pounds I weigh 205 you do not that small come on you do not weigh a hundred pounds you're lying yourself do you do I mean I'm not like that skinny I'm just small she weighs 105 while we fuck and it's a hundred when we're not fucking I have a five pound bear I mean and I didn't I didn't want to mention that I asked the toughs not to bring it out but it needs to be said yeah I've got an Alonzo Bodden I don't like sports I also don't like video game the only thing I watch is fighting I literally don't watch sport I don't know I don't even know the rules like any sport other than MMA and Bob I don't watch them I don't I don't even know when they're happening like when someone says oh you see the NBA championship game like oh when was it no like it was last night man you didn't watch I'm the same it was a thing the only sport i watch is MMA and have watched consistently since I was a kid is MMA and then boxing very secondarily and I can't get in the kickboxing at all really don't worry I've seen clips and everything I don't know why I can't I can't get into because I like anime much more than boxing but then you'd think I would be more in the kickboxing than boxing but I'm not sports just seems like men exercising but like I just that's I mean I know it's more than that but never I feel like if you saw opera you'd probably like this just seems like fat people screaming in Opera they like it you know I felt like it was this like antiquated form of entertainment that I watched i was super duper high when I went to see cuz I knew I knew I had to see it oh just I had to do a favor so when I when I went to watch I was like bullies out of my fucking mind it was good in thing but what's interesting is I what I really started paying attention to was all the people in the audience and there's like this class of people that probably live in like Bel Air and Beverly Hills and want to be seen at the Opera and it's like a big deal to say they're going to the Opera and I was like watching this was like they can't possibly like this like even if they like it they don't like it that they don't like it like people like the UFC that's true that's true you're right pretending to like there's a different level to you like it's not true it's like sophisticated entertainment I mean like we went to the Orca to the orchestra the symphony recently and Moshe hated it I've been I went to the symphony when I was a kid with my grandma she used to take me and there are some bangers you know yeah you know like don't know you know he was just in there like doing this thing but we went to see I don't even smaller and you read the description Mahler and it's like laminations on death not not good discordant ooh not pleasant to listen so we're gonna go sit down hour-and-a-half performance of like something that in its description is like you didn't like it either did you no and there was like a la moshe got in a fight with two different elderly people he tried to help this woman there was I was walking in people are on like double crutches it's so old you can't imagine it it's like it's so old and so white it's like unbelievable you can't believe it you know and I was walking in and this old man was sitting down he's like 85 and so I told him he started to get up to let me through ago you don't need to get up I can kind of crawl around you and he goes we're not all as young as you some of us are gonna die soon and I was like oh I'm trying to like go I just read the Wikipedia pages I go like oh well I guess that's what we're here to listen to right and the guy's nothing iced me out and I sit there like bored and did the worst and it's got it's the worst kind of symphony Mahler because it always seems like it's ending it'll be like dun dun dun and you're like ooh let's get the fuck out what about the old lady who yelled at you and she almost fell down the stairs Deniz we were leaving I was an old man and he was so feeble and and wobbly that I was staring at his body like in my mind you ever have this kind of situation where you're like this this is gonna this person's gonna fall I can feel it in my bones right before like way up on the rafter in the steepest possible like it would and I could feel it like if this guy's gonna fall he's too feeble he's too old to be sending these stairs and he sure enough does he just starts to like tip over and he still goes for it because I was already like looking at him I grabbed him by like the the top the collar and the bottom of his jacket and I just like held him up right oh my god and he fucking like just like shoved me off of him gave me a dirty look and stormed off and I was like I just saved your fucking life you old bitch why did it go tanzie slips listen his wife complaining about her stool I saw more blood in my stool he's like I'm just gonna fall you know my grandma its glorious I'm good steep angle no I said to me no he what she said to me on her deathbed like days before she died she the like man she said if there is a God he saves the worst part of your life for the very end that's like bye-bye grandma thinking about that because I was like going into it like an old person's home seems so depressing like I would never want to do that to go away from your your stuff in your house you know like I'm just trying to think what's the best way to go I think people by themselves in a home alone well it's super depressing too yeah yeah when I lived in New York when I first moved there I stayed with my grandparents in New Jersey and my grandmother and had an aneurysm they gave her 72 hours to live she lived 12 years Wow yeah dude it was how were those 12 years I was only there living with them for a few months I think I lived there for mmm maybe five months six months but it was bad it was like my grandfather they had a nun or a nun nurse would come over and they would help but this like she would have horrible bed sores she couldn't move she's paralyzed she was completely vegetable I know she would talk a little bit too through fall now it's all falling out does she want to live with that no no but I do think like the two ways the two main ways to die are like to have a death bed like that seems kind of glamorous because then you could like call people to you and give them wisdom and like have last words know but if if you died in an accident then you never get to have any of that no but you can't have like those funny last one the third way what is what is you your bit about your grandma on her deathbed I don't remember the third the third way though is to go mad and to shit your pants and to my grandma did my grandma's great fear her entire life was becoming a feeble senile person and of course it came true because the only way to avoid that is to have a heart attack or an accident I feel bad that I say that about my Nana it's just a dumb joke well you know they have assisted death now in California and eleven people did it on like the first day that's crazy please my which I absolutely believe in I mean I think god damn it why do we need to have people die of natural causes and they're horribly suffering and well they were asked that's a good question right it's like what is suffering right if you're a physically fine you have 70 beats per minute resting heart rate you have no cancer but you just five pound there every day five pound dick every day hating life yeah it's crazy in Scandinavia where they've had euthanasia for a long time they they've started to accept that a person who suffering from chronic depression can opt out and take assisted suicide as a means to escape their depression isn't a part of the problem with problem with chronic depressions like we don't know what they're feeling yeah like if you if like someone you have a broken arm like okay I broke my arm I kind of get it but if someone says I have chronic depression it's like okay what does it feel like I don't know I don't know what your depression is and and your chronic depression might be different than another person's and another person it's like and how do you know that it can't be turned around with a pill or with exercise and diet and if you did turn around like I have friends were suicidal and now they're super happy so it's hard well the problem is the main one of the main tenants of depression is hopelessness so if you can't right feel at all hopeful how are you ever gonna try to get your way out another strange thing about mental illness in my experience and I have a lot of it in my family and is that it always looked not always but it off except for schizophrenia and stuff looks obviously like that person's sick and can't help it but with depression or alcoholism that kind of thing it always feels like you could act differently if you just tried a little bit harder you could not be doing this you could be less depressed you could go apply for a job you could get up it look if the friend is like a schizophrenia you can see is impossible but it looks to the normal brain like close enough to normal that they could just change their circumstance if only they tried harder and mental illness is maybe the inability to try harder so it's very seductive to the normal brain to think of mentally ill people is like lazy or not trying to get better yeah I just think it's one of those very odd things to quantify almost impossible like I don't know what you're feeling you know and what is like what's normal for some people you know and like some people are just ecstatic all the time and like what what is normal for them and also antidepressants are like literally just a chemical experiment with somebody's brain go if I tinkle this and do this I know people who ever since they started taking antidepressants has changed their life they're like way better sure have you ever taken either have you ever taken an antidepressant no someone gave me some adderall once when I was a kid when I was like 13 you remember your personality changing I remember my brain doing things to me that I didn't like I'm basically like I started to see things in the horizon of my vision I started if my I started to feel like less hungry I started there like way to see things in the horizon of your vision you know oh like actual apparitions not apparitions like like sort of like sort of hallucinogenic fractal situations you know I started to see that it just like I could feel it tinkering with my brain of course what was happening was I was getting given antidepressants to combat like being a juvenile delinquent like druggie and so it wasn't it wasn't psychiatrist gave you this yeah I was all fucked up with psychiatrist psychiatrist will give you that's the real problem right they'll give it to people that don't need it what's happening with the opioid crisis like they'll people just like they'll just give you ox econ ten like it just seems so crazy it is crazy this doctor told me this weekend I was talking to this but a family member that's a doctor that it takes eight days of of a regimen of what's the drug in the in the current there's one drug that all the opiate addicts are getting addicted to it's not oxycontin it's not oxycontin it's a fentanyl yeah fentanyl it's actually eight days to get hooked and a and a treatment regiment is something like twelve days so it's like everybody that's given the treatment regimen for regular pain is having to kick it when they get off and that's why that's why we've got a crisis that's incredible that eight days in you're hooked it's insane because everybody who takes if you break your leg or something they give you fentanyl I don't know why they give you medical marijuana for a broken leg I don't know for pain it's real simple I mean you're saying it like you haven't thought it through like because they make a lot more money selling you something you can't get anywhere else doctors are it's not like the first rule of being a doctor we're not gonna hurt you they have relationships with pharmaceutical companies means it's but there's also a bunch of doctors that are ignorant to the actual positive benefits of pot they have a negative association about pot people don't smoke pot but also to get real like if you have a compound fracture you don't what you need is more than medical marijuana at least at first you don't agree with me you would take and you put hurts you pop it back in and what you what would you take Oh once you get the cast on it you're fine it's just you just sit there it sucks when you move but you don't have to take that stuff you don't in medical marijuana supposedly they did a recent test in ninety three percent of people with chronic pain preferred marijuana over opiates god I can my mom has pain and like she's never tried drugs and I just can't get her to try you know like she there's such a stigma like she'd probably try fentanyl before because a doctor sure a doctor said it was okay then marijuana wish we could change the not a fan of pain pills I hear you reconstructed and I didn't take anything yeah I'm not taking them we took marijuana though No smoking pot back then how much did you suffer it's not that bad it's just pain it depends on your yeah it's the kind of pain that you just go okay well that's what that feels like mm-hmm okay now I know what that is you know back pain is one of the harder ones everything you do that's a very overrated pain by the way it's nothing it's like scratches ya know I've heard people say it hurt more than anything in their life so you're just it doesn't hurt them it just doesn't hurt that much it really just it just absolutely does not hurt that much there's spots where it's not comfortable like bones like little elbow bone when they go over the elbow bone and oddly enough like right when they get like close to your chest that's painful but not childbirth it's fucking manageable you just go whoa it's like you just I think a lot of it is just how you think about the course and you Fester what's the most painful does anyone know what the most painful thing a human being can experience is what's like that the top threshold it seems to me a compound fracture is as bad as it gets but maybe I'm told I just seems awful burning to death probably a broken bone suck and cut but broken bone a compound fracture just a broken bone and in a horrible laceration all right I guess that's true I have arm and it wasn't that bad I think burning I think you're right burning burning it's one of the most absolutely painful ones burning and not burning to death I think that that's rough the recovery process from do you know that when burn victims are in the hospital other burn victims random strangers go to them and talk to them I didn't know that my friend Zach Zach craigger who's up from the whitest kids you know and he's a successful actor he's on that show wrecked he told me he burned himself at a party in the Caribbean and in the Caribbean people would go visit burn victims from the Caribbean would go visit like a community because apparently the pain is so intense and insane that they nice it's let me say this now before I forget people who loved steve-o steve-o did something I know what the fuck he did but on his Instagram if you're going to Denver this weekend steve-o is gonna be in Denver he has horrible burns all over his body and he's looking for some sort of an EMT to take care of him like someone to help him dress his wounds because he's still gonna do his shows at the comedy works what and apparently he's gonna you won't tell the story of what happened to him but he put it because he wants to tell it onstage but he put these images would put a video of it up on Instagram and his fucking skin is falling off of his arm but he's yeah it looks really bad don't do your show dude girl some want to say to steve-o if you listen to this there's a new stem cell therapy that they've created for people that have burns where they spray stem cells all over the burn and the healing time is radically reduced as well as the scarring the scarring is radically reduced another thing to look into that they put tilapia skin on the burn you heard about this whoa there's fish scales on burns apparently is one of them much so much more healing than bandages whoa I don't know why but it like creates this sort of you know skin on skin healing energy Murli there you go doctors trying on fire burn victims using fish skin that's fascinating okay yeah he's gonna be okay but he's got go to the steve-o Instagram page so you can see it but the stem-cell treatment is pretty radical like they've shown people with third-degree burns they spray it on them and in a couple of days it's gone that's crazy yeah like literally no scar no nothing it just heals that's interesting yeah I mean it's we're in a new world know this and the next one the next one do you take it off oh wait what about that one oh that man he took it down that's a video of him getting blood poured on his face oh he took it down whoa that's crazy so he is he was asking for people to come and see him in Denver like all that stuff all over his body all those uh like he showed what that looked like click on that because it just seems like yeah fuck this is one video that he had okay this day he's not going to show anything but the next video he showed what's going on under those bandages and it's horrific oh maybe he got flags what's what's the most painful thing you've ever experienced what about you not you got nothing I mean your shoulder I'm a baby her shoulder popped out in Hawaii and it was that was not even that painful though it wasn't I just don't like getting like blood drawn I felt very weak as a man at that moment she popped out of the ocean and her shoulder was like separating bodysurfing and I was just I said you did you get an MRI do you know what's going on oh yeah it was like three years ago dislocated yeah right but no tearing or no dislocated my shoulder I didn't even know weird yeah I could see it physically on her body but I was looking at her arm going like I don't know what to do about that I don't know what I'm gonna do I guess I could hoist her on my shoulder and walk back because it was like there was a my arm and it came back I just popped back you're supposed to like for some people you're supposed to like lay them down and stretch their arm right pull it out and then it'll fall back in the most I know about shoulder dislocations is from lethal weapon so slam them up against the wall but some people just have loose shoulders like I know some girls who like every time she has sex or like 105 times her shoulder becomes dislodged I'll be honest Joe and Tasha some of the Lucis shoulders in the game yeah maybe those girls are just like drama queens just like being hurt can you imagine though how bad that would be if you were fucking a girl and her shoulder got dislocated yeah that wasn't really bad I'll get her some pads shoulder pads some just like some football support yeah I do that anyway just because I like a more masculine woman so I liked everywhere a big back something with a helmet yeah just like so we're gonna give her a little TBI traumatic bootie injury man you guys have been in jail yeah we should be in jail just for saying this right married now so we can aren't you glad to not be dating right now oh yeah it seems like a nightmare for everybody I know that is oh yeah it seems so scary if you get lucky you find someone that's awesome it's it's good time and it's fun exciting but you guys got it right under the wire well you know like you know like now it's like if if a girl wants to she can just say that she didn't consent and you'd probably I'd make them find forms fill out forms need forms I think just have a stack of them next to the bed just to let chicks know that's this is like really casual all these so many forms all these big stars do that they make you like Instagram Tom Cruise not like the beat there's a story about Justin Bieber will make you like videotape yourself saying like I'm the same mind and body and I choose to fuck Justin Bieber you know that makes sense because kinks yeah allegedly and you know they're probably trying to get over on them yeah I would imagine if you're that wealthy like you have to worry about everything you do all the time I'm sorry there are a lot of guys who are probably trying to take advantage of girls so for sure maybe there's more of that maybe that's on the rise so it's bad for you boy well I think one it in I bet it's the same as it's always been there's always been creeps and there's always been creeps on both sides this is the thing is that there's more creeps in the man side let's get real there's more like there's more psychos maybe more crazy people that you date but there's more predators that you as a they're more male predators than their female sure there are female printers and there are psycho men but if we were to really do some number crunching you know I would imagine it's not even I've never had 5050 I've never had a experience that I was actively scared and I've had experience where I was like I'm not spending the night at this girl's house because I don't know if I'd wake up remember a friend this girl emailed him and we were left well I'm just saying that's too real it is real I remember this one girl I was at her house and I was like oh I this person maybe would kill me in my sleep she was at she was crazy she was I remember she kept she was like real Hollywood like like punk trash right when I moved to town you okay with this story and she kept going she kept asking me to put a cigarette out on her and I was like I don't think I can do that and I don't think I can do that and I bet like ash on earth full put and then I remember that she was um she was she kept when she'd go down on me and she kept like horribly but biting me in my genitals and she was like biting my balls I remember and I was like please stop that like please please no and then all of a sudden we kept like making out and then she looked down and she looked she was like what is that like the way you say what is that when somebody's got like an STD right you know that like what is this and I looked down and there was a fucking contusion in my nuts okay providing from her bite she like burst a blood-vessel there was a gum and then she was like mad about it she wouldn't know she told and and you'll have a little respect my wife's in the room so she's sucking my balls so hard just you know I know we didn't have sex but if we had this is you didn't have permission and it would have been written right she goes her friend was at Reed College actually we're not we yes I read I read not Evergreen but read where it's like started the center of like the woke sort of PC campus culture she extreme that's very extreme she called him and said she was drunk and she came on to him and was like his name's Andrew Michonne he's a oh I shouldn't say that I don't know that - because I just like telling his he didn't do anything no no he's she came on to him let's not say her name I don't know who she is but he's a comedian and I just figured he'd want a shout out but he's a great comedian he'd definitely avoid a punchline at any rate he he didn't hook up with her she came on to him and he was like I'm not feeling this no thank you went home went to bed gay guy and and then she she texted him like a week later was I just wanted to thank you for not taking me home that night because I was drunk it wouldn't have been consensual would have been rape so thank you well that's a lot of people wanna like firmly establish that though that if you are dull and you're drinking and you have sex it's rape well it is hard though cos you have to understand being a woman you are so vulnerable like men have more upper-body strength we do have a hole and they have a thing that goes into the hole whoa crazy things right now that no one knows it's like we drop that kind of knowledge you have to imagine yourself if you had a hole instead and you didn't have those muscles and you were just walking around well what is the idea is women or men are afraid that women are going to laugh at them women are afraid men are going to kill them yeah those are both very different things yeah but that's a reality is that the just like when you say there's like the equal dispensation of predators on the each side it's like well no there really aren't right that really is I said there's creeps on both sides what a necessarily thing it was equal no but what I mean is and I'm not trying to I wasn't doing that celexa I said that but I did probably was flippant but my point is that the world that women walk around in is one where they fear that the worst-case scenario is they're going to be kidnapped raped and murdered yeah and our worst-case scenario is Prop usually is not that yeah well exactly the rape part in particular most the time it's not that and if it is it's also from a fucking man from a dude yeah I mean I had an argument with a guy who's a men's rights activist about that it was like actually more men or rape than women although he's stupid they're raped by men yeah fuck you're just right just reinforcing the argument against men that's like such a dumb argument well they always like they haven't even looked into it they like they really it's such a surface thing to say like if you done like the next step like who's raping it oh yeah guys pro shouldn't bring it up yeah you should probably didn't bring it up you want to support men if you like your whole thing is that men are awesome like men are actually the victims were raped more than women right such a good point by other men right this guy was saying it like I got you with this fact that I bet you didn't know well because people like to talk in talking points they don't like to I mean we had experience with all right people on your show what's that just that they they don't think things truly remember that guy was trying to tell you that the people at the woman's March he's like how did they take off their their work it's like it was on a Saturday that's right we had this guy on the show that was like the problem is it was all these out-of-work people that just I don't know about this was a talking point in the write about the women's marches or just about protests in general I don't know how these people are able to have such privilege that they can just take work off to go protest it's like first of all there's a history of protests where people strike that's the whole idea the second of all the women's March in particular was on a Saturday kid named Lucien wint rich know you were asking the Milo enough who is who's like a good all right right this reason I came to you because we were trying to get basically we did the show right and we started with cultural appropriation we ended with the alt-right would meet the alt-right written so we were trying really hard to really explore ideas right and I guess if there's there's one thing I realized in the in the wake of we definitely triggered the alright with that cultural appropriation thing people were very upset that we even broached the topic without condemning it essentially and I think there's one thing I realized in the wake of all of the show is like there's one position I truly don't respect it's I disagree with you therefore I won't listen to you fuck you yeah that's that's really there's nothing about that that I have any respect for no I completely agree I think I want to know how you came to that conclusion and sometimes you could find if you do mean especially if you particularly disagree with something someone says and you thought your side through and you talk to someone with an open mind you can actually find like the holes in their logic and it'll help you understand maybe you've got some holes in your own logic their own experiences they're drawing from to help you come up with their way of thinking and I definitely in exploring all those topics found just what you're saying I found like the part of the gun argument that I really fully wrapped my brain in my heart around the pro-gun that the Second Amendment right I mean I'm still not like a wildly pro-gun guy but I totally a hundred percent had this understanding of where they were coming from that I never had before that really you know a lot of the condemnation of the left is that they condemn identity politics right and really when it comes to Second Amendment stuff it and also the truth is the alt right - it's also identity politics just identity politics in the reverse it's not like leftist identity politics it's more gun owner identity like in other words when you condemn a gun owner you're you the liberal thinker is going oh I'm condemning guns I'm condemning violence and what you don't understand is you're condemning a person where their hearing is you're calling them their identity they're the thing that makes them passionate illegitimate stupid and based in ignorance and violence and of course a person is gonna react and go go fuck yourself I'll never listen to your argument if you start your argument by basically telling them their whole lifestyle is bullshit yeah there's a real problem with the the gun ownership argument and one of the big problems is the mass shootings right everybody condemns mass shootings they're horrible they're terrifying and they only happen with most of the time people with guns I mean we've had some situations recently in Europe where people driving over people with cars and there's a lot of insane shit that's going on over there with that and then people have been stabbing people in some places but for the most part it's guns right but my thought on it is always that it's a mental health issue there are more guns in this country than there are people so if you have 300 million guns and every once a year or so one of these things happens and you have this mass shooting this horrible tragedy one of the most constant things is mental illness almost all those people are either on psycho psychoactive medicine either they're on some sort of antipsychotic or an antidepressant or the coming off of it they have a history of psychiatric treatment a history of illness of mental illness it's a hundred percent it's almost a hundred percent of people that are like severely mentally ill we have horrible standards from mental illness in this country for people just being roaming around the street and a lot of that came from Reagan when Reagan let those people yes when they let those people loose that means people would need fucking treatment they needed help as a lot of them it's a lot of people that are on disassociative they're on all these sort of anti-psychotic medication they're fucked up man like the real issues and then they can get a hold of guns I agree with you but I also think there's a flaw in that logic because the mass shootings didn't start commensurate with the shutting down of the mental health facilities in California when did they they seem to me to be a more Kent State obviously was the original no Kent State was the national card I'm sorry what was the one in the tower in second I'm sorry yes in ten states no hi excuse me yeah that that was like the first right the first yeah big one but the modern phenomenon of the mass shooting is it is a fairly modern one it feels like the last twenty ten twenty years right I know that that guy in the tower was mentally ill oh I'm not disagreeing with you at all that there's that mental illness is a huge part of the pie you're saying the Reagan thing I'm not saying the Reagan thing is a hundred percent the reason for it but it's a big part of why there are so many mentally ill people that were released in that time I mean I can remember what sure kid cuz my dad was talking about it he was like it's crazy there's like so many more homeless people now that's someone in there talking themselves they're all fucked up yeah we just a bend in these human beings cuz their brains aren't working right the ice the idea was that Reagan shut down all the mental health facilities in California and the idea was that they would be replaced by community centers where each community each neighborhood would have like a check-in center and the check-in centers of course were never built so the corners just hit the street California was I thought it was when Reagan was president it mean change the standards national matter I could be wrong yeah I think it was when he was president I might be wrong hi it's all dark and they never made the check-in they just didn't exist I mean what I what the only thing I was saying though was that it's there's something else happening in America that's like almost feels mystical or spiritual with it when it comes to mass shootings because it's like there are other countries with mentally ill people that have access to guns and maybe it's that we that we have a less a lesser standard of care for our mentally ill but Cal Canada also has people babbling on the streets although they have limited access to guns there's something else going on it feels like to me and that is totally an activist my opinion but feels like to me there's something that we don't understand that it is of course mental illness and it is of course access to guns and there's some third thing that people don't really can't put your finger on which is like why is this happening here why is it happening so much here mmm well we could be related to overpopulation it could be related to the sort of established mindset of the American people like why are Canadians so much nicer when right connected to us like you just like if you look at the landmass there's no real line but you go across culturally yeah they're they're way nicer they're just nicer you know and they're they talk like us they look like us they pronounce a few words differently and they're way nicer you know and they don't get a lot of mass shootings up there it's super uncommon it's interesting I mean it's based on this I think it's about the connection of America to its guns is based on its myth it's it's a foundation mythology its religion in a weird way right the religion of America at the greatest country on earth II well it's based it's a lot of it's based on fear means it's freedom for sure but a lot of like the tactical people like the people that are really into what happens if something breaks in you gotta be ready to pull that gun out two point two seconds gotta be able ching ching ching I mean there's people that Pryor I know people like good friends that practice that shit all the time and if you break in their house you are fucked because they're ready and they're looking for it they want people to break I know people who are asking people please break into my fucking I took Natasha to shoot guns in anticipation of this gun episode we hated it so much I can't say I loved it I will I got there and I thought I'd make a joke because you have to pick your little target so I was like are there any Trump and he was like I'm nudging her like we are not in the right area we got the Hillary's coming in next week right I think he was just talking shit to her for asking twang and then we get in there and there's like people just like doing magazine rifles and then there's a guy going through saying what was he saying like no rapid-fire no rapid fire cuz they're just like like just like these like kids it was pretty crazy like there weren't even dividers in between us oh and then he was telling me how to work the gun and I was like he's like make sure that your thumb doesn't go here okay go ahead and I was like wait where is my thumb not supposed to go can I will you please cuz I know he didn't know no she didn't know either we got a laughing point of me no I didn't know I did though we each did what we got like 50 rounds yeah we bought we bought two because they you have to by the ammunition in like a box you can't buy like all have so we bought two boxes thinking we'd be there for a while the trainings the training session was literally up to seconds 30 seconds long okay here's your gun and go shoot and people are rapid firing and you're surrounded by other people that got that same safety briefing right right and and there's a celebrity Walt one celebrity Shia LeBouf so we know the picture of him there so I shot the gun and she shot it and then I shot it again and I'm feeling like I gotta get out of here really Tasha's like I gotta get it I just think it was a bad I think every gun advocate or a strong gun person we've talked to since I said about that particular place like that's not a place to start it's not a cool place to unsafe and so we just so I think we picked the wrong place at any rate though I'm thinking about these two boxes of ammunition I'm like I can't go to the dude up front cuz he'll think you on like a little bitch you know I mean I got all this ammo left you know what I mean so and then she's like Natasha's like don't be an idiot let's get out of here I sold her out immediately I'm just like you know I'm trying I love it here you know this is my home baby I'm like I'm like the wife you know the wife is like let's get out of here you know women alright I want to stay I want to stay you know did say the wife I did the wife is you know I'm all like emotional from having shot a gun like I got to get out of here but really I'm just like you know you know it is you all know you want to shoot all night but though wife now I'm going Italian I the first time I ever shot one the first thing I felt when I went into the area you put that earplugs on and you stand next to these people and there was these little dividers the place that I went but when you hear that yeah you feel so vulnerable yeah you feel like whoa like if that hits you that's a wrap we're not gonna make it yeah exactly I gotta ask you guys this before you take off did you see this Trump thing the CNN thing yeah they're going after the kid who made the meme I heard it wasn't a kid well this is the thing Jamiel explained the whole thing but it was a kid that they went after who had made a video or made a meme but apparently the meme came from a video and the video was made by someone else other than this kid and they they're essentially they threatened to Doc's this kid they said they reserve the right to expose him and I heard he's 15 I don't know if that's been 100% proven I don't know if it's been 100% disproven but I just heard that that is a lie it was a lie the fifteen-year-old Ness of this kid well I don't know if that's the case because he's not actually 15 words because now they're talking about a different person because the original video that's turned into a video file trump body-slamming the CNN oh they're saying that that's Trump this is what it is Trump was on the WWE and he did a thing when the guy to the ground and so they're gonna they took that and put a CNN head over the person's body who Trump slammed to the ground and then Trump tweeted it is very offensive very inappropriate very non presidential pretty fucking funny nothing compared to him talking about that woman having plastic surgery and saying that her face was bleeding badly from the facelift that's just gross like that is like something wrong with him that's so beneath anybody that's not just beneath like the president that's beneath there's something deeply wrong with him he's getting worse he's going off these keys on Tisha right now pressure probably getting mentally ill at this point because the seventy's isn't isn't mental illness like your brain chemistry changing and can you imagine what would by the way when the alt were all right came after me for the show I had this other realization which is even people you don't respect if enough people hate you it it's it's got a effect on your brain yeah and imagine being Donald Trump where a half of the world or more is like fuck you all day every more than half the world it's a imagine a large number of people maybe half of America exactly but it's way more than half of America now because there's a large number of people in the Republican Party that are criticizing what makes me mad is that we called it the women's March and that no one really gives it respect for what it was because it was the largest protest protest in the in our history of our lives was to an anti basically an anti-trump protesters elected and like we should just be talking about that more like that's never happened in our lifetimes or our parents lifetimes there was that big of a protest because someone was being elected and it just kind of gets like pushed to the side I mean the woman's yeah March but if she thinks that basically that we the idea of it was marginalized and the scope of those marginalized because they called themselves a woman's Marty I don't know because it's such a huge deal like I mean it was so exciting to be a part of that you saw those pictures and they weren't just in every city in America they were in every city in the world that's how opposed we were that didn't happen when you know anyone who in our lifetimes know we've never seen this kind of a reaction to a president before never but you wanted to talk about the CNN it's what's crazy is that CNN is becoming a monster to fight a monster right and they're threatening to Doc's people that are making funny memes all that was was funny I mean nobody really thought that Donald Trump was actually slamming the person that is CNN that doesn't even have a head that has a CNN for a head and doing some reporter from CNN was going after the person they tracked the person down on reddit who made the memes who gives a fuck who made the memes that's crazy the way the meme itself isn't offensive the name itself is funny the offensive part if anything is that the President of the United States thought it was appropriate to retweet it it's more dumb than it is offending offend me even slightly I saw him that he retweeted I was like huh that's my reaction listen you are correct in my opinion that the the CNN in particular and the press in general is as filled with warts not as filled with warts but he's filled with warts in the same way that there's a pound dick [Applause] [Laughter] Joe that was the right joke day and the right time I didn't didn't mean it and there Natacha right there we would have such a laugh over we gotta sand them off before I see the missus but it's not that it's this this new realm that we're in where these cable networks are struggling so hard to get attention and they're focusing on really crazy shit like CNN had a bunch of people fired for making up fake stories about Russia and Trump or not substantiating these stories and making sure they're correct before they released it and put it live and so three people had to resign thing was three but the CNN's not struggling that's what they are they're struggling they're down 20% in ratings I thought CNN and MSNBC and some other left-leaning thing although I don't really consider CNN left-leaning is like at the top of the charts now and what I read and it might be bullshit I don't know well let's pull this up see if you could find out what I read was that CNN is down 20% since June and that Fox is actually up 20% no no so this looks like typed-in CNN ratings it says Trump is way off on CNN's ratings being down and I didn't hear it from Trump and I heard it from someone else was probably parroting Trump yeah and we were all that's that this therein lies the problem we're all being right filled with misinformation from both sides and each side is so ideologically in their in their echo chamber that they all accept the left and the right included all except the information that they're getting as gospel truth that cannot be assailed by the other side's facts and so nobody even knows what the truth is anymore nobody that knows what the argument II don't think if they read it it's true oh so Fox News CNN MSNBC so Trump is responsible for everybody paying attention now yep driven by surges for the Rachel Maddow Show last word with lawrence O'Donnell no idea who that is MSNBC is up a whopping 86% in local view total viewers Wow in primetime that's amazing you watch do you watch Rachel Maddow no I think she's great I think she's so good Tucker Carlson such a good vibe you know what he is though what he is is like this odd bridge between regional people and right-wing maniac yeah for sure Hannity so much more reasonable than she's a dick though that's the problem okay he said he's an asshole to the people he interviews his whole thing is that he bombards them with like kind of snide interviewing that they relentless snide interviewing until they deserve it like he brings us out of posture especially no x' that they're gonna say something stupid is this and he can mock exactly well there's this idea called nut picking and Natasha's got a go right I'll take an uber and you can say well I'm that's totally fine whole day like just by the hour you know and I I have to be in Hollywood it's it's it's fur I get it it's something I'm doing like I'm it's a voice I'll sing it we could we could bring this Tom Cruise well it's not promo film I'm sorry it's just I have like partners who are waiting for me and if I don't
