yeah I like to open up that shop dude you're fucking there's Instagram things you're doing these Hong Dynasty things what are you doing that shit is hilarious you and Bobby Lee and these 15-second clips I'm hooked I don't know what you're doing but I'm laughing my dick off oh I don't I mean first of all people always like to like it's publicly known that I'm wealthy because of the New York Times and all this shit that came out the Facebook stuff yeah so people always like whenever I do anything to preface it with well if I was rich or if I had your fucking money or if you know and I go the shit most of everything I do cost little or nothing like the Hong dynasty is okay so Instagram comes out and what vine is like seven seconds right I don't have vine but vine is seven seconds instagrams fifteen seconds we're old guys when I go hang out with my nephews and stuff and they're like teenagers like they won't even watch a one-minute youtube clip it's like if it doesn't get their attention they're like or they'll just still watch it with the the bar just fast word fast forward you know so I said let's just fuck around we filmed this thing on our iPhone and it's just you know Bob Bobby Lee's actually an actor oh you know what before we get started let me just say I was on Joe's show last time and it ended with me saying it was a dumb idea but I was like I'm I'm extremely unhealthy I'm out of shape I have like mercury poisoning high blood pressure high cholesterol all that shit I just got diabetes and I said I'm gonna diabetes whatever I mean everyone everyone's gonna have it soon so I said I'm gonna what did I say I was gonna spend a year to get trained and I want to have like a UFC fight or some shit like that and you're explaining to me how film it was yes Bobby Lee's brother Steve Lee who's 40 years old who's one of those guys he's he's like a thousand times funnier than Bobby without trying like Bobby's like a professional comedian Steve just he's just a funny and crazy guy he's one of the he's got a sort of a Al Bundy thing where he's 40 and he talks about how he could have been state champion if you just did this one arm bar or something right um and he works at or used to work at this place fat cells in Hollywood at part-time as a sandwich guy and I hired him to be on my show full-time and and he started slacking it was what I thought would happen and I said all right you and me are gonna go into this room and we're gonna wrestle and you're basically wrestling for your job you're doing wrestling and I'm doing judo and I outweigh him by 60 pounds he's like a little like tiny asian guy and I'm like yeah I used to do judo and my friend was like don't underestimate him cuz you know he was almost state champ I'm like that was like over 20 years ago he's like but you had those little wrestling guys you know you can't fuck with them and right and then his brother was the referee so Bobby says Dave my brother you know he's like very relaxed and lazy about things until you challenge his pussy or money so Steve you know Steve's on the han dynasty he's like a fucking you know he's a crazy guy he's always a good-natured he's always funny when I told him like if you don't win this I'm you're going back to fat cells and the job he has for me right now is like they're like what do you need to hire Steve Lee for what did you do I'm like I literally send him all over the world to fuck as many whores as possible like that's his job that's his job right now having sex with prostitutes yeah I send him I send him like him basically him and this guy bill poon he's 53 years old I sent them to Macau they're the Macau brothers now and bill bill on his normal job when he's not on my show is he drives hookers around he's the number one whore transporter in Los Angeles I think he put two hundred and ninety thousand miles on his Prius and I said do the math and he has delivered six thousand hookers to their John's Wow that makes you the number one whore transporter maybe there's a guy out there that's just fuckin doing math and staying up all night it's trying to break that record well yes he has it he has his archenemy and everything it's like yeah there's another guy but he's like he's like what's that movie the transporter damage like he never tries to fuck the hookers yeah he's serious about it he's got like baby wipes and condom he like he's like he takes the job seriously right he's not does any creepy shit so him him and Steve I go hey you guys you know everyone here stories about like the set underground sex world and in Macau and this why don't you go and investigate and buy investigate I mean fuck all of them and so I send them to Macau we record the whole thing that's that's gonna be called the Macau brothers and we're gonna put that up on DVD I say whatever but so go back to this wrestling match ok so see you guys mission thing are you yeah who happens well that's why I'm not a wrestler I'm right just you know a so-so Bobby's like Bobby used to wrestle - so he's like I'll be the referee and yeah whoever whoever gets the first person down submit whatever they went you know but what is whatever like is it to tap out because if you get a jujitsu guide down that doesn't mean jack shit right when the game starts right ready judo guys all about with we call upon you slam a guy yeah it was just I guess whoever gets someone in a hold that they can't give up or something okay I guess undefined undefined Victory's yeah cuz there was just no punching or kick okay it wasn't yeah and so yeah him working for me is not like sweeping the floor or whatever him working for me is getting to fuck really hot chicks it's a great gig yes essentially his face changes like probably still giving his job even if RINO and I go I'm just all I'm gonna do is let him fuck he's like he's like you know half my size Bobby sighs yeah but like way skinnier when I go I'll just let him fuck around and then I'll just flatten him and I'll just it'll be it'll look funny you know right in less than a minute he took me out he I go if you don't win right now you fucker you're losing your job his fit he goes Reds on his face and I go oh fuck dude and then he comes at me and he's small but then he just like grabs my arm or something gets me down and I'm like oh whatever and then I can't get out of it and then he just puts all of his might into this hold and I'm just sitting there and I can't get out of it I'm like you know also Sakura she's just like I've never seen you look more like a pussy in your life and I was thinking they're thinking fuck dude I remember tell Jo that I was gonna do this shit like the people have that glamorous idea they're gonna go and have an MMA fight and I would never discourage anybody from being an MMA fighter like I think you live and you die if you want to be a bull rider if you want to ride motocross if you want to drive Formula One race cars all those things are dangerous all those things are awesome you know live your life man I I thought I did it it's not I mean I fought in Taekwondo and I kickbox it's fucking stupid it stained I did it for free there was no money involved in it I could I had no insurance I had no health insurance so I would never tell someone don't do anything dangerous but you can't I don't think you should dabble yeah that's something like there's dudes that are doing it that I know that are like trying to make it in the UFC or have made it into the UFC that that's their fucking the whole life man they get up in the morning they're doing their strength and conditioning they're running they're drinking wheatgrass juice and they're fucking taking all their amino acids and they write Joe I'm not gonna babble I mean they made UFC their life I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a serious commitment to my diabetes I'm gonna make that my life I'm gonna need doughnuts I'm gonna fucking do you really have diabetes I I just I was pre-diabetic for like the last four years and I like just cross over the line I just crossed over and he's like dude with with lots of a complete nutritional diet change and lots of exercises like you can go back to not having diabetes but whatever you would rather not you'd rather just take insulin and you don't know it's horrible that's so bad everyone's that well they say 50% of everyone that's being born in America today will have diabetes why don't you do this since we're on the show okay you and I are talking to my friends why don't you hire someone see you got boatloads of cash hire someone to concoct a diet for you to feed you hire someone that's a nutritionist that is gonna concoct like really healthy meals all day long really low sugar and you'll hear that shit within a few months I mean you just met him right now first of all critter yeah critters gonna do it well this is this is what happens when I made my money I naturally I just don't trust people so I made the naturally before or asked always I just don't trust me right so I just made the rookie mistake you've heard the expression before don't hire your friends and family yes and I hired only my friends and family and I was like you know hey I don't know how to work a camera I don't care you're my cousin you have to you know I just wanted everyone around me to be someone I trusted right and uh it just you don't get the level of work that you know like I work every night till 7:00 8:00 in the morning still I don't have to but I do you know and you know without even because there's always in the back of their mind they're like Dave's not gonna fire me right he's my cousin or he's my best friend like right and then I was just sitting there going how come I do have all this money and I hired all these guys and I'm over paying the shit out of them and like I'm still at the office by myself you know so I fired everyone I only hired people that are not my friends and white and I said no more Asians I'm hiring white people oh man that's crazy racist yeah very racy Asians are very hard workers as long as they're not your family I don't know I just I just I just wanted to its first of all yeah it's very racist and I was like but it's okay because you know what I want to try something different I don't know I already rode the yellow train I'm like shit you know and so I hired I hired people that are I'm not friends I'm friendly with but they're not my homies and then and then they're they were hired for specifically what their job was like if you're a trainer then that's what I you know I'm not like hey I know you're not a trainer but just do it right and I found out and with this next phase of the experiment that I immediately like befriended all of them like now they're all my best friends ago and and even if I like critter you know I said listen I have diabetes I you know and he's also my bodyguard which everyone thinks is a joke which is which it is most of the time but you know weird shit happens once in a while and I said look I I love eating I'm a friends with lots of chefs you know I go to a lot of restaurants you know I love I have a piece of me that's like just having no money and a restaurant a nice restaurant for the first time and just like having that snooty now looking at sushi menu and going like what's what's MP right like I didn't know cuz I've never been there and they're like that's market price sir and I'm like well how the fuck am i support this Toro what is that they're like it's the fattest part of the tuna and it's $60 apiece you mean for the two pieces not enough for one piece and I'm like a hundred and twenty dollars for two tiny fucking pieces of fish but you know I don't have any money I'm like that I'm not gonna get then they're like yeah if you have to ask then you can't afford it and so now I have the money and I go in there yeah motherfucker give me a hundred Toro what I'm like give me the whole fucking fish and then it's like Oh tuna has the most amount of mercury and you know the doctor checks my blood he's like you have so much mercury in your fucking blood you know is that really happened to you yeah like you eating that much sushi well I thought I thought it was healthy you know the the oceans are polluted the shit that's out there full full of like radioactive waste and all this shit and I'm like yeah I'm not eating hamburgers anymore and every meal cost $500 I'm rich motherfucker and it's like moderation for everything right I can't eat fish every day no I was starting to get um was it goddamn I forget the poisoning that I was getting from sardines yes sardines have tons of arsenic yeah arsenic sardines have tons of that shit it was a small amount it's a heavy metal you know yeah they need they're eating at the bottom of the ocean you just fucking garbage down and once that shit gets in your blood it takes forever to get out you know it didn't take long mmm yeah I got rid of the arsenic in a short amount of time I just stopped eating sardines oh I was eating him every day Wow yeah white trash I like sardines yeah I love sardines well I get I don't know about the arsenic but the they said I just because my hair started falling out and I couldn't you know I'm like I'm still relatively young but I just Mary's making your hair fall well it said for mercury poisoning it's like memory loss mhm and like it's like I I'm like I have the same memories my like seventy year old father who's like well you know I'm like people will do that hey Dave you just told that story and I'm like really and I'm like fuck and it's like I know that like it's like when you know something but you're feeling really dumb and I'm like a why right where's what's this blocking they're like dude your blood is like just full of it so Wow so I told critter I said listen I need the kind of trainer that physically abuses me like you can put a finger in my ass if you have to he has huge hands I said here's the kick that's in essence I said here's the key to my house need a salad every single I thought but I go I don't have that kind of discipline because I don't drink I don't do drugs and so food is my vice especially since I don't gamble anymore and it's like I love to eat and I love to eat late at night I like to have dinner number to dinner number three so I said here's the key to my house I'm every single day I'm gonna come up with some excuse to not work out oh I gotta fuck this girl or I have a really important meeting with Joe Rogan all right you know it's like I don't care you you have permission to come into my house physically dragging out of my bed punch me in my chest and get me to work out because I'm not gonna want to he's a big dude yeah well he's also this is the best part everyone's like you have a bodyguard you have that what a joke you have a bodyguard ago yeah in the last year my two major injuries are from him like he almost broke my neck and he broke my ribs broken right now he broke my rib like two weeks ago when he just I don't know what that syndrome is like the when a parent loves their baby so much that they shake it in the baby dies like because he has the weekends off so when I see him he sees me and he picks me up and he always like hugs he broke your ribs by shaking you well he hugged me and he was shaking me and while he was shaking me someone my friend David Chang tripped him oh no but that he fell on top of me oh Jesus he's a big guy so I'm like yeah my my bodyguard that I paid to protect me it hurts me broken ribs and almost broke your neck how'd he almost break your neck just when he shakes me like it's so violent that I'm like I'm like I feel like those things that all movies like one jerk in like my necks gonna snap and he did it and and I couldn't turn my head this way for like two weeks and I was like like okay can you like protect me and not hurt me any you know I don't know whatever what you need is someone who's a dietician some is gonna be you can hire like a professional chef Kevin James used to have this guy who worked for him was fantastic he had this guy working for him all day right the guy would cook all these meals and he would leave pre-prepared like really healthy meals in his refrigerator then he hired some woman to do it after that all right so I did that for a little bit like I got this see this is what I'm talking about I I don't remember the name of the service but they deliver the meal every okay there's a bunch of those yeah Susan's healthy gourmet is one that I used for a while it's like yeah and I'm like cool on being first of all is miserable the meals started to stack up in the in the refrigerator it's like Oh like like inside I'd be like oh cool I did it I'm on this program right they weren't really eating but then I'd look at it or I'd look or I'd eat it and go oh cool I ate good today and then like at 3 in the morning still go out and get the burrito and so the thing I'm doing now which I already can see it's horrible and everyone says it doesn't work but now I'm sort of like stuck in this weird thing is I it's like the whole I want I want I I'm like no one's like diets aren't gonna work right right this has to be a lifestyle change right like you can't like go for 3 months eating salads and then be like hey I got my weight down I got my cholesterol down I got my diabetes down and then going back to it it's like you have to have but I'm like but I love food like I love eating and so the thing I'm doing now which I didn't have put too much research into is chewing and spitting there's I know guys who did that with me there's some MMA fighters like Diego Sanchez was doing that for a while he wouldn't eat meat he would just chew it up it's horrible for your pet it is it really it's horrible for you because first of all so you get like so stomach acids as it is I'll order like three entrees I'll get spaghetti fried chicken steak I'll get pie I'll order everything it's just like Roman times gluttony to the max right and I'll have like the worst is if it's at a nice restaurant cuz then they don't have the club they have like cloth napkins and I'm like can you bring some more of those paper napkins and I'm sitting there and I'm like ah and I'm just chewing everything getting all the flavor out of it and then I'm spitting it which the mouth as soon as it starts chewing and making saliva the stomach starts making acid to prepare for the food to come down right but if the food never comes down there's just like acid in your stomach you know and and also when you eat all the sugar already goes into your like before it hits your stomach you know yeah so I'm eating all this food that like nice restaurants chewing it and spitting the napkins and then and then putting it like on the plate and the dudes it's delicious it's fucking amazing and then you know you're looking for shortcuts bro I'm looking for shortcuts you can't do that well I just hire a real trainer not not critter but hire someone who's like a real legit strength conditioning trainer who's gonna put you through some stuff if you really want to do something it's fun yo you're fired you should take a martial art yeah I guess I mean you did judo I think I need a hot chick how would that work for the trainer cuz now I'm motivated he's gone fucker well then if you can't fucker you want to bring other girls hotter around to show her that you can work them like listen bitch I can find them I can't fuck you and then it'll become some weird ego thing and Joe having an eating disorder is the number one thing to like bond with hot chicks because they all have one I'm like should I go anorexic or chewing and spitting or bulimia and they're like well I tried but I'm like cool I'm bugging it's like all of a sudden like a super boring dumb girl is like all like oh yes but a lot of like CrossFit chicks they don't have to eating disorders if you get like a strength and conditioning type gal you're right Joe I do have blood loads of money I gotta figure out how that's not a shortcut I just need to figure out to make not cure cancer not cure AIDS some kind of delicious food that you can eat every day and kill you it's it's this is the thing the more you suffer the more you'll enjoy pleasure you are a glutton for pleasure my friends right but you love but check this out technology so my my Japanese business partner my work with this company good smile it's not legal in America yet but he has he smokes he drinks he eats all the shit I don't even know what this process is called you might heard of it but he that once a month this is like real rich guy shit he gets all like a lot of his blood taken out and then they douche to it like they make it into super blood and then he puts it back into him and then at all everything goes down his his you know and I go what is that like it's not it's not FDA whatever test it's not in America yet and so I do this thing called Regina Kane and I had done today actually my shoulders been bothering me they you take they take your blood out right and they spin it in a centrifuge and apply heat to it and so your blood thinks like it has a fever and it creates this anti inflammatory response and creates this like yellow serum and then they extract the yellow serum out of your blood and then they inject it directly in areas where you have inflammation it's really good for injuries but it's also like when you do it like I did it today energy you just feel great like great right now yeah Dana White told me about it because he has an inner ear infection and an issue rather called Meniere's disease it's from he got beat up one time when he was young a bunch of guys and his he gets his tonight it's like ringing in his ear and it fucks with his balance and shit and it's all inflammation well they figured out a way to inject this this this serum made out of your blood or any totally cured it for him he went through surgeries he was on medication he did a bunch of shit they're really fucked with him but this stuff instead of fucking with him it uses your own blood and it made him feel fantastic right and he used to have to go to Germany for it and I was gonna fly to Germany to go do this but then they started opening these places around only have one lifespan medicine in Santa Monica I did this morning well this is what I'm talking about Joe it's like I get the whole like you need to suffer to like you know but but that's for injuries I know but it's like you have any injuries you could use no I'll get this I'm just saying like the the way technology is going now like you're covered in tattoos but like you know in five years they're gonna have some ray that just gets rid of all they already do they have lasers right but it's not good right now what's painful but it'll get it'll and they'll make it so it's not you know they're gonna have everything so I you know so I'm like do I need to like really switch my eating habits which are they gonna make like a you know some oculus rift fake hamburger where I'm like oh yeah it's delicious enough you know I don't know this is my take on it I think gluttony and eating like lots of delicious food is fun but feeling like shit is not fun and what I like to do is have cheat days what I like to do is I really like this is what I've eaten today so far I had a blended juice drink which was like celery ginger carrot a cucumber I'm trying to remember a cayenne pepper oregano oil lemon all this stuff fantastic for you right that's what I had for breakfast the only thing I ate this morning is to day unshaved pussy lips a slight hint of urinary tract infection and I feel great I don't know if you're gonna feel great in a couple hours once the fucking infection but I got iron stomach ago I will go to fucking in-and-out burger man I'll fuck ups I had popeyes chicken last night dude and so because you ate that that's all you gotta eat this weird ginger drink well because I eat primarily healthy primarily healthy right but then occasionally I go off the rails right but most of the time my body's getting healthy food right that's the key cuz you feel better man you feel better I feel great you'll feel better you'll have more energy I drink these blended kale shakes in the morning I make them myself I throw kale it'll taste like shit dislike shit check don't use spinach you could do that too but I like kale okay it's a superfood especially the superfood - they're all good but I killed it up kills hipper and fucking strong it's got a lot of nutrients in it it's really good for you what's better kale or spinach probably with the probably kale because a little darker a little green that's the key right dark green leafy vegetables they have phytonutrients and all sorts of vitamins and stuff and you get something out of them first of all when I eat I'm like I'll have a bowl right like like this high like I'm pointing to my about ten inches like a big fucking salad bowl that you would give to like a family like oh here's our salad and everybody would take a portion yeah I blend that whole motherfucker I don't drink that shit myself well with with 4 cloves of garlic I throw a whole Apple in there ginger I throw a chunk of ginger right like a thumb sized chunk of ginger it just everybody else it tastes it goes what the fuck are you drinking but dude I throw that shit down and it's like rocket fuel I feel great you're fucking fantastic it's better than coffee I have like a chorizo bacon burger and then and then and then I take the top bun off and I go yes I'm doing good yeah you got rid of that gluten I don't think that and then I feel super charged to take a nap I'm like yes no you know I think you're enjoying your success you're enjoying your wealth and your joint pleasure and that's a part of who you are and it's also I think one of the things about artists is artists are very indulgent I'm firm that about my comedian friends and you know and your natural comedian you are a natural stand-up comedian you you did a thing that was at a UCLA yeah you did a thing UCLA that you put on that video that was up a bunch of dude that was like a guy who been doing stand-up for years and you had only done it like how many times you did that house the first only first time that shit's ridiculous dude I plug that fuck yeah all right so I put it on my Twitter yeah my my problem with the Internet is I always think it's like the Wild West when it's actually not so almost everything I put up on YouTube or Vimeo gets flagged I just put up a new episode of my show DVD yesterday and it got flag so gets flagged for what just there's nakedness yeah nakedness or whatever I mean I think in the soul you took you change your DVD a sa page yeah it's like it's like Wikipedia now dude it's like anybody can go on there and change it now they could say Dave's a fag this whatever and it will you know I can't believe I just said that good luck you're gonna do that now you did you made a Wikipedia out of it how'd you do that we used their technology and we just was like if some it's like it's it's your website now why would you do that who cuz who cares you're gonna care once your website is all black dicks I know that's what's gonna happen so whatever threat level I love the current threat level vitamin piss yellow everything on that website right now it's the fans did it oh that's great yeah like it's just it's I'm like fuck it I'm not even gonna maintain my own website but yeah you had a thing where you got offline you know you you you took down your your podcast and you put up this fucking disc land I had I had a text you about it immediately once I read it cuz I was alone it was like 2 o'clock in the morning in my house and I'm howling laughing because you're talking about racism but you said something that's totally true right you're like everyone's afraid of the yellow man like black men get the fuck but how come Jackie Chan or fuck in in rush hour one two or three and I'm like it's true Jackie can't Chan like he's safe it's it's it's it's amazing it's I'm in bed fucking this white girl and I had my phone like next to her head like this and it's a text comes in and it's Jo just saying like haha he's like he's like writing my press release back to me in it it's look wait first have one quote yeah oh so fucking funny yeah I look I'm just I didn't know these kind of facts but like do you know how many Asians are in America like I'm talking about jungle Asians like Japanese Korean Filipino like all of the agents combined you know how much how many of them there are in America now which tick tick tick a guess 20 million or percentage-wise a percentage yeah 20 million would be what less than 10% yeah it's 4% 4% its 4% so it's like I just like you know I like do it I just like doing shit you know and then people always they need to be like Oh check out this Asian comedian or check out this Asian artist but now I'm like why can't I just be an artist yeah what can I just be an artist yeah I always have to be like you know like a mug by a black guy right exactly he's never I got money but dude this dude fucking mugged me man if you say you got mugged by a dude that's a white guy right like you know if I got fuckin mugged by this dude yeah and and you know also Sakura she's on my show the first time I met her was seven or eight years ago and so this is still in the your you know it was like 2005-2006 and it was on the set of the first asian-american porno in America and I was like out on the first one I was like I don't even know what that means and I'm like there's agent chicks in porn and it was like no the first porno in America knowledge and where they're all Asian and then the I'm like what the male I'm like yeah that exists and they're like no it doesn't they go the only place in porn where you see an asian guy is gay porn and he's the bottom so he's literally getting fucked in his ass and that's the only place you see him so what about Japanese porn no but that's in Japan right I'm saying in America and I'm like wow 2005 whatever and that still doesn't exist yet and so I go on the set and then the guy that's the performer is Filipino and I'm like that doesn't even count you know doesn't count they're not Asian now they count on just joking um but so I go wow that's weird and then and then I just you know this shit I talk about on my show the shit I just do and then I just it's like if you talked about it would be fine if a black guy talks about but it's just it brings out like this these people and they just that it's they're so offended by it and I go what you know and I and I know in the script for Romeo Must Die Jet Li kisses Aaliyah at the end but they changed it to they just danced together oh and you know Jackie Chan is the star of rush hour a fucking billion dollar franchise why doesn't he get the fuck or finger-banging why not like okay fine he didn't get to do it in in one maybe in two he gets the fuck alright well you know it's like why can't you know why can't they be sexual you know right and III don't know the answer to that the male the male Asian with the white woman where is such a rare combination in movies and in television right it's so fucking rare that when they're doing it almost feels like they're doing it on purpose right and it's like but you know because there was once that of with the black guys they're like black guys you know if I see you white women we're gonna kill you yeah but now it's like jungle fever yes yeah so it's a hated a disease I don't know my best guest on it is when and you know this is just my guess is when I hear people go home and those fucking Asians are like they're taking over all the best spots that all the best universities and they're owning all the real estate and China is taking over the world it's like they're taking everything they can't take our white pussy on top of that you know so I don't know I don't know what it is but I just know like when I do shit like I get a lot more slack for it then but whatever I don't I don't give a shit well the point that you were making I mean I know you're just being funny but the point you were making is true I mean you don't see Asian guys get late in movies and if they do it with an Asian girl right I mean I'm sure there's examples there's one it's uh it's Steven Yeun from Walking Dead right right rouse that's true that's really that's a perfect example my god damn I like - that's a good one that's a good one that I high-fived him for that victory for the Asians and he stayed alive yeah have many seasons yeah so he's doing it yeah wait can I just plug the thing really quickly yeah yeah yeah thank the video it's well it's vid me vid Emmy cuz like I've been looking forever cuz everyone's like why don't you just have your own platform or whatever I'm like I don't wanna spend time doing that so it's hire somebody well I mean it's just like when you do it yourself it always cry I don't know I don't wanna I for me to have less employees it's not even the money thing right I don't want to become a manager you know right so this these got these kids started this thing vid me which is like my answer to YouTube or whatever and I could put anything up there so I put my comedy special so if you go to vid me and then put in a DVD or subscribe to a DVD I say you have my comedy special which is the first time in a comedy at UCLA which is intercut with like machine guns and girls buttholes and like a lot of stuff me slapping and cigarettes out of smoking vaginas and there's a lot of stuff stuff stuff that you can't put anywhere stuff you know like here can I give you a great example like well first of all talk about Instagram I went on yours and like someone found their high school drawing art like oh yeah I mean you you have the frenetic energy of like you got like that Bernie Wrightson and like you have like you got all the you were like good I was pretty good yeah you were pretty good and yet all that you like went crazy with the detail whenever I see a young guy with like lots of detail and like that motherfucker has a lot of energy that's usually from like great especially the subject matter like the rage drawing every fucking hair on the werewolf's face yeah one of the teeth with the they're glistening with the fucking blood and whatever that's with comic book art yeah I mean it's it's great I mean I think from what I saw yeah from what I saw and how old were you when you do that it's somewhere in high school probably fifteen or sixteen that's what I'm saying like you stopped at some point right I had an asshole fucking art teacher man he wasn't look I don't know I feel bad for the dude cuz it was was clearly a dork right you know and but he that's great he had this way of talking about shit where he just killed all your dreams I took like I would draw all like Conan the Barbarian and ninjas and that's and werewolves and I would draw shit that I would like you need to bullshit yeah teenage boys shit yeah I would I love that that's a Little Red Riding I did a whole series of like little kids stories and went wrong all right the Three Little Pigs is a werewolf who fucking just attacks the pigs right I had Humpty Dumpty I'll pull that one up eventually Humpty Dumpty with a you're an artist everybody up you're an artist yeah well I certainly was that's what I was gonna do for a living until I started fighting and then when I started fighting I became completely obsessed with that because it was so primal and so much different than anything else I'd ever see this is see we have the same story up until then or even up until then because in high school I drew like that too like crazy detail whatever and then I started fighting too and I loved it and I and then I started fighting all the time except I never won 90% of the fights I get masked I stood up I'd be like yeah let's fuck these dudes up and I do you mean like fighting like on the street yeah you know I had a lot of ingress I didn't do that oh you mean fighting yeah you had like one fight in high school it wasn't really much of a fight well one other time where did this not the best one was the most important one for me it was this dude we weren't even like fighting it's like he was this kid like they bust these these black kids and from bad neighborhoods Newton South High yeah and there's this one kid and me and him we look at each other like in the hallway and like you know he would stare at me and I would stare at him nothing really happened right in one day we were in the locker room together and I was past it and he looked at me and I don't remember what was said but I remember dude grab me and hip toss me down the ground throw me on my back and held me down he was thinking about punching me he was like holding me my like yeah and just held me and then let me about totally humiliated totally humiliated he said the n-word with the ER no no no no no I don't say anything okay I mean I think I said like what the fuck you know or something like my name is hope but I realized that you know they should I don't know how to wrestle I think I was probably 14 I was like I need that humiliating feeling you like I don't want to ever feel that it was terrible I never had why I take it like a couple karate classes before them but no grappling whatsoever so at the same time I joined the wrestling team and I started getting really serious about tackling though at the very same time it was because that dude like I owe him he made me who I became like for real because he humiliated the shit at him but looking at like that changed your course down that path but if that never happened and you stuck with the heart I mean that looks I mean that looks pretty good man well I enjoyed art I still do I still draw I was drawing draw like that yeah I could still look like that I mean yeah like wanted cross-hatching and all that stuff yeah I love cross-hatching yeah I love I love deep I like to do like pencil and then ballpoint pen over the pencil that's like my favorite style of I have some other stuff that I'll put up that I did like yeah I want to check it out cuz like technical pens I always found to be like a little too permanent like I like seeing like though I feel like with a ballpoint pen you can sort of almost barely touch the paper and the image just starts to slowly come out do this with your kids ballpoint pen drawn bananas like that sensation of a ballpoint pen on a banana is like the best thing and then like the next day when the the the banana peel dries up the drawing looks different my kids loved art yeah it's a fun thing but my progression was the same thing everything in high school was this shit like cross-hatching pen pencil Prisma colors and then you know I discovered spray paint which was like the fucking like the best thing ever it's like oh my god I discovered the matrix you know and then acrylic and oil paint but what I discovered now after painting and drawing for years is that all those things I just said spray paint oil acrylic is you just even pencils like you draw something you you create something and if you don't like it you just paint over it you just erase it and then the new thing that like I just that this is like like alchemy or like painting with with magic is the watercolor it's like it's like the medium in art that has like I'd probably say like the least amount of respect because it's like oh watercolor you think of like old ladies you know on see why is that I don't know but like this whole book that I did is all watercolors it's like 300 pages of watercolors and I'm like you know I'm a pretty well respected artist now like I should be able to get this thing published I shouldn't have to like self publish it and I don't want to self publish it that's like in the same way like I don't want to put up my own what do you call like I'm I don't want to start my own YouTube or whatever like I just would rather to do the art and have like a respected public and put it out so I turned the book in and start this bidding war with all the publishers all the cool artsy publishers I want to put it out and I like Dave um you got to take these four pages out you know our legal team looked at it and you know I guess there's obscenity laws like you can't put a a a or fifteen in a girl's butt hole and I go but I thought you know it's art I well it's art and I thought like we lived in America I thought you could do whatever you know grant and I keep I don't I guess I keep pushing things and finding out that you can't do them but you can you can you just can't do it in their forum right that's all it is and I go what's the problem there like we might get sued I go whoa by who I don't know it's always like this pre-emptive like this imaginary fear and I go we need people like you out there I go look like and I was excited because I was like oh these are like the publishers that I like I would love to work with you and I go so I you know I I put the book out myself and it's like we we sold it out like the special edition right away if you want to get it at David Cho calm but it's we made so much money on it on the you know I don't want to say this like I'm bragging but it's like I didn't even want to make that money right like I would rather someone else make that money I just wanted to put it out but it's like they wouldn't do it so you had to do it yourself and that that's sort of I bring that up because I'd rather just it's so easy to just do a video on and throw it up on YouTube that's so easy I don't want to fucking find you know it's like I just want to make shit and just put it out there but everything I do gets taken down so I just got a you know it's just you are you're an unusual guy in an unusual an unusual situation and you want it be free you want to be free to express yourself and you know someone could say like oh fuck him and he's this and he's that and he's arrogant he's this but no your view your being free you're not worried you're not being a fake you are actually doing things that you're interested in and in a lot of ways this is a real problem that we have in society with needing someone to publish your stuff because if you need someone to publish your stuff then they're gonna have to approve it and then you're not going to get the original vision of the artist or the writer or whatever you're gonna get a bunch of other people's in pink opinions of what you should broadcast what you should publish well look can I ask you this because you are like since I first did your show I think the first time I ever did you show I'd never been on TV and since I've been on I mean you you you have like a long career in TV the fear factor the UFC stuff and so I've been on TV twice now I did Anthony Bourdain shows parts unknown and I did I do the news for HBO for vice HBO and both shows that I've been on won Emmys and like it's like I everything I do doesn't have to be guns and buttholes right I know I can work right and you do it yeah like Hey Dude do comedy but don't cuss and then I could do it right but so the two times I did TV like it's like Oh Dave those shows you on one one Emmys and so the floodgates sort of open and like now I have all these people interested in doing shows with me and but they're you ever have this experience because you know you know a lot of rich people and whatever like I sit in boardrooms with like CEOs and like people that run these companies and they're billionaires and they run the world they have way more money than me they have way more power Fame whatever and they're still not free men they're like they answer to to AOL Disney or I don't know like they they go you yeah like you got to take these four page I'm not afraid to take chance I go you're a fucking billionaire who like who gives a shit it's like oh wow you have all the money in the world yet you still have to answer to shareholders like your business partners your wife I don't know mm-hmm I I made a conscious decision not to get married I don't have kids I don't work for anybody and so it's like man it would be so easy for me to just sign this deal and do this TV show but then they're like but then you can't have Hong dynasty on fuck God don't ever let anybody take you from doing what you're doing well no one says well the nice thing is no one says you can't do it they just go if you want to be on our team then you can't do this shit like what is this Hong dynasty saying you can't do it look I've got that one but I don't projects before whatever told me to take down my website take down your message board take that I'm like fuck you right I'm not taking down shit because if you want me to do that you want me to compromise myself right yeah it's gonna start there and it's gonna end up with me we're in a fucking suit sitting behind a desk talking to some idiot about a sitcom that I'd give two fucks about right that's that's what happened and it's a weird thing cause it's like I didn't give a shit and when I was poor I didn't give a shit when I was rich and then it's like what now I'm gonna have a boss all right it's weird like you don't have to do though just do things all you're doing now I'm saying it I know but this is what I'm saying Joe like I don't want like well it's a bit let's let's could put it this way okay what's the benefit of you doing something on television other than Vice which is an awesome show and Anthony Bourdain show which is things like that is great but what's the benefit of you doing a television do you need more money you don't know I'm on to do money it's just like to do projects it's just for me like I don't know I just film this pilot we're just yeah it's not for the money they don't even have to pay me anything but it's the benefit it's like I get to fly somewhere and I get to like like doing a show like this we can say anything we want but right or we could talk about like oh I want to make this movie and talk about the ideas but this is like put making it happen you know it's like but you could do that I know but it's like the thing with the publishing it's so much easier for like when I showed up on Bourdain set like it's all taken care I was like wow this producer called everyone this camera man's like a award-winning cinematographer he knows what he's doing like I don't want to become the guy that's like oh I got to start my own Network now I got to hire my own guys and do all this shit you can do that though man there's no baby you can have meetings and this is one of the things you could do is get a manager get a nice Jewish boy who understands show business and tell that motherfucker this is this is me I'm David Cho I like to put ar-15s up girl's butt holes I like to do watercolor paintings that are obscene I like to do this thing called DVD a essay that gets me fired from HBO I'm a crazy man nobody fired by one fire got an option we'll talk I got tons of money and I'd like to do fun shit and I don't want to have a boss but I want to be able to do cool projects I want to enjoy life I want to have adventures so what do we need to do to hire a bunch of like real good Union cameramen to set up a real good production studio where we can edit video hire legit people I don't want to deal a shit I just want to go do my stuff you handle all that and you could do all that and it could become profitable easily easily well I mean I'm not you managed but but that's what I'm saying it's like I it's like being a reluctant entrepreneur I don't want to do that but I'm gonna have to you should you know you should stop you're doing it Song Dynasty stuff it's fun that was like just like you know it's like it's like a weird feeling to go to like a Denzel movie or a Liam Neeson movie and you're sitting there and you're like this is shitty but you're like it's so much money behind it mmm how did it even get made you know or you're sitting in an editing room and and you're you you're working on a show and and you're like wow that part's really funny is like that's never gonna be on TV yeah why everyone in this room agrees that's the funniest thing right it'll never be on TV why because of coast soap commercial is gonna pull their ads if you do that that's half the best shit I've ever said on Fear Factor never made it to the air exactly because I would fuck with the contestants and say ridiculous you see that wasn't going to be on the air I would love to see that but you got to understand that that's not what they're trying to do their their business is not the business of artistic expression where business is the business of making money what's the best way to optimize a chance to make it money yeah I get a real cookie cutter bullshit television show you know these but they're saying that then there's no audience for a fear factor type show where Joe fucks with the contestants there is but it's not that reform that form has already been established it's already locked down right it's already censored but what you're doing on the on the Internet is a wild what like this podcast it has no boss there's no one to tell us where I talk about we could do whatever we want right and it's because it's on the Internet you could do the same sort of thing run into what I do which is like hey Joe you're on like you know whatever network UFC's on or you know anytime you do TV stuff do they oh hey Joe I've had a few talked about some fucking crazy shit on your last show you got to take that episode down no like no I'm not gonna do that I wouldn't do it yeah I bet we there's been a few issues but I can justify the things that I've talked about I mean I'm not I'm not just going off on a rail well you know obviously what I'm saying I love it yeah I've never met anyone who like knows so much and just couldn't recall that if they at one point like Dana why or whoever said hey Joe you're you're like part of UFC like you've been doing it forever your podcast is just quick I quit the eff say you would like that in one second one second you didn't say I love it so much that I can I've come close a couple times Wow yeah I'm there's no way I'm never I will never change what I do in stand-up and I'll never change what I do with the podcast I firmly believe right that if I did that I would be a miserable fuck right if I decide I believe that - I'm gonna censor the podcast and now I'm not gonna have people like David showing he's a fucking loose cannon he's talking about Jackie Chan finger-banging people it's got a ar-15s up girl's butthole if I did that I would fuck myself over and plus I started doing this thing that I like as much as doing the UFC I start doing these fight companion podcasts yeah where we sit down and we watch the fights we put the fight up on there right and we drink I smoke weed and we watch the fight to just talk while the fights are going on it's the most fun and they're recording them and we broadcast it you're probably having more fun doing that shit gets hundreds of thousands of downloads Wow seems crazy I like doing that almost as much as I like being there almost being there is the best right I mean I look don't get me wrong I love my show and talking about everything you know fucking Jackie Chan like finger blasting and whatever but I love getting access to fucking go to to the North Pole and interviewing like the Norwegian army general and getting you know I like that stuff too right and it's like well any time I'm put in this I'm like you man I'm like I'll never fucking bounce it yeah I never thought out to anybody like I don't give a fuck you if I at the same time I don't have to do anything you know right you could just sit down and just just chill yeah yes you have what's really fuck you money you really have it I mean that's a that's an expression you can just fuck you money feel good you're gonna use that fuck you money use it to say fuck you and when you when you do a television show where they compromise you hey you gotta take now on DVD a si oh you got to stop doing a ar-15 up girls butthole pictures but you automatically you you get rid of the whole point of having fuck you money yeah you can't say fuck you who you are is this weird unique artist dude who likes doing she like pushing boundaries you like being open about everything from prostitutes to sexual proclivities to overeating and diabetes that's you man right you're a good dude you know I like you I like I don't worry about guys like you getting corrupted by the fucking grist for the mill gets stuck in the machine where they figured I can make more money off of David show I gotta make Dave you know what they did with here's a perfect example no they did with David Dave Chappelle Dave Chappelle was doing the fucking Chappelle show which in my opinion is the greatest sketch show of all time the best the best he's one of the funniest and years later we could watch repeats it's funny as shit that guy the the blind white racist who was a black guy it's still one of the greatest sketches of all the work the race Trading and the Chinese taking the wu-tang clan brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant show they started telling him he kind of couldn't say nigger they started telling him to stop saying it he was like what are you talking about they were like we can get more money from advertisement if you stop saying this so you stop saying that or don't do this or do and that's when he went crazy or maybe he went sane right undecided you know what I got some money and they they had a fifty million dollar offer to fuckin renew and this and that and he just said fuck this he went to Africa where it tried to relax and find himself and came back and he quit the fucking show and he quit the show because they were turning him into something else they were trying to take this uncensored brilliant artistic mind and make him a commodity right and that's what happens man but that's their business it's not that's like it's like being along with a wolf and the wolf eats you when it's hungry of course it's a fucking wolf right it's what they do right it's say you can't be upset at a wolf for eating you that's that's their nature and the nature of people that run these these production studios and networks they're not evil they just make money and the way to make money how much money can you get from Toyota well Toyota will give you X amount of money if you don't have any swears they'll give you you know Exmoor if you cut out this and don't do that they'll sign on for three years a three-year commitment well that's the way that shit works no I've been you know I've worked every job I've worked in advertising I've worked I've done all that shit when I when I made the fucking money I sat down and I have five guys that work with me now and had a meeting and I said the point of what we do and it's never been and especially now is to not make money you know I know I could sit here and talk to you about like should you turn into subscription base or ads and listen that we've never had ads on my show and because I don't have to and it's like it would be nice if we made stuff that did make money but that isn't that you know the last three years like everything I do just like hemorrhages and bleeds and honey but you know I can sell one painting and make that money back in one bite and you know it's like uh people have had this discussion before when that when they're at 7-eleven buying a scratcher or super lotto taking they're like man if I had a hundred million dollars this was what I would do but it's like in this country and I don't go on a diatribe about greed or whatever it's like when is it enough right like when is it like so you got a show that like the Chappelle show and he wants to say nigger just let him say it like you make he feels good he's allowed to say you you know it's like they are not Chappelle's so when you have people that are not creative people or not they're certainly not responsible for his creative vision or and they start interfering with it and trying to monetize it that's when it becomes a problem when it isn't a problem is when you who is the artist is in complete control like a podcast like your DVD is a podcast or like honk dynasty or any this other shit you do like all of your paintings no one's standing over you and go Dave stop painting tits you know you're painting vagina but you're making women objects you're doing this you're doing that you you you can't be you if that's happening maybe some people are gonna criticize you and maybe you'll take that criticism to heart and it'll change your opinion about things which is totally honest and fine if someone says hey you know hey Dave I'm tired of you painting blah blah blah and then you go you know what that's you know it's kind of fun I want anybody to feel bad right I'm just trying to express myself maybe I wasn't looking at it from their point of view and then you could sort of all to your point of view it's not it's nothing negative about that it's a part of developing maturing growing taking in all sorts of different influences it's a part of being a human being but there's a big difference between that and doing it only for money and that's what happens when you get attached to a network right and it's not their fault it's just what they do but it's why like I've never I've never talked to anybody about selling this thing I would never sell this thing this is just this is we started this out we're gonna go bad the day that horse 100% yeah fuck everything up right say you got to stop smoking weed right guys got lit joints everywhere you can't do that what do you mean why can't we it's California right I have a medical marijuana license oh I can't wait gives a fuck anybody we have whiskey here all the time really complains about that like what do we complain it about this it's there's millions of people that smoke weed you tell me that those people's money is not worth anything right the weed dollar is not real money right you gotta respect the fucking stoner dollar we're people I pay taxes okay come on the fucking NRA goddamn it right this there's a real problem when people try to take creative ideas and turn those creative ideas into some sort of a complete monetary venture right and that's what happens when you get involved the television show right it's just what it is though there's some sort of compromise involved here you don't have to do that here's the problem Joe it's like when I paint something it's like some people will see it if I have it in art gallery I don't go to art galleries it's like the spectrum of media is like this right it's like at the top is network television like blockbuster Hollywood movies and then video games or maybe video games is at the top and then it's like you know music and then you know Bullock's comic books and at the very bottom is art right mm-hm so at the very top there's the most censorship there's the most like people with their people involved you can't say this you can't do that often tail to right and at the very bottom is uh is art where I can paint anything and no one cares and it's not literal right not only that it's a direct connection to the art right have your hands on the brush where you're standing in front of canvas there's no one there right and it's alone in you where Terry sport no one's involved in sort of like jerking off a lot of cross-hatching and you draw this thing and it means whatever it means to whoever is to me it means this to you it means that it's like and you know there's very little chances of you becoming like a fucking billionaire drawing comic books but you know it you get to say you what dollar can you put on freedom like that but now because this weird anomaly of where I did make like all this money doing art the floodgates have opened for me to do all types of entertainment and not to sound too like artsy or whatever I look at everything I do is art I look at my podcast my TV stuff I bring that level of expression and freedom to it and then it just is not translating well with the higher ups I guess and it's like hey you could do whatever you want over here but there's you know higher ups Brown I know there isn't it can all suck your dick yeah and I yeah there's no higher ups man it's I mean this all comes down to other people inference and influencing your your creative vision and you can't ever let that happen because you create a vision is what makes you unique you know when I talked about being an artist or wanting to be an artist in high school and having this bad art teacher I mean I honestly do feel bad for the dude cuz he was really frumpy and he had a gut and his his fucking posture was bad and he just was a guy who just had no hope and what he said to me was like I would draw this stuff and he was like you got to do like you you're gonna have to draw things that you don't want to draw or and I said why and he said because you're gonna have to make a living so if you're gonna have to make a living maybe gonna work for this is the thing the example to use you're gonna have to draw babies for a diaper commercial and I was like but I want to be a comic book artist and it's like but you know I may not make it as a comic book are so it's like oh fuck this so my senior year I didn't even take art I was one of the best artists in his class right there was me this guy his name's Jon Devore he was really good and this guy Kevin who was also really good these these three guys we all used to draw the same style stuff I don't know if they became artists I don't know what having to keep in touch with him no high school was would you ever do a fucking it was such a social misfit in high school do you ever do a portfolio day where you have like all your drawings and you go to like a like Disney or something and you're like oh I never got that far with it so yeah I'd even get to two as far as like applying to colleges when I got out of high school I went to art school for a year or two and then I dropped out and I was just like how am I gonna make a living doing this and I and I got all my best drawings and I went to I think it was Cal arts it was like a I it's like open call like and it's like every single animation studio every single advertising agency and I got there and it's all these fucking kids with all their art and there's really long lines to talk to a guy that like has a pencil be on his ear and goes work on this work on this and I was like fuck this and so I was like I'm not even awaiting this line so I went I went to go take a piss and I saw one of the advertising guys get up and I followed him to the bathroom and I said and I pulled one of those well his dicks out I'm like hey look at look at this crosshatch penis I get this and he's like hey you can't wait in line like everyone else I'm like dude I'm pleased and he like looked over he's like hey that's pretty good and so he's got his dick out and a nice fat dick dude now he gives he gives me his card and he goes you're fucking dope man you should come to my office in Beverly Hills and I was like either 20 or 21 and I was like yes and it's the it's one of the biggest advertising agencies in LA I show up there like with a tie on and everything and as I walked down the hallway it's like every movie poster and I was like I made it I'm fucking like young and I'm gonna make a living drawing like this is fucking crazy so I think back then I don't know how it is now they would have all these artists draw in the style I forgotten through Struzan that's that Star Wars uh they got painted all the Star Wars mmm these guys all draw that same style and you draw the movie poster and then they give that to the photographer and then the photographer because you know there's no art in movie posters now right and this is I'm talking about fucking twenty years ago so I'm sure it's different now and it was a Avalanche movie with christos bomb no Chris O'Donnell Chris O'Donnell I think the movie was called Avalanche and so I sat in the room and I was like this is so cool I get to see a movie before it came out you know and I'm like this movie fucking sucks and then I'm sitting there watching it with like six old guys with like cigarettes daily dangling out of their mouths like all right guys we need avalanches we need this and this we need Chris O'Donnell looking like this and I'm like this is amazing you know and I sit in a room and I draw Chris O'Donnell and there's a poster vertical article limit there it is I think I drew that bill paxton well that's what you do you do yeah there's that's pretty that Willem Dafoe who's the guy in the back I don't remember Scott Glenn oh oh that guy yeah he's guys awesome so I got all their headshots I'm drawing them the art directors come in and he's like you know it's he starts with the compliment Dave that's great can you do it again like a little bit smirk a little bit more heroic and then not even a day in I'm like I hate this job I just drew fucking Chris O'Donnell and same thing I the same thought then I'm like how did this movie get made right like it's horrible like like who like like why don't crystal Donald's a beautiful man I just want to see him right it's a good date night movie and so IRA safe I lasted at that job you know when you say like you got a draw shit like yeah I spent the next one was like a Sandra Bullock movie where she's an alcoholic there 28 days or something and I you know that that whole like hey I'm somewhat part of showbiz and I'm working and I'm making the good money I walked into the guy's office less than a month in I said like thank you for this OP is and so much I can't do it he's like what are you talking about like you see that line you see how many people would die he's like Dave any closes door he was like I'm gonna tell you something you remind me of me like 20 years ago the fucking crazy hair you got like that fucking punk rock attitude if you stay here and you do what I tell you you could be running this fucking place in like 20 years like and I was like well you only gave me a nice ego boost don't the devil yeah and I'm like I wonder if you said this to all those guys out there you know and because I was the youngest guy there and I go I I can't even believe I'm telling it like like I said thank you for this opportunity I can't do this though I can't like I feel like art is my passion I love it I feel like I'm dying here you know because I thought oh I could draw Chris O'Donnell all day and then at at night I could draw whatever I want a ar-15s and buttholes right muscle memory I had just spent the entire day training my hand to draw in the Drew Struzan style of Chris O'Donnell I get home and I want to do my shit and I'm like oh fuck that butthole looks like Chris O'Donnell space you know so I tell the guy go hey look I can't believe this great opportunity you gave me but I'm gonna I'm gonna have to regretfully decline this thing and he goes Oh what are you gonna do Dave draw your funny books draw he didn't say it in that voice but he's like he's like what's like mocking he's like yeah a little not like hardcore but he's like what are you gonna do yeah and he's like good luck with that and I was like you know what i-i've made at that young that that it's it's the it's for me the saddest thing when I see young people that have already like given in yeah I'm like that's the time you fight that's the time that you should try and fail and try again and then it's like when you get old you're like at least I tried didn't work out you know so I said look man I'm gonna go for it and if I end up fucking broke or poor or whatever then fuck it you know at least I tried you know yeah and and the next next job from that was drawing midgets and and and bubbles for hustler so I was like yes I get to at least draw what I want to draw and buttholes for offline yeah we're for like Asian fever and the whole Larry Flynt yeah it's trying to monetize a creative vision it's it's always it's it's really important that you try to figure out what is unique in your head and what is in your head any of you how do you get it out and if you all bring up the Chappelle's Show or anything it's like this whole like like I don't want to start my own Network I don't want to start my own publishing company it's like I'm just gonna do whatever I want knowing that it's not gonna make any money and then what always happens is because it's so unique and whatever it does make money oh that's so easy for you now Dave because you have fuck you money I'm like how do you think I got it how do you think I fucking got it like it does you might not still be working for that advertiser right exactly just I played the chance when I had nothing and I had nothing to do they say the rich and the poor have more in common than the middle class because they both like if you're poor you like yeah I got nothing to lose if I get sued or whatever like they could take like my fucking toilet paper roll or whatever you know so I don't know you you look you're not trying to make money you have money so if you're not trying to make money it's really simple yeah it's like you just need a manager I need someone to come along and take care of it all I got to be creative yeah I got a great manager I got great people working with those I got a great personal trainer check this out my rube check out this pain tell me what you think about that it's it's beautiful Lance Joe just showed me a painting of a beautiful Snow Mountain landscape with trees in the style of like Bob Ross you know I hear some crazy um my six-year-old did that shut the fuck up by watching one of those Bob Ross things no she just takes art class so are you fucking kidding she's very talented she's been doing art since she was really little is this oil paint or what yeah I got with her when she was really little too we sit down and do a lot of art together that's amazing talented I got my art from my uncle I got it from my family my grandmother was talented my uncle's talented my uncle's an artist right it's all just it's it's in the family you know what I think about when I see that it's like have you ever seen that this is gonna sound bad but have you ever seen Hitler's art yes I have yeah it's it's it's good but it's very like you would think a guy that is a murderer and like his murdered like millions of people would have like a more heart you know yeah it's like that's great if you're six years like first of all great the thing Joe just showed me look like a grown adult being ripped me out the mountains right like the snow on the mountains so when you're at that age like the Tiger Woods Michael Jordan like young person and like you're you're learning you're like Picasso whatever like you're learning you're just technique techniques and just getting all that stuff now spective you get it down and you're like wow I can paint a tree with all the highlights off the leaves and the dew drops in and that's great that's like the time to do that but then at some point you have to be like what's inside me is it really a landscape or do I want to paint some crazy shit and I yeah and so like she's great she has the potential like everyone has the potential right they get to a point so you discovered fighting but if you never got into fighting yeah I think you would have been a great artist doing you know all your werewolf stuff well I would have enjoyed it I still love comic book movies like I love comic book art I love those like really glossy comic book magazines and stuff so like when I see Hitler's art I see like these landscapes and just shit I'm like dude if you like when his hardcore in your art as you did with killing people like maybe you would have never become a you know well I think see a thing that was out recently about Hitler taking math like Hitler apparently was like really in the meth sounds about right sounds about right is what he's like methyl rant he was apparently a hypochondriac and he took a bunch of different medications but one of them is he took math oh wow yeah which totally makes sense right that was eight then one of the things they say with meth is that a completely corroded your judgment your judgment just goes out the window let us kill Jews those crazy speeches he's probably meth - the tits whoa probably didn't have any nerves at all that's why he was so intense and fucking hair flopping around furious anger in his eyes yeah that's you watch one of his yeah Hitler was on crystal meth thank you that I'm not crazy what's that website is that USA Today yeah well according to a 47 page I can't read that Bulls very military dossier he used to take bull semen morphine tranquilizers bull semen hmm I don't think that did anything for him but the crystal meth a pill that contained crystal meth hmm and other drugs depending on Hitler's have you ever seen kevorkians art no is it is it it's fucking crazy be is fuck Wow well you'd imagine yeah but like it makes you sort of rethink like his motivation have you ever seen George Bush's art yes it's fucking awesome why him looking in the mirror have you seen that one look at the four cans art pull up some of the more dark it's all like death stuff which is really kind of fucked up man it's like he was really into like whoa oh my God look at that man that's like demonic shit it's a guy being pulled into the abyss you see eyeballs behind him and stuff Jesus but there's some other ones that are even more disturbing than that Jamie there's like some like dead body ones and shit don't look look at this look at this one what the fuck is this man look at this so dude sitting at a plate at a dinner plate on the plate going on here it's okay zoom up again it's like a Roman see the whole thing it's a Roman soldier he's smirking he's um he's a guy has his head decapitated there's a bowl of what Jewish stars starve David and then there's like what the yeah and the salt and pepper shaker are like rocket ships yes fucking crazy the guys got an apple the guy's head is cut off it's on a plate there's an apple in his mouth okay so let me ask you Joe you you have your show where you get drunk and you critique UFC fights you have this show you know all these forms of expression you have stand up stand up comedy every night do you think like art is like the best ik not for like like monetizing reasons or fans or whatever just when I draw something and I express it and I don't have to like write literally and I just go wow and that that fucking brushstroke it captures exactly what's going on isn't that like the best feeling like I don't know what's going on the kevorkian shit but that must guy it must have had so much shit that like that release of like painting shit like that is just like it's so therapeutic to me like yeah there's definitely something beautiful about creating something because you know that like it didn't exist before you put your attention to it you put your attention to that piece of paper or that piece of clay or whatever you're creating and you you made something out of it and it existed because you put your attention to it and whatever it is inside of you right whatever creativity is it's it's like you're your god creating something out of nothing you know like there's there's nothing here and you create it and then like just not to harp on it or sound you know it's just with the young people you know because I'm sure young people talk to you all the time and I don't I don't want to sound delusional saying oh it's easy for you or guys like Joe but the saddest thing is when you enslave yourself at such a young age and throw yourself into like yes there's people that need to be parking meter cops there's people that need to be working at ad agencies or what doesn't need to be you it doesn't need to be me but his need to be the person who's listening to me that I'm saying doesn't need to be you it doesn't need to be you there's a lot of fucking people man right and so somebody will fall prey to that trap this is this is like my best advice on that whole thing it's yeah there's people that follow that trap it's like you're young you can fuck up and you'll still be young like and then try again and it's like I get you know I'm sure you have a lot of people that are like your fans that go you did it and I you're my idol and I worship you and this and that and so you did it so that makes me feel like I can do it and my whole thing with that is like the whole like follow your dreams definitely follow your dreams you know like definitely go for like your dreams and everything but like what gets my dick really hard is like when I'm at IHOP and the guy takes my pancake order and he's like you know we have three new different syrups for that and like if you do this that's a better combo and he knows his job and he runs to get me the syrup and I'm like this guy maybe doesn't want to be IHOP waiter for his whole life but the time he's here he's passionate about it he's bringing all of his energy to it and then if I help waiters and ultimately what he ends up doing he's gonna bring that you know it's like just I like try to do not everyone's gonna be the best artist not everyone's gonna be the best actor not ever it's like so when your dreams get crushed or you know it's like be fucking awesome at your job even if it's not what you like wanted to do and then like I don't know I think about chefs a lot now cuz I'm friends with a lot of celebrity chefs that's not a fucking that you're serving you make food for people that's not a glamorous thing which like my friends like David Chang and Bourdain is becoming more glam because they took a shitty job where it's like fuck I gotta stand on my feet and wear these weird clogs shoes all day and all these then this is too salty and take it back it's like a shitty job you're like a servant but they took that job and they made it glamorous they fucking brought their fucking rockstar passion energy to it and now it's like you know I went to a chef's convention this thing Mad symposium in Copenhagen and I mean there's guys with like knife tattoos and weird facial piercings and I'm like is this like a rock star convention or something and insult the artists well yeah and they that to that and so I'm just like be fuckin dope at your job whatever it is well I think being a chef is being an artist I really do I think its cuisine is a form of art and there are different flavors that you can definitely into someone's mouth is this there's an art to that without I really learned that from Bourdain ya watching his show right the and the passion that he has for it it's contagious it makes you yeah guys like Shane brought that to that brought it to your attention and so now it's like you meet kids that are like I want to be a chef when I grow up and it's like that yeah that really didn't exist before you know everybody has something they're really into some people are really into riding horses I couldn't give a fuck about riding horses right some people are really into you know fill in the blank right it's a matter of what your personality fits best with we're in trying to pursue it one of the most insidious things where it happens to young kids or it's not just the compromising early and falling into a slave job it's being saddled with debt right being saddled with debt right off the bat that happens so fucking often man right so often kids go to school and then they accrue fuckin $300,000 in in-school debt and then they get out and their fuck theirs and they almost did it to themselves yeah well like someone will tell them like look colleges in four years now it's more like five to six years you're gonna be like a quarter mil in the hole when you get out and we're not gonna teach you anything here that's gonna teach you how to make money you're just gonna know a lot about psychology well specially if you're doing something technologically based right by the time you get out your years later and stuff solved yeah and a lot of these professors are like dinosaurs they're like teaching you some shit that's like irrelevant now yeah there's a lot of that for sure and it's just also the idea of wanting to figure out what you want to do with your life and having to choose at 18 right you're a baby right and you're 18 years old you're a baby you've only been alive for 18 years it's enough it's not even anything it's your first in over the last couple years is the first years you've been able to make your own decisions right and all the sudden you have to choose the course of your life then you got your parents harbouring are David you should be a doctor David you should be a lawyer David you should do this you should do no for the immigrant experience a little bit hard I mean every first first of all everyone who's an American isn't an immigrant so it's like that that experienced the guilt level for the Koreans is like I escaped from North Korea for you to stick a gun in a girl's butt hole and like you know they use that they're like the tanks and the fucking bombs I had to dodge for you to come here and do Hong Dynasty let your family come from North Korea no but I just say that it's mathematic I'm sure so someone know but you know my dad the fucking crazy escape story my mom has it too it's like it's not you know and ya can since you brought up debt can I speak for it for one second like brought up debt like yeah being in debt so ever so I used I used to do this show thumbs up I just did the fourth season a year ago it's still not out yet but what is it it's just me hitchhiking across America it's still not out it's well three seasons of it are out on Vice and the fourth ones like still being edited or whatever it's it the whole premise of the show is hitchhike from once point A to point B and you can't spend money on any anything like it's just to show oh man I'd love to have your life I'd love to travel and like I've been hitchhiking since I was 15 I've only almost got raped twice that's it that's the worst that's ever happened own it almost not how close a finger in the butt doesn't count right no I'm kidding or am i uh so it's just you know it's it's weird now because I'm rich and I'm on the side of the road begging for a ride but when I got to Detroit basically let me just show you guys I'm gonna when you got there I'm gonna bring out visual wrestling's head in that bag this is a Harry Kim he's my partner on a on a thumbs up our show so you got a bag with his face huh yeah okay you Matt you had this made so here's a hundred thousand dollars this is a hundred thousand real dollars yeah there's on two thousand real dollars I never felt the hot thousand dollars before oh it's kind of heavy yeah damn fat bricks like I like to pop Joe so when like to gamble and when I got to Detroit I didn't realize there was an MGM there there's like MGM casino there and so in the middle of filming thumbs up season four you know I'm I won 10 grand because you know like and I'm like what do I need that for you know so I've never I've never been in Detroit before or I haven't been in Detroit and I don't know since I was 15 you get by Detroit for 10 grand it looks horrible it's pretty bad and I've been to these third-world countries people like oh man look it like Bosnia and I'm like look at America it looks horrible and I couldn't believe it I was so shocked by it because you've heard stories about it and I was like I got filmed with so much emotion I was like you know I'm just gonna hide this money and I just like threw it and like I hid it in around you know like in like shitty areas and I just put up a tweet I said hey I just hit 10,000 in Detroit and it's like I heard about a guy doing that in San Francisco he's like hey if you find it tweet it and it's like this big social media experience I'm like I'm not doing a social media experiment I'm just like hey I'm fucking hiding money and then like I you know I just walk around the block and I tell all the homeless people hey I just like threw like 10 grand and if you guys want to look for it you know and so that's just given the money why I'm making a fucking cake that's true I don't know games are fun you don't feel like I don't like to play games I'm like I love playing games are fun so anyways the people who found the money I'm sure didn't tweet about it and they're like the the backlash comes quickly you fucking piece of shit fuckin with poor people like that this is laughs I'm like what cuz you didn't find the money you know so would it be fuckin with people if you said that you hid the money and you didn't that's what they're implying and I'm like what why would I do that that's fun don't you know so I well I like fucking with people but what whenever I do shit with money I just get you know I just give it away I don't I don't want to fuck with it's like hey he's 102 had to get away like I'm not doing that so I'm a hoarder I don't know if you know that are you really yeah my my the the house that I live in is actually half the size of this room and I've lived there for 15 years and it's just people don't understand it because they're like you could live in a like a fucking mansion and have your own Island and whatever and I'm like yeah but I don't care you know so I haven't gambled since like you know since I went to rehab for gambling and had my heart attack and all that stuff when did this happen thirty five so three years ago now I went to rehab for gambling I couldn't stop man and what and what they had done with the limits because in Vegas like the most you can bet on certain things is like twenty five thousand a hand on blackjack or whatever is they raised it for me because they knew how much morning I was worth and I could bet a quarter million a hand on budget so you know it could go pretty quickly I mean the shifts like oh I just won ten million oh I just lost everything you know how much did you lose uh-huh this is where the mercury poisoning comes in like the the height of my my Vegas experience was like staying at the penthouse in every single casino like all the High Roller casinos a harem of whores in each one and just going downstairs in like winning five million here going to like the next one going upstairs fucking like ten girls in a row going downstairs winning ten grand what's the most you ever paid a prostitute the most money I ever paid a whore I like to say prostitute because I'm classy oh sorry sorry notice I say that the Mercs work the most I ever offered a sex worker was ten grand she wasn't this is a this is some vampire shit this is like when someone's not a sex worker yeah it's like hey like hey not in the Asian guys don't want to fuck you at all like I have no desire to fuck you and you're really crass you're a douchebag you're crude and I go okay so since since I'm not denying any of that so this is real money like this isn't a joke like I'll you know I'm gonna I'm gonna turn you into a whore I'm sorry that's right I'm gonna turn you into a sex worker did you say that to her yeah it's actually all in this book oh yeah this book is all watercolors and the text messages with women that people have no idea that because they don't believe me see my color chart here it tells you what you are stripper single mom bush like whatever can everyone just sure sure sure my favorite so you did it with text messages we converted her or you did it I died oh this one was a telephone because I met her this is a this is a text message between me and a billionaire okay I like at some point I just stopped selling my paintings I was like I just either give them to free to my friends or you can look at it for free on Instagram or you can buy my books that are cheap or you can go out and look at the murals I did like I didn't I'm not on this planet to make really expensive art for rich people you know right so this guy's like and you tell a rich guy he can't buy a painting he's like how much yeah how much so I write to him he goes I don't know how much higher I can go 180,000 is my final offer I don't know what else you want no response for me okay okay I get it you don't care about money but I saw you hit it off with my wife how much how much night for a night with her and I write I don't know let me get my buck let me get her lips off my dick right now and I'll ask her so it's like this is this is shit that happens that like people are like no it didn't and so yes he got busy playing I mean is this guy serious is he playing around no I like you you know like when you get to that level of money like I know rich guys that like pay dudes to fuck their wives and like just it gets weird you know hey I was getting there Oh tell me about this girl there's $10,000 girl oh so she doesn't believe me right and then I take a picture I go I'm holding ten grand right now and she goes fuck you you piece of shit like you think you think like you can buy me I go alright fine whatever I don't think much about it she calls me two months later and the textures mutts two months later and that whatever happens whatever happened in her life or whatever two months goes by I don't know a month me I don't have no idea that the text is is the offer still good I don't even know who the girl is I go who is this and what are you talking about she calls me and she goes you offer me ten yeah and I go no it's five grand now that she was you piece I go I offered you ten grand when I was horniest and I was like I was playing a game and I wanted it that bad I'm like I'm like Nova Jen the most any man should ever pay for her vagina is two grand most the most like you can you know but what about that Robert Redford movie but do me more that's they she's in her breath they should remake it with two grand it's like well I play this game it's a dumb game but you know I played with Auslan and people on our show it's like someone who's not a whore right a person who has a regular job bartender fucking I don't know something where you make it like you're your middle class mm-hmm what does it cost for a person who's not a prostitute who's single who has a normal job to just go up to them and go I will pay any amount of money to fuck you is it the Robert Redford movie is it a million and like I go for normal chick like I don't know 20 grand maybe 10 grand 30 grand something like as long as they know that no one's gonna find that no one will ever find out a big thing no beautiful there's some what a shame right and that's the real problem with the whole idea of prostitution is the shame and every girl I asked they're like I don't know 5 grand 3 grand 2 grand I'm like whoa I shot it way too I like all the guys always say something like 20 and up rent all the girls that or maybe it's the women all the guys if you want to fuck the guy no no when I ask guys what do you think what do they think the number yeah now this girl when you said now it's five grand what'd she say then she said go fuck yourself then so you didn't have sex no then she called me back and then she came and she fucked me and then she didn't take the money and she left and I thought she forgot I said hey you didn't take the money to fill on the thing she said go fuck yourself and then oh we have a weird and we still fuck now we have a weird relationship what a good kid yeah giving off freebies she was basically attracted to you I don't know I'm sort of a strange this is us the worst answer but when you say what's the most ever paid it's with my soul in time like I mean money when money's no object for me it's when people waste my fucking time and they play games with me and they suck my life force out that's what cost me the most yeah I want to get into something with you because you were involved in this gigantic fucking controversy right and knowing you I know you and I know the way you communicate yeah I know the way you fuck around with things and the way you talk about things you told a story on your podcast DVD a essay about getting a massage therapist right to give you a blowjob right and by forcing her head on face face face fucking her face fuck yeah and everybody decided that you were a rapist that you would raped her and that you know you do you've faced this massive amount of backlash online alright well first of all like because I do the news like for fine for vice and to see like if I if I interview a Norwegian general or something and he says something we fact check it we fact check the fact and it's like okay and then it's like we're presenting ourselves as news people it has to be accurate now people who just like some I don't know like the TMZ Paris Hilton Perez Hilton type of shit where it's like we heard this and then they just it's all like this guy's a piece of shit and it's just all gossip rumor stuff I'm not even trying to defend myself like I totally fucked up on that end my shit your shit is live my shit is not live when I record a show I record usually five to six hours three shows back to back because we're not around a lot and you really suck one a week well yeah we did two a week for a year and a half and then it's like hey the show I don't know like I know the first time I came on your show you're like I don't like to talk about my wife or my family this and that and like that's where you draw the line my thing is I don't have a line I like I'll talk about anything and I noticed that my life I started to like lay in true artists form be extremely self-destructive forget about like talking about heads of companies and this and that it's like wow I'm really like oh my god this girl that I just met won't fuck me oh I heard you say horrible stuff about like this and that like I'm throwing myself under the bus constantly you know with my own show and were you doing it to get a reaction when you were doing all the stuff yeah basically what happened was my friend who's a lawyer said dude you're getting into a lot of trouble and when I sit so I'm like here's a show I don't have to do at all mm-hmm it's costing me money time headache there's like weird stalkers hanging out outside you know it's like it was getting bad it was ruining my life and and everyone's like why are you doing it I'm like cuz I guess it feels good cause it's impulsive cuz I like it you know I'll um so he goes look there's a lot of people that you're talking about that they don't want you to talk about them right they have real lives they have real jobs I'd say almost every like celebrity we've had on our show is asked to take the show down or have it edited except for Joe Joe was cool but he said look if you want to tell a story about like like let's say Michael Jordan I don't know Michael Jordan but like say you were friends with Michael Jordan you wanna tell story about Michael Jordan and it's not say a famous white baseball player so then it's like still a famous person you know he's like changed the race if the point of the story isn't who it is and but what happened right and change the race change the when it happened and changed like as many details without fucking about story you know and so it was our third show of the day and my shows like chaotic I mean you've been on there's like six people talking over each other at the same time and I was trying to tell the story and no one was there paying attention and I don't listen like when they show ends do you listen to yourself no I never listen to myself and that was the one time where I was like man these guys aren't listening so I exaggerated a little I never all the bad shit that happened to me I deserved it I never should have told the story the way I told it I should have never liked whatever anyway okay anyways I'm like whatever I'm not a rapist in the soul and there's like well that's what all rape is say I'm not a fucking rapist like I've never like right and then people started bumping me in with Terry Richards and I'm like nobody came out of the woodwork because I don't fucking treat people like that you know right and it's like the holy face fucked her I'm like the number one thing because I have been in prison five times is everyone because of growing up with like these movies American me whatever whenever I go to jail is I'm like I'm not black I'm not white I'm the the minority in prison who someone's gonna try to rape me you know so then I think that then the the would you rather get fucked in your mouth or your ass or you know like those kind of questions and yeah I've been to prison five times no one's ever tried to I don't know really try to fuck my ass or face fuck me but that is point you a little bit I felt a little bit you know I'm like come on yeah but the show ended and uh and my manager comes in he goes do you ever listen to your own show I go no he goes that was the worst sounding like he goes I know you you sort of exaggerated and told that story weird like me you should just cut that out I'm like well then I would be a hypocrite just put it out no one gives a shit anyways then you know like all these blog gossiping bullshit and they've blow it out of proportion and I'm like wow this show that I created in the first place like what happened was I went live on all this Facebook shit happen I went on Howard Stern where I talked for two hours unedited right and it was live then I went on Barbara Walters and she butchered my thing and just took out like tidbits of Paris contacts yeah and I was like fuck this I'm gonna have my own show where no one can ever fuck with me cuz it's gonna be from my perspective and what I did was I shot myself in I'm like the old me I'm the only person ever fuckin person in a sex scandal where there's no victim except for myself and and I did it to myself I'm like there's no fuckin one coming forward they're like what the feminists are like wait til this chick comes forward and we're gonna all get behind her and pay your legal fees because Dave's rich and I'm like no one's coming forward like there's nobody there it's like like the girl likes me and I face fucker like every week now it's like it's like face-fucking is not rape it's like ha ha it's like fun be like you know what happens when you don't want to face fuck somebody you bite their dick off that's what happens like that can happen that is an option so like when you were doing it is it just you just get caught up in the moment you're just trying to be entertaining are you trying to to just be controversial didn't be exciting I just got I just got was really tired this isn't like this is exactly what happened everyone no one but I was losing control of the show and like look everyone always goes why don't you just do your own show you fucking talk forever why don't you do show like you know Adam Corolla or Jill's where it's just like you and like one other person or two other people why do you have like ten guys on your show you know and so I was just losing control of the show it was tired of late and I was like I'm gonna say something a little bit more exaggerated so that they'll perk up their ears which it did oh you know and then look and and then the shitstorm started and it's like I was like well who cares like I didn't do it I didn't mean from their point of view the point of view of people that are listening to that and you know the whole concept of rape culture are you promoters of all can I just say during that whole thing Joe is like like the only one of like my celebrity buddies that like call me and was like just he was a good friend so thank you for that well you're welcome guys you know first of all I don't know if you raped somebody but I don't think you ever would you just see okay I could be wrong obviously it could be wrong but I listen to your explanation of it and I know what it's like when you do in a podcast cuz sometimes you're just trying to be entertaining I've seen people exaggerate stories I know I know I've been on podcast before where people have told stories that I know what really happened right and they're trying to make it better right adding a little to it but the way you did it like if you any crazy yeah if you and me went through some crazy shit and like we were like let's talk about it without getting that guy in trouble then we have to change some details you gotta dance around into a rape session but to the people that listen to it I kind of see their point oh when I went on hundred like I said when I went back and heard it it sounds horrible right like I that's why I'm like everyone who like got down on me I I'm sorry like I deserve like knowing who I am and then like hearing like that thing I was like whoa that sounds bad like so you know but my my defense my delusional defense of like but I didn't do it it's like if I if I said anything it just sounds anytime anyone sounds tries to defend themselves it sounds horrible I was like whatever I mean I I totally understand what you're saying so I'm and I understand it from a point of someone that does podcast to that you can say things sometimes that you don't mean it even you're just trying to be fun or titillating or in your case trying to be really controversial to shake change the the tone of the room you just fucked up you know Patrice O'Neal was talking about something once we was talking about people trying to be funny that sometimes people say like really offensive things that they're trying to be funny that fails and they're a horrible person right he's like but if they said something that wasn't offensive and funny and it it and it succeeded and made you laugh right it comes from the same place it comes from this place of trying to make something entertaining well we make mistakes when you're doing things live look you've been on our show and once I want I need to go back to the North Korea America thing it's like I know I'm not a murderer I know I'm not a racist so why can't I say like aids jokes or it's like I get it now it's like oh well you're an you have a responsibility people will hear that and think you know it's like when I'm with AUSA and we're not on the air and we're just saying the worst shit to each other it's like who cares we're not ruling with a sukira who's like one of the most hardcore of hardcore porn stars ever right so like her tolerance level and that is what she thinks is funny and controversial it's so different well that's what has happened is hanging out and I'm not blaming AUSA it's like I have a lot of porn friends and I have a lot of dislike a lot of disturbed pieces and so when we fuck with each other you know and you know comedians and like like you start to forget that there's normal people out there yeah you're like oh wow like that like you know me and my friends when we get together horrible like like this is I told you about Steve Lee and and bill bill boom doing the McHale brothers so Steve's the lead singer of my band now I started a band called monkey with money mark from The Beastie Boys Steve never gets laid he fucks a pocket pussy every night right and so I say hey dude if if something happens with our band you're gonna start you're the lead singer you're gonna start getting laid all the time and you put pussy way up on a pedestal like he gets so distracted if a girl likes one of his photos on Instagram he's like Steve look at her and I go hey like you gotta you gotta concentrate on like learning these lyrics like like get into the shit so I said you know what I'm gonna take you to Vegas we're gonna have a old bolts cool like when I was in the height of my gambling we have old-school orgy and you're gonna fuck non-stop and you're gonna learn that pussy is it's just sex it's not like this that you know and he's like I'm all for that Dave so thumbs up I'll show you I'll show you a cool video after so we go to Vegas and he's getting his dick sucked by two women at the same time going dance that's just amazing oh my god this is so warm and what this is like the best feeling ever like and it's it's uh it's he's having the best time and he's like oh wow I've never had a threesome before I go there's another one coming so he had like one threesome after the next he's just and like I'm on the bed just filming it for him cuz I'm like I'm like dude you won't you'll want to watch this later I'm like every time you think like oh like this whatever like right like just remember you getting one ball in her mouth one ball in this other chicks mouth and uh you ever see it this is a little bit off-topic but you ever see that Seinfeld where the guy converts to Judaism so he could tell chew jokes so so I'm sitting on the bed filming Steve get his dick sucked by two women and one of them stops and she then he starts fucking one chick and she's like look at his but it's so cute I go yeah Steve's got a really cute but she goes should I stick my finger in it and she I go yeah go for it and he goes no no don't do it exit only but he's still fucking the girl so she goes she spits a loogie in his ass and I go I'm gonna stick my finger is s so I stick my finger in his ass and I go can I start saying fag jokes now I'm like I pretty much yeah hey you can't say say fag and I go but I'm I did something gay right now so I don't know it's like yeah your tolerance level and your your level of like what is that I tell people this shit and then we found out find out that bill who fucked like 30 hookers can't he's 53 he can't come I go what do you mean he goes I don't use my hands and I wear women's underwear and I used the the tightness of the band around my boner and I twerk back and forth until I come and I go what the fuck are you talking about so then we need another TV show that we haven't filmed it which is I go wait so when you fuckers yeah I go that doesn't feel good to you he goes no I go then wipe come then why don't you call me goes and so I go your thing is psychological youyou what is it he's like in a go is it something like where you feel like the girl doesn't deserve your calm or something so I made a whole new TV show for him called girl experience and I'm sending him to Colombia and I paid a model like that looks like Sofia Vergara bill if you're listening like you know not the most attractive guy like a short like very fat nerdy looking asian guy with a girl like basically I told the girl you can't ever talk about money you have to trick him and pretend like you're his girlfriend for 30 days and then see if you finally come so it's the whole TV show if you fuck 30 hookers and you know basically sorry that's my life now so that feels normal so when I talk about this shit with you or my friends it's like whatever that's weird we just talked about Asian guy that works in in women's panties to come and and then you're like oh wait maybe this isn't polite dinner conversation maybe like my world views a little bit skewed and it's a little you know it's like you know it's like you know I'm not the best person to bring to like a dinner party with wives and stuff you know like yeah that's that's definitely not polite dinner conversation right so it's like I don't know and you've been on our show it's like when when you go in the room and the doors close and then everyone just starts fucking it's just like you're like you forget that another world exists you know yeah when everybody starts talking about crazy shit yeah you sort of like get into that mode and it becomes acceptable like right if you're around people that never swear and someone walks in the room and says fuck it's like all right oh my goodness right if you're around people that are constantly swearing you don't even it doesn't like this conversation here nothing nothing's registered right wouldn't and you'll save this fucking this or that yeah means nothing but if the president said it in a speech right you personally bro oh he just said fuck and so I was like yeah Houston maybe I gave myself too much credit I'm like hey I have I've developed my you know I've branded myself as a fucking crazy artist guy and I didn't do anything and I'm like I guess not you know you you know like when you tell someone you're an artist like it's sort of like free Rick like you can do whatever like I'm not rape that's where I know you're victimized well I found out yeah like you made a mistake my whole thing is like I'm around a lot you know and it I'm not saying this at all to get sympathy but like I get raped all the time I like women grab and touch me and do shit to me that I don't want and it count cuz I'm a guy and I'm not I'm not even please please I'm not saying at all because like I like it whether it's rape or not it's like yeah I got molested all the shit it's like how's it molesting if you like it because I because I don't want it and then it's like I like that I don't sure we saw that we can't have conflicting emotions at the same time I love and hate you at the same time no when it starts I'm like I definitely don't want this chick to be touching me and then it's like then it feels good well I'm a sick person I'm a sick demented person and well that was part of what you were talking about when you're talking about this experience like you were talking about the fact that it might be kind of rapey which what got you off and you were saying that again you're a brown a bunch of fucking pervert well 400 so was trying to say it to the next level also was like so your rapist and I was like yes I'm a rapist and it's like no I'm not a rapist but it's like I don't we're I know I'm not so I'm we're joking you kind of forget also that a lot of other people that don't understand your sensibility gonna be listening to this right exactly you assume that the people that get it I like like on my message board my message board it's like this ridiculous message board and some some of the subjects are just so like but everybody kind of understands the tone of the board so they'll say something really fucked up and right if it was on any other message board people might like read it and go what the fuck did this guy just say but it became normal well yeah I still I'm not there yet it's like when I have when I get new fans from like being on the boarding show or if I'm reporting the next cold war coming that's serious shit and then they come over they're like oh I like this guy I wonder what else he's up to rape and they're like whoa fuck right ah you know so it's like I don't know but I'll figure it out eventually that's real I mean you're still you you're still doing the same can I just say something about that it's like if someone's not a rapist it's like it's it's such a huge fucking thing to call someone that one they're not and it's like you're literally like ruining that guy's life but how would they know that you're not a rapist that's the problem they would assume that you are i I saw people that I know call you a rapist I was like oh this isn't I'm like you don't even know me like it's like but they're basing it on what you said right your fault yeah it's we've all think zero defense no fault from what I said it sounds horrible you know me you're like they've just been oh yeah like I know your whole thing right your style of community and I know that show which is crazy I love your show I love your show I love the Han Dynasty share levels wacky shit you do because you I really think you want to than the rape stuff I really think it's important to have a guy like you out there pushing the boundaries I think what you said about Jackie Chan it's funny but it's fucking important right because in in terms of like identifying and and in communicating about racism right that's a real racist thing for a person who's Asian well it's gotta be kind of fucked up it is it is kind of fucked up and it's like I just a Charlie Sheen out there you're banging hookers right and it's like yeah go Charlie yeah but then you do it it's like Oh Dave's creepy but it's it's the people that like come at me the most Asian women they're mad at you yeah they're mad at me it's like my check but you're all Asian all the time but this is what it's done on a grave it's like oh is Dave full of shit or this and this and this so like I said during the height of that like crazy Vegas era I would be going to Vegas all the time with like a hundred grand a million dollars in like a pillowcase in my backpack it's much that looks like this you went to Vegas with a million dollars oh yeah all the time all the time and so that's the most money I've ever seen in my life by the way I've never seen a hundred thousand dollars Oh check this out Joe I I'm cleaning my room for the first time in seven years since I lived in the my hoarders nest it's just it's just filthy I find a shoebox and I'm like oh hundred grand from the Vegas era and I go fuck you know critter I don't want to get into how much shit he does for me but I sat here tearing him down about what a horrible personal trainer he does shit that like I can't even talk about here that's like the peas look he's my little I'm shovels mole yeah so I just I just gave him this I was like you take this because you're the fucking man he's like I don't want your dirty money he's like I don't I don't get I'm not I'm not a Whore like I'm not gonna get paid for the whatever so I was like let's do it for all the people to go if I was written a hundred thousand dollars in a like million dollars but it's like the money it's good get a kid out of debt whatever and so all these people complaining well if I was richer this and that or it's easy or because I did so this hundred grand cash like this I'm just gonna give it to someone okay it's not like some weird like Oh fill out this form and we take half or we're just gonna give it to you but you have to go around the united states and you got to do all that critter put all these clues in place and immediately they're like well we're not rich like you I go I've traveled around the United States for nothing and they're like oh well like we have lives we have jobs I go it's $100,000 that's why you would do it and so and with all the shit they're like we never even know if this guy's serious or not so I'm putting a hundred grand up in this critters cross country cash contest scavenger hunt that's what it's called ten people are playing only ten ten people are playing I bet there's more now well yeah I mean I wanted Raiders cross country cash contests cut all the details are at DVDs DVD a sitcom it's 5-cc critters cross country cash five seas okay here's the problem with that yeah your DVD a sa page anybody can go there and just you know the contest is the only thing on the thing that you can't fuck with you can't fuck with that and change a threat level you could do it right now you can change a threat line yeah sure why not number one that was like a big deal like everyday I've been talking about this lately with my friend my threat levels at what orange all the time then it's bad do you remember when it was like that though like every day you'd look at the news and yeah Paris threat level well that was closer to like 9/11 and it was so ridiculous and it makes people like uneasy and stuff yes that's the point of it and it's also a good thing for the news right here threat levels at orange right and all the fuckers right god damn Arabs Joe I love you I love YouTube you're fuckin awesome guy man you really you're a good dude I really it helps me to come on the show and talk to you about this stuff because I know like you go through a lot of the similar shit like everyone wanted to know like like why I'm so calm in the last three months it's because I took my show down and it's not for any reason that people think it's like literally like I was sitting at home one day and like there was a glitch on our website and they're like oh the next episode can't go up tomorrow Mike why he's like oh we got a call a guy and fix this thing and I was just sitting there and thinking I was reading a comic book and I was like I don't have to do this yeah like I don't have to do this and like I don't know what your fans are like but like my fans are horrible like that's bad that's why critters here today I knew if I showed this money like maybe someone's gonna drive here right now so you know I think that you you're always gonna have some horrible people that are out there first of all you have great fans cuz every time I do your show I go outside I go to supermarket they're like heard you want Joe and they're so nice our fans are fucking great too but then there's like that handful of like if I talk about something then they'll definitely go out of their way to like like if I try to like mask the girl that I'm talking about without giving away or identity they'll put the clues together figure out who it is call her and be like hey Dave said horrible shit about you they're usually wrong and they just live to sabotage me why do you think that is I honestly try to figure that out like I don't watch a lot of television but like you know how there's like all this like reality TV the Kardashians and all the shit the Housewives and people are like I hate this show but I can't stop watching I really feel like there's people that hate me that watch everything I do I could be wrong about this and then like just I get excited and I am like cool I have a show where I could talk about anything I talk about it and then I find out like we did a couple episodes in Big Bear and I was like cool we're doing shows in Big Bear while we're doing the shows in Big Bear because we said that someone went online found out the address of the thing blasted it on that line growth the manager and said hey there's a disgusting porn star and a fucking rapist artists they're doing any on the landlord called us and he's like hey like what what's the like we're trying to have this like we spent a million dollars building this like nice resort honeymoon Big Bear ranch and you guys are turning it into what it was this post the internet controversy or pre after after fault um so I'm just like what the fuck am i doing right look I'm you gotta assume that then people are looking at you as a target they're going after you right and but I'm also like like I said I don't need to be put making painting this bright fucking bull's eye on me all the time right right so like you know what I'm just gonna take a vacation never take a break yeah but we're back we're all gonna do it again well it's up there there's that there's our disgusting DVD ace a Wikipedia page and our usual recording new episodes yeah I mean well the thing is I never stopped I never stopped recording like I know like we have like 30 50 episodes I don't even know so the entire time you're just recording them not releasing them yeah if someone shot me in the head today I'd have like like years worth of podcaster just that's all there you can't stop this shit motherfucker you can't stop this shit DVD a say forever fuck man people are gonna be very happy people were very bummed out on my website my message board people were very bummed out that you took your show down well I'm like I'm always like who gives a shit like you know it's like people give a shit but you gotta understand okay as your friend this this this persona that you've created you who you are you your actual human existence where you are and then on top of that all the hyperbole of exaggeration and fun and chaos and all the stuff that you're doing all those machine guns and buttholes and all this chaos you're automatically gonna attract a certain amount unsavory attention and learn dunno well it's also plus people are fucking haters there's out there and there's a lot of people especially stronger they want to not like something right they're looking for something to Streck them from the miserable existence that they're caught up in and there's also people that they K this guy's a piece of shit rapists I have a target now and then they go after you because of that well how do you deal with it like I'm done not a right piece of shit rapist no I'm not saying you're very nice person to say nice I know you have crazy fans I'm just gonna get crazy people you're always gonna get a certain amount of them and I try one of the reasons why I mean I assume one of the reasons why the people that like the show are so nice my fans are so nice is cuz I'm a nice person and we can also fuck them up by just doesn't matter people could shoot people's houses right that doesn't last you know you pick kick people's asses they don't like that they shouldn't you they stab you they run you over the car right just be nice like if you martial arts is supposed to be about developing your character all right figuring out how you overcome difficult obstacles and how that makes you a better person to not fight that's what it is for me right so it's not about that but it's also about being confident so you don't have to worry about as many people kicking your ass there's always gonna be some people that can kick your ass no matter who you are really right unless you're at the top of the fucking heap and then you're only at the top of the heap for a certain amount of time when Cain Velasquez beat the fuck out of Brock Lesnar everybody was like Jesus Christ you could be a guy like Brock Lesnar right somewhere out there this is badass dude with Brown pride tattooed on his chest who just beats the shit out of you always be someone there's always gonna be someone most likely but I think you put out a certain energy and you get back a certain energy well like it's new there's always that's the metaphor I said in high school I fought like almost every weekend didn't win 90% of them still did it so it's like that's if that says anything about you there's nothing I mean be short of like putting a bullet in my head there's nothing like you you getting in that that black guy putting your thing and humiliating you it's like I've been embarrassed humiliated I've been called a rapist I've lost love and finance and I've anything bad you can do to me I've been in jail I've almost gotten raped you know like it's like there's nothing you can do to me that I haven't done worse to myself you know but use like groan from all this stuff right I think so have you grown from this personal experiences an experience I think so the rapists experience the virtual rape is that experience yeah yeah you know that putting that out there now even though it's an innocent look and you're trying to entertain look when I like the the stand-up thing that I threw up on vid me it's like the first time I tried it like I'm you could see I'm shaky I'm trying to find words like I broadcasting I don't know how many episodes you're up now like 600 or something like and and you've been on TV like I I've been a quiet guy drawing werewolves my whole life right and I've just started to do shit this shit I'm trying to figure out who I am I'm trying to you know I'm I'm learning and I don't mind thing I don't mind people judging me as I learn and I know that's gonna happen with the haters and stuff but it's like look if you want to hit on me go ahead I'm like I'm sorry if it didn't turn out exactly the way you wanted I'm sorry if I offended you actually I'm not I'm not sorry if I offended you but it's just like you know I'm look I'm learning I have my heroes like Stern and whoever growing up it's like there's a little bit of emulation but then there's also like I want to be my own person so I'm trying you know I'm trying to figure out my voice and in the meantime like yeah I'm falling I'm failing here so I hopefully I'm learning from this experience it was also the there's an I don't know if there's an art or skill to being the public guy and expressing yourself because I have not mastered that yet shit that we all do and I know you know you hang around with guys that I know like Bobby who's fucking crazy but he's crazy and there's the shit that Bobby and I have done just hanging out at the Comedy Store right to make each other laugh right well Bobby said like ridiculously dark fucked up shit shit out Howell laughing right I know he's not being aren't but if anybody else came along and didn't know Bobby and heard him say that right it could be misconstrued and when you're broadcasting it to the whole world and that's what is inviting a bunch of people who don't know you as a human right you know yeah no that's examine you if that what you just said is a commercial for my show it's like we say some fucking horrible shit and it's like if you're if you're part of the family if you're part of the whole like you you're in on it then you get it if you're just like oh I saw him on HBO let me check them out you're like what the fuck that I just hear right now you know you should hire someone to go over all the DVD ASA's as you do them and at the end of the episode go what do you got for me well you said you raised someone oh I definitely didn't do that bullshit well you said you robbed gangsters and you fuck them in the ass with a dildo well I didn't write that I can't talk most where you have you know we solve the problem I did I don't need to hire anyone dvd-a say if you if you go to DVD a sitcom you can like listen to it on iTunes or whatever but if you want to watch it it's on that vid me site now because like I don't want to censor anything we broadcast from an insane

like 34 GS or I don't know the biggest real tits I've ever seen in my life so a lot of people watching them they kept flopping up yeah yeah that's what's going on so how did you get you so you paid them to let you get into this I said look man instead of like you said like that's that definitely crossed my mind I was like I'm just gonna hire someone we're not live right we're delusional we say dark shit at the end of that episode have like a lawyer go hey that you guys went too far I'm like right good like that always makes me feel good like you know I'm 40 I'm 38 years old I just started a punk band with Steve Lee and whatever my dad heard it and he's like I've never been more embarrassed of you in my head because because I have a Korean song where I was like Pangu more girly Pangu more girly it's like you want to eat my fart you want to eat my fart music you're a grown man you're a grown man and you just did it like that is so disgraceful to my country you're my son and he's like I'm begging you as if I'm a fucking grown man he's like I'm begging you as your father take that song down and I'm like yes yes I did something right you know it's like so instead of having a guy paid to be like take this episode down or edit this thing I'm like let's just broadcast live from a fucking insane ice I don't think that's a real disclaimer though I know it's not Joe 5150 somebody have one of your employees just go over everything with a fine-tooth comb and then apologize at the end of every episode I just do everything as you don't as if one of these nut jobs is gonna kill me one day and say let's stack the podcasts that this shows how many nut J's this is all that the negative nut jobs are all post this right no I mean this is I mean I've had critter for a few years now right but I mean the negative nut jobs the Escalade oh no no I've had haters in my entire life you know well they both look at you like you're not just a talented artist you're a talented artist that got some crazy break where you you but Illustrated the Facebook offices and gave you a shitload not deny that the Facebook thing was a crazy brick but I've made millions of dollars in like everything I've ever wanted to do and so it's like did I get a crazy break over and over again or did I just bust my ass and like you know just fucking go for it you know you you've been very successful end right you got a crazy break oh yeah I've been very successful and that and then so when anything happens are like oh well like I said the world started the show oh well he's rich I'm like well what about my entire life up until then like was that a good love to marginalise breaks people love to find some way where you're not better than that right the difference was the Facebook thing in my life before was nobody knew how much money I had so when they went to my hoarders house like I had millions already I already sold out a million-dollar art show in London I had millions from gambling and like but nobody knew right and I was like so I can still like that's the best that's the best combo you get to live a normal life but your fucking riches shit and then so you were rich before the Facebook shit even one I didn't have hundreds of millions but I had a few million and I was like cool that's more than I ever thought I would make right I'm selling paintings for a couple hundred grand like it was awesome I go to Vegas and win a hundred grand it was like it was a very good life but now it's like you know if I go most public now it's like give me if I put my email right now it's Jimmy money give me money give me do you ever give people money no never I hide it I didn't well yeah I had $100,000 I'm gonna give away but they don't I have to I'm making you work a little bit for it right the clues the fucking clues recruiters cash contests or like the dumbest like easiest Clues ever I was like I want to make it all cryptic like the game and make it super hard and I was like no I'm literally force feeding you the answers like well what if more than one person finds it we have a whole thing it's like first of all everyone thinks I'm hiding cash I'm like I already learned from the Detroit

able to do yes come by for like an hour or something it sounds crazy yeah it'll be fun it sounds like chaos yeah I'm like I like I'll answer anyone's question you know like on the the reddit thing they ask like crazy questions and then like if you ignore them they just upload it so it's like the the number one question or something right right right I don't know it's but once again don't have to do it like the pain like the torture but you you enjoy all the chaos you definitely enjoy living it I love it yeah that's I think that's why you live in a tiny little place you didn't move to some suburban neighborhood in Beverly Hills and set up shop and some nice you know have a manicured lawn you live like a crazy person it's manufactured misery you know the whole miserable you're not miserable it's miserable in what way it's it smells so bad in there there's there's cockroaches ants but why do I do that then because you know you and me we could talk about like oh you should eat kale and this and that but it's like I know at the end of the day what I'm really gonna do and so if I sit here and go hey Dave forget all this fucking bullshit you've talked up until now your podcast TV bullshit you're an artist okay so let's talk real talk about you being an artist right how much have you actually painted in the last 10 years not that much okay let's look at your entire life when have you painted the most when I was in jail in Japan when I was in a cold miserable place in China with no internet no cell service so the the the combining factors of all these places is that it was always cold no internet and no cell service and no one else around so isolation cold and miserable and just that's what it takes now because I am easily distracted addictive person so I can't and I do have a lot of options for postie that I never had before I I do have all these things and it's why dude Joe's cross-hatching of a werewolf with like that takes a long time and I have it in my head on oh man I wanna paint this thing there's gonna be a million little people and I get this crazy tripped-out idea it's gonna take me like a week to draw that the way I want to draw it and then there's a Playboy model that wants to suck my left ball and a penthouse model that wants to set my right ball and I'm like hmm tough decision it's like wait that's what you know drawing my whole life was the only thing that brought me attention and now I have everyone's attention so let me fuck the whole world but isn't it like it's like you know so it's you were talking earlier about your favorite thing is to create I do when you put it but there's a self-destruct know thing that distracts you and let me backtrack my favorite thing is creating and pussy so let me let me just ask you this job because because you're in it you're comedian like like the whole like what like is the great art always come from misery it's like Jim Carrey anymore like do you have to be miserable no you don't I believe you can make really good are if your well-adjusted and your happy and whatever but I'm talking about the great shit that transcends time and whatever those people are suicidal miserable fucks and then speaking just for me because I know my best stuff always came from rejection hatred getting dumped living in miserable conditions there's nothing about living in a 20-story like our Tony bedroom fucking mansion in Beverly Hills with the pools and Playboy models hanging around that makes me want to create yeah but you're getting your balls sucked by Playboy Playmate it's Anna it's still the most amazing paradise ever it's not staying in Suites in Vegas and bang at $10,000 hookers you're talking girls in the fucking you that never will sex workers sex workers sorry I didn't say whore at least I'm not trying to change your opinion right but what I'm trying to say is you you love a lot of different things but you definitely have a self-destructive streak but I don't when I was a kid and I was doing stand-up when I first started doing stand-up one of the things that I thought is man I don't ever want to get enlightened right because if I get enlightened it's gonna fuck up my comedy oh right my comedy was always my favorite comedy was always like Sam Kinison Richard Pryor troubled people or dirty people and I was always thinking like man you can never like achieve a certain amount of enlightenment because then you'll never be able to do like the great comedy but I don't I think that's a trap we'll check this out like I'm at my I'm at my warehouse where in the wintertime it's freezing and I'll be painting and I remember thinking like wow it's 2:00 in the morning I'm miserable oh wow I have a heated fireplace a woman just playing with their vagina waiting for me to go in there in a beautiful house in Beverly Hills oh I'm gonna call it quits for tonight now I'm there again still painting and I'm like wow it's 2:00 in the morning I'm miserable and guess what my house in Koreatown still miserable I'm just gonna keep painting you know so that to know that that comfort like I say it all the time Comfort is the killer of creativity like to know that that's there like it's not that I can't paint something good like something good is still being painted but it's not gonna have the level of intensity of like it's you know being completely measurable yeah an awesome also said exactly the same thing you said right now she's like people try to make me feel bad for being a porn star she's like I love fucking I love sex and then I've offered her I was like you know because we have dark spots in our past like I think like there's a huge age gap where I don't remember where I'm like is that why I'm so fucked up that I get raped or molested or whatever and she has the same thing so I do lots of rich white people kind of enlightening you know wellness camps and shit like that where I'm always the only Asian guy and the youngest guy there and I said to her I was like hey if you ever want to do that stuff off you know I'll pay for your therapy and this and that and she's like I don't want to go and then learn something and become enlightened and then find out that I actually hate myself and hate porn so she's enjoying her enjoy her life right now well people are very adaptive man right we're very malleable and we change to our environments and you can you can become comfortable and happy in a lot of different weird circumstances and if you find a good state a lot of times people like this is right I'm good I don't need no enlightenment I don't need I don't need no consciousness expanding I'm good right here well I'll tell you right now like I'm this this a lot of people is like really disciplines and people close to me like they're like oh so sad and they're I only fuck hookers now like I don't like I have given up like I don't want to say given up because I am adaptive in this could what I'm telling you right now could change tomorrow but as of right now I am working on animation TV shows my podcast painting working on my next book it's like there's no time in there for a real relationship for kids I cannot like when you say why don't you just buy the best trainer the best nutritionist I go guess what I'm paying for the best posting ah well you gotta pay for it I go yeah I'm rich yeah but they don't love you I go you could have fooled me the way these women said I did like the woman is the woman who sucks my dick like that's in love with me that wants to have my children like you when you give a woman fucking two thousand dollars and she needs it and she knows if she sucks it really good that there's two thousand bucks coming to next week she's sucking it like she's in love with you like it's like that dick is like her lifeline and it feels pretty good and guess what and you've heard this before you're not paying them for that you're paying them to leave so I get my dick sucked amazingly like the chick is in her honeymoon for days like this like the fucking veins on my dick are like a lifeline UV into her system then she leaves and I spend all night writing drawing creating there's no like you're up all night you didn't call you didn't check in we're going to take me out and I'm like I am fucking creating so much right now still fulfilling my my sexual needs cap it off with another blow job from a different chick it's like I'm I'm sorry if that upsets you if you're like oh weld it and it's the women they get upset they go yeah I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing this is why first of all Evol antara everybody's voluntary no no one's doing anything against their will right they want the money you want to get your dick sucked it's an awesome exchange yeah you know I have a real problem with prostitution being illegal and this is coming from a guy wise daughters I don't want my daughters to be prostitutes but I'd also don't want them working at fucking Denny's I don't I don't want them but working as a garbage people well like I said the women I'm fucking aren't like I mean they're sex workers they're not like hookers I find on the street or like I go online they're just people I know that I've offered them money oh so this little bit like created what I created them Wow I only work for you know sort of maybe may know maybe I lit something up inside that's a great gig though yeah I mean look there's a friend I'm paying you money to get Oh like get away from me yeah I I really like you you know it's not just like where's the money and looking at the clock it's like I like you we had a good time use this money go to real estate school or what like whatever you're gonna do but I need my time now that's what I'm paying for as a rich guy I value my time and that's why when you said earlier what's the most you ever paid it's like when I do fall in love and catch feelings the worst STD you can catch it's like it's like oh fuck I just wasted three months at the bitch that just fucked with my shit and like is like trying to like play games with me and fuck me over and it's I can't happen right yeah can happen it can really happen it can really fuck you up if you you get involved with someone who's manipulative who wants to control you and I live in LA do live in LA you know and you've got money so you're a target all right look Joe I feel like a catch I feel like I'm a soldier and I'm like in a war and like Chris Rock has his joke right he's like you want to be the first anything you don't to be the first black president you don't be the first black baseball player he's like I'm butchering his joke right now but he's like do you want to be Jackie Robinson nigger nigger this or you want to be dill dill strawberry coke blonde whores like okay so like what I'm sitting here going huh who was the only Asian guy that fuck the white chick on TV it's like one guy Steven Yeun it's like we're like sort of the first everything you know so it's a little bit stressful I'd rather be I'd rather like I don't either be like ten other weird wacky asian guys and then like you know and Jackie Chan doesn't count I'd rather be like number ten or twenty down the list you know like I don't want to be the guy in the forefront but guess what I'm not complaining at all I am complaining but I'm here I'm gonna do my job and and I'm gonna do it as best I can you know it's I had an armchair psychoanalyze you I would say that you spend a lot of time conflicting with other people's expectations and everything with you very conflicted but why because you seem so free when you do your own thing but now this is the question right it's part of what makes you enjoy your life the fact that you reject these other people's expectations and their definitions of you and you get to live free on your own n you're proving that you're successful you're creating great art you're having fun your podcast is well-received you're getting all this attention you're David motherfucking Chow right on top of the fact that all these people want you your dad's calling you you're embarrassing our country you're fucking everything up girls are mad at you you're fuckin hookers you're a piece of shit right and meanwhile you're creating all this great art and you're living in chaos and squalor I've got I'm George Costanza I'm the guy not David fucking show um I this is you're gonna laugh so recently I was having sex with this girl that has a lot of lines on her hands like mine's like not wrinkles but a lot of so I said hey that like like a lot like hundreds of unusual unusual so I said hey you've ever been to a palm reader so she said no so I said let's go to a palm reader so we went to the palm reader and I was like fuck I'll get my palm read too and she goes what are you I go I'm Tan dad she goes let me see your right hand first and so I flipped my hand over and she goes well how very enlightened internally inside like not much bothered you very evolved like and I go okay and she goes flip over your left hand she Oh externally you fuckin complain about everything and you whine and you bitch and your mouth is very blunt and you're getting a lot a lot of trouble and it's like I didn't grow up around Koreans I grew up around Jews so that whole like Larry David humor like the whole Woody Allen shit that's what I grew up around so yeah I can shit sit here and like fucking complain about everything but at the end of the day you're right and it doesn't it doesn't fucking bother me I am very free I can just in one second say fuck this podcast and just quit it like what I'm saying is I think part of what makes you happy is this battle definitely well that's just being Korean I mean there's nothing I could do about that really yeah being Korean makes you want to fight against things I talked to Bourdain about this on the show it's like they probably have it in every culture their own version of it but in Korean it's called Han and it's like it's like genetic it's like you're just like I have a friend who has adopted a Korean son and he has his own kid and he goes my normal kid is just you know cuz he's rich he's like he all my kids have everything they could ever want but this Korean one he just wakes up with a scowl on his face every morning I go yeah welcome to fucking Korea dude like it's like you're just like David Chang yeah a generic he's one of my best friend he's like a my twin brother and he he does like with cooking what I do with are like just fucking goes at it and he's very successful he's like on the cover of time and all these magazines and the best chef in the world and all the shit and when I hang out with them I mean he makes me look like he's just piss and vinegar like fucking her I go why are you so angry I some like you talking to me right now and he's like come on to you it's like all the kimchi in our blood or whatever but it's Korea's a small island or it's not Island's a small country that's been invaded by Japanese and fucking Chinese and everyone's always trying to take over Korea so it's like almost like a evolution like built in hate system of just being born like right two workers man yeah hard work like it's it's like I don't know there's a lot of similarities between Jews and Koreans I think in on that end you know I grew up with a lot of Koreans yes you know what talking about no environment you know what I'm talking about right now I mean I was I was around Koreans constantly they're loud you know the other thing about them is I've never met more people like as a group that are more dedicated to hard work in life if you don't work hard if you're not miserable from working hard all the time right you feel like a piece of shit right like I had a friend he was on the national my friend junk sick John sick Chang yeah he was he was a national Taekwondo champion and at the same time he was going through his fucking residency the medical resident right this guy was always tired this is how I would see him like this always tired and they just fucking work out really awkward and then be exhausted right he would be at school and he was training so he would like be studying all day and then he would run upstairs you run up the flights of stairs at the University right he was constantly tired constantly miserable but he felt like if he didn't live like that right and I have to be happy that's in me that's in my blood and and so let me take it straight down to comedy and let me get racist for a second I mean people asked I'm sure they asked you who's your favorite comedian I'm like okay forget specifics who's your favorite comedian blacks Jews and Koreans well Orient's what Koreans well it's like Bobby Lee like okay so if I take it just to Asians there's not like Chinese comedian I mean there are right but there's no Japanese big it's like all the big funny comedians that are successful in America are Bobby Lee dr. ken Jeong like they're all they're all crying you know but I think it's like certain yeah japanese big comedians i mean i can't think of one right now or why aren't there huge Chinese and why are why are there so many Jewish comedians this is in here long persecution this torment part of the culture this why is Howard Stern miserable why is Jerry Seinfeld miserable why is Larry David miserable they're so rich Ryan you have nothing to complain about you're a billionaire you have why and that's like sort of like what you're asking me right now I don't know why I'm so angry it's just there but it's like it's just like I don't know how to define like I don't know why Jews are so funny I don't know why Koreans are so funny I don't know why blacks were so funny but what do they have in common persecute persecution mmm misery and don't you think though that like as Japanese and Chinese like as generations go on they become more assimilated especially because of the internet you're gonna see more and more Chinese comedians more Japanese comedians do things along those lines don't you think like as they become more entrenched in the art form yeah maybe who knows I don't know dude you could be a comic and I'm not I love it called you after I saw that video I might dude that shit is really funny thanks Joe I appreciate you that's your first time on stage you were those notes that you had on a table I sure you wanted to talk about I my whole thing is always you know for me that's horrifying because you know in the same way comedy solitary you're not up there with anyone unless you're like Smothers Brothers and you're comedy duo or something but it's like I didn't want to have an act I want like like when I come here like it's like I was like I just wanted to make everyone sure that I'm actually giving this away this money that's all I'm like and then everything else I'm like we'll just riff you know right right it's like you can just you know I had so I was like I want to go up there with no act and then like I started like writing stuff down but it's whenever I write stuff it just ends up being like dicks yeah I mean he's been drawing the whole time we've been on this pipe crossing the ball there's a dick would come squirting out of it this is the whole time he's been on this podcast he's been drawing so it's auction that piece off if you see the close-up of me doing the comedy special and it looks like I wrote some flashcards they're all just drawings of dicks on the side like it says that's all that that was yeah and so I'm like I'm like when I see the black guys on the corner like hit on every single girl that like hey what's up and and I'm like dude does that really work and they're like no but the one time it works out of 100 it's worth it you know right so when when when I was you know thinking about doing stand-up or whatever I'm like okay so if I get if I bomb like the worst like bill you suck and they throw oranges or I don't know what they throw or made of tomatoes do they really do that her um it's like okay so what like a I already like pain like that you know it's like win-win for me if I'm humiliated I'm like oh I tried it I sucked so I just was like fuck it I'm gonna go for it and I was like I don't want to act I know I'm talking to college students so I'll try to like stay on college topics and hell it's dumb it is but yeah who did that with you what is just you was just you it was just me who organized that show so I get asked to colleges to talk about like art and whatever right and I never do it I used to do it a long time ago and then it's like you know someone's like David's very like almost like motivational Tony Robbins kind of speaking kind of shit and I was like like some tombow shit baby like man you'll make my money you know cuz I know how to make money right if you got ripped away everything took all my money I could go out and figure out how to make money again like it's it's not like I'm very confident with that so uh you know when they approached me they were like hey we would like to speak you know you like to speak at UCLA it's very prestigious Bill Clinton Dave Chappelle or Michael Moore all these people did and I was like well what do you want me to do and they like talk about whatever you want I go well then I'm gonna try stand-up and they're like oh we didn't know you're a comedian I go I'm not and they go uh this is awkward and I go well I what do you mean like you're gonna tell jokes and stuff like yeah sure they're like yeah all right cool so you'd wore a nice red suit yeah and since I did that I did it five more times in it's like it's so fun I can't did you do in Hawaii with Bobby and I did it in Hawaii hiki that fucking asshole so he's like before before the show he's like David again and you're like a weird Warhol like artsy fucking faggy dude I get it but you don't speak the language of comedy you don't speak the like I need a real I need a real open or Dave not you and my fucking brother touching each other's I need a hope you'll I need the audience to get ready for when I get on stage like I don't want you up there doing some weird artsy fucking fake rape shit or whatever like I need a real comedian and I go fuck you dude fucking you're such a piece of shit and and it was any you know it was last he couldn't find anyone and I said hey fuckface guess what I've seen you stand up ten times I have your act memorized I'm gonna do your exact act before you gotta go what the fuck are you gonna do about it and his face changes he goes because I thought he thought that's me being delusional I thought he thought it would be funny he's like don't do that Dave I go he goes that's like me going to Europe like if I had an art show or if you had an art show and I had like the counterfeit of that right next door I'm like cool then I will just paint something else like you as a real comedian if I just sabotage your whole act should be able to go up there and talk about weird Hawaiian shit or like anything you know because he's funny enough and I that's me being a weird guy like trying to push him and he said please don't do that and I'm like I'm gonna do that you asshole so I go up and he's just like can you do it can you do ten minutes I'm like dude I did two hours at UCA without fucking any notes or anything like this and they had to kick me off the stage I could have gone for hours and I hear those like Chappelle and those guys do like the 14-hour levels are never good yeah yeah so I go up there and I and it's me and I did like I some others brothers comedy routine with his brother like we just ripped off each other on all the weird shit that happened just on the flight to Hawaii and so we're just killing and he's on the side of the stage and he's like it was like a movie he's like get him off the stage they're fucking killing I don't want to follow that and I was like yes he didn't want to follow you don't want to follow us if you're listening right now Bobby fuck you motherfucker fucking killed your ass you little bitch Bob no Bobby but Bobby killed after us he's the fucking I love him he's just fucking that's what he's the real deal he goes for it you know yeah Bobby Lee's the real deal yeah he's it really crazy the first time I met Bobby I'm not Bobby clock it was like the 90s and Bobby it was in San Diego he wasn't on MADtv wasn't doing anything back then he was just doing stand-up at the Comedy Store in La Jolla yeah this is probably like shit 95 or something right 96 maybe I don't know a long time ago right and was a bunch of comics went to a strip club and there's these Mexican gangbangers to the strip club one of them has long hair and tattoos on his face it's the 90s he had tattoo tears on his face right and he had eyes like he had these eyes he looked at him you knew this motherfucker had seen some shit right I don't know if he'd kill people right I don't know I don't know what I'm just guessing but I had a guess fuck yeah he's killed people right and Bobby somehow or another insulted him by talking to his girl like there was a girl that like maybe he was his girlfriend right who was a dancer there and Bobby talked to the girl yeah and the guy stood up and Bobby's like fuck these bitches they don't know shit right now like and I know and I was like you're gonna get me killed right I go you either we're leaving right now you're coming with me or I'm fucking leaving you here or and me and I think was Jimmie Schubert was with me we ran outside and jumped

people that will shoot you right and that guy will fucking shoot you right I'm pretty sure but he in a similar way he has that this weird Korean energy and like at like a real artist like a real sult
