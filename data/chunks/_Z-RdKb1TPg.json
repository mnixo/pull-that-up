that's what a professional does professional turns that bitch down on down huh a non-professional or someone who's half-assing it they keep that phone up really yeah have you seen that yeah some people keep that phone up checked that phone on time they'll check in the middle podcast Russell Peter can't leave his phone alone really try getting through a fucking whole podcast with Russell Peters without I'm checking his tweets what's impossible impossible he's checking things sometimes you read off tweets and say oh people Oh Doug Benson used to do that that's why I read off the tweets I'm trying to get away from it if I can I'll find times if I'm gonna go eat now I'll even leave it at my phone in the car yes Power Move and I hadn't done that before I just started and it's not even a natural choice I'm making almost it's like something I need to do yeah it's a chickenshit move all right you're scared scared to leave it in there yeah scared scared to leave that phone would have something important I guess I needed to know but there isn't there is a thing like what if something important happens yeah but what is you think like when does that happen super rare but if it did happen why your phone was in the car and somebody needed you you'd feel terrible right but you gotta just what is the what's the balance it's like it's so slippery we didn't have any way to get in touch with back in the day you had to yell for help number that yeah you can't yell huh yeah not in Los Angeles there's too many people you yell for help nobody's in some languages helped me in something else I think it's you know something not good or something Arabic or something people will fuck you up just make that up I'm not sure honestly I think I might have heard that because I live in Westwood and we have it's very diverse over there's a lot of people sometimes yell and stuff in the street do you think for real do you think help mean something bad in other languages is that real somebody told me hello means go to hell in like Greek or Latin like um like politics means like political like up like um something like not good like something tick like a tick like blood-sucking oh really government or something like that let's start with one let's start with should we do with hello first yeah I think cuz and I just say things and I don't even know sometimes think if somebody just told me to say hello when I was young and I've been saying in my whole life but what does help mean is help mean anything in another language is help a bad word in other languages okay I'm looking up if the word help means something in another language not right there word help you got if the word help mean something in another language that I think you mean you're gonna have to rewarded it you're gonna have to word it uniquely I think cuz it's a that's a hard one that's a that's a that's yeah I don't even know anymore now be its translation that might may be an Arabic or something like that have any sort of alternate meanings and other languages yeah I'm not accusing anybody the Arab nations or whatever Asians or whatever you know Arabic and Hebrew like those old old languages have the coolest letters yeah way they write things like you look at some old Hindu script or something like that why is that looks so cool it seemed like a mystery yeah man anytime like even Russian when you see Russian written out you're like whoa look at the crazy little letters they have like look at that like this is like some alien writing yeah I'd be furious I'm Dalek I couldn't I couldn't imagine having to learn some of the other languages you know like I'm going to China next week when we want to Shanghai and I'm like it's basically just me looking around at different drawings you know like as far as even though words go it's gonna be I think they have a lot of stuff in English there oh yeah yeah are there a lot of a lot of countries where there's a lot of tourism they just put stuff in English English seems to be a language that most European countries like most people know you could you can kind of get by in Italy you can kind of get by in Germany they just speak English it's uh it's it's real interesting man because it's because I guess there's so much tourism and I guess what everyone's worried about us because we have the nuclear bombs everybody learned English and we traveled a lot because we have more money here probably so we have the ability to go places maybe hmm do you like English that's the only language I know yeah yeah I like it but it's just weird how much cooler other languages look when they're written out I guess it's just because what we're accustomed to like Thai you look at Thai writing or like yeah I was sweating I tried to read some one time and Thai I was sweating by the end of it how crazy is that that's crazy food yeah like it's just like it took me out of my element man there's a couple of uh a couple of words off I you know I almost needed help Asian characters look like if you had a movie like a science fiction movie and in the movie they found a crashed UFO and I had some writing on the i-beams or something like that hmm would look like a lot of Asian writing right it would look like something something crazy from Asia that like you like what am I looking at right like a lease you saying it might as well be alien writing if you don't know it yeah if there were alien writing you think it's gonna look more like something from Asian writing than it is from American writing well be weird if it was like comic book font yeah like that or whatever it's like wait a minute aliens speak English yeah bro everybody does what if aliens were like a Boeing Shuttle man that's the biggest mind fuck that I ever heard was that because the size of infinity mm-hmm not only is there another Theo von out there in the world but there because infinity is so big I'm gonna butcher this for sure yeah we talked about this a little bit last one was in I did we the only thing you've ever done someone has done the exact same things in the exact same order down to the last millisecond do you believe do you okay so that's something that you'd think or that's something you think that could be really true I think it could be really true but honestly my brain is not really strong enough to compute that so I would have to take many many many hours really thinking about what that means because right now when I'm saying even when I'm saying them I it's one of those whoa dude things like I'm saying it but I'm not really thinking it through yeah like how much how how much you really thinking through yeah just a couple steps you don't really think okay that there's a so then that means for you there's another there's another man out there who did comedy at last hand at the Comedy Store who wore did the exact same set tripped over the exact same words spilt his water the same way every it's supposed to be everything and not not only that because infinity so big they're supposed to be an infinite number of those people out there yeah I don't want that I don't man cuz that would hurt my feelings honestly it would make me feel I think it wakes heads I think it makes sense I think the universe is so big right I mean everything's so big just what we know about our solar system so big it's so big that alone is crazy the idea that there's no end of the crazy we're like no no it's got to be an end no no no no but no no that's too crazy yeah like what's too crazy when it comes to the universe the universe is crazy there's nothing about it that makes any fuckin sense I mean it's so crazy that we don't like to think about it last night I was watching the fireworks and the fireworks were going off and I was thinking yeah this is kind of cool you know what's cooler the fucking billions of flying explosions that are above our heads yeah the free fireworks that are constantly in the sky it's like we just will get together for like some something made in Honduras each other but the fact that they're like shooting stars every night yeah and we like because of street lights we don't see the craziest light show ever which is the Milky Way yeah you know when you drive make that drive like out to Vegas or you know into you drive it through Montana at night or something like that you pull over mm-hmm what is that is that fireworks from last night Wow that's last night is from the NBC for helicopter that's crazy Pasadena to downtown that's awesome those are illegal at least half of them are illegal right I would say most of them are illegal it looks like a lot of like kind of Civil War artwork it's also sped up dude for a firefighter that has got to be a crazy time but some of them get off I think on fires like some of my think they want a little bit of fire you don't think yes well it's been proven that some people that are mentally ill that become firemen we start fires something you know it's not it's not 99.999% of them or one of the numbers but occasionally in every line of work you get someone who's crazy yeah and I could see that dude you want something going and you don't have a lot of money or anything like that it's also just that one of their crazy yeah you know they're just some people there's something wrong right there's there's connections that aren't being made in there and they're not they they're capable of doing things just to deceive people rip people off or they're capable of doing things for their own personal gain like lighting a building on fire just so they could put it out right there's some people that are just broken like there's something about them that's just not connected right yeah we should shut them down man I think I think in the future we have to have some better programs to find out who's just not even care about people yeah yeah there's people that yeah that's a really good pair about people who doesn't care about people because if you don't care about people then it's just not then you shouldn't be here you should be somewhere else you should be in a place where they don't have any people you know yeah it's just a dangerous thing to have around for the most part it's fine right because life is fairly easy in civilized times right most of stuff is fine most of this stuff yeah without you know the caveat for the occasional chaos but it's just fucking it's hard to tell how crazy people are until something really happens and I mean you really need to count on them and when they you know and you're pinned underneath a dresser and they look at you and they just run out of the room and just take off and like you're not even gonna help me there's people like that do you think some of those people didn't even know there that they would do that until the situation arises then that sometimes well I would love to have some and I know this sounds a little dark but like to have some serious stressors in our world to find out even who I really am you know like to see who rises to like who you are inside yeah right like what rises to the core of my skin and says this is who I am you know like I got trapped in an elevator once do with like seven or eight people okay and this sounds like a small idea but this was like three hours right and suddenly like a first one dudes kind of verbose he's suddenly like I'm the leader but like an hour later he's like trying to fuck a couple chicks that are also in the elevator and you start to see like okay he was trying to fuck them like it was hitting on them or he's trying to actually get down in the elevator no he wasn't kind of fucking over he was maybe gonna fuck him later if they got out of the elevator safely not like a raper like a guy who's like gonna date him or like take him to dinner and then hopefully have sex with him at some point if they want to as well but he being on saying yeah consensual sex yeah yeah there you go but he but you started to see who was who like one guy was like just literally wouldn't listen anyone tried to rip the doors open for two hours hit like just like just like gave up on that like one lady was really scared like immediately it started to kind of fold out who was gonna be who you know I wouldn't know what to do I don't know if you're see I don't think you're supposed to climb out though that seems like death right like to climb out into that shaft you're supposed to stay yeah I know you're supposed to yeah I mean they must have some sort of regular but you know of an elevator fell in one of the UFC hotels like real far and fucked up CB Dollaway one of the UFC fighters his back is fucked up from that apparently apparently he's suing and I don't think he fought that day I think they had to cancel his fight I think I might be wrong about that but I know his back was like significantly fucked up from that fall elevators make it too easy man I miss the old day sometimes when you just he scratched from the fight yeah and he's fought since but I think he's still having problems with his back yeah yeah it's hard to fix to a back it's one of the hardest one of the hardest things to make better again it seems like every time people get surgery it's just a slippery slope it's very rare that someone gets surgery on their back and they go oh my back's great now everything's fine it's always like yeah I got to go in again I got another disc like oh no and state they're literally getting their back fused from top to bottom and they're back that are still fighters too yup no way Tito has several fused in his neck he has artificial spacers from where the discs used to be yeah he has in his back his multiple operations on his back do you think that that like because some people think like you know a lot of your Chi and you're like line up is you know like your do you think that that could alter knee of it yeah I don't know I don't know if that's real I don't know what is that is it is it the actual disc gelatin or is the the spine itself the spinal column where all the all the nerves are firing all the way up to the brainstem yeah this really fucking crazy thing to risk if you think that about that like the connection between your brain and then that cord that goes to all your body and everything moving and it's all just this back area that very few people ever even exercise yeah which is so crazy everybody's doing all this shit to get your biceps look and fly and pump your tits up and very few people are concentrating on like lower back exercises reversing Pipers protecting your spine putting muscle all around that bitch work that core do like kettlebell windmills you ever do kettlebell windmills no I do do that shit they're so good kettlebell windmills you like you press the kettle button you go down and touch your touch the ground by your foot and then straighten Wow for your spine like all the muscles around your back that stabilize everything and your obliques and your abs and all your core yeah it's a great exercise I got to do more like adult fitness man I got a G that's what it looks like damn look at all that shit that's a human spine Oh like I'm gonna eat this in China next week anyway you can have dick over there somebody said they can you gonna have human a human and dick Carroll what do you month said that and he's eaten a lot of all he's eaten every where is he Andrew Zimmerman honored food guy yeah the podcast yeah he's a chef travels all over the world really cool guy welcome this is that pictures fuckin bizarre man to think that that's all the stuff that's firing your nerves that's crazy and what is that what does it even look like it almost looks like a jellyfish or like a it looks like it's reaching for something doesn't it yeah it's shooting off into the cosmos son thing at the top is making nuclear bombs at the top is making 4G cellphones and 40 megapixel front-facing cameras I think it's making that thing is making time machines yeah that fucking thing is making satellite transmission of video signals and simultaneously delivered to televisions worldwide that's what that thing's making dude you got things making Tesla's Rory's making pistols and steroids that thing's making oxycontin that fucking thing's making everything that's what's tough about the human brain areas that we yeah things making whiskey that thing's making crystal meth and crank things making nail-polish and fake tits that thing is off the job if you look at if you look to the human brain for like all this shit is responsible for you like what that area oh my god and it looks like something you would think maybe wouldn't even do nothing if you walk by that on the street you didn't know as a brain you'd be like ah man that's one of the my favorite out here is Mars Attacks where they have their exposed brain I can't remember that you don't remember Mars Attacks I never seen anything never saw Mars Attacks from watch although this is one of the greatest movies of all time it's Tim Burton right is that who I believe is why it's amazing it's so good dude Jack Nicholson is in it and he please place two obviously different people oh really but it's obviously the same guy playing two people and it's never brought up no it's a great movie man I mean it is a great great movie it looks bad dude it's so good it's really it seems like it looks back if you're watching here but it's all on purpose yeah it's all on purpose it's like when the when this it's what it is is they somehow or another captured how we feel about this time period they captured it with this weird like Vegas thing with this is the president back then and when these aliens come off this spaceship it's there something about the way they move that makes you think like you're watching a movie from the 50 but still really good like just good enough but what he did by making the effects weird and barely real as he almost gave you a nostalgia for like 1960s 1970s movie I can see that a little bit right here yeah but but it's better right it's way better than anything they were capable of I mean look at the fucking the shadows on the head and everything like that watch a little bit of this real quick this is when they first land yeah [Applause] they came in peace [Music] [Applause] on Mars [Music] that's cool do you think you'd eat something from Mars if they had like if they had it say this because I know you'd like to be a wild eater I've seen some of the stuff you eat you know you'd be kind of rare you know you you know you know you're not afraid to eat the rare and would you have say this they catch a Mars donkey or something you know and they're just they're serving enough you don't even know what's in it bro alright the ultimate Eyes Wide Shut party serving up a donkey from Mars how many pounds of that thing I would need it no chance first of all people first of all people gonna be definitely mad at you you think people are mad at you for eating animals on earth yeah imagine eating animals from space only one it would be so fucking mad at you second of all I would want I would not want to be an early adopter of Mars meat really I want to sit back look these people that are convinced that meat I don't agree with them but there's people that are convinced that meat is bad for you that meat itself is bad for you yeah because a lot of people that eat meat wind up with a bunch of heart disease the problem is that they're not really measuring just the meat they're just measuring people that eat meat what else do you eat oh you eat a lot of sugar you have a lot of bread you have a lot of pasta you eat a lot of this and a lot you drink oh nice yeah you might have you might smoke cigarettes yeah so it's hard to tell and I think different things are also different for different people but people can't even agree on whether or not it's healthy to eat meat there's some people that disagree on it right but wouldn't you want to wait to see what Mars me but wouldn't you want a fucking wild one oh sit back have you like dude I'm good with bison you can eat those Mars donkeys all day long I'm gonna see what a 20 year profile of fucking donkeys from Mars eaters looks like Levin Stardust steak or something out of Mars they only have one bounce in that one donkey yeah but it could be so like some prions getting your system you got mad cow disease likewise you could also what if you adopt a superpower by eating it that's good true that's one thing that nobody ever brings up with like nuclear energy like all this all these like nuclear disasters everybody's terrified of mutations and radioactive waves and all the shit that's gonna fuck us up nobody remembers comic books where every single time somebody got hit with some radioactive shit they became a superhero to be around that's never happened here I wonder if I could handle the dude if I had a superpower I just feel like I would tell everyone I wouldn't be able to keep it a secret hmm some secret powers you're allowed to just tell everybody some dudes they just tell everybody right like who doesn't have to keep it a secret obviously the thing he can't keep it a secret what is that at the big x-men they're like had to go yeah but they had high but the thing doesn't hide the thing is just that's what he's covered in rocks you know oh yeah oh yeah I know yeah but the fists yeah giant clobber time who else um doesn't have to hide anything you can't hide anything bruising Bannister who was banner Bruce Banner Bruce Banner do you know when they sure as a carpenter no no do you know that when they did the incredible health TV show they changed his name from Bruce to David because people thought Bruce was gay uh really yep was a lot of Bruce's gay then dude that's always been the stereotypical name oh wait what kind of comedian would do a hack joke about a gay guy they'd be like Bruce yeah Randy Randy Oh Randy really I would never heard Randy but Bruce it's always been Bruce is the name that they would use so apparently people in then you know what it was the 70s when the Hulk TV show was around with Lou Ferrigno oh yeah yeah they just decided like hey let's let's change this name change it make it David David Banner and we also comic-book dorks like me were like what how dare you how dare you change his name that was the best show ever because it made it feel like me if you were ugly you could still be cool and do neat stuff I felt like well it was the Revenge of people who were bullied and picked on there's the idea that you you could be this nerdy guy and you get picked on by these assholes and you just fucking Hulk out and become bulletproof yeah I met him at the post office one time no Ferrigno I met him he's a real nice guy yeah he seemed nice he was with a lady friend and it might have been his wife I think he's still yoked his fuck he's jacked like you know um he looked really good like he looks healthy too it's crazy yeah I mean the dude's got to be deep into his 60s but he looks very healthy he might I wonder who I wonder if you were gonna start living for like a really long look at him there that dude looks healthy as fuck now he dare he looks a little bit more more reasonable yeah I mean look he was a gigantic super-sized human at one point in time you know money that's what he used to look like so big so when you saw him on the Hulk the problem was he couldn't really be that defined for long periods of time and film a television show because it was too unhealthy oh it's super unhealthy when those guys are like right about to pose down when they're about to they're on death's door they're really unhealthy they get light head look at that dude oldest fuck who's sad old and jacked yeah Willie Nelson looks like a 75 year old jack man see they have those you eat that bro say that guy gets shot and killed it depends how far I am from civilization okay let's say you're far man yeah I need them yeah I need him if it was but whether or not eating him or not surviving getting home to my family or something like that okay say this thing I'm gonna put you under a little bit of um some if you don't mind is that okay okay so a ship went down a shuttle an airship or something a plane and you know like that movie alive right you're out there do you are you the chef you know you're gonna eat it you know you're gonna eat well it's whether or not the bodies like the people are killed already the real problem is that people start killing people and eating people then you got a real problem okay people are already killed people are already dead it's to senior citizens that's it it was a small plane well you got to decide people can live without food for several weeks especially if you're the average American you got a lot of fat in your body after a day or so your body kicks into fat-burning ketosis mode but you're gonna be hungry yeah you're gonna be hungry but you will be less hungry believe it or not after the first day once your body kicks into fat burning like have you ever been on a fat burning diet I've just on paleo for a month little different paleo you're still eating a lot of carbohydrates just cutting out all the grains and things like that yeah when you go on a fat burning diet one of the first things that happens is your appetite just changes radically it's really weird like you just stop being hungry the same way like hunger isn't a desperation thing like when I know when I'm not ketogenic because then my hunger gets desperate like I have to eat something like I feel like ooh I never feel like that with keto it's like I'm hungry but I'm okay right it's like and through the day like energy levels are much more stabilized that's what I felt like on paleo I've never done anything like that I mean I lost like 11 pounds with someone think I was supposed to lose like I don't really have like a plan or anything but next thing you know like I felt I never felt like I had to eat I felt like I needed to eat to get to the next few moments of my life but I didn't feel like okay I got to make a big deal about eating it felt more like a survival technique mmm like eating all day and then my mind I felt I did he feel more energy I never felt like that after eating I always felt like okay I could eat and then still go do something I could go you know play cards or run around or you know chase a friend or do anything you know hang out yeah um so who's you know you would have to you don't have to first of all talk to everybody about know cuz you got like I said you got two weeks right you got two weeks for your body could just go on fat eating itself started the your body starts eating itself okay you got to talk to people and say listen this person is dead okay this is just meat now that can keep us alive and we can survive and we could see our family and our friends or we cannot eat this person and would take a chance on going hungry and we might get too weak to get out of here like you have to think like what if what if you can get saved but you have to be able to hike out 30 miles in the mountain okay so you're really planning ahead then a lot of you have to you have to you you're you're either gonna die or you're gonna live okay these are the only two things that could possibly happen that in that even matter that point so you got to figure out is it even possible that you can live is it possible yeah you might be might not be you might be in the mountains in the winter with nothing around you to eat no way for you to get off the mountain because it's too dangerous because you get cliffed out every time you try to go down and then you try to get back up and you can't get back up and you're stuck you could fall and die it happens to people all the time so it's it might not be that you can make it but if you are gonna make it out you're gonna want to have some energy and different people have different fitness levels obviously so some people like they're not even gonna be capable of hiking out what if you take a lunch I mean you don't have to eat the whole person right then like you guys could yeah you would eat them in parts for sure what would you have it's a psychologically devastating the thought of just eating human meat it's psychologically devastating you you're crossing a threshold that you know you're in you're in - it's a dark arts I mean it's everything is everything it's sad it's it's crazy and it's also a rich part of you know human adventure history there was always like you run into cannibals you know it was like a big part of those crazy movies about oh yeah is it in the jungle they got eaten by cannibals even Brady Bunch remember they came across some people I think they were cannibals or they went in like ever cross cannibal haha but like all even cartoons all of them did it was cannibals or like da Joe versus the volcano remember that and I don't remember that I think he came across cannibals well there was an Hannibal's in history a lot of cannibals I didn't know that there was so much cannibalism amongst Native Americans like Native Americans would cannibalize settlers some of them like the Nez Perce Indians Steve Rinella was telling me about that they would cut dudes up and eat them like whoa that's that's crazy imagine yeah if somebody goes down and ulis and there's a part you already know you like you're like oh I'm cutting this dude understand I'm having a little bit of fucking ligament right here on this hillside man a guy killed by a polar bear yesterday in front of his kids in Canada he was protecting his kids from the polar bear and he died 31 year old dude you know what that's a hero though I mean these kids will think of him as a hero I bet he lives in that same place where those people live on that life below zero I think it's called Nunavut if people know that's where he lives he lives I mean he lives in a really really remote area that has polar bears mmm polar bears have the most dangerous bear you could ever run into because they're the only animal that all of them actively hunt people really Nunavut that's the place where it was yeah they hunt everything everything that moves they all don't have any vegetables up there so they don't they're the only a hundred percent carnivorous bear all they eat is me all the eight is meet every other bear is like eating berries and bears no ignore you if they forget a whole field for a berries well I don't want to chase you asshole and chew your bones and all that bullshit I'm just gonna eat berries what are the lazy bears there's some very laid on his back they love berries much you find like giant fields of blueberries you'll find bears just snacking away having a great time eating blueberries they'll do it all day not polar bears polar bears eat your asshole kill you they kill everything man oh I would hate that dude I would hey if someone's trying to eat me man I would just be so upset I think yeah did you see that lady that got in trouble cuz she shot a giraffe she shot I did see yeah she shot a rare giraffe and so everybody's freaking out on her it seems sad man that giraffe seemed like it probably what was he gonna do to her it's not gonna do anything to her for sure it's it is rare for an animal to get that old it's 18 years old it's real dark yeah it had dark skin or something a little yeah the old males they get dark this is super cool one thing though that people need to know see all these things are complicated they're not as simple as everybody wants to think they are and this is one of the things that's complicated about this store is that that giraffe is killing little giraffes it's a normal thing the old bulls like that one which is a big massive 18 year old animal okay it's a huge huge animal he just was not having it with these young ones coming up not having it what do you think it is jealousy or anger it's just nature you know they kill off the younger males oh yeah like pissed at the neighbor kids kind of thing don't they just don't want anybody taking their spot they don't know that they're riding off from the sunset like he's not a viable breeding male anymore huge so at 18 years of age he had killed off three young bulls so they were gonna have to kill him right because it's not good you need the Bulls to keep the thing alive what was well not just that he this is a species of giraffe that already has a population problem there's not a lot of them and if he's killing off these young Bulls each one of those young bulls could have fathered countless children yeah so they're missing all these future children for one bull who can't even breathe anymore and he's gonna continue to do it he was seeking out the young bulls he already killed three like this is not a cut and dry thing I don't think it looks cool to pose with a rifle and a giraffe and I mean there's something about giraffes that are so gentle that they let kids feed them when you go to the fucking zoo right I don't so I get why people would be upset but when you find out what it actually is you go oh this is not it's this is more complicated than I'm that I'm seeing on the surface it's not simply a cruel person shot at giraffe and we should be angry too right it's like no they had to shoot that giraffe because it was killing other giraffes so is it appropriate the way she celebrated it that's when you have to wonder yeah but they were eating it I mean that's the other thing it's like they got fucking eight hundred pounds of meat or something like that out of that Wow it's a huge animal I think it was more than that didn't they say 2,000 pounds of meat I think it's a 4000 pound animal and they got 2,000 pounds of meat which they give to all the villages all the people there and I know people are like wait I don't give a fuck you shouldn't shoot a giraffe I feel the same way because when I see a giraffe I don't think of it as something I want to shoot and eat yeah I think of it as something a little kid can feed at the fucking zoo because they're so gentle they're so gentle that they like people feed them oh yeah they had a thing by our home when I was growing up they had a thing do that a couple giraffes out there a couple of lambs and shit yeah get out there and buy a little cup of corn and go out there and you don't even have to know it like you know it's a sign a wave you have to do anything you even have to fucking be able to read very well and you can fucking feed a giraffe you know point-blank it's the only animal that is a wild African animal that we let kids feed yeah at the fucking zoo little kids can feed them yeah I can't believe that that is that much I mean when I hear that for one the lady would did she why did she have to put that picture out what was in it for her to do that she even knew like she's a hunter and she was excited that she got to kill a big giraffe you know and the you know it gets it's it gets strange when you just tail a bunch of things and make stuff trophies and you put them in your trophy room and you go well I want to get it now I want to get a ram okay I got a ram now I want to get a mountain goat okay and you got like this menagerie inside of your yeah that's it gets dark man now I want to get a mouse now I want to get a stepdad now I want to get a second but then I it's like okay but if you're eating all of those things and this is how you get your meat yeah is that okay well yeah it's okay but there's something we did something we all have a strange feeling about this the idea is that people are killing these things and they're getting some kind of pleasure out of it and they're not doing it just to eat it right it's so like even if you you are gonna eat it we don't want you to be really happy when you kill something that's it - that's some of it I think the villagers should have be able the ones that should vote on if it was okay or not it's in their village they would vote okay every time because they get money from it then to me then that seems okay because a lot of times it's like we're judging things from so far away we won't even know we even know what it's like we're talking about completely different dynamics in terms of like the way their culture works first of all the money for these big hunts that these people pay to shoot all these different things down there that's a shitload of money and that shitload of money for that area for that part of the world is gigantic fuels conservation efforts it pays for these people that are essentially their version of game wardens you know and then they have these different people that are employed by these hunting companies and then there's resources to stop poaching and then resources to actively participate in controlling habitat and making sure these animals are in healthy populations and bringing their numbers up this is all done through the money that comes from hunting so soup it's super fucked up right it's it's weird because it doesn't make sense it's like the people that are paying to keep these animal lives or also the ones that want to shoot up people what the it's we would like it to be all the conservation money comes from people who just love animals and want to keep them alive but that's not the case that's not the case no the money comes almost I mean it's not exclusively because there are a lot of conservation groups that do donate for wildlife protection and for preserving of animal habitats there are there's there's definitely some people that donate right but there's no it's not even close to the amount of money that's raised from hunting tag and especially hunting you're on that local level like you're you know like some of these like these programs I'm sure there are a little bit more bigger more blanket you know but you get into that local level fifty thousand dollars can keep you know a small town or a small habitat around for the year ya know who's getting all that money but you're right it's but it makes us uncomfortable but rightly so I mean you're looking at a giraffe you want giraffes to stay alive you say like that's amazing but we have to know that the facts behind it in this particular case were they that giraffe had to go yeah that giraffe was killing giraffes you ever see him fight it's the most oh yeah thing they just headbutt each other they swing their head like a like a mace smash into each other it's what a terrible way to fight it's fucking crazy just suck at fighting oesophagus yeah fucking yeah it's like crystal it's almost like Chris D'Elia maybe were in a fight you loved his esophagus I love Chris D'Elia very prominent target if you wanted to hit something have you seen how he had this funny thing of this Jaguar challenge he's so surprisingly silly sometimes you don't really like he is he's so funny and he's and uh he's so fucking funny yeah very good dude and very funny very silly he's got his own kind of con kind of funny yeah and he lives yeah and he's so confident and living in that space man it's kind of um yeah it's been it's interesting it kind of gets slowly get to know that guy well that's what you know it is with you too it's like you're kind of you you do you're kind of funny and that's a that's an interesting thing like when fines they're like we're talking about Mitch Hedberg the other day like he had his kind of funny yeah like you could see like you could hear Mitch Hedberg Joe can you go oh that's a that's a Hedberg joke that's how he does his kind of funny yeah yeah it's so funny well thanks for saying that man appreciate that yeah I think it's like as I've gotten a little bit older it's made me feel more comfortable to just be myself you know you're so long out here I just felt if I was just afraid to be myself artists Amy knew who I was you know it's all those things man you know it's hard trying to be trying to be confident in what you're doing is a confidence destroying way to make a living yeah you know yeah and I get intimidated easy like I this is the first time I've actually felt kind of a little bit more comfortable being in here really yeah in here yeah like I don't know it's not you it's just something with me you know it's just something I don't know I don't know if it's like if I feel like if there's like men that are more like kind of physically you know in shape or so just some things maybe inside of me somewhere that make me feel just on you know I don't know what it is it's well people worry about being bullied for sure people develop like I I feel it sometimes I'm around big people really owners to me I was thinking about that you like hang out around like some real rare young awesome around some real rare animal humans you know yes super humans that Daniel Cormier dude that superhuman that big coffee John Jones superhuman yeah Mighty Mouse Amy's a small superhuman George st. Pierre superhuman have you ever been like an elevator with him or something a bunch of those dudes this guy could fucking kill me oh they can kill you anytime they want you have to deal with that feeling it's not the best well you're talking to Francis in Ghana that's always and your might no matter what you guys are talking about there's a part of you that says if you wanted to you could just kill me like that do you get scared fast sometimes honestly like I get scared for you whenever you have to go in the ring after the fights do you ever get scared a little bit dude the first time I ever even interviewed anybody ever after a fight I had to interview mark coleman after he choked out dance ever walk and this was in like UFC fucking 12 so that was 1997 and Mark Coleman was so fired up max he just won the heavyweight title fucking jacked he was so jacked and he was fucking pumped up and we have no idea bears in that movie doesn't even he was the king of the world back then marked the hammer Coleman changed the fucking game look at because she was like a real world-class wrestler taking dudes down and just smashing them and he was fucking huge huge you know and so I the interview first have no idea who I was fuck is this guy but I have to respectfully write him an opportunity to express himself and then it worked out but I prepared for that man I was nervous Wow oh I was nervous that's interesting yeah cuz it's to me I'm like holy shit this guy you know this man is going into the cage after lunch yep you know that's what he does how do I want you that's it I felt like me but like when you go like you know I'm not a you know these you know these guys are very some of these men are very physically imposing to me like in that you know they're so when you sometimes I'm like man I can't believe that you go in there it's just bravest well now one thing that I think they all know and if they don't know I want them to know that I I don't want anything other than them to shine right that's all I'm trying to do like when I interview people what I'm trying to do is give them an opportunity to talk about moments I just want to give them a chance to shine and show who they are I want them to feel comfortable I look out for their best interests I really do I try to do that with commentary even if it sounds critical my critical commentary is just expose like I look at it in terms of I'm looking at it like it's a math problem or a system and if I see things I'm like this is this is an issue even if the person can win with this issue this is a real issue like a high-level person's gonna exploit that issue maybe this guy can't do it but this sometimes people get upset at that that does happen but I say listen I have tics bows and I may be thinking I exaggerate but believe me those fucking high class killers that see the same shit that I see they're gonna try to exaggerate that shit too that you're gonna try to jump on that little hole yeah there's a little hole somewhere and that happens all the time with people to get mad if you point out their holes yeah it doesn't mean they can't win these guys who've gotten their entire career they rarely throw a kick they never submit anybody and there's some of the best of all time yeah do you don't have to have a fully complete game sometimes it's better to just be ultra good at one or two things and those other things just don't fuck with submissions you know just don't fuck with any of those there's there's people that are like that they take someone's back they never choke them they just keep punching them they never choke anybody there's a lot of people like that and then the raccoons almost raccoons do that you read a record on you never had a raccoon on me of you oh yeah they bite you dude if you ever had one bite you uh if I have one I've had maybe bite I mean I got scratched or bitten I mean I had to get all the rabies shots I mean I grew up in like the rabies Belt you know so you'd you'd uh and they group up raccoons to do rec under they are I can't believe we can't shut all that shit down how many of them are roaming the streets that know a lot how crazy is it you stare you down bro you ever seen Madagascar and they're fucking they're everywhere did I lived in I lived in New Rochelle New York and they used to have these urban raccoon oh yeah different kind of raccoon raccoons that live in high-density areas or Boulder species and they have access to massive amounts of food they just would lift off the lid from the garbage can they lift off the lid they get inside the garbage can they tear the garbage bags open and they just be sitting there staring at ya jus lookin jacked look at gold like they were big I was like how is that a raccoon that's a big animal yeah it's about a blowgun we shoot darts good I did these motherfuckers would wreck my garbage and you like shit over and I'd be sleeping and I dang look at him climbing up do we have one is he what is he doing he's going to get that bird feeder and unscrew the bird fees bill oh my God look how smart it is dude this is insane oh no smart this thing is but also look how confident it is in its strength and look at him and over the Camry knows he's being filmed and look how he's yeah I don't think I knows that but look look how how good he is it climbing up I mean this is crazy the amount of physical strength is fucker has look at this look at that they let all that seed go and now it's hanging and partying that raising and they fuck too - you can hear them at night we used to live we used to hear a bunch of them having sex at night and you could hear you can go outside and even in a residential neighborhood dude there's 70 of them on your block like there's so many raccoons living amongst us that it's it blows my mind that it's not a bigger issue pull that up again look with that video dude how many people even if they could do that if they had the kind of strength to do that how many people would even figure out how to navigate that so easily dude Matt Iseman would host this this is like American Ninja Warrior dude you telling me that they don't steal some of these games from this this is fucker look at him how can we stop going fullscreen because they were flirting over I don't know okay when it goes full screen starts oh I don't know what the hell is happening look at this and is that a fake shiner person or something look at his fucking ability to just hang on there with one arm and then grab with his feet that is bananas what is that called in UFC is that a move no it doesn't exist I guess maybe jumped a guard yeah I kind of jump in two guards look at that it's amazing like what he can do his little body is just crazy yeah how much core strength is a raccoon have to have to do that oh dude so much in the garbage it's just freezing out I have paused on perfect they can eat newspaper how crazy is that can they yeah keep going this look at this but look how comfortable he is just hanging from its fingers with all four limbs he's just chilling he's not worried that something's gonna happen he's like let me just scoop my ass up here climb-climb-climb I'm just gonna twist this fucker off here look at him he's hanging on with his legs and he just cracked it open yeah I don't look at this reverse look at the sucks I'm gonna buy him at the end but the crazy thing is he could hold on to that plastic tube with his hands and feet like two of each the two of his hands or two of his feet both their hands look at the size of their body yeah their hands this big are tiny can you imagine having a little bitty baby hand and having to do something I know right look how much smaller the hand is in their face you'd have hands like a four-year-old girl imagine opening a door but you can't even open a door you just have to stare at a doorknob with little but I'm talking the littlest hands yeah tiny they'll fuck you up to those things yeah raccoons eat a lot of chickens too they like to get into chicken coops fuck up chickens dude they would jump on your back it was almost here's the crazy thing I remember about being around raccoons it felt like they were playing with you but it had an immediate propensity for violence like it could go like very quick from fun and comfortable to extremely violent mmm that makes sense I mean what a rough-and-tumble world the world of the vacuum motherfucker oh you live it right look at door look at this one okay right no I think this is it close the door here and it opens it again my grandmother had a friend that had a couple so he just knows how to open doors creepy fuck there's something weird about them mm-hmm it's a strange animal that like almost seems like it shouldn't be real you know like a smart weird animal that lives in the forest like you expect it to start talking to a little kid that's on a walk yeah like who are you where are you from and it's yeah yeah it's got dice in its little hand one dice just turns it over listen your grandmother won't mind if you hang out with me for a while yeah come come on I'll show you a house is made of candy yeah you want some lipstick they're putting lipstick on each other creepy animals that's weird to me the the weirder animals the animals that have adapted to living right next to people that's them there yeah coyotes that's coyotes that's them will you tell me about a coyote you had at your house I've got a bunch of them at my house they're just in the you know in the hills if you live anywhere around la in particular anywhere that there's some trees and shit in between the houses guess what you got coyotes they just fucking live everywhere man I saw him on olive in Burbank the other day driving up olive I saw a fucking coyote so I was like whoa somebody reported a coyote fight in my neighborhood when I was growing up and it was a somebody made that up but the cops still showed up and I remember they interviewed everybody like fucking knew anything about it dude do you think coyotes fight wonder if they do fight with each other I don't think never heard of them fighting it must make sense someone has to be the boss in the coyote world wolves do wolves fuck each other up do they really yeah it's awful they kill each other so these a coyote fights here most intense coyote fight oh look at this they're going to war right here there's a worldstar I think is this worldstar yes we need to Rob back right there look at that another one jumped in three coyotes strategically held by a bush do you fuck their fucking each other up dude do you think we could ever get to the point where you know that humans fight animals like they did back in the old days you know like gladiator style yeah seriously though yeah you could do that in another country for sure yeah somebody from some crazy country where they had some maniacal dicker dictator who's on crystal meth and he decided to have humans vs. Lions give it to a sword and a shield and some armor and him fuck up a lion 100% do you think that goes on um I wouldn't say no yeah because I think there's people with enough money like fucking crazy crazy Prince money yeah if there are prints of some crazy country as people just probably can't get satisfied it's not they can't get yeah cocaine pussy pussy mud hole Jets Oh Islands in France like what else do I want what else I want I want to watch a dude fight a lion with a sword yeah this is probably like some place that you can go right and it's got like drains in the floor where they hose it down from all the blood and it's like built like a hockey rink yeah but the floor underneath the floor there's a zoo just like they have these two do it in the Roman days and it rises up they let the animal out yeah close it down and then they open the cage and the fucking dude stands there with the sword and the crowd goes yeah and they're all listening to techno music could speak in Dutch and then that uh well suddenly we know where they are that dude in that fucking lion go to war they go at it man yeah you'd think he has like face paint on or anything or he's just mmm it's probably a good move pull a face paint on you need every edge yeah you know you gotta fight a line with a sword you're probably gonna get killed you're gonna cut the line and then get killed that's what you're gonna do give one good hit at it if you're lucky probably won't even really yeah yes sword man yeah you you don't have any idea how slow you are until you're around a cat that kills antelopes and shit chases after wildebeest takes him out with his face it's gonna that child you you have no idea I think everybody no I don't think you get a shot off I think with the cat wants to the cats on you so fast you barely have time to move your arm that's what I think I don't think yeah yeah I don't think you have any idea how fast a like a real predator moves how ridiculously soft human beings are right especially if you're not some I don't fucking Conan the Barbarian dude you can actually swing a sword a heavy sword with with some fucking oomph behind it yeah you ever pick up a real sword it's heavy shit man it's fucking heavy and it's sharp it's almost scary to have one sometimes you're like fuck I would hurt myself right cut my cousin up or something on accident or I'd hurt somebody at the house yeah the odds of you killing that lion with one swipe or almost zero you're gonna get fucked up okay how would you attack it then say you're in a place you got this sword maybe you got one other weapon a small weapon you keep on your leg or something the only way that I think you have a chance is if you can keep your shit together and plunge that blade in its chest as it leaps on you it's the only way you would have to be ready to as it comes at you to push forward and hold on to that sword with everything you have as it's coming at you and the blade goes into its body yeah that might be the only way and even then it's gonna swat you and rip you apart you hold on the line not gonna be able to it's not possible I think you could do it dude nope nope you don't think you could no no and you would keep both hands on now that's how you acted it out you keep both hands on it you are not gonna be able to hang on you're just not it's a different kind of power it's like the power of many many men it's like the idea of hey bro do you think you can win a fucking tug of war with ten dudes yeah oh yeah bro most guys are bitches yeah you had a chance there's there's a strength level you'd have to be like some Herculean Mariusz Pudzianowski type dude so I'm just an enormous fucking World's Strongest Man guy with chalk all over your hands and a good grip on the blade and maybe tie it down like a rodeo rider and plunge it into the heart of a lion and even then I don't think you're hanging on to it I think that thing's gonna buck and kick and and you're gonna be so terrified and if it's a male lion you get to see that Mane in that face and your your body are you you're gonna get diminished yeah you're gonna be so overwhelmed with adrenaline your instincts gonna be to just run away from that thing as far as you can you feel like some truths as you like any truths like any innate truths would be revealed as you're as you're sitting here looking to each other's eyes and you know that it's gonna kill you I don't think you're even there at that point I think if you're I think you're it's such a primal experience that I think at that point you are probably the you're barely a human you're just a series of synapses firing that are designed to protect you from predators I think you're just in full panic full adrenaline rush full survival mode where you don't you don't know what the fuck is going on I have some friends fuck man I got some friends that got attacked by your hair they got attacked by a giant grizzly bear and they have only their know everybody got away survived luckily but they were in they were in an island off of Alaska a fog neck Island and it's a huge population of brown bears and elk and they all live together these these fucking bears are you in this bear which is like an 11-foot bear charged into their camp and knocked everyone over like guys were flying left and right one of the dudes his nicknames dirt myth dirt myth was riding on the things back if you want to hear the whole story and it's a great story go to the meat-eater podcast and I think the episodes just say a fog nack Island I don't know if it says bear attack on a fog nack Island but if you're us if you're a clever Googler you'll find it's a great podcast anyway Steve Bernal is a genius he's a really interesting guy and a hunter like we just totally totally defies the stereotype that people have of like doofy hunters like super well read really interesting guy but his depiction of this event the most striking thing about it was that it defied everything that he thought it would be like if there was an actual bear attack sounds like Hemingway asked almost in a weird way well no we're right yeah because when look if something really fucking crazy happens the best-case scenario is there someone who actually knows how to write that's right there when there's something crazy happened right and this is the case but instead of writing it he just does a very eloquent job of describing it as does everybody else there I mean it was quite a few guys there my friend Remy Warren was there and Yanis patellas this is one where they got false attacked this was in British Columbia they got false charged a false charge is a bear this in this case it was a bear with Cubs and she just wanted to scare them off so she came running at them full clip it's crazy to see because they fired near her but they had the discipline to not fire at her well I'm like that is really impressive because this thing just came fuckin running at them and it's huge like here it is like give me some volume here oh my god peels off man is away and Callahan says I'll never forget I want to give him a t-shirt with him in his mustache and this says smell us now 80 fellas now lady that's the sentence that comes to callaghan's mind this so that is what he had experienced before and so he kind of kept his composure in that situation and he's like this other one where the grizzly bear literally knocked them over to the teeth word gnashing 10 inches from his face it was just so many people the grizzly probably didn't expect there to be that many people there there was like seven people there please let me think how many people one two at least five people there and I think that's what saved it even though there's camera people too is it probably was about seven people and I think that's what saved them the fact that this was a giant mass of people and the bear didn't know which way to go and one of the dudes Yanis hit it in the face with trekking poles you know those trekking poles yeah it was right they smacked in the face and the thing veered off one of the guys Remy he juked it he faked right and then went left the bear it was just so much going on the bear just ran through it one of the guys wound up on the Bears bag for like ten yards the bear was running and he was somehow under stuck on the Bears back and then fell off this is how big the bear was and yeah I think when you see a bear man you don't think it's gonna be like that that intense you know you don't think it because the first picture they showed of that bear he seemed like a calm bear you know look at that bear I've seen him in and the worst thing about bears is they advertise them mostly Disney movies how do you see a bear teddy bear you know what I'm saying you know they have fucking bears fucking - on the internet they have all that kind of shit but it mostly sweeties do your buddy there your buddy meanwhile how about those little kids that their dad got eaten in front of them those little kids what if they had a little pet polar bear that's not outside the realm of possibility with little kids and you you get convinced that that's what those animals are look I'm not saying you should never pet stuff polar bear they're cute it's not bad but you know I'm saying a toy would you have a little bear you think they'll go as a pet no fucking way man really is ridiculous you seem like a guy that might have a little bit fuck that dude fuck that first of all they're not listening to you yeah get away with all that there might be your friend it might be a friend as they grow older but you better keep that food around bitch and even if you have that food around you can't keep them from killing other people like there was a guy who has bear trained look at the size of that fucker oh my god this guy is definitely probably oh my god this is a gay guy if you keep this animal fed there are people that have bears this isn't Russia this is Russia yeah so if there's people that keep bears fed and take care of them and treat them well you know and this is the thing about bears - is that bears are omnivores they eat everything oh really ate animals ate vegetables they eat everything yeah it's crazy they like people in a lot of way in that their you know their diet varies so they don't have to eat they don't have to kill things they don't necessarily have the desire to chase things down and kill things like a cat does like cats have a deep desire to kill things right like cats can't shake that shit yeah I think you could you could feed a bear well and take care of it and you could probably avoid most of that but if it ever feels threatened in any way you're so fucked and do you think you have any like there you might not even notice when that bear feels that way well I wouldn't I'm not a bear expert I think a real bear expert would see that something's weird the Bears acting sketchy yeah they're bears like yeah they just they start acting irritated look at the size of these things man this guy is definitely a pervert you think so yeah because I think there's got to be something inside of you that gets off in a weird way to do this I don't think this feels natural I think they're intoxicated by powerful animals and not having these powerful animals around gives them a thrill okay the thrill has to be do you think that that they could kill them that's it 100% and also they'd like the thrill is they are beautiful creatures so you do want to be around them like they're cool to just be around and you can make friends with beautiful creature that could just kill a mass of people it kind of feels fun dangerous yeah it's cool too feels dangerous it's like a celebrity it's like knowing Elton John or some way better you know pet grizzly come over my house motherfucker I got a 12-foot dog it was my house you know like but cats see that's all that no more loose these people these are different animals this is a different thing but I think if people have an animal like that they're fucking next to it at night and they're doing I think is some of that I think you should be yeah probably near it I don't think they're getting involved with them but I think they're doing near it but hooting fuck right next to the tiger and get them horny well dude bestiality needs a different because I thought this about bestiality I don't know if we've even talked about this like but if you have sex with a local animal some that lives your house livestock right chickens so my phone it's fucked up it's fucked up and it's not you know it's you know we're traveling overseas with the specific intention of having sex with an animal okay that's to me that feel fucked up you know the rules are different I don't know you ask Bobby locally I'm sure in some places they're like give me some money now you do whatever you want that I go you know but if you if you fuck a mountain lion that's a strong man that's how I that's it young dude you never buy a beer again you fuck a mountain you fucking link yeah that to me that's not bestiality to me that's like some Ragnar lothbrok type shit yeah that's the bravest thing you can do that's a Viking shit imagine a trying to keep an erection and then sneak up on a fucking animals but you'd have to you have to figure out a way to hold them down do you think there's ever guy the best of the mount line then fucked it see I see another I believe there might be another Theo von or an infinite number of them out in the universe talking to another me and that we're sitting in the exact same to the exact same notes I believe that I'm not sure I believe any of those people on any of those planets planets ever fucked a mountain lion I don't a long time ago you don't think that one no but there's no YouTube there's nobody that's the only person who knows is the other two people people gonna think they're lying probably cuz they're alcoholics you could fall eat I don't think so dude I don't think there's any squirrels or rape people either you know and I think I think it's that that's more likely it's more likely that a squirrel would rape a person I could see it's gonna fuck someone who's drunk who passed out in their yard that's more likely okay I go crazy super horny squirrel just can't keep it together he keeps fucking up yeah some Kappa deltas just passed out under fucking yard you know crazy I do not think that a guy could fuck a mountain lion I just don't think that's ever happened especially not gay sex right maybe a female mountain lion might let you she's all wild up and in heat and he my friend wasn't it Chris Ryan talked about fucking his cat with a pencil that's right you did that's that's his shirt he tells a great story about his cat was in heat and she backed up to him she's like trying to get some dick and he put a pencil in there it he was like a little kid he was like a little good yes chéri was an adult sexual experience was this cat healing backing up on this pencil yeah I should imagine that did I remember getting like an erection and just I remember his hot hold it against fucking did I remember being at the library when I was young and this is back when they had books you know what do they have now um you know I mean I'm like fucking or libraries still open who's hitting here because people's around a finger each book about homeless people they allow homeless people in libraries yeah can we just start calling them shelters you know what I'm saying and serve lunch but I remember going in there and the only sex you could see at the time was like rode in or something like that or these old artists remember they were paying like a rubenesque home by shooting at you bit like this yeah see breasts did you'd have one of her hands like this hands why is that but I remember why is that like a pose it's indicative of a certain time and history yes because it's fucking really hard to draw a hand oh that could be it maybe somebody drew warning but you you think that like Emperor's would stand there and do this to their to their people yeah like you know how great look there's two things that Trump could do that people would freak the fuck out one of them obviously is like a Sieg Heil yeah that's bad the other one that might be just as bad as the Emperor yeah he comes out with one hand almost like he's holding an invisible football and the other hand do this and just address the people people who blow a gasket oh my god dude he should start wearing a crown how great would it be if he started wearing a crown dude it would be hilarious if we started wearing like a cheap burger do you think you think he has a sense of humor he definitely does yeah he definitely is the first president that has ever been roasted on Comedy Central oh that's a great point dude he got roasted on Comedy Central and Jeff Ross even said to him like like you're not laughing at the jokes like you should probably laugh at them like don't don't it's probably people like it better if you you're going along with these yeah yeah you're right and then he loosened up and started laughing at so he like takes advice from people right that are in the business they told some ruthless jokes about him man oh yeah you hung in there he handled it oh I think he's resilient whether or not he can feel any of that like cuz of his like whatever ego spaces and I wonder how much that even feels but I'm only he might be the only human in America that could take this much hatred from people at such like a level dude that brush put it on yeah and it doesn't sit off care it's weird yeah it's all I mean it's fucking it's kind of awesome it's kind of oh I remember after he got elected driving down the street me and like holy shit dude I could be President fucking yeah that was what we thought when we were kids - what's awesome about his and when I say awesome I don't mean good I mean amazing about his abilities like all throughout all this crazy shit he doesn't show any signs of being like he doesn't seem to be like freaked out right over the stormy Daniel shit or over the rushing all the investigations occasionally he goes on a mad tweet storm yeah he seems to be the same guy right he was before it doesn't seem to be there's certain dudes when you see something like was a good example something fucked up happens to them and you see it in their face rice like they're like well like George Bush whenever maybe on that video in the 911 ever they see the pictures and they told him about not well 9/11 was huge thing that's I don't think he knew how huge it was at the time it was all breaking out you know the that was a bad example yeah but yeah Trump says this seems totally unaffected he's just crazy no more senior citizens on Twitter that that's the thing senior citizens on Twitter is kind of bizarre oh there's a lot of them now yeah they love crazy will they take a break every couple minutes of doing Facebook all day yelling at people on Facebook everybody hates the guy so I don't think everybody's I think a lot of people like the time we're in right now because it's so it's just I feel like you know what you're gonna get you know ya know it's it's a strange time for communication man it really is yeah strange time for everything yeah man it's uh it's different it's so different to it it's fuckin it's kind of fascinating I had dumb they got Jordan Peterson came out on podcast yeah came on your podcast yeah which was wild cuz I'd know his publicist and I reached out and the publicist and then it was wild and so then he came through because I mean a lot of the people listen to my podcasts her you know we talked a lot about like being sober and like people that masturbate too much kind of weird stuff you know troubled youths kind of I'll say it right um but anyway it was cool because he like I don't know you know him better than I do him he loves you he said a lot of nice things about oh that's nice he's a great guy he's really misunderstood man misrepresented people think he sunk some fascists and some Nazi I didn't think that at all he's not by any stretch of the imagination he just says certain things that people are uncomfortable hearing and whether you agree with them or disagree with them that's one thing but that's the demonization is where it gets weird even if you think he's what his ideas foolish don't misrepresent who he is as a person yeah they try to pretend that he's this racist homophobic fuckin alt-right character he's not by any stretch of the imagination he's just a guy that especially when his principles are being debated or when his ideas are like he'll stand his ground and he's very firm about what he thinks is wrong about things like equality of outcome like making sure that everybody makes the same amount of money make sure everybody achieves the same amount of success like that is a ridiculous idea that leads to communism and Marxism he gets into it and it made me rethink how I thought about it before then I thought about it before then like an unattainable goal that socialist leaned towards because it's like the ideal the ideal is that money's not a concern for anybody and everybody just sort of does whatever they want to do because they enjoyed doing it not because they're doing it for money and that all the money's kind of piled in together and we take care of everybody it sounds great on paper right but then he starts talking about no you have to enforce the equality of outcome right he goes when you were talking about acquit there's gonna be people that work harder right it's gonna be male that try harder there's gonna be different varying levels of effort because we're human beings you have to take that into consideration as these people don't take that into consideration it's then you're you're you're either trying to stop the people that are doing too well or you're trying to take from them to give to yourself and how are you enforcing this and he just takes you down this rabbit hole of thought and really kind of explains the problems with Marxism and socialism and I'm sure there's really intelligent people that dispute his ideas I'm not saying that his ideas are infallible or that he's the only voice that I would listen to in these subjects but he's a brilliant guy and he's a very nice guy too and he's really missing misrepresented and and willfully so a lot I think it's sad because I think what's missing between right and the left is how much of it we would probably agree on we just talk about things rationally instead of contentiously instead of getting into these right versus left to base which are just way too common yeah where everybody's on one side is trying to diminish the person in this side and and get angry and they're doing a lot of these in front of big crowds which i think is also weird because then you're playing to the crowd I've seen some things that Jordan did with this Michael Eric Dyson guy with a guy literally wasn't looking at him is looking at the crowd calling him a mean mad white man and it's like right these kind of things that people are doing it's just everyone's just digging their heels in deeper on each side and instead of like looking at life like just having an open conversation about things that are troubling things where we could do better things where society needs work or things maybe where our perceptions are off and maybe we could look at the other side or look at each other but look at the whole thing better and figure out a better way around things instead of doing that everybody's just right versus left and right and deeper in the trenches and harder and we got a stop drop and I hope we have a recession to stop Trump and people are saying crazy shit crazy look everybody's supposed to suffer so that you can make one guy feel like he's doing a bad job or it's just not the way to approach it like you've seen that what does that woman's name Maxine what is her name Maximus or Trump I call her dark Trump she's people she's wild people to interrupt people's meals and and draw a crowd and like you know and I guess it's in response to what is the most disturbing policy was to separate children from their parents and people that are crossing the border but I think he didn't he decide to put a stop to that didn't they decide to put a stop to that did he sign something to put a stop to that well it's definitely scary if you're doing that new border I don't I don't know let's find out what the fuck that means you know we would have I know do that and I mean how do you separate people from their kids you've got to be you got to be trying to send some fucked-up message to scare the shit out of them so that'll keep them from coming over this is the idea I guess if you tell them you're gonna take their kids away they probably won't even try and then but what about this say if like you know everybody's against like sex trafficking and I'm not like what if one of those people is that scenario and the kids too afraid to say it I know that's like maybe more in acute situation but in that case you'd be grateful that you separated them at least to get each of them's point of view to know kind of what's a little bit more what's going on apparently that's like a huge issue like apparently sex trafficking you know everybody's just bringing young women in here too you know from other places for sex and I don't see that much of it but apparently it's the biggest thing in the world you know or it was last month well there was something that was I don't know this is true either I'm giving Jamie a lot of work today there was a smart there right sex trafficking ring that was broken up by ice and outside of it these people were protesting ice because of what I they were like saying abolish ice but meanwhile ice was like stepping they didn't understand that when you're doing what is it image immigrations Customs Enforcement is that what I stands for what they're doing is not just they're not just trying to stop people from crossing over the border they're also busting in this case apparently it was a sex trafficking or a human trafficking ring I don't know if they were using them as slaves or if they're using them as sex slaves well that's the thing say if say if two truckloads of people come into America right and one is you know adults and children and another as adults and children right and one of them are just actual family members and one of them are sex you know adults you know Manman trying to bring in sex workers we let's yeah we don't I mean how do you know how do you not set you know like I know yeah you don't want to take a mother from a kid or a father from a daughter but it's like how do you know what if we and what if you don't you know I don't know it's well that is the problem with people coming in if they're coming in illegally you have no idea who they are what they're doing yeah I mean that's that's only one problem the other problem is people who are criminals people who are violent offenders you know people there's people that have gotten back and forth multiple times and got busted in American wound up killing people that happened many times yeah they're that guy in San Francisco I remember that I simile shot yeah shooting the girl but yeah I mean it's you know I'm glad I mean I as much as it's hectic sometimes to think about it in here about it I think it's also it's neat to be alive at a time when you know I'm challenged to think you know and I'm challenged to to to feel different ways and to hear different voices and opinions about it honestly like I feel like we should have more of a roll call in America like you have to know who's here before you can even you know like if you're teaching a classroom people know who's in the class how can you even you know you know but it's what they should do first and foremost is legalize drugs and the reason being is that they're getting across from organized crime and it's building organized crime and Mexico to a staggering degree the drugs are here people are selling these drugs period they're going to keep selling these drugs you're not gonna diminish the amount of drugs you just not yeah no one's ever been able to do it the drug wars are complete total failure hope they love coke so make coke legal you would put a fucking halt to so much and if you made coke legal people would die pure coke you would it would it be tested and you you could give people drug education cuz like everybody knows okay how many beers can you drink if you drink three beers you probably shouldn't drive a car unless you're a giant you know like three beers you're probably over the legal limit you're a bear right unless just some 7-foot tall gorilla type man who's just got a lot of by but a regular regular guy beers you should not drive right so now stop and think like what is the level for cocaine I don't know I don't do it I've never done it but I don't know what it is like maybe we should know like you know you can't have three shots of Jack Daniels and drive okay but what what about what about speed I'm like you take two lines of coke you should not be talking to people yeah should be fucking calling an architect dude one of my buddies tried to put all of his fingers in his but one time I forget like an eight ball of coke how crazy is that so good goal but look and it's hard and it's nice to have a name for what was that called fingers in your boy yeah it's called something it was like called a clapper the Liberty Bell or something some crazy thing but um Jamie's Google when you have all your fingers in your butt I think that's go go for hunt have to be like bunny style and to be super flexible pull it off and you're gonna the crazy part is and I'm just I'm thought about this a lot but I have thought about this for a little bit you're gonna start with your smallest fingers and then you're gonna be stuck with those thumbs that's gonna be trying oh yeah that's gonna be the hard part you're gonna rip your asshole yeah well that's the risk you take like an old balloon it's exciting that thing you know there's no there has to be some risk of rewarding it your friend must have slender fingers well he was farming look dude he's on that much cocaine did I'll do it you know I used to that's the thing dude I got all fucked up and you know I used to get cocaine and do it by myself at home you know just to I don't know I wasn't doing that good just have some feelings and I remember dude I would order vests and shit off the internet I have like what kind of vests oh all kinds like the kind that we would wear if you lived in Boulder with them down filled ones Patagonia yeah I'm done I've gone that's a weird look yeah you got the flannel shirt with the puffy vest yeah very common look but it's like what are we doing here well I want to be warm but I want to let a little bit of ventilation in my arms just a little chill don't want around my body no I like my torso to be warm I'm talking all kinds bro I will get the leather I would get the ones with the bead what I mean I have like uh honestly I probably about 30 best at home why vests why was that the thing that you would order on cocaine it was just something I like to do with my belt buckles you have any preposterous belt buckles huh like some that light up different colors and shit like yeah I'm going out with this one of my buddies had a belt buckle said pussy only on it oh nice yeah that guy's gay 100% gay he's a kid no pussy what about you fucking no pussy bro you know what I do when I get pussy no what do you do I'll show you bro take your pants off I'm just an so was a pussy be careful he's like yeah I got a labia tattoo a mass love it push it I got vulva tattooed on my back in AH in Old English letters bro I love puts you so much I had my asshole turned into a pussy yeah yeah go ahead fuck it put your feels just like the real thing put eight and a half of your fingers in it bro they use stem cells bro yeah I got some new stem cells dude I got these new stem cells used on my asshole um but uh but that guy yes yeah I don't know but they got Jordan Peters from a super cool man what did you guys talk about you said you listened to any of his stuff before you got him on yep I listened to your episode with him actually from the day before and I listened to and I'd been listening to his book so that's where I was and I listened to the monk debate the monk debates are the ones where the guy called him a mad white man I was like this so silly but I found him to be and this just uh he just seemed like the pure he seemed completely pure and whatever you know he believed I think that in helping people like because I talked to him about like did he start to feel like famous you know like because people are really gravitating toward ya and he just felt it genuinely seemed that he felt just good for people he won he was happy to be helping others and that like it didn't seem like he had any ego in it he he definitely does like to help people but he also feels a responsibility because of his knowledge to explain what he thinks is a problem with certain types of behavior certain laws and one of them that got him in trouble or got him controversial got a lot of controversy attached to it was the compelled speech laws for transgender people the use of compelled pronouns me know Indiana death yeah so if you decided that you weren't gonna be a he or a she you could make up a number of different names and they would be legally compelled to use those names and some people are arguing that's not what it says and then he was saying no it's a it's a human rights violation if you don't follow along with that like this is this is compelled speech and this is dangerous because this is why this is what it leads to and then there's all these people debating with them but then what you got a chance to see is with him debating these points with these various intellectuals including like gender studies teachers and shit you got to see like oh this this is a crazy idea like these these people that think that you should have like 78 different gender pronouns and then it's it's tantamount to violence to not use someone's preferred pronoun you're like oh oh you're crazy right oh this is a mad person who wants the world to be different so you want all these new laws attached to whether or not someone calls them and he or she yeah and they're getting some traction with it what is weird in New York New York City I think it's landlords and it might be employers might but I think of pretty sure it's landlords they are compelled to use your preferred pronoun hmm so if your landlord decides to call you a different thing like if you say a machine now and it's like fuck you Thea I knew you when you were Thea you're Theo see what that law is compelled gender pronouns law New York City but but people like wait a minute wait a minute how many do I have to know right which ones do I have to agree with yeah you start because there's a ton of them now this literally is 78 different gender pronouns you know what I'm finding like I know they would you know for a while it was like people in certain areas they don't want to build transgender bathrooms it's like because there's nine people in this town yeah and we've seen everybody's dick like nobody we don't have any you can't change all these zoning laws for people for when there's not even someone present in some of these areas I think in some bad ways they're making people not be accepting of transgender people that they may meet at some point right by creating all of this this this this rhetoric or whatever it is this this conversation it's like some people are already fed up and they've never even met someone like this and so then they're gonna have weird they're gonna have already like contentious views when they do meet someone just cuz they've heard so much background noise that it's problematic you know when it's not that's certainly possible it's also possible that people will be scared of the backlash so they won't use transphobic language anymore the problem with that is you're not encouraging empathy you're encouraging fear you're encouraging fear of not following the the standard line of behavior and speech yeah and that's where people have a problem with it it's like the real way to do it is to promote empathy to say like look these people like this guy's born in the wrong body yeah came a woman he went through the surgery let him use the woman's room yeah like why not and if they're a bad person judge that bad person on each individual basis now when you're talking about children that's what people are scared of yeah you know you're gonna have some creep who pretends he's a woman so he can get in the girls room and he's gonna molest children those are those worst-case scenarios yeah those are terrible worst-case scenarios but what how often is that gonna happen how do we protect that how we prevent that from happening though those are the questions but what for the vast majority of the people that become trans do you really think they're gonna molest people I don't think they are you can't judge the vast majority based on a few that's just like the same logic that says people shoot up people with guns so we should take everyone's guns away that's crazy to know the vast majority of people with guns don't shoot people the vast majority people were trans they don't hurt anybody the nothing that all they're trying to do is just get along and be who they are this is a complex subject I think the danger is when people are scared that they're scared or bullied into agreeing with one side of the other side because then then shit gets weird because then it becomes a battle but it becomes a battle instead of an opportunity yeah a discussion an opportunity to enforce and encourage compassion like that it can be done both ways yeah I think the Opera but to look at these people like look they just okay why do you care if someone wants to be a girl why do you care if she wants to be a guy why do you care yeah like let him do it let him be free let me there themselves just like let it do tattoo his face let let what do whatever you want man as long as you're not fucking people over and you're not hurting people you know they're robbing people and stealing from people and murdering people as long as that's not happening yeah do whatever you want yeah that should be our approach this stuff that's me one of our that should be someone the Bill of Rights or somewhere I knew what new a new amendment should be something in there where we think about the why why we have a problem and how we address the problem as soon as you address the problem with force force forward is force in return you're gonna get forced back people are gonna get they're gonna want to get ramped up just as much to attack you as you attack them and then you're going back and forth left and right and it becomes fucking chaos yeah that's what we have right now and you see the difference between Fox News and CNN and the right and the left and everybody digs their heels and fat and fuck it's it's not it's not helpful it's not helpful and there's also a bunch of people that profit off of this this battle and you okay no New York City did not just introduced a $250,000 fine for any incorrect use of gender pronouns but they did for some use of gender pronouns I think the question misinterpretation of a guideline that's already existed there was a blog post I got written in the New York Post reported on it there was a updated or a change in the guidelines but it's not supposed to be free like an incorrect or miss misuse of it what is it supposed to be for harassment discrimination and things like that okay so regardless of individual sex assigned at birth Anatomy gender medical history appearance or the sex indicated on the individuals identification okay the raw requires employers and covered entities to use an individual's preferred name pronoun in title eg misses or mrs. regardless of the individuals sex assigned at birth so that's it okay these guidelines as noted by the Commission can impose penalties of up to $250,000 for violations that are the result of willful wanton or malicious conduct mm-hmm so that seems like they're saying that it is true there are that is the so there is a law but there's a commission it's not just like you can't just say it no but someone's gonna find you it has to go through a long lengthy court process they're not just finding people like businesses and like can you imagine the G all this is gonna do is create a ton of lawsuits yeah just because it's a commission like that that might even be worse that you're bringing it into like you have to sit in front of a bunch of experts who have to decide whether or not you you misgendered someone or gestapo-like it's crazy it's crazy to me just look if someone's an asshole they're an asshole like what if so what if you're a Jew and someone calls you a kike can they get fined $250,000 how does that work well no right but that's an offensive term for a Jewish person right so if you if you brought that to court how would that work you I don't think you get it right it's Commission though a business being brought they're not like just a price yeah like landlords is one of them that they brought up like you know if you decided that you were be Jamie still but now you're Jamie the woman I'm like the fuck out of here Jamie you're a dude give me my money yeah that's like a Missy wouldn't they if if that was the case it was and I wanted an apartment that you were offering and you wouldn't give me an apartment for that reason huh or we work together in some sort of way and I'm discriminating against you at work ma'am b/c it's just so it's feel like so many it just seems like a ground for so many lawsuits what I find is if somebody's a dick to somebody if somebody's calling somebody a name or something these days with so many camera phones and so many things usually it gets brought out pretty quick if somebody's racist these days like really devout like in their core and they do like it gets brought out pretty fucking quick yeah not always though not always I'm sure some people get away with it well you know you learn you know how I learned like in in the area I grew up in not to be racist you'd hear somebody say something to somebody else that they shouldn't say and they got their ass whooped and then they learned not they I mean it was a weird way to learn it but you learned you learned it would be nice if people could learn another way to realize how stupid it is to just be racist yeah there's three ways you should judge individuals like based on their actions and what they've done how they treat other people how you know whether or not they're doing things that are illegal or immoral or unethical that's as an individual but as soon as you're doing it based on where they can't control right there what they're what they look like where they were born what part of the world they're from that's just fucking stupid it's just a stew it's you you're you're you're judging people on something of zero control over yeah you have any control over your color that's crazy and if there's people that are still doing that that are still living in that space then it's I mean it is something that I think someone will just take more time but I think eventually some that will be eradicated I think it's beige powers my thing what we're all gonna be beige bro you know I'm saying we're three general generations from all being bathed yeah II think so you don't know no not because of places like England and Scotland and Ireland where it's always raining you're gonna just gonna get a massive amount of white people in those spots no matter what it's there's no Sun you went white brown people that move there of five six seven generations they start paling up like Brendan Schaub see settings from England that's what it really he lies about a lot dude for me I think he does you don't he just forgets things yeah a black guy from England like 500 years ago is full families probably black and then over time over time they just turned into white people just like every other person that moved to England yeah right every fucking human being came out of Africa a hundred percent yeah that's the the origin of the species we came from Africa we branched out into the world and we got to places like Scotland where it never fucking sits never sunny and we got bleached out people got they turned into like solar panels for vitamin D and the soak up that vitamin D yeah because if you're black like you got so much melanin oh yeah if you're like Congo black you've got a dark skin color that's just awesome for Sun but it's terrible when there's no Sun like how you getting your vitamin D dude even if you hug a black person I think your skin feels a little bit kind of like more moist you know what I'm saying kind of these cocoa butter yeah remember Ashley oh dude we had a dude in our neighborhood his brother set him on fire and his whole leg was ass she just dude booboo Tyson and he does anything just roll on oh yeah she's just dry skin but sometimes I feel a little bit of African like in my course unless I'll lay in bed at night and just like pretend I was in Africa never get your blood tested to see what you are yeah I didn't look at the result yet didn't look at the results and I'm scared what you might be I don't want to be French that's what I don't want to be honestly you I think you're French no I'm not do I see French a little bit yeah I think you got 13% don't laugh about that Jamie what how come you don't want to be French of all things what's wrong with that why would that bother you even a little bit they made great wine great painters who create a rewind they came laying a lot yeah apparently they like to fuck really yeah that's the word that French people just like to fuck and they think that the way we handle things is stupid like they have affairs like openly publicly like a little bit politicians they of course they cheat they're all fucking animals over there and that Toxoplasma apparently was running rapid through friends really yeah what is it Toxoplasma is that things yet from cats get it and they get it from rats and it's a it's a parasite that gets into human brains and it affects humans and it makes people a little bit more reckless like rabies kind of a light no not rabies more like like slightly drunk all the time yeah and this Toxoplasma apparently there was at one point in time 40% of ever inch of France was infected with Toxoplasma yeah see if you find that that's true that's been a fuck fast I bet fuck fest wild and loose yeah you got JP they think that there there's a direct correlation between the high levels of infestation and the behavioral changes of the population infestation of what rats and stuff know of this Toxoplasma apparently 50 million people in this country have it you get it from cat shit or from if you live in a farm like you step on a field and it gets in your skin like maybe cats I've been shitting all over the place or a dog will eat something that you know some catch and when you get shitting your feel around the dog 2012 analysis from France where an estimated 43 percent of the people carrying toxoplasmosis Gandhi concluded that men with a latent infection tend to be more dogmatic less confident more jealous less impulsive and more orderly than uninfected men infected women seem warmer more conscientious more persistent more insecure and more sanctimonious whoa dude I'll get a six-pack for the ladies then huh that's not crazy is that that 43% of people carry it Jesus Christ that's a large number of human beings infected by something that changes behavior or at least leads to trends that are different hmm and noticeable more dogmatic less confident less confident is interesting that gondii toxoplasmosis gondii associations of having antibodies to the parasite with bipolar disease suicidal behavior even optimistic disposition possibly related to the Paris its effect on dopamine so it gets in your body and then you just have it for life oh wow yeah it sexually transmitted it must be then huh that's a good question that's a very good question I don't know if 42% of people have it I can't imagine that half of the population is stepped-on up you know fucking well I think they that's a good question that's a good question but I think there's a lot of feral cats around yeah that's true yeah I think when this place is like Elgato yeah we had a lot of feral cats running around ratatouille they have that whole movie about that animal it was shut up yeah and what it does to the rats is it makes them get hard-ons when they smell cat piss is that really yep rewires their sexual reward system so lately their testes enlarged when they smell cat piss no they get hard fucking a neighbour like that with pregnancy say that's their past through pregnancy to the child yeah woof woof there you go ruff 43% so high number that's a it's like it's a lot of people it's 43 out of a hundred people do 2 billion people on the planet 2 billion people have it yes 43 percent of those tested in that study and that's all the people to get tested who the fuck I've never been tested you've been tested know how many people been tested that's a rough estimate man they don't fucking know I bet it's a lot higher I bet as a lot of people that have it yeah shit in the blood dude I probably got it we had dr. Robert Sapolsky in the podcast we did one with him he's an expert in it and he's got a bunch of lectures and speeches on it and he said that when he was a resident then he had heard about a guy who found out that a disproportionate number of motorcycle accidents were attributed to people that were on this Toxoplasma really yeah that they that they they got this infection and it was causing them to do stupid shit on motorcycles and crash I would hate that man it's hard enough to ride a motorcycle and then have like you know just to be being led astray by a rare disease in your brain a 1 and I wonder if it varies right I wonder if the Toxoplasma that they get in Paris has the same exact response as the one that they get inside the variation no just America the field is a bunch of variation yeah Oh see that's what I'm talking about different ones a Long Island has a lot of Jesus Christ there's different ones fuck see I bet the what is this though this seem like what is it well it's parasites okay so we have our sites parasites exist in so many animals they hitch rides and then that they've that's their ecosystem our ecosystems to be on planet Earth their ego system is to be in Planet Theo von and they just get inside of you have parasites ever change like the kind of the course of history is that what happened with the plague or is that a different thing no the plague is a different thing but they probably could change the course of history if they really changed that many people's behavior if you think about Paris there are France they're talking about 43 percent of the people have this infection the irony of parasites how crazy is that that's crazy it's a parasite what if they have could you imagine little French fucking Berets yeah we go behavior stupid Americans the craziest one man is this aquatic worm it climbs inside a grasshoppers body grows in the grasshoppers body and then it tells the grasshopper to commit suicide oh my god so it gets the grasshopper to jump into the water and then once the grasshopper gets in the water then it bursts out of its body well it's like Pinocchio meet some alien if you see a movie alien Sigourney Weaver it is like Pinocchio it's like the bottom of the whale right belly of the whale yeah movie alien with Sigourney Weaver probably my favorite science fiction movie of all time oh really yeah I would say if I had to pick one science fiction horror movie that was like filled one I would say that alien it's kind of cornball when you watch the special effects now though yeah like not as scary yeah there's some space stuff that you like oh okay this is 1978 you forget different I wasn't even 1980 man you know that's corny that's crazy hot as hyzer being he was tall and she had curly hair I remember thinking about strong confident sexy yes like her fucking neck wanted and like you think he couldn't choke her out yeah like if she was she was a power woman like this isn't a woman that needs a man right if she liked you it's like oh she's like I'm worthy yeah of her like she drove a van but because she had fucking business to do yeah I think we should have like a old Land Cruiser like a Toyota fj40 you know when those ones yeah she'd be like an archaeologist or some shit right yeah she had a fucking pickaxe well that's what she was in Avatar right in what is this oh that's alien and that that's - is that a record what is that so it's a kid kid hang on to her bro oh my bad that was alien alien - is not my favorite because it's like wait a minute why is it so easy to kill them all of a sudden so easy to kill them because there's so many of them like alien one that fucking thing was like it was thinking yes it was it was ahead of you every step of the way alien - they just became like clumsy and bumbling and you shoot them and there's another one around the corner shoot that one - it's like okay did I remember uh arachnophobia had me shook remember that one when those spiders gotten that duplex bro that shit shook me to the core do you see this one is like way deep into the future like the first one was in the 70s mm-hmm and they're still doing them now that's what's craziest - ready to bang out new alien movies now they're predator coming out they'd have a new predator coming out they do hilarious mm-hmm why not make some money yeah let's do that kind of stuffs fun it's probably fun I can't believe Brennan shibez Italian would you say was British English yeah yeah they came from Africa through engi 2,000 years ago his people did oh I'm over time recently white yeah that's why they call him big brown oh really no I just made all that I thought he seemed like he seemed pretty white to me when I see right yeah a giant white dude yeah he loved he always has he is the best disposition doesn't break he just loves to laughter yeah you could think it's on he gets hated on dudes get jealous do you get jaws but do you think and also he says stupid shits but but you think he feels that he feel like is a special gift where you can kind of especially if your buddy like you can kind of joke with him and he love like he just he knows that you love him ya know he's a great guy he bros it off he's got a great attitude like if more people had his attitude with life's problems we'd have a happier world he knows how to let things roll right off his back it's big he's a smart guy man I always like being around him yeah man he gets a lot of hate online it's interesting yeah I think it but I think it's guys that are jealous cuz when I go on the road like I just went to Bakersfield recently which is can we just say it's like the best people ever came out there's fuckin amazing oh do I I felt like I I thought like Hulk Hogan bro people came out people were crying someone sacrificed their cousin some guy came out of the closet like oh wow they wanted it all that happened at the show you know people were giving me recipes people were giving no I think man it ain't that far now's an hour and a half hour and 40 minutes how long does it take to get the Bakersfield familiar two hours two hours max it should be the new capital bro it's not a bad spot and the bleep are super-nice pretty diverse I I mean yeah it was cool man I really liked it although I did turn my sink on its Brown shit was fucking flying out of the sink like what fuck is this it was like Bakersfield what the fuck is going on with your water man to Saint good because you know they're high school the mascot it's they're called the drillers there's like a team name because they're oil drillers do you know that that whole area is where there will be blood that no Louis Lewis movie I love that guy that's an amazing movie - so good that there will be blood is about that whole area that's where there's apparently look at that doesn't my water coming out of my fucking sink did you drink any oh yeah dude and the worst is you already brushed your teeth that's a crazy part - I don't know that happens because you don't know it first ooh it's funky definitely seems like a malt but I think that I was staying at our super old hotel like real old from the 1800s they like redid it downtown yeah what does it call it the Ace Hotel the didn't say God Dre I didn't tell people or stood because I didn't want to be mean to the hotel the Padre hotel I think is a whole place yes I think that's it was nice hit a nice it was nice in there it is nice resonator yeah yeah but it's just they they got some old ass pipes clean those pipes on yeah something's going wrong yeah I was staying there son yeah what if what if I took a mouthful that drank it what he died what if I was just shitting all over myself for the rest of the day and I to cancel my shows oh how about that he will be here yes it fucking angry rightly so this should be furious dude do you think you will die one day or not I'm not trying to make you think about I'm pretty sure that's how the world that's how the road goes yeah you're born and then you die what do you think I don't know me where Christ she doesn't think you die yeah yeah I think I think he's just drunk yeah that could be it - yeah another shirt on do you have to put a shirt on to decide if you're gonna die or no he goes prove it we we have to base this on what we know about people now I know the people you used to be alive and now they're not so what happened to them are they faking it you know like you will you be sad if you die you think I don't think I'll be dead bro yeah what about you I'd be sad if you died oh thank you I'd be sad if you died - thanks man I would be do you worry about the end of your life yeah I worry about it in the sense it makes me really wonder then what does my time mean what does your time mean like what's important to you in this life right now I think probably being just feeling more okay with myself probably hmm and trying to have maybe help other people being more okay with yourself like what what bothers you about yourself oh I just wish I just felt more comfortable my own skin a lot of times you know because I feel like I would be able to be more effective as a person if I could just they kind of get a not toil in some of my own you know the small self-worth issues a wound like lack of confidence at times you know I wish I could trust my instincts and I wish my instincts were like better calibrated so that I knew when I was what if I was doing like okay and good stuff and my insides like told me you're being ok you don't have to worry you know there's a lot of things going on there right one of them the big one is almost always from your childhood almost feelings of lack of Worth and self-worth come from that feeling as you're developing as you're growing up yeah you feel like you're not loved are you're not appreciated or you're you're criticized too much you feel like you're a loser and really because like psychologically to be very hard to shake and even as people get older sometimes they still they still cling to this thought that they're they're a piece of shit because they're a piece of shit in someone's eyes when they were 8 yeah there were 10 that's a real problem with people man and that's one of the reasons why when someone gets bullied when they're young it can be so devastating because it's happening when you're in high school or junior high school and it becomes a defining moment for you yeah yeah it's - I was scared as one kid really also about this one kid one of the reasons why I got into wrestling this kid like we had this confrontation in a locker room mm-hmm and I didn't think we were gonna fight like I was just totally bluffing I don't know what what I said or what he said I don't remember but I do remember him getting me in a headlock throwing me on the ground and then leaning like he was gonna punch me in the face but deciding not to and I didn't know what to do I had no know martial arts skills no nothing right I have I'd never wrestled anybody before I didn't know anything so there's nothing in you that is like any reaction panicked and no idea what to do and I think on a thought shit I didn't think he was gonna do that and now here I am on my back I'm trapped like god dammit I gotta learn how to wrestle I gotta learn some martial arts or something so then I started taking karate and then I started taking wrestling like right after that but I avoided that kid every time I saw him I see him on the other side of school I'd like see you through the breezeway and I'm always knew where he was I wanna see that guy that threw me on the ground and could have punched me in the face it was almost like more humiliating that he could have punched me in the face but he didn't but that bullying and that guy doing that to me that fear of like being just helpless mm-hmm made me get into martial arts I was like fuck this like I gotta figure out how to fight I don't want this to happen to me so they said that said you said there's the benefit mean if it was a lucky situation to like he didn't beat me up it could have been way worse it was not that big a deal it's an easy school to go do like my school wasn't hard even though there was some criminals that were in that school like some kids that get shipped into there was some bad kids and one of them got charged with murder like right after graduating whoa our friend Kevin we knew this dude he killed somebody more like whoa yeah everybody was like whoa that guy killed somebody I think he was one year older than me yeah he murdered somebody like right after high school yeah there's a kid we knew he was on the football team we like knew him and do you never think he would murder somebody he was a tough guy yeah a scary guy for sure like a powerhouse of a person like a tank um I didn't know him well though but I you know I'd say hi to him but it's one of those things where when something like that happens to you and for me again it was a very minor yes I was just scared of this guy and I he didn't do anything to me horrible just threw me on the ground so I'd like you to beat your brains I mean if someone could hold you down I thought I could do it could've beat my face and I wouldn't been able to do shit are you grateful in a weird way that he didn't they're not great yeah look I'm sure for sure it was enough he just let me know I was you know I don't know what I said I'm it I said something stupid he might have said something stupid and wanted me to back down and I didn't say he just grabbed me threw me on the ground but the fact that he that he did it and could do it led me to make one of the biggest decisions of my whole life is getting involved in martial arts didn't want that feeling anymore if like if someone talked like gives me a hard time I want to be the one who can decide whether or not this gets violent or who gets hurt I don't want to leave that into some stranger's hands who might be a fucking psychopath yeah if it's in my hands no one's getting hurt we're gonna be finally there's a video of Matt Serra from yesterday Matt Serra there was a drunken altercation with some fucking dude in a food court Matt Serra who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt at one point in time when he was competing he's one of the best Brazilian jiu-jitsu artists in the world then on top of that he fought in MMA knocked out Georges st. Pierre won the welterweight title and he's got some dude on the ground and he's just saying calm down calm down the guy's like I'm gonna fuck you up I'm gonna fuck but it's hilarious to watch like look at this look at play it good and play the volume he's like I'm gonna break your fucking face there get he's holding his wrists I love how he has a shirt on the guy's face he's like calm down calm down it's like he's putting a crying baby to sleep and so the security guard comes over and says let him go he goes okay you're gonna control them [Music] are you gonna control the noises are you gonna control oh yeah are you ready to control him like he's not he's standing up and he's fat and let me tell you something Matt Serra's one of the nicest fucking guys on the planet Earth if he has to do this to you in a restaurant he's a restaurant he's got full mount on you you fucked up you fucked up dude but see you're way way better off with Matt Serra in that position then that drunk dude on some guy who doesn't know how to fight it could be that - that drunk dude could just be a real mean violent person who wants to beat someone up if he gets them down so if there's guys like you know who aren't into that kind of so you found getting into martial arts are really kind of led you in like a way where you felt more confident in case things got into an uncomfortable situation that you would be okay yeah well look you're always you're always gonna be nervous in life when something's important whether it's going on stage or something difficult in life you know difficult things make you nervous it's like there's an anticipation there's an understanding of the difficulty of something you're about to pursue and whether or not you're gonna fall short or whether or not you're gonna succeed that shit makes people nervous but the physical confrontation nervousness is a bad one that's it that's not like that is a paralyzing fear yeah no you need to feel of being hurt and you can't do anything about that devastates people that puts them in a deep deep depression yeah so it's really important to look I think I think every young man should learn how to fight I think there would be way less fights because of it and I don't think you have to be a mean person to learn martial arts I think it's a skill and I think you learn it and then once you start getting good at it it started actually starts actually becoming fun and the people who you practice it with you you become close with yeah you don't you don't hate the people that you're practicing fighting with they become some of your closest friends yeah and I think it's just a big it's a giant confidence boost to know that you can do something difficult and get better at it that's I think just that alone it has massive benefits for people yeah you know I can sense them and I'm we were watching a video a couple years ago actually like getting a belt or something they gave you a some dojo or I'm not sure the correct terminology was it might have been a bj you probably watching when I got my black belt yeah maybe that was it but anyway it yeah like all there was a lot of guys around it just and I know that Koko does it Joey does it loves it you look why don't you do it you're a strapping man I talked to Eddie drama about going to do it one - do it so he said uh he said yeah come he said come down one day and he'll you know get me you know like one of the beginners classes I think I didn't do it fuck yeah you make me feel a little bit more yeah like you said sometimes are just uh I don't know some and especially like if people get bullied and then they don't have like a brother or they don't have a friend or they don't even have somebody to go like talk to they'll be like oh man and then their buddy be like oh it's okay you know like that see that's that can mate you know then that person gets stuck inside themselves just feeling like you know like they're not gonna be okay you know no it's terrifying and then everywhere you go you're you're just scared of running into this guy yeah it's very very bad you know that's get into the venomous do it it's a fucking natural animal inclination to pick on the weak you know only humans realize it and stop it and actually tell people not to do it and understand the effect that it has on the people that do it but every animal does it dogs do it chickens do it chickens have a pecking order they fuck one chicken and then they all decide I let's fuck with this bitch and they all attack her for no reason it's weird man and you seen it everybody seen dogs do it one dog will blow up and the other dog the other dog will cower and then they decide the pecking order I mean and then that dog will always go near that dog and fuck with them and growl at him maybe bite his ear or something like that yeah it's a weird thing that animals figured out how to make sure that the only ones that get to breed are the ones that are confident and powerful and can overcome problems okay and one of the problems is other mating they're viable males that want to mate with the women that you want to mate with like with this fucking giraffe they wound up killing those three other giraffes this guy just was like fuck these bitches coming up I'm gonna smash my head into these giraffes to stop them you ain't fucking these girls when you get older fuck you bitch and is just a natural inclination that animals have to find the weak and force it out and we don't have it well we do we did have it fortunately we have it less now I said we realized because of communication right we realized that there's devastating effects nest then we have loving and caring communities we have compassion that you shouldn't do that right there's an inclination that people have to pick on the weak and attack the weak it's very it's very disturbing but it's also very logical in terms of like biology right we're trying to make it difficult for males to breed it's not like we have very few people and we're trying to make as many people as we get no no it's like the the high status males and the dominant males are competing against these other males in order to be able to breed with you know whatever yeah lizards or fucking wolves or any any and any species yeah high status male wolf is the one who gets to breed with the the choice females and this is how they're carrying their genes on it happens in deer it happens in elk it happens in all these different animals it's and they fight I mean the reason why these these antlers on this an elk yeah those are for fighting that's all they're for they actually lose those fucking things after they're done breeding really they fall off and they grow back again the next year that it's the fastest body-part growth known to man is elk antler's and that look I mean when you look at those it looks like it would take 70 years to grow yep they grow those motherfuckers in a couple of months Wow and then it'll grow bigger next year up until a point sometime around like age nine or ten sometimes they taper off and they start to decline as they get older yeah they're their antlers actually become smaller and smaller but for the most part as the that's one of the reasons why people want to shoot a big male is cuz that male like with big antlers that male spread his genetics for many many years so his genes are long passed on he's probably bred with dozens of females oh I see so if it has if it obviously been alive a long time and it has that family treatise hanging out of the front of its head exactly then you know okay this thing is already it's already prospered yeah and the idea also is that to only shoot those males those those high-status big males it's actually better for the population because then the younger males get a chance to become older mm-hmm because they'll kill him they killed young males if a young male gets fucking frisky and he thinks he's a badass the big old bull will fuck them up and one of the ways they fuck them up is their antlers are longer so they can get the young one when the young one can't get him nothing misguided and kind of evil like you're your weapons are dictated by your age it's really weird right and you're strengthened like how vite how much vitality you have that's what grows your antlers out in that I mean that's fascinating yeah that's how it all that it's all put together like that it is fucked up and they bully the shit out of those young bulls they chase him away you get no pussy those those young bulls are they're calm satellite Bulls they're so horny are they just hanging on the outside we're gonna blues that's like they're susceptible to hunters because hunters will like make a cow calling yeah okay what the fuck what the fuck and then they get shot yeah it's how they get that's one of the things about elk hunting that's so interesting is that you call them in actually make sounds to try to bring them towards you so they think they're gonna get some pussy or they think there's a fight that's the other thing you do you make a bugle they have these horns you blow yeah these bugles and then the elk will go what you want some of this bitch and he'll come around the corner look for ya looking for another elk to fuck up and then then shoot them would you ever get in like a suit or anything like that and do it no that pretend to be an elk yeah like sneak up on them they have actual elk decoys that they use that they actually put on the front of the bow so like say if you were shooting your bow right you got your bow here extending in front of your bow is like a like an L it looks like like like a female elk it's like a decoy and you're actually shooting through her at the elk oh okay it's like a decoy that you put on in front of your bow you're drawing back your bow we got something here like rocket pussy's like a weapon in it elk blow that toy what is this that is weak so popped up when I techno it's a new product was it's a adjustable fit ball cap so what is that mask it's that LK that's a good way to get shot by a dude it's a good put one of those on a water ops oh so that's what that is what it is it's like an elk head you know who has one of those John Dudley has something like that guys like years he wears you tricking or treating him looking at the filter that's it you look like I don't think their vision is very good oh I say I think their vision is have you ever watched any of them have sex or they don't yeah yeah I saw one of them I saw male elk fuck a female it was crazy really is it pretty cool or mashed it he smashed it so hard she went flying forward what she got tackled went down to her front knees he just climbed on top and he's a one-pump chump boom he just slammed into it could you tell he felt good after eating like whatever Sally's screaming when they're fucking and when they were in in heat and they're eating in the rut they call it it's amazing to watch I mean this is something they only do once a year so for 11 months out of the year they're cool with each other they're all just hanging out together and one month out of the year it's chaos just fighting to the death with other males and smashing into it and then every girl they get a chance they bang it out and then when it's over it's over and then this is a cycle of life and then in the spring the new calves are born and then you know they they grow up and then a year later they're hanging around and the the pack and then they get older is that they get older to challenge the old bull for dominance and chases them away and yeah it's it's a fascinating sort of ecosystem when you want and then you know there's always wolves and there's always bears and those all these things are trying to eat them and mountain lions are killing them it's amazing that's wild man it's wow that's good that's neat that you're so in tune with all of that stuff man that you you know you're into this world that sounds like a lot of fun you know well it's really interesting even if I never ever hunted again I would still be fascinated by wildlife yeah it is just it's one of the more interesting things about being alive there's there's these other things that are alive too and they're nothing like us yeah they are nothing like us without outliers really oh for sure for sure but we're the ones who are separated from them so completely that if we see one it's like a bird that's sitting on a flagpole yeah it's you know it's fucking coyote in your neighborhood well what's he doing here you know like the or a dog which is like our friend you know dog I don't even count them as animals I know they're animals but they're our friends it's like when you have dogs either they're dependent upon us for food they're part of the family it's a totally different deal than like a pet wolf or a pet bear or some shit there's an episode where somebody's dog plays family feud with them no I'm saying so that's uh yeah you what other animals gonna do that I saw dude online who talked is he trained his dog to get him a beer and he put a tighter towel to the door or the refrigerator you'd say go get me a beer and the dog would go there she would grab ahold of towel pull on it it would open up the door to the fridge she would reach in grab a can of beer run over hand the can of beer to him he'd say good now go close the door and she would go close the door she would go grab that towel and use it to shut that door I was like that is insane that is a super trained animal man mm-hmm yeah I never had a dog I know we were talking last night at the comic store about your dog and you you know you guys always seem to be super happy like when y'all go running and everything they're talking about school you ever have any pets no I never had any pets never growing up uh-uh responsibility they had scary dogs I'd like they had loose dogs and her neighborhoods like Rottweilers Doberman you know so it was like it wasn't nobody had a pet like everybody had like there were two dogs they were like fuck you know you'd see him fucking and sometimes like attack so it's kind of exciting but it wasn't like and then a lot of animals got hit by my house by this highway by trucks and so we'd go bury the animals sometimes oh really yeah so we go get the animal you know pull them right off this little highway and bury them but um but yeah I never had a pet but I would like to have one if I can get a home one time you know a home and like a wife and stuff and I think I would like to have an animal you know they're fun man B got a really know what you're getting into if you go out of town you're gonna need somebody to watch it feed it and take care of it you know you gotta get that you gotta make sure you have a big enough yard or your dog can get some exercise yeah they're gonna shit all over the place you're gonna have to learn how you pick that up you gonna have to pick that shit up yeah you know can you teach them to shit in like a hole or something nope nope they shit wherever they go outside they just find a spot and say this is a good spot to shit and they just drop logs yeah and then you got logs all over your lawn yeah and if you go two days without cleaning those logs you got eight logs I have three dogs so a dogs makes mucho logs then if I don't clean it up off that fucking smell going to be out in the yard like a really harsh it's mouse and you got to get the scraper little scraper and scrape the logs and then I have a place I'd dump them into yeah scooping up shit imagine if your grandma just shit all over your on just go out go out in the lawn just she shits in the yard shits on the lawn like clean up her shit yeah I love her but god I hate cleaning her shit yeah I would hate cleaning up probably human shit for some reason but I remember the dog shit well when I was a kid they had to blend our neighborhood named Mario right and he uh and he was dude he ended up dying actually did some pills and drove into an embankment but he when I was young he would shit in his yard make me bury it and that's how that's how I was allowed to be friends with him well how did he make you bury it he just asked me to do it and I was afraid not to do it I said yo dude you're gonna believe this but I took a shit and it's out my I can't even bury it because I'll throw up hey do me a favor and go bury it yeah he was he did he was dark man he had a he had a real dark vision and he would uh he would I mean he probably honestly dude he probably shit two hundred three hundred times and I buried it I swear to God I swear to God I swear to God dude and he um how'd you not run out of places to make new holes do you think you ever dug up old shit to put a new shit oh yeah I wouldn't be surprised man hey we basically had like they'll only set up I had not even have a strong system the only setup had was like a one of this plastic uh you know beach Oh setup dude I was seven so wait a minute the seven year old was doing this how old was he he was eight or nine Oh he's tricking you but yeah an older he was older and two years when you're seven is a long stretch now when you're 32 yeah 32 34 doesn't mean shit whatever dude put seven and nine that's a big stretch yeah you go shit at your house buddy that's what I tell people now [Laughter] - what he would what was the firmer the first there's no way you really remember I remember instead I don't remember what he said but I remember how did it happen how did it happen we find yourself with a plastic shovel and another person shit going damn how did it come to this well it came to it because he I know my brother probably wasn't around and I wanted somebody to play with and he was older so I was hanging out and he was deviant man how so he just had a little bit of like like he was kind of slithering you know what I'm talking about my mom he knew how to manipulate you yeah he was obviously buried his shit 200 plus times like there wasn't he had the same color in the outside of his eye on the inside of his I took him out demon yeah like a light dealer Diablo yeah like a el Diablo but also who was in elementary school ah interesting um but he so when you first found yourself do you remember them the feeling that you first found when you were digging a hole for a dude's shit like just thinking what am i how long can I do this what if he keeps asking how do I stop this how'd you wind up stopping that's maybe a better question you know what I don't remember how it kind of you know pant you know how you do off yeah peterhof how it kind of tapered off his parents ever like hey you ever shit in the house how come we don't have any missing toilet paper well did you know that's what I think it was I think he was lazy or you know he's I'm serious and he shout outside behind his slide they had a slide in his yard kiss a do you know a little bit of money and he shout outside behind the slide this is a great word to buy and it was silty kind of soil and sand and I remember going over then I still remember I remember the shade of it honestly would it look like I would say like a taupe but a little bit a little more Brown in it you can always find coyote shit because it has like little berries in it a lot of times coyotes eat all kinds of things yeah yeah eat some berries sometimes I'll see these logs like these little red berries in and I'm like oh that's coyote shit mmm it's always a dark brown to their shit super consistent it's weird gooses have fancy shit sometimes aciem you mean disgusting yeah I never liked it but it seems creatures yeah and that's a bait-and-switch by mother nature because if you see a goose you think oh this is fun this can be exciting another me and then they'll fucking choke out an infant at a park I mean gooses are violent they're violent it's really violent Nate they they fight impacts do they have impacts yeah they do I have a friend had a house on a lake and they had a wire all around the lake I was like what's the wire for Doug is to keep the goose from going into the water they don't want him waddling into the water the other thing I was like is that electric like what kind of face is that I'm not sure if a thing I'm not sure of its electric might give him a little shock but the idea was to try to keep the because they shit all over their lawn the shits in here where they're at a pond in their yard yeah there looks like the ultimate like that kid marry a hitter site that came marry oh but a bird I'm balling on you and you have a pond in your yard like you want to go fishing yeah take five steps out of my backyard you know you know that's like the ultimate but I don't think that's it I don't think if you have a natural Hill in your yard kind of I don't think that's that expensive to get water put in and to get a pump put in I don't think it to that drastic man I would think that would be a nightmare but you got to make sure it doesn't leak like you Adam like what's gonna keep the water there yeah it takes a special kind of bottom like when you go to a natural lake like that's that water's pulled up there for a reason like that's an unusual ground you got to realize if you're looking at natural existence of the lake the waters decide to stay there whereas the same amount of water has probably landed everywhere but it's decided to stay there so what the hell's different between that ground and all the other ground around it so when you want to make a pond you just can't make a pond everywhere there's a reason why there's not a pond there it's that's not the kind of ground for a pond right so they'd have to put a liner in oh you got a tame mother it's like taming mother nature almost yeah you have to do something you can't just pour water in there and you got to do something and one of the things that they do in a lot of places they use this really thick koi pond liner it's basically a plastic liner so you got a bullshit-ass fake pawn it's way you got that's gonna look shitty got a above-ground pool yeah you know basically the above-ground pool of ponds it's not even organized you know well once they get the liner in place then they put surface levels of dirt and rocks and stuff over the liner so it looks like a regular pond but the thing is though what's holding the water in place in some places they they'll use those koi pond you ever see you know what a koi pond yeah yeah it's big beautiful got a restaurant yeah they have very thick liner that they use for the base of that shit use that stuff on float tanks to flotation tanks we've floated them oh no I mean yeah her you talked about before well that the liner of those things is the same thing it's koi pond like a liner it's like a real thick durable tough plastic does he feel like you're alive when you're in the tank yeah it feels like you're relaxing you know it's a good feeling feels good on your body just alleviates tension but it also feels like you're in this like meditative state you relax and you think about things better there mmm you get a good good thought of you know what how to look at things from an outside looking in perspective yeah you get a chance to be away from your body really because you're not thinking about your body just floating oh I like that you're not feeling your body at all the water is the same temperature as your skin so it you don't you can't even tell where the water is and where the where your body is oh I like that yeah I just feel like you're flying through the air it's all dark and you don't see anything you don't hear anything cuz your ears are underwater does it feel dead do you feel like you might be dead or not no definitely not I like that you worry about the feeling of dead I'm just worried about how does the fizzing like did your brains keep going you know or whatever it is it keeps us going in art like it when you die yeah like there's our consciousness does it just leave out of this shell and then we're just part of this straight up fucking I think part of the thing is when we're thinking about consciousness we're thinking about language so we're thinking about the way we talk and think about a feeling yeah because I think what we think of as consciousness when I think of it when my own limited mind when I think of consciousness I think of consciousness is me using language to interpret how I feel about different things I have there's a language attached to it I think if something happens when you die and your soul goes to another place let's say a soul is a real thing or consciousness is a real thing I bet it goes there with no language and I bet that's it's real similar I bet to what it feels like when you're really tripping okay when you're on some heavy psychedelics and you just melt into the universe and you you sort of cease to exist on some of them like five Meo DMT you've ever been on that yeah Wow you melt into the center of the universe you feel like you don't exist anymore I bet death and they that feels like you're dying too that's that's it yeah that's a scary one five Meo DMT is a universally disturbing one a lot of people have a problem with that one because it really does feel like you're dying can senior citizens do it or not I think they can yeah I think the only problem would be if you had a heart attack freaked out I think it's toxic because your body makes it your body knows what to do with it too you know your body knows how to bringing you back down to sobriety levels in like 15-20 minutes do you know when you're going into those kind of when you're ill and some of that do you get a feeling that if you're a good or bad person did you get do you get like an aunt that like well I get a feeling if there's things that are bothering you about your behavior you know if you're if you have something that's that's haunting you and maybe with a lot of people it really comes down to life choices not just in terms of like their behavior but even like what they're doing with for a living and how they're living their life and sometimes those experiences these psychedelic experiences can highlight these things that are bothering you but that you're suppressed and then you realize like oh this suppressing of these feelings and thoughts is actually making me lash out in these other ways I've got shitty behavior and I'm aggressive in this way because and it's really because of this Wow it's really because of and then you might you might also come to realization it's about something that happened you were a child or it's about feeling unprotected or unloved as a child and it's just you never develop properly so you never felt totally secure so you want to do something to make you feel secure whether it's drinking or something and then you'll see that in a psychedelic experience you'll be able to like see the root of it better oh wow for a lot of people its cessation of smoking comes from that feeling like oh this is I'm killing myself because I hate myself like I'm literally poisoning myself like how could I not see this and then through having a mushroom experience they've just completely quit really so yeah it's a real common one real common one there's a lot of other stuff that I haven't done that that also like ibogaine is a big one for getting people off drugs it's a huge yeah I heard about that yeah that's a big one that has an amazing success rate but it's supposed to be really brutal and as far as like how you feel like like it runs you through the ring or psychologically uh-huh but when you get through it it's worth it but it's 24 hours fuck and who do you have to go with by yourself there's a lot of clinics that do it particularly in Mexico a lot of people go down to Mexico and go these clinics in their 24-hour clinics of this ibogaine experience JRE field trip but hey man if you have a son and if you like Joe my son's hooked on oxy I don't know what to do I would a hundred percent recommend you do that really yeah because I know so many people that have done it and it's helped them it rewires the way your brain connects to addiction it's really fast it's a fascinating drug Hamilton Morris who is the host of vices Hamilton's pharmacopoeia it's a essentially a show that's all just about drugs hmm he was talking about last week about how fascinating it is and in low doses it actually is like a nootropic it actually enhances your consciousness and low doses make you smarter yeah yeah you know I want to get into some of that kind of stuff but I mean I you know so right now I don't party or anything like that so I struggle with that it's like mana you know because I don't you know it's tough because I do want to be able to be do things that are beneficial for myself and things that I didn't have a problem with but it's all just hard to kind of balance yeah you want to stay sober yeah yeah well you know sobriety is a worthwhile goal and if you can go from being a person who's doing a lot of drugs and ruining their life the person who's like yourself that's on a great path and you're sober and you're disciplined you wouldn't want to break that right you don't want to have that bad feeling but there's ways you can achieve certain psychedelic states without any drugs yeah one of the big ones is yoga and meditation those are two big ones yeah I mean I don't do the kind of yoga that gives you a psychedelic experience I think mostly that's Kundalini Yoga but the kind of yoga that I do that become hot yoga shit it's just this this what it does to your body and chills you out afterwards I think it has a pretty profound effect on the way the world the way you experience the world after the classes is that I think that's something that people don't take into consideration like one way in which you can change the world around you is to change how you interface with the world and how you experience the world how are you viewing it what is your what's your behavior flavored by is your behavior motivated by frustration and and weirdness and insecurity and anger or is your behavior motivated by love and confidence and Happiness and are you like are you quenched physically do you feel good physically yeah and if you do and if you've like experienced like a strong yoga class and then you run into someone you might be more relaxed more compassionate more easily and that that'll change the way that person thinks about you that'll change your interaction with them in the future that might change your whole life yeah and if you continue to act that way and you continue to look at world through the eyes of this this very particular discipline it's really good for your body it really can change people yeah change a lot people it's like there's a definite butterfly effect from that yeah so if you want to just do something for you I'm just meditating man learn how to meditate yeah I just got a new meditation chair actually yesterday so I might have to start giving me be getting into it too why not man I mean if you were interested in doing drugs right why not just be interested in doing something that you know you could definitely do and it's not gonna fuck you up and it's only gonna help you yeah so yeah when you were when you were partying what was your thing just doing cocaine by myself at the house really cocaine yeah it's all cocaine yeah what about booze the booze bother you no I just couldn't have a drink because I'd be afraid that I would buy I would buy a coke so if you got drunks then it would loosen your inhibitions and you'd be like where's the coke what's the fucking coke yeah dude and cocaine oh go back to that vest story man so well here's what happened so I you know I would get I would do some cocaine a thousand put on these different vests did you barn you I don't know I spent too much on him but I would probably say the priciest one I had was probably about $210 nice AM yeah and so I would get fucked up and put these vests on and put on sunglasses and not let no like Buffalo Bill shit but at least partying by myself you know and one time I was making a smoothie you know cuz I you know I have I got like a new one what kind of blender it is but it's pretty nice and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up I'm partying you know I'm living high on the hog two vests on maybe right and I thought I I thought I heard something outside right which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going right so I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway lock myself out with the blender going coked up out of my brain right I have to go to my landlord dude right down the hall tell him like hey man during the morning I got locked out oh my god he must have hated you oh the blender shorts out and smoke happens the fire huh along starts going off in the building right as I'm at his door knocking right so now he's pissed and he's like what's going on and I didn't know what to say I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party dude it was fucking into January how old were you at the time huh two and a half years ago so he comes back to my apartment my god man but that's it it was fine oh my god no that was fine how long did you live there for I still live there whoa yeah we passed you know like I've caught him doing some things how long you been sober for two years in two weeks it'll be two years what was the big thing were you like I gotta get my shit together you doubt was going on opium Jim when hoping Jim Norton had a radio show it's serious and it was actually on it's on Ari's that show that he had this is not happening and I ended up doing coke all night driving a taxi I was in a taxi the driver is dude Luigi got me an escort I didn't want to escort we're doing cocaine in like Harlem or something north-holland the cab driver doing coke and I just had I was taking a cab from a party to my hotel and so we end up off on this other excursion next you know I'm driving the taxi he's in the back with the hooker it's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be on the radio station at you know 6:30 or something so I get to the radio and I can't even talk and uh and Darryl strawberry's the other guest right who's the baseball player who also had drug problem but he's like 13 years soberin so it was this weird moment where like I thought I was kind of cool but then here's a man who like I'd always in my head maybe somewhere thought oh that guy's like a coke head within here he is eloquent put together successful and Here I am I can't even talk and I'm with two men that I admire you know being Jim Norton just to be honored to be on the show you know and so I was like this is um I'm not making choices like there's some there's some unevenness here you know and so what did you do after that two hundred twelve step program join 12-step program yeah and then so yeah so I've been in that then it since then it's helped me out you know well I would definitely say don't do coke yeah the problem with drugs is they're all under the same blanket right you know when someone says drugs you think of everything you think of pills you think of smoking it you think of coke you think of pot you think of mushrooms think of everything yeah but obviously they're not all the same thing you know it's weird to call them all drugs yeah they affect you very differently 100% I don't think if you did mushrooms you would all of a sudden be doing blow and you know yeah I don't think so either in Luigi's cab again right I don't think so either so but I think I wouldn't want to be the guy that told you do no I don't feel like you are but you know I feel like it's something that I think about sometimes and but you know I don't know cuz I also do want to have experiences where like I'm able to get you know unique experiences out of my out of my mind and think about other stuff and like you know I do remember times where mushrooms would just clear my conscience it would be like someone came up to the chalkboard where everybody written all these math problems and bullshit and somebody drawn a dick and to somebody fucking cutting off somebody's head just stupid shit right and just clean it all off and you're like oh no I think so too is relaxing mushrooms forgive you I'll give you for your mistakes I mean this is one of the reasons why like mushrooms and Jesus are always kind of connected in folklore and a lot of people's ideas it's because they're both very forgiving like here's the best Jesus story of someone being forgiving goddamn coughing lump it's the weed um there was a guy named general butt naked you ever heard of that guy real man yeah he lived in Liberia and he's a famous character in Liberia because of his exploits when he was in in the middle of war he would he would go and and fight naked oh wow and he was a cannibal he would kill innocent children on the other side and to eat pieces of their heart and they believed that it would protect him in battle and talks about it openly after doing this he found Jesus he came on him he is this him did you have a look I didn't know either so then he became he I mean he's killed thousands of people oh he's apparently in in war and then according to what he said and then afterwards became a preacher and talks openly about the fact that he's like killed innocent children and eaten pieces of their heart but people forgive him because he's a preacher so his love of Jesus is so complete that people forgive him to the point where they forgive the fact that he ate kids Wow imagine how was if he was your it was your kid that this guy ate then you see him out preaching now I'll be pissed Oh bro you ain't my kid yeah his heart fuck that was a different time yeah I was a different man yeah it's crazy the the four travelers guy I feel it's called the Vice Travel Guide to Liberia it is a really really eye-opening sort of a view into what Liberia is like night Liberia is a really really poor dangerous part of Africa that was originally when slaves left America when they were set free they went back to Liberia and that's where they settled fuck yeah dude I Africa's always fucked up huh yeah that sucks man yeah that's why I'm all these wild animal stories from Africa it's like there's another one that was kind of interesting these poachers got eaten by a lion they tried to get a hold of a rhino they were trying to steal this kill this Rhino and cut its horns off they try to sell him and he just got eaten that's crazy dude dude that's the way to go if you could get an animal organ put into your body would you do it will be the benefit would you get I'd do something nothing like a hyena but I already have the butt of a Down syndrome boy so I don't know what I would get man I would probably get just something I'd start off with something small probably look you know a wrist or something more like a pinky nail once there's a bit splicing genes man then we're gonna be able to do with people you're gonna be like they got Tigard oh it's a guy on a Thundercat remember you gonna be like Thundercat who's but I don't remember that guy with the red mean he was like never tried that I know it's definitely illegal but you think there's a scientist yes right I met a guy why some people with animals fear yeah but wasn't it something we're trying Stalin was trying to do that with chimpanzees yeah he's trying to make some sort of a chimp human hybrid yeah I could see it man I've met some motherfuckers dude some motherfucker yeah well I think they're gonna be able to do something like that soon can you appreciate in that you fucking or talking to somebody and then they just get into a bird bath okay this is that Humanzee thing scientists claim us lab engineer to Manzi human chimp hybrid 100 years ago scientist that is this is a really recent article huh this isn't science alert oh this is the Sun super sketchy right yeah that Humanzee was real weird though that thing walked upright a lot yeah and they wore a suit what is that that's big that's Stalin's Humanzee experiment but that one picture is real that one that one the one next to the one you're at that one that's real that's what it really looked like mm thing walked around with shorts on yeah the side of his quads son that motherfucker will tear you apart yeah the thing I think it got very close to the woman to which became an issue look at that who is that that's the Humanzee Martin's friend yeah look he's doing coke with what does that fuck is that they got from narcosis in the background stop look at that language that's what I'm talking about look at the writing tell me that shit doesn't look alien like that's from some spaceship like what language is that I don't know I'm ready for it all language the Japanese yeah that looks like it should be on yeah don't don't go back there we go that language looks it does look like like it's from space like if you saw that on if you didn't know anything about Asian languages you saw that on a spaceship people like oh do you think Japanese people could be from space and not know that they are the people that are really into nonsense like the zecharia sitchin do you know about all that shit there's people that believe that there is a planet that's out far outside of Pluto that comes it's a no on an elliptical orbit and it comes near earth every like three thousand years or something I forget the exact number but it's called Nibiru and on Nibiru there are these people called the Anunnaki and what they are is an alien race mmm and that this alien race engineered us and they took they took these old monkeys like ancient hominids and then they added their DNA to him and created a human being this is the idea and then there's this guy Zecharia Sitchin wrote all these books on this stuff and there's a lot of people who think he's full shit but it's interesting it's fun it's fun too it's fun to speculate you know but the idea was that different groups of people got different level of alien hmm yeah I could yeah well look sometimes I'm talking to somebody I'm like I don't think this dude is like a full person you know like who who do we know don't tell em mm I don't know if it's anybody that we know um I mean Josh Martin networks this house takes me for a ride but I don't imagine if there was one just living amongst us oh the whole time we just get our chain yanked oh I bet I'm sure there's some chick out there that's fucked an alien I think when I really think about it I think that that would be the first in breeding would be a chick would let an alien fucker it would be a dude who fucked an alien girl oh no I think now these days there's I could see some women fucking some aliens well isn't that some of the folklore though some of the stories of male alien abduction are like female aliens that seduce them yeah that's how they get your loads bro dude off species I've been give him rides up for free sign Natasha Hendricks right is that her last name and Strich Hendricks how do you say it and Strich Henstridge so they said how many loads can your body make you she was on fear factor she's very nice she's a very nice person oh really you met her yeah she did an episode of fear factor hottest fuck Wow Forest Whitaker was in that movie oh I love Horace Whitaker damn Ghost Dog I'll listen the hustler and he's in no hassle King of Scotland he was in the color of money not the hustler you know a movie I like is um that movie where they escaped from the mental health facility and Michael Keaton's in it and it's like four dudes and they go to a baseball game you remember that movie no I think it makes me think you probably wouldn't be able to make that movie today yeah oh yeah cuz a mental health facility or some people be upset well there was always dudes in movies that would play there was guys that would play someone who was mentally challenged yeah that's a common thing dudes would always do it didn't Sean Penn play someone yeah I am saying challenged yeah great Dustin Hoffman did he do it oh that's right Wayne man Rosie O'Donnell Oh Dustin Hoffman was probably the first guy to play a super autistic man yeah and he did great Rosie O'Donnell did it too right I think so man that's the last thing you want your enemies finding out dude imagine the outtakes really start laughing imagine the outtakes if you start laughing you monster and nowadays you have to have a real person with the disease on the side of the stage so like the consult yeah is that real yeah that's crazy man come on really I'm sure you think they're letting you do that without having somebody there to verify if it's legit or not well how would someone verify whether or not like like like it's someone gonna come up and go that's that's not how I do it I just that's Rosie let me hear this let's try just made that up why didn't you wait inside riding the bus with my sister because you can't see me in there I have your address honestly you just make things harder on yourself buckle up for safety whoa pretty good I wonder if you could do that movie today you might not be able to do it like 12 years ago yeah but that's a different world man different world man you can't even barely breathe out there do you know it's tough right but um dude I can't believe I'm going to China in there you wonder what you can do anything can you do anything as far as like comedy material oh my dress no I mean I'll just think of all the different stuff they have animals are treated differently there oh that's true you know right but I think like you get in trouble if you like Google certain websites like they have a different version oh yeah they're censored yeah yeah I'm not gonna do anything drastic like that crazy gets censor a billion people how the hell'd you do that that's pretty impressive dude I remember going when I was a student we went to Cuba when I was a student in college right now I remember we went to a bookstore and all the books just started at like a certain year and that was it like there was no you imagine that and it was like in the nineteen whatever yeah when Castro took over me like Che Guevara this is going on today in China World Cup kiss sparked social media debate on sexual harassment in China oh wow why uh he's a male reporter in these to Russian fans gave him a kiss while he was repairing and it's caused like a reverse sexual harassment debate and trans prion it's a big deal wow he looks so what's a big deal that in China someone like you're not allowed to show public affection like that is that what the big debate is here's a it came after a bunch of female journalists have been assaulted and so they started assaulting the dude the other way around oh um I'm gonna go out on a limb he's gonna be okay he looks fine he looks actually better in kissed on the cheek by attractive women they're not hurting them they can't rape him I think he's gonna be okay let's watch homeboy get mauled by these hot Russian broads here it goes mwah kiss no nothing nothing he's fine laughing okay we're done he's laughing we're done stop this people are fucking crazy the guy's laughing he thought it was cute yeah why would anybody make a deal out of that it's a zero tolerance that girl literally had a plastic red cup in her hand which is the universal sign for being fucked up in public yeah if you got that plastic red cup in your hand that chicks probably lit she kissed that guy yeah he thought it was cute they didn't move him around or push him or assault him there's a friendly gesture on the cheek that's love I think why are we trying to shut down people and join each other I don't think we are anymore I think I think things are actually think things are getting in a lot better place and it's just all in the media it seems like they're not sometimes you know wellthank that that seem like they're not the fact that someone's making a big deal out of that yeah that's true you can't look you can't compare that to a bunch of guys doing that to a girl it's not the same it's not devastating the guy's gonna be fine it is different men and women are different in that case that is a very clear-cut case of no one got hurt yeah did they interrupt his broadcast perhaps did they ruin what he was trying to say and this I don't know what he might had a serious message and these Russian broads come over and kiss him on the cheek maybe they fucked up his little project and what he's trying to accomplish yeah but there's no crime there that's not a crime it's not the same if that was a bunch of dudes doing that to a pretty girl yeah some gorilla looking fucking football player fucking corn-fed Iowa boys came over and kissed her who what what are they doing remember when they were trying to make it a big deal because Katy Perry kissed some guy on American Idol yes remember that is like two months ago yeah she kissed some boy had never kissed a boy she kissed him she brought him over and kissed him there was like oh well what if worth Katy Perry wasn't man what if that was a girl yeah she's not stop she's Katy Perry and if that guy is really complaining that Katy Perry took her kiss I'm suing my kids for something to growl at me dude no one's gonna love you shut the fuck up if you can't appreciate Katy Perry kissing you oh she's pretty too he's pretty and more people will love that man because Katy Perry kissed him Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry oh he shut down the Katy Perry backlash he kissed her to listen nothing wrong with that look at him first of all homies gay right is he look at him he could be from Idaho who shot him and he fell down that is not a male mood that's not oh he could be okay it might be he's avoiding that kiss until he really did find the woman that made him feel like he wanted to be kissed and maybe she stole that from him yeah see right here imagine of a 33 year old male artist tricked a 19 year-old female auditioner and do a kid's like Katy Perry well imagine that's a different thing you fuck how about you imagine that's a whole different thing yeah don't pretend that men and women are the same fucking assholes imagine a Volkswagon fuck your stepmom what are we doing not the same thing everybody's okay that Chinese guy was laughing man oh he probably jerked off to the video at the house Oh multiple times I'm going to fucking China to ask them something totally a different fruit over there give it a vacuum they have different fruit in Brazil they have different fruit in England you get some different fruit fuck man excited I'm excited I guess I'm nervous but I'm also excited how many shows you doing over there I'm doing three shows but you know uh and I've you know I I don't know about to promote you know it's just a guy hit me up literally over email and like oh wow it's a Nixie no I'm going but next thing you know you got a ballgame now tie it up at a basement under a noodle shop somewhere hey as long as I get to eat after Jesus Christ are you looking forward to the food no man no do you not like Chinese food I mean I like about dude just somebody told me that you can eat animal dicks over there you can eat fucking elbow you were saying they could eat human dicks I think you're just joking around though right I don't know honestly think about it think what else you went over there and they said we heard you on experience and we have a hockey rink and will prepared to put on the lion fight are you prepared to watch which if they brought to you to a place and I said a dude's gonna fight online with a sword you could leave if you like yeah would you stay I would stay yeah you'd have to I would oh it to them if the man's already gonna fight and I'm the only imagine he comes out to fight a minute no but is it the fucking the stadium well you would have to be able to trust the people that are there that they're gonna let this guy get ripped apart by a lion in front of you and then get rid of a body yeah would you eat during it or would you wait to eat after because the guy depends on a hungry nose if they got my weight yeah if the guy looks over in your fucking eating eating a hot dog well this guy's getting mauled and he looks something he makes eye contact like say are you just saying that muster on your face and shit our crowd the teeth drinking a beer his head oh Jesus bartender do that well yeah talk about like that movie Gladiator with Russell Crowe hmm what is that supposed to be how long ago was that was it split based that was like a thousand years ago yeah I think it was like 980 I'm guessing or 2 mm mm-hmm shit dude that ain't that long it's set in Roman times so could we get back there you think all around was exactly yeah thank man says that's not that long ago people were fuckin ad 100 180 180 ad I was in Rome a couple years back and I went to the Colosseum it's fucking amazing man it's crazy to be there just to feel it and then most of its missing mm-hmm like they stripped down a lot of the stone and people stole things from it and it's like it's all dilapidated and falling apart but they wanted to Louis they take you through the catacombs and they sort of explain all the different things but they had these animals they'd gotten from Africa and they had kept them in the but see that hole in the ground that's really real that's really how they did it man these animals would come out of a fucking hole in the ground and you see that first layer of people the first seat the first row seats they had to put up fucking fences and shit because the Tigers would leap through the air and kill the people that are in the first row stub people up those StubHub those season pass holders imagine you get that nice ticket and you fight your buddy you get up to get a soda and you come back and your buddies just in pieces dude though just the fact that people did do stuff like that we did that it's in us do you know that that's what's crazy man that's your show makes me think about stuff like that like that there's DNA inside of us that remembers that well I think when people get into situations where they need entertainment and back then right like would you rather go to a play or see a dude to have a sword fight against a tiger tiger yeah all day depends on what plays are boring couple plays would be good what what playing Neverland maybe if you I mean if there's a line and on the left you get to see a guy fight a lion with a sword and on the right you see a bunch of people pretend to be cat bitch I'm gonna go see that guy get eaten you know watch it's terrifying to watch but the the shock and the the just the entertainment value before death yeah we got tickets to be the worst good stories have been written yet so what the hell do you think they were doing they had plays I mean they had great stories I'm sure they had great stories but it's not as good like and also the value of human life was so much lower than right people were constantly going to war and then with the war that they fought they fought with bows and arrows and Spears and swords so there's just bloodiness horrible bloody this probably four or five dead people on the street at the moment so maybe you're like I'm not gonna go see somebody else die in there we need to see this play and part of the problem was like the way they got rid of her - right like the streets would be contaminated with shit you should have buried it like we did around my neighborhood imagine the the the blowback if someone in some country did put together a Coliseum and then people started travelling there and it became like the new hot spot well if I lived in Africa I would do that because it's you know I know that some places are so starved they have so many animals I think they have a lot of people who believe in reincarnation well just do it a million dollars to have a sword fight if you had a purse of a million dollars for someone have a sword fight and they give him a shield and armor and a sword and a helmet they're gonna have a sword fight with a tiger people would sign up for that I mean I feel like you would know almost better than anybody cuz you guys spend you spend more time around you know the closest kind of thing maybe we have to some type of gladiators modern day what do you think would any of those men do it yeah yeah people would do it what is this Jamie 2011 man fights lion to boost Egypt tourism what come on yeah come on this is real sitting in there with a little plastic lawn chair he's got a shield it's got a spear the shield is a shadiest fault what and the fuck dude hell yeah a lot of room either not a giant lion but is this this actually happened a hundred percent live like recorded videos on CBS News Jesus Christ this guy get jacked or what and this isn't it's not showing it it must not have been a long fight and it was probably subdued the attack it's obviously happening if this guy recorded then it's probably I'm Jay escaped he had to do like a two minutes or something with it I bet yeah the line seems fine he's gonna climb on top he's a winner yeah he's gonna do like a fucking cage drop drop down on that line imagine that the balls you'd have to leap down with a spear and drive it through the lion's brain from the top rope play spray all over the place you could do it someone would do it if that dummy got in there with that lion you could definitely get if you gave someone a million dollars yeah he gave them a shield and a sword and an armor give him some armor not all armor yeah peace lion would leap on you so fast your soar to be knocked out of your hand it would just crush your fucking head with its teeth but one man would do it yeah one man would win maybe the the mountain from Game of Thrones the Giant dude yeah give that guy like a battle axe like a fucking 85 pound axe who we do it in UFC who would who do you think could win and it's not saying that the greatest of the best but who could do that you'd have to be the biggest guys it has to be like the heavyweight champ would have to be like Stevie Miocic or Francis and Ghana or someone giant it would have to be a big powerful person because you'd have to be able to swing that fucking sword fast and you have to be able to take a hit I'm a 500 pound cat you're probably gonna get fucked up either way though you need what you met yet if you able to take one good hit like you're gonna take one good hit um I just feel like you're just gonna get fucked up I just don't think you have a chance there's a lot of debates about this when I was reading it earlier of course people there's a lot of people just as stupid as me and Theo the line wouldn't have a good technique for you it doesn't matter if it has good technique the physical power of a lion it's just so overwhelming I just don't think people understand how much force it can generate how quickly can move how quickly you get you it'd be box it would just fucking spray on you it would be on you so fast dude there's a video hilarious video of a bunch of dudes running away from me in comparison a leopard is what hundred fifty pounds or something like that and these fucking people are running left and right and this thing's coming after them and you realize like oh my god like look at this this guy running now watch the leper take the corner look just look at he slides the leopard is going so fast it's running on the walls on the top like the middle of the wall above his fucking head watch how as he starts running forward and the leopard comes into the picture the leopard is literally running on a vertical wall look watch this watch when it comes around the corner look at this it's running on the wall it's got so much power that it's running on the side of the wall like you can't even imagine the kind of physical speed and strength that that thing has in its body it's bouncing from the side of the wall to the other side of the wall and just trying to get some traction so he could get a hold of your bitch ass damn no way to get ahold of your bitch ass you don't have a chance that thing mmm that's a fraction of the size of a lion just a fraction fuck man oh Jesus Christ listen to school oh no this is a video game isn't it look at it climb over the top of that fence like it ain't shit this one of those video games on the dark web I think hmm middle school leopard dude you find that thing you just gotta shoot it you just gotta shoot it there's not much you could do oh it's fucking this dude up oh Jesus Oh oh my god the board they just bit him and then ran off he got lucky yeah he got lucky that there's all those other people in the commotion and 4 million people have watched I so would it so as people we're ready to see that yeah 4 million people have safely washed out and they're not crying at a center right now or anything like that yeah but watching that doesn't seem real you know we watched that if you were there in real life mm-hmm like if you're in that hockey rink mm-hmm sit in those excellent gold star seats we're in Mexico I think you're in China somewhere yeah but China this is how it got the guy Wow coming around here I try to climb the fence gotcha Wow look at your bag him down oh my god what do you do it just wants to get out it doesn't know what it wants right it doesn't know what the fuck it wants do you jump in the water do you think they swim swim oh well that's not good you think he's bleeding or not oh yeah he's getting his legs his arms his legs everything's getting torn up all that shit's on the ground that's blood that's his blood I don't want that on there you definitely don't like that I just think we really need to understand when you thought you're talking about a large predatory animal really didn't need to understand what bitches we are the toughest man that's ever lived is a weak-ass bitch compared to a leopard just a fact oh Jesus Lee this one fuck man who's doing all this oh I've seen this one this is in India right yeah it happens in these areas and these cats they get into these villages and just start fucking people up that's so crazy imagine that and it's a small animal and compared to a lion in comparison anything else to you before we wrap this bitch up bring it home I think I've seen enough today well I hope you realize that uh if you're ever in a confrontation one of those animals that's gonna be difficult yeah do you realize that have that in your mind now yeah I think it's not a game as much as I thought it was you know there's more of a game well I think this I think it would be neat to go out and hunt some type of an animal with a knife to start to get my guard up hunt an animal with a knife do you think you could even hunt a raccoon with a knife yeah do you think you could 150 percent do you think the raccoon might fuck you up though fuck no man how quick do you think a raccoon moves like if you don't get that first stab into that like that you do that double up how long do you think it takes before that thing is latched to hold at your face claw in your eyeballs out of your fucking head and you're feeling your eyeballs getting shot out of your skull because it tears through your tissue paper thin lids like they're nothing and it's just biting luck man chewing your eyes out no I think if it got on you well the the tough part is if it gets on you you can't stab it because you'll stab yourself this is Kevin Rose this is Kevin Rose got a raccoon chucked it down the stairs titty yeah he fucked that rock coming up the raccoon was fucking his dog up that's a guy who loves his dog yeah he said he didn't even realize he was doing it he was just doing it before even it was happening but look how he did it he hooked it like a like a pillow wolf bitch BAM damn mm-hmm yeah they went after it it's a gangster I go out that's pretty gangster yeah what's probably like you said it's just that's a that's natural instinct that's the basic entry instinct of a man you know well what I was saying was what those guys were talking about when they encountered that grizzly bear they just you reach this survival mode you have your regular operating system and then there's survival default mode when some real shit goes down fucking grizzly bears right next to you well I would hate that and well I think that you know going back to like we were saying earlier like that's the moment you'd find out who you are and I would hate to find out at that moment that I'm not a fighter you know well that that all could be built up right you can build that up through martial arts right that you like there's people that are just naturally inclined to never quit and then there's people that have to learn it but you can learn it yeah yeah I want to start learning some of it to have just a little bit more that um just to fill in whatever that space inside of me is sometimes that feels a little bit inferior I don't need to feel invincible invincible no but I do I wouldn't mind getting a little caulk in some of those areas where it's like okay if somebody grabs me like I I know that I'll be able to grab them back right yeah man take your Jitsu it's easy you already know Eddie yeah yeah why not man come on take some beginner classes start slow it's fun to men you really enjoy it as long as and you're a healthy guy like mentally like as far as your ego as long as you don't try to not tap yeah no I don't need to win I've just be I think I'd be happy to have the camaraderie yeah and I would be I think that's happening is probably some humility very good for you it is definitely it's just hard to do okay especially you know when you're in the beginning you'll try to resist you try to resist an armbar that maybe you should tap and you can get hurt mmm that's how you can get hurt you get hurt from not tapping especially other beginners they don't know how har like a black belt you're more safe rolling with a black belt than with anybody is that they're gonna be able to tap you if they want to and when they do they're not gonna hurt you right whereas like someone you might get in there with some Herculean white belt who's just learning the techniques he grabs hold of your arms like fucking Yanks on it you don't even have a chance to tap yeah and you're hurt and you're hurt right yeah that's a good point I think yeah maybe I'll see if that he can help me out to get me he can yeah he can dude last night was weird at the Comedy Store wasn't it dude it was so weird they fourth of July is a strange night to perform people like why are we here and you're like why are you here it was a weird crowd it was a great crowd you're good but they they they also felt odd that they were at a show yeah I didn't realize it until you said that you're like you're like yeah these people are thinking it's fourth of July with the fucking hundred a comedy show it's not wrong it's not right but it's just like does my calendar even work the weirdest crowd you'll ever experience is Christmas yeah you ever do Christmas shows at the store yeah I did one Christmas show the store like ten years ago I'm like well I'm taking this night out for the rest of my life fuck crowds weird man they were weird it was more than 10 years ago cuz it had to be like 2006 you had fun no you haven't it wasn't weird Oh last night yeah last night was fun last time fun yeah got a good time but it's just it's a different feeling but I think people are feeling differently about comedy now because so many people are really politically correct outside of comedy and almost forced into it like you're hearing so many things about people getting fired from their jobs because of sexual harassment or from a sexually harassing joke like someone would say jokes in the office that were inappropriate and so they got fired and this is happening left and right hear about the guy from Netflix that got fired for doing yeah he's having a car conversation about offensive words that you shouldn't be using in comedy and because of this conversation during this conversation about this subject he used the word nigger right because he was in this conversation did it one other time apparently because of that not calling anybody that saying it out loud yeah I was fired from Netflix that is crazy unless if he was saying it like he like is having a good time right like he was like you know right now like how was he saying it was that's the thing right but the thing is it's very strange that that word is only forbidden by the people that can't it can't be used on right you can't use the n-word on you work but if you can use it on someone and they happen to be a person of color then that person you're not allowed to do that right it's very interesting man well I remember when I would go when I would ride my bike to school a lot of my black friends would get on my bike you know and they'd get on and I would ride I mean it was fun you know and they used to call me the nigger bus whenever I rolled up I never doll call me that and I honestly felt and they were my friends it was fun right so but you couldn't say it you know and I could I couldn't say it and also look I find you know when somebody says anything if it's something to do with a race a gender anything and they have malice or ill intent and these days I think if you do that somebody's gonna correct you really fucking quick and so I agree and in a bit but in a business setting man and that type of setting it's just yeah you you make people so aware that they can't I don't know that's it is it is crazy but it's also he was talking about forbidden words and calm right it's his business right like you're saying he can't make a sound with his mouth yeah this is what you're saying you're not he's not calling someone that name right he's using that word and people filed complaints about him using that word so the people that he worked with ratted him out but he wasn't just allowed to say the word right like but the correct then then it gets real crazy whereas if you're a black guy you could say it all day and it's funny yeah you'd say it in front of white people and they can laugh right but they can't say it but they can't say they can't say it yeah but I view Chris Rock you can go up at the ORR tonight and just have like 15 different use of that word in a half-hour set yeah and no and everyone's like that was great yeah that was a great show right but then yeah but then it'll be the same people that say we should never say or hear this word it's interesting some people learn it from different places some people learn it from black people some people learn it from white people it has a different feel a different meaning to it well and I was even talking with mr. Peterson the other day who and I was saying you know the toughest thing I find especially come from the area I came from were you know there was a lot of racism was probably kind of went it was popular when I was young but it was a part of the it was part of the tip of the cloth and there in the area you know it's poor black and poor white and bright you know poor people like to fucking fight you know it's caused everything it's like yeah it's like hey let's be on the same team for a minute you know and we can change the love that bit you have about white privilege oh thanks man hilarious bit thing but did you did you find it fun talking to someone like Peterson does it was it challenging it was challenging I felt nervous you know I felt nervous because you know I'm not as smart as him you know most people aren't right but I also felt you know I know that you know he really admired you he mentioned in the beginning so that made me feel a little bit more comfortable because we had something in common and then and then he's a nice guy and I thought he is a I tried as much as I could to I wasn't trying to pick him a part of the thing I just wanted to see what he cared about and he just genuinely I swear to God I genuinely maybe more than anyone I've ever met he genuinely I think cares about trying to help young men feel better yeah for in that you know we didn't get into anything political or anything like that it was mostly about you know like take a small step take a small step and you can change your life you know if you have a if you have accurate goals well he's a real clinical psychology yes and he understands the traps that the mind leaves for itself yeah and we all fall into those traps yeah we all do yeah and I've fallen into a lot of them and and you know it so it was nice I mean I you know I was you I I'm I think of him as like I thought a Guevara like you know like Che Guevara but like Canadian K like I wanted to tell him that so bad enough for God but you know che guevara is supposed to be a murderous monster right and he's not like that he's not like a socialist like that but um but he you know what he's like that he's kind of like the dad that a lot of us didn't hear and we need to hear again and it's like we need those reminders of some of those things and and I think he genuinely to me he genuinely wants humanity to be well that's what I felt for me it does but the thing is when you want men to feel better women will think you want them to feel bad and this is the problem that we have with this whole right versus left male versus female black versus Y anytime there's two groups and they're supposedly pitted against each other anything positive for one side becomes negative for the other side but I think it's the opposite I think that if men feel better they'll be nicer to women and I think that if they get their shit together it's better for everybody and I think that if someone's looking for men's like look at men's values or men's lives they're not disregarding women but we look at it that way like know you should be paying attention to women you're obviously a misogynist you're focusing on men's right it's like there's a it's an insult to call someone an MRA which is a men's rights activist it's kind of hilarious you know like what is with but like if someone was a women's rights activist would you ever say there would be an insult to call someone a woman's right activist or an advocate that's crazy now but it's openly dismissed from the feminine side making fun of the masculine side like men's rights activists are openly dismissed yeah really it's very strange yeah I like to think you know I I get to meet a lot of women's rights activists and look the strongest the hardest-working man I've ever known was my mother you know and I'll say that to the end of the earth I mean my mother delivered newspapers since I was born still does you know and and she sacrificed a lot of raising her children she wasn't there for us emotionally because she had to work all the time right you know she didn't even have she did have the opportunity to be but you want to talk about a feminist like I never known one more in my life I don't think you know she had to play a man and a woman you know in a lot of in a lot of instances and I that's great that you appreciate her oh I love it to the end but they mean so much to you yeah and we start even like I started doing this thing we're like we try and like treat a single mom out to like a weekend when I'm out on a weekend of shows you know pay for the sitter pay for the dinner you know and and not to object a single dad's you know but you know for me like I uh you know like I was even talking with mr. Peterson about this like I never got to make like the reason I think I got in economy I never got to make my mom laugh you know like she was always suzhou is tired she was always working hard and tired and we just didn't have that connection mm-hmm you know and so I think that's one of the reasons I got in the county the only person I've ever really probably wanted to make laughs as my mother don't know and then Here I am like just doing all this other chicanery on the outside did your mom think that you were funny when you were when you first started I don't know no I don't think he I don't think she thought of anything like that my mom literally said to me I just don't think you're very funny Oh mom dude I saw that young the video the young video usually comedy with the longest hair on the sides and stuff yeah I was a little cutie dude that was the best but it was a really cool video I was probably like 24 23 Wow maybe 23 1 2 3 yeah somewhere in that range man crazy but I think I'd like to you know a lot of some of these do you know aggressive sometimes angry feminists they're not mothers either I mean that's odd to me like you know people get you know they get into something because they feel there's an imbalance yeah and if it's true feminism or they get into being a men's rights activist I feel bad for those guys because I think a lot of those guys have just been fucked over by bad relationships or shitty divorces or you know shitty laws in terms of like child custody and then they you know this is their the response it's what we would really like is for everyone to be treated as an individual yeah and and and no groups no male versus female no fucking right versus left just all human beings individuals and I think that's like the ultimate goal for a society for a healthy society it's not to not eliminate judging people but judge people based on their actions and their words and their deeds hmm not their sex or their you know but then you're always gonna have people that want to fuck the opposite sex and you're always gonna have people that want to fuck the same sex too and make them uncomfortable like I've been hit on by dudes before it and been made to feel very uncomfortable yeah I'm sure you have to the only difference is I know how to fight and when a dude was hitting on me I was like listen cut the shit like this wasn't a scene where you know I was worried I was gonna get raped it was I was worried I was gonna go to jail for fucking somebody up right I don't want to have to hurt you man but don't touch my dick again right I've been in situations before but it was never a situation where I was like a woman where I was worried I was gonna get held down and someone's gonna do something too right but you can understand them when those situations like I can easily see how women feel that way like way worse yeah way worse yeah I get that too it's like I'll get like dick pics and stuff from men into my instagrams and stuff bro and it's fuckin like Oh some dudes are aggressive with it but that's nice six-zero did he fix zero well you're gonna get them right now they come people feel bad for Theo there's something bold about a girl should send you a picture of her tits this guy sends a picture of his dick a sumptuous fuck a girl's sending you something you're excited to see yes like if a girl sends you pictures of her tits and she's holding I'm she was like I heard you wanted these you're like whoa those real this is crazy yeah I need a Gatorade yeah somebody gets those like oh but sexually harassed by this woman shot mouths fuck up you're fine pussy walk it off dude I yeah it's so it's so true that but I dunno I start to notice how people feel I start to notice how yeah when that happens like I'll see how you feel I see now see how women feel if they get that you get there's a door that you could look through where you could see a mile away maybe where this could go right but to be the person that feels that like a dude once the stick is digging you and shoot loads into your body that's crazy it's wait video game that's you know that's the difference between men and women yeah and this is also why there's more anger because women have experienced so many guys trying to do that to them that they develop this bad taste for men and I understand that and we need to be better man you know and I believe that in an honesty that's one of the reasons why you know I listen to your show it's one of the reasons why you know I'm excited you know I was intrigued to listen to mr. Peterson and reading his book and you know I do want to be a better man and it's harder you want to be a better human being whoever you are yeah we all want to do better and if you don't want to do better you're probably gonna have a fucked up life because then you're not trying you're not perfect it's no way you're perfect no one who's ever lived has been perfect I mean every one day yeah and every day you have to pay attention every day you got to pay attention every day to your behavior to the way you think and you have to constantly being us be assessing it and moving it in the right direction and when you are moving it in a positive generous loving direction it feels better you feel better yeah you feel like a better person yeah you really yeah you really do you know I'm glad that um yeah I'm just glad to be like alive and be able to like try and like learn about shit it is exciting you know it is exciting and you know I think one of the things that fucks people up more than anything this is what I've experienced this with so many friends like dude you're thinking about your past like it's you and it's not mmm you've you can't beat yourself up for something you did 20 years ago or the way you were you know doing coke and fucking your life up five years ago that's not you anymore yeah like you did do those things yeah but that doesn't mean you are who you want that you're you're not that person anymore yeah like as long as you decide but if you get caught in that trap you'll be that person again yeah a person again I mean there's we all know that one dude that can't stop can't stop he takes a few months off I'm sober enough now everything's doing good and then whoo off to the races again shows up coked up drunk comes the commies door won't shut the fuck up breathing shit breath and everybody's face like Jesus sweat dripping off his earlobes seven fingers in his ass we all know that dude there's so many of those dudes yeah they just can't they never break free they break for you for a little while and never go wow I don't want to be that person anymore they just go well I'm not that person this week and then you know they just get addicted to being sober for a little while and then next thing you know there's Dark Arts dark Horus why do you call it dark just because it's anything that thing takes you out of like your path towards like some sort of enlightenment a little bit mmm that's what I think you know Dark Arts they got in Harry Potter like Voldemort and everybody you doing dirty spells like his bro turning candy and the worms and everything right yeah anything that takes you off of the path of enlightenment yeah is the dark arts that's most things don't write most times you're jerking off oh yeah arts yeah I've come with myself so many times bro right and when you do do you ever feel good about it do you ever feel like yeah that's what sometimes season like occasionally gonna four days bro not even joking sometimes during the holidays I'm just so filled with joy that the shame doesn't get me do you know that it actually does alleviate anxiety and people recommend doing it before you have a performance you have to perform in front of people yeah it's not a bad idea whack one off and your hotel room before you go to a show you'd be like less anxious I could see that maybe maybe for like a special or something you know diovan that was just three hours was it really Wow or more than three hours how long was it 320g is the longest conversation I've ever been in this fucking room dude something happens in this place I don't know even know how it works Theo Vaughn calm Theo von on Twitter or Theo von on Instagram when you're on the road next I'm actually gonna be in Oxnard tonight through yeah life that's a great club is it I've never been oh you're gonna love it it's great it's a sweet setup it's fucking awesome crowd they're pumped something's out there yeah you know it's like a mini Bakersfield oh wow closer I like that's the closer though I'm excited dude I'm gonna try that Brazilian Jujitsu and I might fuck your cutter knife fight a raccoon let's see won't you better leave the raccoons alone okay get into that jujitsu son yeah oh all right we'll be back next week you freaks bye thanks [Music]
