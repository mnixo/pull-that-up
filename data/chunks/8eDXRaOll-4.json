hello freak bitches well it's like we're talking about virtual reality we're like how long before they made a porn I mean yeah when the moment they came up with oculus we knew yeah it's a matter of time yeah matter of time and they did it and they did it it is going to create some fucking hilarious earthquakes and a lot of different relationships and marriages because people are going to have to define whether or not fucking a hologram is a form of infidelity like you're gonna have to make a rule for that in your relationship is it okay to fuck a hologram not alive not a person but looks like it's fucking you looking you right in the eyes right in the fucking eyes oh my god yeah it's pretty weird because your brain when a hologram is looking at you in the eyes in a loving way your brain doesn't reject it it's like oh wow I think this girl really likes me oh wait it's a hologram but in one millisecond you get this feeling of like strange connection which is and again we're in the most rudimentary parts of VR only apparently only I just read this it might have been a dated article but only a hundred thousand people are so own an HTC vive if that's drastically off you guys I'm sorry but not a lot of people have VR goggles right now so not a lot of people and there's a lot of us who are fucking ear beating people at parties who'd clearly just don't want to hear about it any more than you want to hear about someone talking about it dream but there's a huge group of people right now that are having some of the most psychedelic mind-bending experiences through technology and they can't even talk about it or describe it to people because when you describe it it's like you're talking about a dream but you're like no this is happening to a lot of us right now we're going into alternate dimensions via technology and hey out there enjoying it experiencing the freedom from the confines of being constantly in it infinitely located in whatever physical space your body happens to be inhabiting to suddenly remove that weight and I can pop these things on and instantly translocate to some art universe that some geniuses created fuck around shoot arrows wander through Minecraft have sex with two girls who I was apparently going to throw out of my house if they didn't fuck me that's what the point is high but in this universe I guess that's what I do yeah so they kind of rapey what it's not rapey it's just like please I don't have money for the rent can I suck your dick oh you know it's her idea oh yeah you're not type you're not raping so it's not like look you got you got to give up some pussy either otherwise I'm taking you to this tree you could say it if you want into the porn I mean you could say whatever you want wait you tell you have a microphone yeah I'm a microphone but you can talk to it if you want to be a weirdo but ok how long before you can talk to it how long before it talks back to you well that's you're gonna look you're looking at like so we got to figure out a way to either I mean I imagine that probably exists in some rudimentary way for some kind of CGI style porn but to be able to like instantaneously communicate with live video porn you're gonna need some kind of AI that I don't think we probably have just yet or we are probably on the print but yes that will have to come oh that's definitely gonna happen I've watched ex machina again on the plane the other day I watched it for the second time that's cause it's just as good the second time that movie freaks me out man why because the girls so beautiful and she's so she's so attractive like you know that guy you could see as much as he knew that she was a robot as much as he knew that he wasn't a robot as much as he knew that she was artificial he was in love with her and she was amazing and it seemed like she cared about him and when she was talking to him for real like when the lights went and the camera was down spoiler alert and she was like don't trust him yeah I'm like this is like a real person yes a real person she's thinking like a person it's a person yeah and he's like completely locked into this idea that it's a person he's hypnotized it's a person I mean I don't this whole distinction between artificial intelligence and intelligence is the same as the distinction between virtual reality and reality it's just like another human attempt to be in control of something you want you want to say oh I'll tell you if this is fucking reality or not oh this is virtual reality this isn't reality reality but it's like oh really so reality is compartmentalized into places where there's if something is created by a human oh no that's not real reality even though humans are reality realities reality intelligence is intelligence because the intelligence is inhabiting something that isn't the human vessel it goes back to what we were talking about earlier what because it's not in a fucking meat body now it's artificial intelligence how is why intelligence is intelligence here's my weirdness about all this you know we were talking about language and the limitations of language and the eventualities of reality and I wonder how we're going to digest data and information in a virtual world like if people decide like what if you decide that you want to read books in a virtual world yeah and this is how you want to read books the way you want to read books is with your feet up on the couch in your mansion in a virtual world all these girls around you like finger-banging themselves with high heels on and queens fat bottomed girls you make it rockin world go round' plays in the background share and you get to sit down and read books in a virtual world yeah what happens then like what what happens when you're watching movies in a virtual world well then that's why that would be student same as streaming I think the movies would be they would exist I think movies in a virtual world look they're definitely coming right and they're gonna you're gonna exist in the world like you're not gonna sit down and watch them with it no they have a great theory theaters and VR now you can sit down put on a movie and watch it on unlike a massive screen and VR there Howard don't you think why do they do that as their limitations in the medium where they can't have it the movie play out in front of you like if you want to see jaws right let's know it's kind of nice to watch a movie floating in space I don't mind that the virtue of you there's an app called virtual desktop where you like you put on your VR goggles and suddenly your desktop is wrapped around you a giant screen giant screen wrapped around you that you then can like pull up any kind of movie you might want to watch and so you just like you can sit in there and if you look down you see space yeah that's it virtual desk that now the problem with VR when you look at that the problem with VR on like people looking at it on the internet is it you cannot convey how fucking cool it looks right from looking at it that way right like it is suddenly there's this massive thing in front of you the space look real what the space look real it it looks real enough pretty I wouldn't say that I mean I would say really realistic I think they're probably some there's got to be by now some 360 videos that are actually from from Hubble but it looks good enough for you're like this is fucking incredible well what's the benefit of like they're just watching and you play a video game what's the benefit of playing a video game on a screen in a virtual world instead of playing the video game in the virtual world well I think but honestly in that case I don't know like I started a game up in there it's like fuck this you see what I'm saying here because like he's clicking and menus and stuff he's using it like a computer yeah I think it's uh I don't know if the benefit is the right thing to look for there it's just it's just badass to like suddenly be completely immersed in a new environment doing like whatever the work is that you want to do though with virtual desktop I just use it to watch documentaries what I'm thinking is like would you rather like okay like they're perfect example you're looking at a screen right here clearly a floating screen if you watch jaws in that floating screen that would not be as good as if you were sitting and you're living when you're looking down you were on the boat with Roy Scheider who's like we're gonna need a bigger boat oh you mean like if there was like a VR Jaws yes oh yeah that'd be fucking cool it just doesn't exist yet right but that's what I'm saying like that's gonna happen right of course yeah that'll definitely happen for sure no question and when they do things like that like will you be able to enjoy other things in that world like will you be able to go into that world like you were in the Swiss Alps where they are in a fake world would you be able to go to this place and put on an ANA podcast like would you be able to like look down at your phone find the Duncan Trussell family hour and start streaming it live on your phone while you're skiing down the side of the virtual Hill would you can already there's that you could already you could already do that yeah look I mean look man this is like Rick and Morty's video game is in VO is accepting that you're in VR and and they're there yeah there's like there's a there's all kinds of shit you could do and they're like for example man there's a in one of these games called fantastic contraption which is one of the most site dude show split reality fantastic contraption if you looked at this where people have managed to put up a green screen so that in interpolate the two videos so it looks like you're actually in the game that's the clothes show that fantastic contraption is this everything in there's fucking psychedelic but check this out when you see people in there in the reality itself yeah there you go whoa watch what he does so this guy's walking around this is what he's saying so what we're looking at what we he seemed is this gonna we're gonna kicked off use YouTube for this you don't need a daughter you don't no audio please I'm worried but so this guy's moving around and while he's moving around he's doing a bunch of stuff there's a battery in front of us for sure there's like well just explain to the people that are listening what we're seeing oh yeah you're just seeing like in fantastic contraption what does that was fantastic contraption you're in this like weird putting green and you have to build these amazing devices to the way unfortunately these videos you're not seeing the guy actually form the shit like watch this what am I watching well he started listening watch this sorry you're seeing look at this look at this you have to stretch out these like tubes to build this weird device that you like then automates itself to try to I mean honest-to-god talking about it you feel like a fucking you're listening to an eight year old talk about a drawing that they made like what it's impossible to convey it's a game and it's a game where this guy's moving he's got devices in his hand and devices move things in the virtual world he's holding onto these two like controllers but this is not a good if you look up crazy matter state pretty thoughtfully looking cool yeah you'll see it on Friday I'll show you guys and what we need to talk about is porn what's that like Duncan what's it like in this world what's it like so um I mean it's like I'll tell you something even better than porn man oh um here's what's really cool about VR that I don't think a lot of people have caught on to maybe a few of them have because the porn of course is amazing it is on it is if anything is going to drive VR and I hope everything drives VR it's going to be the fucking porn because the porn that is shot for VR is very very close to like experiencing having sex with someone obviously - the body right there's no body there there's nobody there but it's amazing and it's going to cause a lot of great and hilarious problems and I'm excited to hear the outrage that comes from the world when people start realizing that every single person on earth now has access not just to in a voyeuristic way witnessing ooh that that I'm telling you man that is that's this girl's ass is insane and so she's right in front of you but this is they're not doing a good job with this cuz it's got two eyeballs oh yeah that's just how it yeah you you you have to use virtual desktop to bring those two things together like the the porn that you download is broken up and stereoscopic so the VR goggles bring it together you have to get specific programs that are designed for this right yeah like yeah just google search read it how not to watch VR porn and so these guys that are watching it like we're watching this guy who's sitting on his bed and like he's looks like he's doing everything to keep from coming in his pants he's laughs like I don't ever watch porn like that this is like sheer joy and him watching that porn like the what you're talking about is something that's very different than watching a two-dimensional screen it's it's as different as sex and watching a two-dimensional screen except there's no body there I mean you are in you look or you can look around you can like you know like for example let's say there was a and by the way I'm not doing this shit a friend of mine watches it so let's say let's say that there was a let's say that there was a you know in a VR porn experience there's a girl who's giving you a blowjob while another girl is shoving her pussy in your face you can actually look up and see your pussy not a pussy you can look around or pussy and see the see your face looking down at you just like it was really happening so that's VR porn well that's what it's a ligament you can look at her pussy and then you can go back to her the other girl sucking your dick you could yeah you can move anywhere you could stare at her feet if you're a weirdo or not if you're a fan of feet either way either way either way it's it's in its game changer it's a game changer man it's a game changer and it's one of the many freedoms the virtual realities offering people it's like you are saying who wants to you know like even just watching a movie in 2d in your virtual reality room it's pretty awesome maybe you don't have the greatest apartment right but you put on VR goggles and suddenly your apartment is transformed into a into a massive beautiful space in the HTC vive it comes with like VR home and there's two different versions but when you go into this space you feel that same sense of expansiveness that you get from being in a big space right your body's still like feels like it's you know you're in a you still feel that weird sense of freedom that you feel when you're in a big space and you're not there it's beautiful man it's like one of the most liberating incredible technologies I think that a lot some people are giving it a little bit of a hard time right now because they see the game from YouTube and they think those graphics look like shit but let me tell you man do minecraft in VR like I just that I did minecraft in VR I play minecraft of VR regularly now but you do minecraft in VR and when suddenly you're perched on the edge of a cliff looking down on some hyper colored underground river your body initially reacts in the same way it reacts to being at the edge of a real cliff your balance gets weird you're like fuck fuck fuck it's that real that's the vibe the HTC vive is in fucking sane Jesus I can't wait to show you man it's like it just works it doesn't it doesn't mess up like anytime I want to now I can go like I've I've made a room in my house or now I can just put on these goggles and I'm instantly in up fucking there's a game called hover Junkers which is so fun wasn't so you um you you could you probably pull it up you ride around like it knows how big the space is that what's called your play space that knows how big it is so you're riding in a craft in this play space shooting weapons at people flying around in these other things yeah it's so you could like you could all go in your garage and you could the garage would become the environment where you're playing your game oh yeah man you're not in your garage anymore you're flying around on that fucking thing shooting at people which means you actually have to be good at shooting like you have to be able to aim this isn't like pressing buttons like you need to know how to fire at least some Saudis what are you holding are you holding a fake gun no you're holding these controllers that feel exactly like a fucking they feel very close to a gun and it's got haptic technology so when you're shooting it's vibrating like new this would actually teach you how to shoot better they have they have a great archery program is it making your archery better it's making me not do archery because that's way easier are you good on it are you good at this archery yeah me at doing real archery definitely translated into me playing look up the I'm sorry to keep asking you look up stop Jamie look up archery the lab vr this is one of my favorite archery programs they also have a VR boxing which I haven't tried yet but which I'm excited about because that that seems like you could really train people to learn how to box let's see I'm I don't know if this is yeah that's that's a different archery program than the one that look up the lab fuck is it's valve look up valve archery VR now there this one's really fucking fun man yeah this one it's fucking cool you just shoot it these little guys are trying to infiltrate you whoa so you're shooting at things yeah and it's so it's a game yeah my god and you are you pulling a bow back like what are you doing in your gear so you have two controllers you're pulling them back there's haptic so it vibrates according to this tension of the bowstring and then when you want an arrow you're reaching behind your back and pulling it from behind your back that is nuts yeah it's so fun wonder if it actually could help your archery skill for sure the only problem is it's really weird cuz you get used to like it's different because you use a compound bow but you know you know it's kind of same you get used to like I have a place on my cheek where I put my yeah the anchor point changes cuz the goggles brought up your eight so you have to use the anchor point but it's still pretty fucking fun I mean how often you get to shoot at things in like an archery range like this yeah this is wild and I wonder they mean they should definitely be able to do something like this for like compound bows oh yeah that's a go deer hunting with it there's another archery program that you can get on Steam that looks pretty cool I can't remember the name of it though but it looks a little bit more I guess realistic well they have an archery program see if you can find this archery program where you shoot at a virtual screen you actually shoot a real bow at these images on a screen and this like you you go to like in front of like a giant movie theater type thing and you stand in front of this thing and these animals walk by oh that's cool and they run from you and they hide and you got to sneak up on them and shoot arrows at them I mean I'm sure this will be translated into VR and I'll tell you Joe if I was if I were you man I would be developing shit for VR right development yeah god damn it it's not a developer I would there are so many ideas that you will have when you try these goggles on where you're gonna be like this hat this needs to exist in the world get this shit developed man because it's gonna like there's so many things that once you experience it we're like Oh someone needs to build this someone like for example a fucking boxing game he's nodding so in the in the one hour I think I got a demonstration of it I was just sitting there asking the guys so what about when where someone gets a hold of this and they start thinking about doing this thing and what about when Rockstar gets it and then they say I think I'm making grand theft auto this way it's like yes your exact your brain just like well fallout is coming for the vibe which is going to be pretty fucking cool but dude from the and they have like a boxing program that looks like it's still in development but a fucking gecko that real boxing program because it tracks the controllers perfectly in real-time so you can actually learn how to box yes someone needs to build a real thought not only learn how to box but you could train with the great boxers like you throw kicks - well you would have to have something on your foot you'd have to have another additionally that could be done boots right easily man easily kind of sneakers you can get a great fucking workout - oh I'm sure remember when people were doing dance dance revelution they lost tons of weight yeah it was a huge thing yeah a lot of guys lost oh and gals lost a ton of weight off that dance dance revelution game because it was so fun to do well that's what's funny about VR is that right now when people think of a video gamer they don't you're not gonna hear someone say oh they're lean and and they like her decks they have such dexterity but now when you think of a V someone who's great at VR they're gonna you gotta be in fucking show here's the program I'm gonna download it the creators of this seem like they're super Oh son I think I could get a good workout with this they have V our pool table good I don't want that pools real but see the thing about this is this is something that you could do on your own and get a workout in what I find interesting about this too is you could tune a dude up and you don't feel bad about it right now what you need to do eventually is they're going to have something that looks like this but it's a robot like both things like you have a thing that you can actually hit well now you could just you could already I'm sure there's a way that you could hang a bag and cuz like okay so when I am what I'm talking about something that hits back well yeah that's that that's gonna be something that's crazy doesn't have to have a lot of power it can have like a really mushy arm and it knows how to move the way the way you move like it's actually punches at you so if it hits you it's not hurting you you know what that could be man it could be like a haptic facemask their registers the punch and vibrates so that you could feel it you know and yeah wherever it hits you it could be but it also could be like some sort of a robot that has inflatable arms and the inflatable arms moved with the program so as you're looking at Apollo Creed in front of you when he snaps his Jap out at you pop he's he's throwing this like spongy almost like inflatable raft balloon arm you know like when you get little kids yeah inflatable balloon toys yeah I know like that like it's not gonna hurt you at all it's just gonna touch your face it would be fucking incredible and and what's in what you're gonna see man is people are gonna get really good at this shit okay if you're good at shooting in VR - like the heft of the gun and the real cake of whatever gun in the real world you're using use it's it's gonna translate
