sup sach hey how's it going good man how are you good good thanks for having me back on my pleasure hey um thanks for turning me on to those shoes you were to those ultras oh nice I started running with those yeah I like them I like them a lot they're great uh-huh which ones you got the Lone Peak RSM I've got the whatever the trail ones are okay you know I like the wide foot what's it called foot box so check box yeah toe box of what's called toe box yeah those are great cool man no I'm glad you like them and I feel like this is what you wear so it gets me excited you know it's really interesting like when you dive into under the the world of footwear and stuff and I learned this recently and the number one indicator of low injury risk which is what runners always looking for they're gonna minimize risk so comfort is the identifier for that so if you find yourself going into like a specialty running shop ask them to try on a variety of different pairs a variety different models and find the one that's most comfort for you and that's probably gonna lower your risk to the lowest you can you can get from your Footwear anyway but if you like really smushy ones aren't those supposed to be not so good for you yeah no that's a good question I think it's one of those things where it's kind of half true half not where you kind of have to look at what you're what what's the purpose of what you're doing so the way I kind of describe it is if I'm trying to strengthen my lower legs you know I want that low cushion that firm platform because that's gonna really activate the muscles in the lower part of the leg but if I'm dealing with some lower leg issues or a little sore I did a workout and my calves are kind of sore or my ankles sore then cushion can be great because it's gonna relieve that kind of initial impact on the lower part of your legs and the the caveat though is those impact forces have to go somewhere so they're kind of going to move further up the kinetic chain so what I usually tell people if you're dealing with lower leg pain or injury then you might want to consider something a little more cushioned and if you want if you're dealing with something like in your knees or your hips then getting rid of some of that cushion is going to just keep that kind of more precise foot plant and maybe alleviate some of those impact forces from ending up in those areas but at the end of the day the mechanics of it all are going to be the real driver you want your foot to come underneath the bent knee because you're using your legs that's kind of like a three-foot spring essentially so if you can get that foot plant under bent it's gonna absorb it in the way your body intends versus absorbing it in a way that could maybe send those impact forces into the wrong areas that's really interesting you know I was watching a video with this guy who was in his 70s who runs in under three hour marathon yeah and he said that five years ago he hired a coach it was just kind of crazy like a 65 year old dude hiring a coach but trimmed a bunch of time off his marathon I think more than five minutes off of his marathon I think it was quite a bit more than five minutes and you know he was running for a long time before that mm-hmm but yet a coach sort of shortened his his time and finishing a 26 mile race at 70 years old yeah it's never too late yeah the bent knee is really important because a lot of folks who don't pay attention to the history of Footwear don't understand that this fat cushioned heel that everybody sort of thinks of when you think of a running shoe and you when you watch a lot of people run that don't know any better they run and they land on their heel which is sort of something that was created was it by Nike is that what it was it created that fat bottomed heel thing yeah they I think they were the first one to do the offset where it was traditionally I think was like 12 millimeters where your heel would be that much higher than your forefoot but I think even with when we get into kind of like say heel striking versus forefoot or mid-foot striking heel striking is another thing where it's not inherently bad it all comes down to what I was saying before where if you can heel strike but your foot is still underneath that bent knee you're probably not gonna do anything too detrimental so like that it's not optimal right it probably depends on the specific runner and there really a particular gate yeah there's a good have like extra long legs or something and maybe heels trick would work or extra short legs or what would it be yeah I don't know for sure if there's like a height thing that would do I think would maybe just come with like the mechanics of the way the person learned to run in the first place and just maybe some nuances with the way their body is is kind of more or less designed but I mean there's there's heel striking folks that are very or not injury prone or have never gotten injuries or hardly ever get injuries but usually I think if you're doing that that's probably because you're under that bent knee and you're not kind of having that point where your foot is out in front of your knee and then you kind of that straight leg but at an angle where it's gonna be you know not not ideal for kind of absorbing those impacts yeah that's the the real bad one right is when people are pigeon toed when their knees kind of Bend in which I do see quite a bit mm-hmm that's that's got to be terrible for your knees right yeah I mean I couldn't say for sure but I think I think there's a lot of nuance and it's ends it'd be kind of like an individual situation with a lot of these cases so it's hard to know for sure there's probably people who can talk to mechanics better than me and Haley right you just run what does the was that explain the record you broke you ran 24 oh in less well it was a hundred miles and it's a 24-hour time pair but you did it in 11 hours and 41 minutes yeah so um it was yeah let me explain a little bit so it was a the event itself was called six days in the dome and really what it was was you could do anything from a 24-hour event to a 48-hour event to a six-day event and just see how far you can run within that timeframe days yeah I know there's some crazy people out there so just wait till David Goggins finds that event but yeah so I've been it's interesting because there's not a lot of time events that are necessarily structured 400-mile or for like 12 hours so a lot of times you find yourself jumping into some of these other events that are longer in duration and just kind of using them as a way to try to run a fast hundred mile er or a fast 12 hour so the race director for for that particular event had reached out to me because he he's known me for a while and knew that I was targeting fast hundred mile times and just said hey I've got this cool event set up at the Olympic training facility in Milwaukee Wisconsin at the Pettit Center and I think it's gonna be pretty conducive for fast for fast times and and asked I wanted to do it so I actually didn't have an ideal timeline to that I would have normally wanted to work with in terms of getting ready for it but the training went really well and I went there targeting the hundred mile world record which was 11 hours 28 minutes and 30 seconds prior to that and ended up running 11 hours 19 minutes and 13 seconds for hundred miles and then since we have like this 100 mile distance and also this 12-hour time to event kind of structure you can find yourself if you're under 12 hours kind of double dipping and getting to events for the price of one I guess you could say so I kept running after I hit 100 miles and ended up going 104 point eight eight miles total in the 12 hour time frame so that was another record yeah those two World Records hundred miles in 12 hours dude six minutes and 48 seconds for a pace for a hundred miles is fucking bonkers that is so fast that's so crazy that's such a fast pace man yeah you know it's funny like when you look at it because I think sometimes people look at like a hundred miles in 11 hours and 19 minutes and there's not a lot of context and they're mindless they're kind of familiar with ultra marathon running mm-hmm but when you start to break it down into like the subcategories where it's like well that's like for like sub three-hour marathons in a row or I can't remember how many or what the 5k time is there's like it's like 31 five K's at some some times for sub three-hour marathons in a row yeah Wow so crazy that's so fast and are you still eating mostly meat uh so you know this gets brought up quite a bit I think because I mean I eat a ton of animal products for sure but you know I wouldn't classify myself as a quote unquote carnivore or quite as the carnivore diet people want to claim you we discussed this kind of the last time you were here where you take in a lot of glucose and you you wrap up your carbohydrates considerably before a race like what is what is your what is a daily diet let's say in training you're preparing for something like this what's a daily diet for you like yeah yeah so yeah let's jump into that I think there is some nuance within that even because when you think of my lifestyle the way I like describe it is if you took a calendar year and you grabbed a single day out of there and you grabbed a day where I was yet like a peak training day versus a recovery day those are like so drastically different in terms of my energy and my my energy demands so like things tend to fluctuate quite a bit and change quite a bit and I think that's oftentimes what confuses people because they want to they look at what I'm doing say on race day they look at what I'm doing on one big workout days or my rest day and think that's what I'm doing across the board so you and you get the folks saying Oh Bozek follows a carnivore diet they're probably looking at like a post-race recovery day where then I might be eating almost all just animal products a lot of eggs a lot of salmon you know red meats that sort of stuff but if you pick a day out where I'm doing like a big training day doing like a 30-mile run or something like that that's where I'm gonna kind of bring back some of the carbohydrates to try to supplement that activity and the best way to maybe describe it is uh you know there's like this this that kind of Train low race high or this carb periodization concept that's getting more momentum behind it in and more studies and science behind it too there's some interesting folks that are looking into this in more detail and if folks are really interested in doing a deep dive in it there's a guy named dr. mark Bub's he wrote a book called peak and he kind of dives into kind of like some of the nutrition science where it's been and kind of where it's it's kind of heading and and they highlight some of that and one of the big things they're starting to recognize that even with the elite athletes when your period izing your training like I do you know your nutrition should be being periodized as well you know the science is pretty clear that like if you're doing a workout and you take in glucose or fructose I think most science says a two to one ratio is ideal for maximizing the moment you can take in then M you're going to give yourself an advantage that's like rocket fuel so then it becomes a question of like do you need that a hundred percent of the time or do you even want to do it a hundred percent of time because when we look at it pause you ready yeah when you say glucose two-to-one like what do you mean by that and wood in the coast of fructose okay because what they found out is when they started doing a lot of like the exercise science and nutrition was that the real limiter is your gut so like on paper so absorption yeah uh-huh yeah there's a finite amount you can absorb and you increase the amount you can you can absorb on average if you have that two to one ratio versus all of one or the other so to glucose to one sucrose yeah mm-hmm interesting and now what are the different sources for glucose versus sucrose like sucrose is simple sugar that you get is that more like a refined sugar yeah yeah you I think like the way like a most most like sports supplements and things like that are gonna be designed to kind of meet those those specific because they're looking at the literature and they're seeing like okay this is how you got selected power8 or a Gatorade or something like that would be a two-to-one yeah I'd have to look to see exactly if they have that but my guess would be they would be if they're looking at the research and where that's kind of that but yeah so like really wanna the question that I think needs to be asked with a lot of this stuff is like if I want to make a workout feel as easy as possible if I'm trying if I can get in like say 60 grams of carbohydrate per hour it's probably gonna do that like my pace my perceived effort at that pace is probably going to feel easier but then you have to ask the question like how often do you need it to feel that easy so for me the answer to that is like well if I'm doing something really strenuous or something that's in a little bit of a gray area where it's just fast enough to dip into the glycogen stores but just slow enough that I can do it for quite a while and make maybe even a couple hours then you're kind of in this area where that could be an advantage for you from performance standpoint but if I'm going out for an easy run of like 60 to 90 minutes and it's gonna be like a 2 to 3 out of 10 perceived effort anyway like there's no real need for me to be hitting glucose during that or you know sports drink during that to make that feel even easier yet because my goal isn't necessarily to you know make an easy run fill even easier I guess is the way to layer so you call a 90 minute run easy nothing just a stroll just a few dozen miles well and I think that that also brings up a really good point to where like a lot of this stuff when we're looking at carbohydrate usage and performance is we're looking at elite athletes we're looking at folks that are training for like you know the Olympics you know sometimes they're even Olympic medalists and that's just not a very good comparison I think to the average person who's out there running because you know they're doing their purposes are different you know their objectives are different their lifes are very different like one is doing basically everything around a specific specific date and distance and trying to run as fast as they can on that date another person may be trying to run as fast as they can but there's so many other factors in life like their work their relationships their you know the level of training they're actually able to have with the time they have and then also like you know managing their own health and nutrition because like you know elite athletes don't have a very rosy picture in terms of long-term health either so for someone who's like you know maybe 10 20 pounds overweight and is trying to run to get into shape or train to get into shape or something like that they're probably thinking just so much about health as they are about performance so for them to be you know shuttling in 60 grams of carbohydrate every hour during training and racing is it's probably not the direction that they'd want to go now when you get ready to do something like this 100 mile run how many miles do you run on a typical day and do you ramp that up or do you just give yourself a base and know that you can push through like how do you handle that yeah so I'll build up my training the way I kind of describe it is like I'm always focusing on specificity kind of being Kings so depending on the race distance and the intensity is kind of how I'm going to structure my workouts so the rule of thumb that I use is the closer I get to the workout the more specific the workouts I do are going to be towards that race distance and intensity so for me what that oftentimes means since I'm training for like a hundred mile distance races is early in a training black I might be doing some like shorter interval work like vo2 max like an example that would maybe be like a three-minute kind of almost all out effort followed by like a three minute recovery jog and then another three-minute interval like that some of those real short interval sessions and how many those would you do in a row how many Sprint's versus recovery yeah it'll depend I'll start like pretty easy I'm the first one I did the four when I first started I might just do three by three on that and what my goal really is to every week is to kind of build volume within that so that first week it might be just three of them but by like say the eighth week I might do a total of like 24 to 27 minutes worth of volume within that vo2 max context so it's it's it really interesting because like you know I could go out on any one day and do like maybe ten of those but if I do that and then it takes me like a week and a half to recover from that session it's not nearly as probably effective as if I spread that out a little bit and said did like five by three and then five by three three days after that give your body chance to recover and build versus just destroying it all in one and then feeling like shit for a couple weeks exactly I like to I like to call it micro stressing when I'm working with folks and my own training I'm like we want a micro stress if you want to stress you just enough to elicit a response and as you get stronger and then we want to do that over and over and over again are you where you I'm sure you are you know who Pavel Tatsu lanius yeah yeah so he's got that sort of concept when it comes to weightlifting with kettlebells in particular calling greasing the groove yeah whereas instead of doing all these sets to failure you would just do like half of what you're capable of and then do it again in a more frequent pace like do it again rather you know do it again on Wednesday do it again on Friday and then give yourself a lot of time in between each individual activity to particularly in training for strength he actually recommends as much as ten minutes of recovery in between sets which is you know kind of correct me and most people not all the time for that you know six sets is an hour in I mean it seems like you're just laying around the gym people would if you were a gym people in mock you but that's his protocol mmhmm yeah yeah and I think it's I think it you know endurance is like a it's a patient person's game so I think if you can build that volume in a you know micro stressing or in a like a sustainable way that's what's gonna keep you or get you strong and it's also gonna make it less likely to get injured how much time do you need like like if you got you know up to that insane pace that you did when you ran 100 miles when if you took like a week off or two weeks off how much would you lose not much in that amount of time especially at that intensity so the thing is is like the 648 mile pace you we need to be kind of relative about it so like for me when I'm out training when I'm not when I'm not what I'm fully recovered that's like a pretty reasonable pace from an intensity standpoint so the interesting thing about ultra marathon is race pace is sometimes faster than even some of your easiest runs and training so your training is kind of all what we would call like over speed training hmm whereas in most endurance events from like the 1500 up to like the marathon the majority of your work is gonna be sub-race pace and then you're gonna have like depending on the program you know maybe 20-30 percent of that be like over speed training why is that well just because the duration of the event is so long like you know I can't run fast if I run too fast then it's just gonna end badly for me right but why is that with marathons oh well because it's it becomes it's similar to strength training where like if the limiter is like the amount of like stress you put on your body so if I was gonna train to peak and say a marathon my my max potential pace for that wouldn't be sustainable to do every run so I'd be running I'd be running too hard too fast too often and then we'd get into that that kind of a situation that we're talking about before where you're starting to macro stress versus micro stress so if you run a marathon what is your standard marathon pace so I I'm a little goofy where I competed in high school in college and then I did some marathons but not really in a structured manner and then I got an ultra marathon running so I haven't really done what I would consider a real legitimate marathon training program so you're basically saying marathons are for pussies right you're saying just say I actually think the marathon I just think marathons are maybe the hardest event of them all I'll explain why because you're going fast well yeah it's just short enough where you have to be pushing like a fairly intense pace but it's just long enough where if you make a mistake you're gonna pay for that for quite some time so you're on such a razor's edge and you're also just one tiny mistake away from things going really bad and what you're saying about mistake you're talking about pacing okay yeah if you go out too hard yeah I see your watch what is it what kind of watch you wearing it's a Kouros apex what I've never heard of that one before had a GPS watch one of those yeah it's it's relative they're a relatively new brand like in in running I guess like the two kind of big players historically have been Suunto and Garmin mm-hmm and korells kind of came to the market a few years ago they wanted to try to make like take that high-end technology but make it maybe a little more affordable and also make it user friendly because now everyone's there they care more about the post-workout or the post run data that you're uploading to these platforms like Strava so like corals kind of made it a big point to make it really user friendly on that end so you like I get done with the run and I load it up to the app and it's up on Strava like within a few seconds sometimes and then you go dissect all the data like how much elevation gain and loss your pace per mile oh is this primarily a running watch I mean you could use it for running or cycling or hiking or mountaineering or anything like that it's got like all those kind of bells and whistles on okay so so if your my question was like it so if you're running how long you are you're checking your watch if you're doing a marathon you're making sure that you're not going crazy because it's is it otherwise you just have to kind of gauge it just based on the pack and based on how you feel yeah and I think that's actually a good especially when you get into ultra marathon I think the metric that people should dial in the most is their rate of perceived exertion because that's something that's not gonna necessarily lie to you like if you base your thing your stuff off heart rate exclusively or a pace exclusively you can find yourself like justifying something that's not necessarily where you need to be and if something like that malfunctions and that was your like only compass then you're in trouble so I like when I'm doing my training and when I'm working with other folks I like to use heart rate and I like to use pacing and stuff like that but ultimately I'm trying to get the person to really understand like how hard is this effort and then across the board from like very easy to very difficult and then when it comes time to race we can kind of dial in like this is the intensity you're trying to look for so that they can kind of feel that out to use a metric like to you say like how do you feel seven to ten yeah pretty much I'll have a scale of like one to ten that I'll use a lot of times and there's like a whole variety like most people are gonna be using some sort of like probably like zone system of training where there's like there's numbers that are associated with heart rate ranges or intensities and there will be descriptors and you know there's some that are like 1 through 20 there's some that are kind of 1 through 5 and then 1 through 10 and isn't that so so weird too right because it's so it's subjective I mean the whoop-whoop strap is something I wear and it uses something like that like what's your perceived exertion of my own I just push it towards the far right I don't know like what does that mean like it's it's also hard to gauge your perceived exertion especially when the workouts over yeah I was hard I went on went all out like what does that mean I don't know what that means you know yeah yeah it can be tricky and it is very subjective but I think it's one of those things where it falls into the same category that a lot of endurance events are where you just got to be patient and really work on kind of understanding that and you learn from experience to like you you find out like oh I went and did this workout and I thought that was the right pace and intensity that turned out to be a little too fast duty keep a training log yeah mm-hm and do you like write it on Excel or something like that yeah I basically just load all my stuff up to Strava and then yeah so that's kind of like the go-to for most runners these days is I'm sorry but do you keep like a diary like today felt like this and this was an issue and I felt like I didn't have enough fluids or do you do anything like that not so much anymore I did it a lot when I was in college and I did it a lot when I first started when I was really trying to kind of learn my body and kind of learn what things mean and and how I respond to them but now I've been kind of doing it long enough where I have enough of a like an understanding of kind of how like when things go wrong like why they did or if something went really well like why it did that I don't feel like I need to take as detailed notes but I think it's really valuable for someone who's especially well they're trying to learn the rate of perceived exertion and kind of really dial those things in it's probably worth a lot of worth a lot worth their time to write that stuff down so that they can look back at it and they have that resource available to them as they're kind of reflecting on things now say if you're getting ready to do something like this crazy 100 mile run trying to break a world record what what do you would help much time you giving yourself to really truly prepare for that is it based on what how you're at right now like what your baseline is like what kind of preparation you've done before you knew that this race was available to you like how do you do that mm-hmm yeah no and this is this little we can kind of hop back to where we're talking about before because when I was talking about the vo2 max work know stuff that's kind of early in my training plan because that intensity is very unspecific to a hundred mile you pace you know that's you know those vo2 max workouts are much closer to something shorter like a 5k so what are you trying to do with those of you - max workouts you just trying to elevate your your base yeah like just in like a hear that like there's the different systems of training and that's kind of a higher intensity system so it's not very relevant to the race pace that I'm doing specifically but it's not irrelevant to my overall like aerobic efficiency so like by doing some of those faster stuff things you work on things like your form and just because when you're running that fast like things tend to be a little more dialed in and it just it expands it basically what you do is you give yourself kind of a bigger range of what your potential is gonna be when you start focusing more and on like the aerobic side of things that we're gonna see like as I would move further down in the training plan so once I kind of do that section of training to answer your question they're like ideally I'll have maybe about since I'm coming into most programs not completely out of shape like four months is kind of a sweet spot for me if I was coming like off the couch so to speak six months would be a little more appropriate are you ever off the couch only if I'm injured and I've only been injured in any significant way since ultra since they're altering running once for about five weeks seven I had a stress fracture on my right sacral ax it's kind it's basically like on your tailbone oh ouch yeah yeah the fuck happened so what I think I don't know it's hard to know for sure but what was the way was described to me when I was going in and getting eye stuff checked out was what likely happened was I had such a history and kind of flat running that I was actually preparing for a race had a lot more climbing descending so I started changing my training to more climbing and ascending and when I did that like one thing that sometimes happens when you're running a lot of flat hard surfaces is you're like ankles and your hips can get pretty tight from that real like kind of uniform like mechanic's that you're doing so like my range of motion was semi limited so when I was doing some of that hard downhill and uphill running I just probably wasn't very efficient with my form and it ended up the kind of were talking before those impact forces ended up in the wrong spot and then the stress fracture occurred that is crazy you broke your ass you literally broke your ass yeah people always talk about all he was busting his ass like you actually did so where is it Jamie right there oh Jesus Christ it's so it's it literally is your ass bone you a really goofy thing about it too was Wow when I first had the pain surface for that it was kind of in like the like lower back glute area is where it surfaced so I thought I had like a sciatic issue like I went into the doctor and they were like okay let's try some like actives release therapy and let's see if we can get this thing to loosen up and we just were working on working on it and like it would like clear up where I wouldn't notice it if I was walking around but then every time I'd go for a run or try to go for a run I get that sharp pain right away and so after about I think it was maybe four weeks or so we just we had been doing a ton of Active Release a ton of mobility work and then like it wasn't going away so he's like well let's just get an MRI and see what's going on in there and they did the MRI got the results back and he said there's nothing there so you start running again so I started running again I ran like I think it was two or three days maybe very short like two miles and then three miles then maybe five or something like that and then I got a call back from the doctor and he's like well it turns out we took a second look at the MRI there is a stress fracture I told him like well I just ran the first three pain-free days I ever I have since this this issue nine fuck yeah well and I think what he said maybe was going on there was it was I mean it was a very fine stress fracture it wasn't I mean sometimes when people have a fracture on their sacred Ala it's like a big enough fracture where like it can be out for like a year and oh yeah yeah so it can be a really bad injury but he said maybe the mobility and the strength work I was doing while I had that to try to rehab kind of strengthen the areas around it enough that when I just was running flat really slow really easy that protected that area enough where I didn't feel the pain anymore so after that I think I took another like two weeks off completely just to make sure before I started building back up and then I started kind of building back up again do you ever run on one of those err runner things you know those self-propelling treadmills I've been on one once before but not in any like a significant way they look pretty sweet I love those damn things which one do we have what is it uh who makes it it's aired I'm right airdyne makes it the air runner is that what it's called Jamie I'll find out but anyway man it's some percentage thirteen or make up the number 13 percent harder than actual air assault air runner yeah it's amazing it's hard as fuck I gave one to Bert Bert Kreischer losers too hard because he likes using a treadmill and pretending he's really running when he's just picking his legs up and down you know but that makes you actually push and see your calves get blown the fuck up man it's it's hard yes it's really good and it's what does it say and what is its what percentage does it say it's harder than actual running like if you were just running at the same pace some people are like runnings hard enough why are we making it harder but the idea is that you go and run and mix running easier uh-huh yeah sort of like running with weights on uh-huh but it doesn't give you an additional stress yes not too good it's not pounding on your body mm-hmm you know it's not like you're you're doing anything that's gonna injure you but it's it's caught you you know you have to propel that thing you know it's if folks don't know what we're talking about it's basically a very subtle you right like the way the thing is structured and it's got tread on it and as you run you are the thing that's making it move so there's no machine or it's not plugged in it's not like it's electronic and you set the pace and you just gotta keep up with it it's not it's you're making it run uh-huh so you're pushing it and as you push it it requires extra energy and extra effort in that extra effort when you actually go run on a regular road surface or a trail it seems easier mm-hmm yeah I know that makes sense and I think it's pretty cool because like yeah with the weighted stuff like you run the risk essentially hurt something bad additional weight like they were doing these rock challenges I forget to come I think it was trained to hunt or one at one of these one of these competitions they were making people wear heavy packs it might not have been trained to hunt it was much I think it was another cunt but anyway they would make you wear like a hundred pound pack and so the idea was they were doing these races with a hundred pound packs on which you can imagine is a fucking recipe for orthopedic surgeon races yeah and so these people were getting kind of jacked up and they Steve they stopped doing that as a competent you know as a running competition but there's a few of those similar kind of competitions where they force you to do a bunch of physical activities and then bring your heart rate down and execute shots on targets and then run to the next station and do a bunch of physical activities and they were doing that with heavy heavy weights on and just really was a bad idea mm-hmm yeah yeah I think that would that would be maybe good for if you're gonna do like a mountain hearing experience and you got to carry a bunch of old stuff like you're doing with the hunting but even then you really should just ruck yes pet the heavy pack on there's a company called outdoorsman's it makes a really good one it's called an atlas pack and it's essentially a pack frame but the back of it is a universal post like would you would use for weights you know like a weightlifting post for you know Olympic weights you know so those big round steel plates slide right onto it so you can get a 45-pound plate on it and then clamp it down and so it's like really secure on you as opposed to like sometimes if you put too much weight in a pack like maybe it'll sit all at the bottom it's this is like boom right the center of your back and you cramp it down and and then you know you're really carrying all that weight you know on your hips a little bit on your shoulders it's all like really centered well that's a good one for really training but you don't fucking run with it you just hike hike yeah that's our yeah hard enough just to walk with it does it say how much Representatives it's no I couldn't find like an official testing of whatever but one person that did a big deep dive into it said its main thing was to fix his gait or a will improve running gait mmm that 30% is a number that they read is like a sales like thing 30 I didn't hear that one I thought I couldn't find it was like a I'm trying to find like testing or some it doesn't seem like it's 30 percent mathematician but it's it's just excellent for training do you do any training on machines or is all your training essentially done on the road the running is all pretty much done on the road in the trails I'll do like some mobility work and some strength work on the gym and that's where I'll I'll kind of go inside I guess for it but yeah you know I I've used treadmills and stuff in the past and I do use them from time to time but usually if I have the option to go outside I'll do that and I mean I live in Phoenix so it's you know we're it's sunny Coles days 7d yeah exam there this weekend actually oh yeah that's right you're at the is it chimeric america's next yeah Friday and Saturday I'm psyched yeah I love Phoenix yeah it's the time of year to be there for sure yeah man right what's what's the temperature there right now probably maybe 65 I ever saw I've been there before in the summer in July when he at Tempe improv and it was like fucking 120 uh-huh well and that's that's the funny thing too cuz when I was training for that 100 mile 12-hour world record it was through the summer because the race was in August so my training was like 110 degrees some days and the funny thing too is the Petitte Center where I did the race it was actually built for speed skating and some hockey rinks so they keep it at like 60 degrees nevermind I remember one day when I was running it was like one of the hottest days this summer I'm are thinking like I'm gonna race literally at half this temperature yeah so it's really funny when you when you see when you see that and I think I'm I'm no expert at it by any means but I think there's some pretty cool like studies and stuff that of the effects that happen when you are training in some of those extreme heats like what happens it for the way was described to me is it kind of simulates training at altitude to a degree hmm so who knows maybe that makes sense well it's similar to hot yoga right mm-hmm that's they're doing some studies at Harvard I believe I think it's Harvard someone was explaining the whole deal to me there's not something that I read but essentially what they're doing is they're trying to find out whether or not hot yoga these 90-minute hot yoga sessions replicates some of the known benefits of sauna uh-huh because you know obviously the temperature is not as hot they keep it the hot yoga place I go to I think they keep it at 105 degrees versus sauna you know it gets much much hotter than that you're in like the 180s which what I like and but the idea is that when your body is extremely stressed when you're doing these poses and you're sweating like crazy that your body core temperature rises basically to similar level then if you're just sitting in a sauna so you get a very similar response yeah yeah it's it's really interesting so I try to remember that when it's the summer in Phoenix so I don't get to miss yeah it's got you got to be doing yourself good crock gym which is one of the most famous boxing gyms in history a Manuel Stewart who was a just a wizard of boxing and he trained Tommy Hearns and you know some of the like to all-time greats of that era he would crank the temperature and this is in Detroit they would crank the temperature up really hot you'd go into that gym and it would be that way like for that specific reason because he believed that it increased endurance mm-hmm yeah it's it's interesting stuff but I'll still take January and February for comfort now what do you do in terms of like how do you hydrate yourself and like what what kind of durations are we talking about like Savior if it's 110 degrees outside 120 with it was the hottest you ran out I think 110 is what I do and I try to get out relatively early so that it's not like 110 from start to finish so like if I get out say at like 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning you know it might be in the 80s high 80s and be working its way up so that like I'm finishing and it might be 1:10 for Mikey workouts the way I structure my training usually when I'm kind of in peak is I'll do them my biggest workout in the morning and then I might go out and do like a second run that's like a little shorter or quite a bit shorter in most cases and really low intensity and you know then sometimes if it's the afternoon in Phoenix that's when I would see like that 1:10 but I'm usually not out for more than like 45 60 minutes for those so hydrating is is interesting because you know I grew up in the Midwest so I was very familiar with running in hot humid stuff in the summer and you know the dry desert heat though it seems like you get thirsty a lot quicker and a lot more frequently so I you know one of the things I learned the first summer I was in Phoenix was knowing where the water fountains are and kind of planning your house around that you drink out of public water fountains when I have to you worry about cooties I haven't gotten anything too miserable yeah in fact I did a race earlier this year it was in early June called the San Diego hundred and it's got this spot in the middle of the course where the aid stations are a little further apart there's like a nine mile stretch in a seven mile stretch and I kind of miss timed how much water I did so I filled up my water and a stream and it was probably not an ideal oh dude but I rolled the dice and it just I don't get no I'm getting pad no I'm I thought during the race was this is the mindset in the middle of one of these things is like well if something really bad happens will happen after the race so I definitely would but it's really bad yeah already is rough I've never had it but the people that I know that have had it say it's really bad but you know you could just bring a SteriPEN you but you can't really stop huh yeah I mean in a race I wouldn't want to yeah and what what really helped for me was the the situation is since the track rate since the race was on an indoor track 400 and like I think 42 and some odd meters I was doing a lot of my big long runs on a 400 meter track okay so when I did that I would just bring out like a cooler I don't have ice and water in there I would sit there waiting for you oh that's sweet yeah that makes sense but when you do a lot of trail running though right I do some of that too yeah historically I've done a lot more flat runnable stuff but now that I'm out in Phoenix I like to try to split the year into two halves and do some trail stuff in half the year and some like flat or rogue or track or runnable stuff in the second half do you bring water when you run trails do you bring like a backpack or something like that like one of those um you know what Zack yeah yeah with the tubes yeah but the fuck is that camels camel camel backs yeah there's I'll do I don't usually use what they call like the bladder which is the tube thing that you're talking nice though they are and you can pack a lot of water yeah usually unless I unless I'm gonna be away from a potential stop long enough usually what I'll do is I'll I'll use the pack but I'll have like small or a little like like little flasks soft lacks in there okay so you bring those two that you even like on the the chest straps yeah a lot of people with those but you're rolling the dice with that like you got to know how much to sip yeah you know we're lady the pickup spots are from or run with friends yeah when I run with my dog in the summer when it gets really hot I bring a hydro flask in a backpack and I'm one of those collapsible dog bowls because you know I don't want him drinking out of puddles and so but that just having that extra couple pounds on your back it makes a difference you can you feel it yeah yeah and that's that's why part of the reason why I try to go as minimal as I can with water if I if I can get away with it obviously if I go out and do like a big loop where there's no potential stops I'm gonna have to carry it all from the beginning but if it's a spot where I know like I can get to water every five six seven miles then usual I'll pack a little lighter and not be carrying as much at any one given time do you hydrate up before you go yeah I mean I think that's the one's one of the things to really get right in Phoenix was just like kind of learning kind of how much you need to be hydrating like between sessions because what I usually found out is I could go out and kind of neglect hydration for anyone given like run or workout but if I did that then the next one I'd probably pay for it so for me the big motivation to make sure I'm on top a hydration during any given run is because I know like if I don't then the next one's gonna potentially be man I've done that before that's that's a weird feeling trying to do anything when you're dehydrated it's like you have a bad battery or something yeah it's like everything's like oh come on it's it's it's amazing how just normal everyday life like you could feel like a little run down you barely notice it but once you start physically exerting once you start training once you start doing something hard that's when you become like really in tune with how you're screwing your body up like drinking for instance mm-hmm like have a couple of drinks and then run like oh god you're like well this is what it's doing to my body yeah I got a fucking stop drinking you know yeah yeah I think you you I like drinking to thirst that's use you but my gauge is and I haven't really had any issues with it with that with that so there's no like strategy like say I'm gonna run 25 miles today let me drink X amount of liters of water before I go out no before the run ya know I try not to like do too much like kind of like pre-emptive hydrating because I think what you want what people oftentimes I think do then is they drink too much and then that comes out of the expense of your electrolytes too because your body's gonna screech those so if I'm if I find myself couldn't you just supplement you can yeah and I'll do a lot more of that especially in the heat too just in general is like having like electrolyte supplementation and things like what do you use for your electrolytes supplementation I use a product called hydro ax mostly it's a like a powder that you can kind of mix in with your water by a company named X endurance they have they make these little tubes now to wear like so if I'm running and I have like one bottle with some in it already I can have these little like just these little tubes that if I've refill and want to put more and I can just kind of take them all pop it off and and pour that in a lot of other people will use you can make like little caps that you just swallow it with your water and it's got like the formulation of the different electrolytes in there kind of dialed in and you know that's a and I think that's a little more hit or miss as to like like where people feel you need that some people tell you don't really need electrolytes at all just need to salt your foods and things like that all the way to like you should be taking X number of these every hour there's got to be science behind it right I mean do you are you getting blood tests and finding out what your levels are pre and post workouts or anything along those lines yeah I haven't done any like post workout tests to say other than I know I was part of the faster study which was a study that looked at high carb and high fat athletes and I think they were looking at some of that stuff too and like anytime I've ever had a blood test done though by like my my electrolytes like my sodium potassium levels always been in range so I haven't really tried to it's one of those things then where it's like I'm probably not gonna try to fix something that's not broken Ryan you're pretty diligent about your supplementation yeah I mean I I I definitely am not afraid to salt my food you know most my food is conducive to putting salt on so you know I'm probably getting quite a bit of that stuff just in my day of day-to-day nutrition - do you have a specific salt that you like to use Himalayan do you see Saul like what do you like to use yeah I like to get sea salt lately I've been using uh this stuff called Redmon's sea salt they they get their salt at alike I believe it's in Utah in Salt Lake okay and I don't know like if the how accurate or whatever this is but like they I heard that if you can get an inland sea salt it's better because it's not like it doesn't have potential as many potential toxins that you can find in like oceans yeah yeah that's what the idea about Himalayan sea salt is right because it's no real fucking sea in the Himalaya yeah is it called Himalayan sea salt or am I just making that up or is it Himalayan salt I think it's sea salt right yeah the pink Himalayan sea salt right yeah but how was it sea salt explained that how does that work was it an older sea I wonder what it is and it's similar it's just like these big salt oh it is just salt okay oh it's just Himalayan salt No oh yeah I think I've heard it like an old C that's no longer there and they just have the big salt deposits right like that's what a lot of Montana is the Great Western in inland sea you know like millions of years ago like they find seashells in Montana yeah she was just fucking bonkers yeah it's crazy uh I was I was in Utah earlier in the year a camera where we were just out of Salt Lake and apparently that used to be on underwater too and like they'll find like shark teeth and stuff like that around there like Anna's you're up on this like trail and they're like there's no water and say think about that next time you see some asshole that would spend ten million dollars on a house on the beach yeah okay pay for that event yeah that it's not gonna be here something's gonna be different in the future it's always been that way like there's no permanent like place where the water is or the water isn't yeah it is funny how we think of that though it's like we see the map now and we're like oh okay this is just how it is yeah maybe not well look at Pangaea yeah you know things change pretty goddamn radically what's up Jamie I don't know the accuracy of this but I just found this okay Himalayan sea salt is a gourmet salt with a slightly misleading name it doesn't come from the Himalayan mountains oh Jesus and it doesn't come from a sea these motherfuckers it's definitely a seesaw so it's not a total misnomer Himalayan salt actually refers to exclusively to Pakistani rock salt no they used to be sea salt hundreds of millions of years ago so why don't we call it Pakistan if I was Pakistani I'd be mass yeah look at these motherfuckers are stealing our shine when a sea spreading over the region dried up it was covered by geological shifts leaving massive deposits of salts scattered throughout the hills odd name aside Himalayan salt has a lot going for it it's tasty it's pink and some even claim it has healing properties assholes those are the people that like crystals yeah that's what we have a big Himalayan salt rock right there yeah we'll and lo I'll just go look at look at that sucker has anybody looked at yet someone must've licked it when were looking at yeah I like Himalayan salt oh it's it it does it's nice but like cooking like we're cooking mean particularly I like kosher salt because you've got the big big flakes flakes yeah what's the when you put the big flakes on there's that help like retain the moisture on it or allegedly I don't know you know I cook in a Trager which I defined that the low heat and the the what I do is I cook at about 225 degrees and they have a setting called super smoke so it sort of accentuates the smoke you know what a traitor's yeah yeah for folks who don't know it's it's a pellet grill and what pellet grills are they they use something like this table like when they make this table this is hardwood this is made out of oak they would saw the the tree and the sawdust in the past we just sort of throw out well then they figured out where you can compress that sawdust and turned it into these pellets using the natural sugars from the wood so there's no chemicals at all and there's a lot of like really good ones but you know the one that I use as a trigger and when they compress these pellets there's a heating element that's electrically fired inside the the grill that heating element turns into flame in turn it cooks the pellets and turns it into fire so it's just fire and wood it's really pure so you're just basically cooking over wood and it's you can perfectly regulate the temperature and you do it on your app and all that stuff but because it's so well insulated and I cook most what I cook is wild game which is very low in fat mm-hmm so you really can't you really shouldn't cook at high heat or for any long period of time you got them you got to make sure you monitor the temperature of the actual food itself so I like to put it in there and I get it up to about a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty degrees then I sear it on a cast-iron frying pan usually in beef tallow beef day yeah the best for that so I get some more extra fats healthy fats with that I've been doing a lot of slow cooking lately I'll go in phases where I'll be drilling I got to get a palette girl with all those things look pretty sweet I'll hook up I'll hook you up I'll have triggers anyone Oh awesome happy great dude they're living once you use one it's like I have a regular grill it's just fucking gathering dust yeah I don't even touch it anymore cuz it's you could do everything on this thing and it's so easy to maintain the exact perfect temperature and again for game like I'm not cooking at a high I'm not worried as much about losing moisture so it's mostly a flavor thing I really just love the flavor of like the salty on the outside and then especially when it's seared you know it's just nice yeah yeah you know I I think like that the low and slow is the way to go for a lot of that stuff and yeah when I do a when I roast uh I'll get like a roast I'll put it in a slow cooker and ultimately some of the fat will separate and kind of form on the top and always take that off and use it cook eggs and stuff later so it's ooh that's nice yeah yeah a lot of people have their own idea about what to do and what not to do but I I learned this from a guy named Chad Ward his uh label on Instagram is whiskey bent BBQ oh yeah and he's a world champion pitmaster this fucking guy can cook his ass oh my god he's cooked for us a few times in in hunting camps and his food is insane he's so good and that's his philosophy is the reverse sear meth is where I learned it from I learned it from him a lot of times people will cook it they're sear it on the outside and then they try to finish it off and you can do that that way but it's not as good it's better to bring it up to temperature slowly inside like a pellet grill another good method is Susie do you ever sous-vide things I I haven't yet I've had it from restaurants before though yeah I was talking to someone they said a lot of restaurants now do that just so they can kind of make their all their stuff more uniform so ya go and you get exactly what you did the last time yeah they don't no one fucks up because if you go you know you can go to restaurant order medium-rare and it comes out well right yeah I've had that happen right but the sous-vide method is fantastic too because say if you have a steak and you want that steak to be a hundred and thirty-five degrees you basically put the the the setting at 135 degrees you can put it in there for four hours mm-hmm so when you get it it's just all the tendons and ligaments and all that stuff is just broken down all the fash is broken down and it's just so tender but it feels weird because you're boiling in a fucking plastic bag that seems so wrong it's like you're not I mean I know it's a different kind of plastic but you're not even supposed to drink water if you're lastic yeah if your plastic bottles been sitting in a hot car mm-hmm it's like how the fuck can you apparently you can that's not an issue at all you know to cook in it you know but it makes me feel weird if eventually we'll here in five years that that's going to give us cancers I don't know man I don't think so what is the reason why they can okay here we're going down a rabbit hole oh let's try let's go down the Suvi rabbit hole why is it okay to Suvi your food and why doesn't it leak what is it BC peas is that what they're worried about BCA's bps just a bunch of B and a bunch of other letters which is supposed to be what you get this isn't some NASA scientists have figured it out all right maybe not maybe the same guy who said smoking is fine you know doctors prefer camel yeah and you know I don't think we're dealing with that but it just it feels weird but it for as far as flavor it's a phenomenal way to cook a particularly wild game it's really good for because again you don't overcook it like if you want to cook an elk steak to 130 degrees and then blowtorch the outside that's what a lot of people do mm-hmm you know that's how you finish on a su V you basically use a fucking blowtorch uh-huh oh so I have this I guess it's like the Elon Musk flamethrower in the background I literally could use that yeah because it's basically the same thing it's just a fucking torch and you torch the outside of it to get a nice you know caramelized crust and then the inside you know it's perfect super tender yeah what does it say Jamie you don't like it does it say it's gonna kill you the first one just says like there's after consider amount of research that's been done we believe the answer is it's safe and it's like they believe it is a little window well I feel like if you know cooking it every day like when the director of The Cove was in here I always fucking have a hard time saying is less Soho yes so hey Louie Psihoyos was in here he was explaining how he was eating a lot of fish before I became a vegan he he was eating a ton of fish and his mercury levels it really shot out because a lot of fish that's like a lot of fucking mercury and if you eat fish for morning noon and night every day day after day after day you can develop high mercury mercury levels but then I talked to other scientists they said yes if you're eating it every day all day but if you just eat it fish like once a week you're fine like don't worry about it or even twice a week so I was like oh did they say anything cuz I remember like when I think was probably when the Mediterranean diet got popular people were all in on salmon and stuff and seafood and then it's everyone wild-caught yeah and I guess that's where you'd get the mercury but then they would say like the farm-raised salmon are not as good for you for whatever reason but then I guess now farm-raised is what you're supposed to get because that's gonna there can control that environment and make sure I heard with Louise saying those that it's even worse oh really yeah in terms of like the heavy metals and targets got to think they're just sitting there yeah like it's like at least in the ocean they're they're migrating they're moving around they're swimming in different places like that that podcast that I did with him was so disturbing because I've always had this weird not weird just this sort of peripheral fear of what we're doing to the ocean you know this like thing like man whoa how many assholes are out there just giant Nets just pulling fish out of the ocean right now as we speak and how how much is that sustainable yeah and I think individual people fishing is sustainable right that's not what's going on it's just huge Nets they're just scooping up everything and the the conversation that I had with him scared the shit out of me for the future of the ocean because what was what's been done the amount of damage has been done over a hundred years it's very similar to the amount of damage that was done sort of at the end of the the end of the 18th century the beginning of the 19th century in the United States worth market hunters it basically wiped out almost every animal wiped out the Buffalo do you know when they were shooting the Buffalo they were basically shooting him further hides and their tongues and they would leave the carcasses to rot yeah which is just insane we think about bison today is like one of the most cherished meats right because it's so delicious and so good for it high in protein and taste great yeah but we basically almost wiped out every animal on this entire continent until they stepped in and decided to start regulating hunting and stopping it and then sort of made concerted efforts to reintroduce animals and still most of them are not if they're historic range yeah yeah no it's uh you know it gets interesting you start looking into some of that stuff but uh hopefully they get the the bison herd back to where they need to well they kind of have that I mean there's there's basically a healthy supply of bison but not the ocean well the thing is like the same thing that we did not wait you and I weren't a lot but the human beings did in North America they're doing right now the world is doing to the ocean yeah and there's no real concerted effort to reintroduce these animals or surficial sure I see what you're saying yeah so we're essentially not learning from our past mistakes well yeah we're just and it's also there's too many people involved the thing about the ocean is it's kind of unregulated right right yeah whose is it it's the Wild West out there it's just this big gigantic swath of its it's basically like another world that's connected to our world you know it's a water world we have the land world and the land monsters going to the water world with these floating little fucking killing machines and suck all the living forces and living beings out of the water world and then serve it up on rice sushi ah I mean healthy you know it's just it's weird are you still doing you you were doing a podcast with dr. Shaun Baker right yeah yeah it's a human performance outliers podcast we've been and I think we've got maybe 175 episodes now so we've been also you guys are still a hall at it yeah yeah we're not we we had a stretch where we're doing about three a week but we've kind of backed off a little bit of that we're just scheduling and stuff this how do you do it do you do it over the phone yeah that's always the hardest part where is he he's he saw down in in Southern California okay you're in FINA onna and so do you have guests and do that over the phone yeah we'll bring them in and we'll record with exhume video recording and then bring it up but that's always the hardest part is getting the audio quality for that it's awkward too right yeah I really I've only done over the last few years I did the Snowden interview which I did remotely and I did one with dr. Anthony West who's an Egyptologist I did it with him but most most of the time when you do it with the with Skype or anything along those lines it's like you're kind of talking over each other this is weird delay it feels inorganic uh-huh yeah in-person is the way to go you know if you can do it so props to you well I just I just don't I mean I just don't I don't like it it feels I feel I don't feel connected mmm all right it feels awkward yeah it doesn't doesn't make a good product I don't think as good a product no for sure yeah you're taking a step back if you do remote for sure so yeah but it's been it's been a cool experience just from a learning standpoint I mean we I don't think we really have a specific direction I mean Shawn's Shawn's kind of the guy that everyone let's do it from the carnivore things so I think sometimes we get identified as carnivore but we definitely go down at a bunch of different rabbit holes like we did um we've had a lot of like some of the protein researchers come on and talk about some of that stuff like dr. Stu Phillips or professors do Phillips professor down Lehman professor hose-down told me you mean about proteins toughly different qualities of protein yeah they're doing like the protein research they're kind of the guys who are on the doing some of the more recent research and looking at like well what are our protein needs for I across like a variety of Ages as well as when you introduce athletics and then like what does the quality verses or like I guess maybe the best way to look at is like the bioavailability of different protein sources and things like that and I think there's a you it seems like something that we we'd have figured out already but there's I guess some nuance with that even and now we're they're saying that there's probably reason to believe that our our recommendations should be higher than what they have been historically especially for athletes and elderly folks and but you mean the RDA yeah yeah the RDA as it currently stands is basically just to prevent disease right mm-hmm yeah something like that and I think they're I think they maybe are learning more too about just kind of what role protein plays in bone health - as opposed to just because people think of protein as just this building block for muscle but there's a lot that goes into it with with bone bone health as well so those guys that were really interesting to hear hear about and we've done a lot of stuff with ranchers and some of the like the savory salads and folks come on the show and talk about kind of that practice versus kind of your standard agricultural production math dates and things like that savory sound you mean Joel Salatin what itwhat is savory like Allan savory Sookie that Allan savory Joel Salatin will Harris from white oak pastures on Bobby Gill he's part of the savory Institute's come on I just kind of share with us like kind of where that stuff is axe I think there's a lot of guesswork and unanswerable questions at this point with with that some of that stuff because we're projecting like you know way down the road with some of this stuff are you talking about the difference between grain-fed versus grass-fed meat yeah and most specifically with those guys to just like kind of what it's doing to the soil health in the soil quality mm-hmm so one thing that I've learned that was interesting was that I mean we kind of start to like throw a lot of these different like quote unquote regenerative type regenerative type practices into one bucket or one category when in reality there's a lot of different variants within them so someone can say like Oh regenerative agriculture is gonna save the planet and then someone will go dig up a bunch of studies that show like well no it actually doesn't do anything and then like yeah I'm confusing that because Chris crecer is all in on this regenerative agricultural thing but it has there it's a real evidence that you can have a zero carbon gain yeah I mean it's that's the that's the the the net positive the idea is that if you use regenerative agriculture meaning the animals graze there there's you're not talking to mono crop environments that these cows graze on open fields of grass and then they shit all over the place and then you know that that shit becomes manure and that this actually helps the plant life grow and all this stuff sort of it all becomes a part of a cycle you had this regenerative practice is actually instead of raising the carbon footprint it actually makes a carbon neutral footprint yeah yeah and I think where sometimes it gets confusing is if you go and you just look at Studies on regenerative agriculture you get a lot of mixed information so what I was told and I'm still kind of going down this rabbit hole and the way I like to look at all these type of things is I try to like look at one side of the story and then look to the other side and see where the counters are to that and just kind of go back and forth until you hit a dead end and then you know if you hit a dead end like that's where you're at for now until you've something else gets introduced and where I got to now is okay I think of as maybe we'll Harris told us this that when you're looking for these studies on kind of what practice is gonna be good in terms of like soil regeneration you have to look up adaptive multi paddock grazing because if you look up like holistic or regenerative agriculture you're going to get a whole mess of like different ranges are different types of it and you know some are effective some aren't so it's really hard to kind of piece out you know who's got the accurate stuff and not and I mean I think ultimately some of this stuff is we just don't know yet it was the one who that's most of what you just an adaptive multi paddock grazing and what does that mean it just means like your instead of kind of your your it's a rotational grazing from what I understand but you're kind of moving the the herd along to these different products and then they're like you know they're doing their thing you know what would you consider like a natural way likely would have been before we came in and shot all the Buffalo and all that stuff and then they're rotating it so the way I've been on I've understood it like the more of those paddocks you can get the better because then you're letting the the soil and the and everything in there like really heal and and develop that deep root system as well as some of that microbiome like all the insects and things that would be in there right and all that stuff so you would need massive amounts of land and massive amounts of areas for them to graze I think yeah I mean I think you would need I think the more the better is probably the way to look at it but hopefully the the soil biologists are cringing yeah I'm sure there are we apologize in advance but like the interesting thing though is like I mean I think there's a lot of work to be done in looking at this and finding out the best way to maybe utilize it but the thought the part that I thought was really interesting is with the will Harris white oak pastures thing they just I think this study is maybe over utilized by like the the pro regenerative or multi paddock group to a degree because it's like it's what they have I mean it's what they're looking for they're looking for a specific answer meaning this is good this is the way we found a way where you can eat meat and not feel bad yeah yeah and it's the thing that's compelling about that study to me is the the way it kind of happened was essentially what happened was will Harris and WeDo Packers they were they were raising raising animals for for epic bar like that that was one of their buyers and epic bar got acquired by was General Mills and so General Mills looked at what epic bar was claiming when they were the independent and they were saying like our stuff is regenerative ours you know you eat you buy our product and you're giving back versus taking kind of a mindset and I think General Mills was skeptical about that so they spent I think was like $80,000 to go in and have a study done on on will Harris's White Oaks pasture to really see if they could back that claim up and they went in and they did the study and it actually showed like on that carbon sequestration versus like they weren't even neutral they actually pulled in more than they put out so this is from epics particular type of farming that they at least at White Oaks pasture so I mean again that's one specific situation or one specific environment or area so I think where people run into maybe a potential problem is can we extrapolate that forward to other areas are we gonna get that same result or is it gonna be different right that's what's important too I mean it and it really is important to look at that honestly mm-hmm because even though you do have this one area is that because of the environment where this farm is taking place is it because the particular soil soil quality like what are the factors that allow them to have so it's it it actually takes carbon out of the atmosphere like a certain percentage so instead of adding carbon it actually removes some yeah because I guess the the way was described to me is that the inputs of that type of system are so low that like you're not look as if you'd look at just a normal like agricultural setup you know you have all these inputs of like manure and all these other things that are going add to that then that net effect or that that that net negative effect of animal agriculture so when you reduce the inputs down to next to nothing because your inputs are all kind of just manpower where you're moving these things around and letting the natural course of things happen all the time that's where you can maybe minimize some of these like I guess put you maybe call out to cut tertiary damage of animal agriculture but you know I think I think we probably have a lot to learn and stuff with that stuff too but it's one of the things when I think about it's like it hopefully we're spending a lot of time looking at that stuff because if they're right about the number of harvests we have left I think what is estimated we have I 60 harvests left I mean clearly regardless of whether you're vegan carnivore or somewhere in between you know we need quality soil right right what about hydroponic because I know that there are some large-scale hydroponic operations that are growing vegetables and things along those lines and some people think that there's real promise in that because you're not you're not using soil at all you're not using you're not devastating they're already depleted ground soil and you also don't need to do all the the harmful things that are involved in mono crop agriculture right like the the devastation on the wildlife the displacement of wildlife pesticides combines they're indiscriminately indiscriminately chewing up small rodents and bugs and rabbits and anything else that gets caught in their blades yeah yeah you know that'd be interesting I don't know a whole lot about it other than what it is so I mean I'm all for solutions yeah somebody sent me a link to something that some indication that there might be some promise and hydroponic agriculture but so but the thing about this whole idea was the name of the farm were that this was done where there's light oak white are catchers is that sustainable like nationally I'm gonna forget about global ability even nationally in terms of like the the needs that people have for for B for me we we use so much beef in this country yeah I don't know for sure like what the scalability of that would be my guess is like at this point it would be because it's pretty small like even from a percentage standpoint of what is how much of that type of process is being used it's like a single percentage or something like that so we're all grass-fed meat right all grasping yeah meat is like less than 3% yeah so it seems like we'd have a long ways to go but I mean I guess the the counter to that would also be were essentially going back to what we would have been doing historically mm-hmm and so it's not necessarily like reinventing the wheel as much as it is just saying okay what we did here obviously is not sustainable or potentially not sustainable so let's look at well what did we do to get back to where we were before I guess maybe is the way to look at that but how did you get linked up with Shawn but Shawn is such a polarizing figure because yes he's the carnivore go-to guy and he's like a full-on carnivore zealot as it were yeah I mean he doesn't even he thinks vegetables are bad for me so I think Shawn sometimes gets misrepresented and part of it is just like you know way he interacts on social media and stuff but he's uh you know I met Shawn like before he I think went full carnivore but on Twitter and we I thought he was an interesting person not because of what he ate so what's he doing back then was he was he was kind of more like high fat low carb I think something pretty similar to what I've been doing maybe maybe less carbohydrates since his activity levels are like really short and fast and you know I just thought he was an interesting person because of his background I mean he's you know a Highlands game athlete professional rugby player he's doing this high-intensity gigantic yeah yeah I mean he's twice my size like it so it's like my thought is like okay here's a guy who has a similar nutrition plan that I do but he's doing the exact opposite athlete type stuff he's twice the size of me like if we're kind of two ends that expect ends of the spectrum from like an athletic standpoint so like I was just interested in kind of like you know what he was doing and what he was up to and that's kind of why we started the podcast together and but yeah I mean when you one of the things that she always says on the podcast I think is is a kind of a better reflection I mean it'll say I don't the only thing I know for certain is that I'm wrong about something so it's like you know it it gets I think it gets tough for someone like him who gets identified as the the face of the carnivore movement because then like you get all the positive and a negative coming your way too and I mean you can feed into that but I mean when we when we record our podcasts and stuff is he I mean he's a very open-minded person we're looking for answers and we're asking questions and things like that and it's it's it's you know it's a learning experience I think for me anyway so well he clearly enjoys fucking with vegans well yeah and it's he's been on this fruitarian kick lately which is kind of hilarious i didn't know there was that many of those people out there yeah one of them just died one one fruitarian doctor died during a fast really yeah and Shaun was talking about on his YouTube channel there there's people out there that think that you could just get by by only eating fruit mmm Jesus Christ folks you know I've got a theory with like social media and that stuff in general is that like for a lot of a lot of the people who are most active on it it's like they're they either take it 100% serious or it's like kind of a joke or a game and then when those two polar ends meet it's that's where you get the big kind of like you like blow up interactions and then yeah and then it becomes the like kind of a game of like well the vegan told me that like I should die or something like that so now I'm gonna go tell that vegan that you know this is that and it goes back and forth back and forth back so stupid this is such a waste of time but the most interest the one I always get a kick out of though along those lines is someone will come up with like a picture of like here's here's the humans you know jaw system and this clearly means were were frugivores and then someone will say well look at the the digestive tract of a human being it is clearly designed more to be eating meat or animal products and you know they go back and forth with different like parts of the human anatomy to try to like prove that were vegetarian or vegan fruitarian organs are so stupid and then I'm thinking the whole time I'm like so what we have here is people who can have to have specific traits that are good for eating fruits and vegetables and some specific traits they're good for eating animal products so we're omnivores it's biologically it's been established not there's no real controversy the controversies fake look particularly from the vegans where they say they were herbivores and our jaws are designed to crush you know right roots and shit like no no no we had tools and fire yeah for fucking hundreds of thousands of years you knuckleheads you know who one of them of my favorite podcast we've done was with this guy uh dr. bill Schindler he's an archaeologist I would have I think it's Washington University and he's such a cool dude he like totally what he said something I was really resonated with me where he said you know humans were were unique in that like we we we've we've like over time developed ways to use like tools and things like that to liberate nutrients so to look at anything in its raw state is kind of the missed the point of why humans are the way they are sure we'll like lentils mm-hmm right I've seen this argument that human beings aren't supposed to eat meat because if we were we would be able to just wrap it apart and eat it with our own teeth and go go eat a squirrel with your face well guess what you can eat a squirrel with your face if you're so inclined if you really wanted to do that you could do it without tools uh-huh you know you can't do you can't eat a lot of beans if I'm cooking them like we have we've figured things out folks I mean cassava in the jungle they figured out that you have to cook this stuff and strain it and it's a primary staple of the diets of many people that live in the in the jungle you know and it's fucking toxic is shit if you don't do that I mean it literally produces cyanide cyanide is produced by ska Tsavo which is like one of their primary foods they just figured it out just like you figured out you have to boil lentils just like you figured out you have to cook beans uh-huh I mean you can't eat most of these things that we eat are not good to eat if you just eat them in their raw state some things like fruits are some vegetables are but some just are not and this is the same with meat and this this idea that you're supposed to be where we're clearly an herbivore because of the fact that we you know we're not supposed to be you know killing animals with our teeth like that's so dumb like we we kill animals with tools and we've done it for so long that our bodies have adapted we've adapted to the fact that we have clothes that's why we're not covered in hair you can fucking idiot like this is like real clear obvious stuff people who live in the coldest climates of the world aren't covered in hair you know yeah you know and it was interesting because like what you're saying too when when we had bill on the show he he's got this eunuch experience what he's actually gone in and visited these indigenous tribes have been relatively untouched by modern society to basically with the one question or level how do you eat so he's been he seemed like a variety of different stuff I think even had a show on National Geographic for a while that looked into some of this but he just to show you the polarization of what humans can kind of do he he went he visited the Sun burrow which is a branch of the Maasai over in Africa you know they're they're basically drinking blood and milk for the for a huge portion of their nutrition and you know so you have this this this tribe that's basically on a primarily animal-based nutrition plan and they're super healthy he said that there may be one of the most healthy groups of people he's seen from just like a physical stature like toothed health and that sort of thing but then he also went down to I think was in South America camera the name of the tribe but they found a way to basically liberate nutrients from a poisonous potato and Sabah is that what it was me that's what we're talking about okay yeah um yeah so I think it was maybe was cassava or maybe there's other ones yeah they think there is a purple some weird purple potato that has a similar sort of a toxic profile yeah and what he said was this this tribe they're a basically mostly potatoes what they would do is they'd literally dig like a pit and put like some like like thousands of pounds of these potatoes in there and let them sit there and like ferment I guess for like up into six months oh and then they would actually make this a clay that they would use and because there was still a toxin or something though that they needed to kind of prevent from like interacting Oh some totally different yeah so they would they take that this clay and as a potato and when they dip the potato in this clay its it like binds to that toxin so it becomes it doesn't become an issue when you eat it so like by itself that potato could potentially kill you I guess but with the clay it doesn't and so I was like how the fuck did they figure that out that's what I want to know I'm thinking like how much trial and error goes into that it's like oh this guy dropped dead this guy dropped oh this guy lived I guess there's so many things like that in the jungle you just have to really wonder how do they develop all these different menace all these different ways of eating thing it's just fascinating when like your I guess when your only goal when you wake up in the morning is to find your next meal yeah and you know kind of build build enough around so that you can kind of survive like you put a lot of time and energy into it but yeah it is interesting to think like how they all got passed along from generation to generation and how it got fine-tuned to where it is today but I think it's it's cool to look at that stuff when it just comes to your own nutrition too and kind of when you understand like it's less about like this food is net bad for me or this this food is this particular food item is bad for me across the board and this one is great for me across the board more so about well this is what this food does well this is what this one does well so let's find it like you mentioned mix and match to where you get get the profile that you're looking for yeah I think the problem is what we're saying before is that people are entering into these conversations with this this goal that they want to achieve this goal being plants are bad for you or meat is bad for you or we're supposed to be only eating meat or we're supposed to be only eating plants and here's why and you know you have this confirmation bias you're not looking at any other piece of evidence and particularly the biological variability of human beings is pretty incredible yeah I mean I can eat peanuts all day long if you're allergic to peanuts you're dead if you eat one yeah I mean it's it's uh we're we're strange creatures and what does this change you what do you got here Jamie the ancient oh here it is the ancient and ancient Andean tradition of eating clay may have helped to protect health I think it goes back to ancient Egypt I was just trying to Wow how far back this goes and probably just you could still buy clay dust right now it's my kind of looking that up too so eating dirt it's good for you yeah for this they found a way to like package the dust and right pravin clay dust this is a whole history on potatoes here it is the world and like while potatoes are laced with solanine and Toma teen toxic compounds believed to defend plants against attacks from dangerous organisms like fungi bacteria and human beings we are dangerous organisms cooking often breaks down such chemical defenses but solanine and toma teen are unaffected by heat in the Mountains I'll say that word Guan Guan echo in vicuna like llamas wild relatives of the llama lick clay before eating poisonous plants the fucking llamas figured it out the toxin stick more technically absorbed to the fine clay particles in the animal stomachs passing through the digestive system without affecting it mimicking this process mountain peoples apparently learned to dunk wild potatoes in a gravy made of clay and water eventually they bred less toxic potatoes though some of the old poisonous varieties remain flavored for their resistance to furrow favored for their resistance to frost clay dust is still sold in Peruvian and Bolivian markets to accompany them Wow interesting it's crazy I bet it tastes like shit though still dirt you're eating dirt with potatoes but look people do what they got to do to stay alive yes that's we're just so fortunate we don't have to do that it isn't go to a crossroads and have a nice vegan meal feel you want to you're not really worried about staying alive anymore we're worried ok primarily about yeah about well you know people are worried about the environment and worried about the health consequences of certain diets and the environmental consequences of certain diets and you know and these people this is what I've really gotten into after Chris crecer was on the podcast recently debunking the game changers when he was talking about the positive net benefits of regenerative farming I don't think that's clearly been established worldwide or in in large scale like in terms of and maybe it can be like can we do it right feed yeah yeah can we feed the entire country on that I mean I don't I'm not yeah you know I think that's I mean that's the million-dollar question right now - right like well how are we gonna feed however many they're predicting like how we're gonna be the 10 billion people we're going to see in X number of years and I think it's interesting and it's certainly worth thinking about but like it's also like well how far do we keep kicking that ball down the road before we find ourselves in a situation where like you know then what's the next question 15 billion 20 billion and so on and so forth and eventually like you know we just over populate the world and it ends really badly for us diseases usually follow overpopulation I think the real key for us I think is going to be and I think this is within our lifetime is going to be lab-created meat and I think they're really close to doing that and I think if you have some sort of ethical lab-created nutritious meat where you don't have to worry about suffering or death if if this has been established then we open up a whole new avenue of exploration because now you can say okay all these people that are vegan for this moral and ethical sort of dilemma that they have with animal agriculture killing animals suffering let's take all that out now you can eat lab-created meat that has absolutely no suffering attached to it let's find out how healthy things really are and let's find out how many people stay vegan and how many people revert to more omnivorous diet which I mean there's time this is something that vegans hate to hear but it is a fact eighty-four percent of people who start a vegan diet quit now is that because of taste is that because of and then there's the argument that well people that do it over a long period of time you get a higher retention rate that's fine but eighty-four percent still is the number it doesn't matter if you get a high retention rate for people that have doing it more than two years in more than three years I'll give you stick with it you can do it no they're just more committed but the reality is 84 percent quit this is what's been firmly established what what would the number be if there was a cycle humane lab created meat that had no suffering attached to it at all it's just science-based it's just made with compounds and you know whatever they use to create this stuff that would be interesting it'd be interesting to find out could we eliminate large-scale animal agriculture in favor of lab-created meat and what if any environmental factors would there be that would be negative that we're attached to lab-created me because you have to think whenever you're making anything right industrial large-scale you're gonna have waste what is that waste can that waist be mitigated can they figure out some sort of a way to have some sort of net positive effect where waste is utilized in some sort of form where it's it actually can contribute to the natural processes of you know soil regeneration and manure and you know you composting and things along those lines ya know I think it's I think it's interesting and we're in a interesting time for sure it'll be interesting to see where they get with with that and and everything else with that and you know it you brought up an interesting point too not to keep going down the rabbit hole but the other thing that I thought really interesting was when you look at waste components I feel like we're not maybe looking at that as much as as we should be when we're talking about trying to feed a bunch of people's like well maybe we should start with what we're throwing away that we wouldn't have - oh yeah and I think like at first I just thought like well you know there's a lot of food thrown away at restaurants there's a lot of stuff that's thrown away just because it doesn't meet standards for like the grocery store it's like let's start there and I actually had asked dr. Schindler about that he actually did a study with some of his grad students where they looked at I think I took 30 white-tailed deer and they they processed it down to like the very last potential calorie to find out how much is wasted even in like a you know a deer that the say you go and you shoot a deer and then you could take it to the the process and get it all done he said it was between I think it was between like 13 to 30 days worth of human nutrition that gets wasted you know a single white-tailed deer so like well here's the problem with that idea a waste is only if you do something with it if you leave it in the field there's no waste right but if you just killed a deer that it's not it just left it there there's no waste it's you're feeding animals right I mean they're going to absolutely destroy that thing it's gonna be gone in a short period of time including the bone so it'll delete the bones and if they don't eat the bones the bones will eventually deteriorate and become part of the soil this is what happens when animals die sure so I guess maybe the way to look at them is like what are we if we're looking to just if our objective is to feed as many people as possible and we're maximizing the amount of nutrients we can acquire from a specific thing like we're leaving a lot on the table or we're giving a lot to different areas like different animals and things that are going well we're doing it wrong you know we're putting our waste and bags and throwing it into the ground fills I mean it landfills have you seen they did this aerial study of Los Angeles they're trying to find out where most of the methane comes from they were trying to go it's fuckin landfills man landfills are disgusting and this is not how it's supposed to be it's supposed to be animals so are supposed to have access to what's left over I mean this is what would happen if a bear killed a moose all right if a bear killed a moose that's gonna consume a big portion of the body and then it's gonna leave whatever is left and then rodents and vultures and and then eventually insects and bacteria are gonna break it down and this is a natural cycle of life for animals this is how it's supposed to be what we do is we take it we cut it up we eat some of it we throw some of it away we put that in a plastic bag we zip tie it we've did a fucking hole in the ground and we throw that bag in there it's not it's ludicrous yeah it's we know better we do know better we understand the whole process of these things breaking down in the wild and what happens to them we understand there's animals that their entire diet consists of eating animals that other animals have killed and they leave some of it behind that's we're supposed to leave it behind it's supposed to be a part of the whole cycle of life we were supposed to compost all these things are supposed to be natural weed you know when I was a kid my mom and my stepdad were part of this cooperative farm thing and we started composting and I'm we didn't do it for very long because we eventually wound up moving and we stopped we stopped being a part of this thing but I thought it was really interesting because I was a little kid or thing like oh I never thought of that before you take your food waste and you separate it from like paper uh-huh give your paper waste and then you have like leftover tomatoes or something like that and all that would go into one specific bin and that bin would go into this big thing it was like it was made with like chicken wire and leaves and you had a lid over it and like it was a wood box and you would throw everything in there and it would all sort of rot in compost and then you would take that stuff and you would use it in the garden and this is this is how composting is done this is how fertilizer is made and this is what you're supposed to do yeah this is like small-scale regenerative farming and what we're doing is assholes we take our food we put in fucking bags we zip tie it shut and we chuck it in the ground it's dumb it's a really dumb way of doing things I just feel like that there's something that we could really leverage at the educational level like yeah we've got schools where we we were housing these kids and like you know one of the biggest hurdles I think is like we got them indoors sitting in desks for seven eight hours a day and then we what why not get them out and learn that and do that and we have these mini little like regenerative areas sure then you learn it and then it doesn't get forgotten when you're an adult as easily but we're so enamoured with this idea of working you know we're so enamored with this idea of getting a job we're so enamored with this idea of the structure of civilization as it stands in 2019 is the way to go so we're teaching kids how to complete this this life that they're born into the way it's established for their parents the way it's established for their neighborhood get in your car drive to work work all day come home you know eat what you can throw the rest of the garbage go back to work in the morning and this is nonsense this is not how you have to do it you don't you don't have to do anything there's a bunch of different ways to live this life and there's only a hundred years if you're lucky so this thing that we're setting up we're setting up kids to essentially be as miserable as everybody else before them doing the exact same thing that everybody else has done like maybe you can get lucky like I have been or like you've been and you find something that you actually enjoy doing then you get lucky like oh my god you know Zak found a job that he really loves and he got really good at it and now he actually has joy in what he does but there's there's a lot of different places in this this country alone where you can live and you could do things in a non-traditional manner and you can get by and you probably be healthier and happier than someone that gets stuck in the same goddamn Civilization cycle this industrialized cycle sure that we're all in and we don't teach kids that well we teach kids is here's history hears math get your SATs in get the score go to the college that you want get a job and this is the the standard path that seems to be rewarded and this is what and if you say well I'm gonna drop out and find myself oh good luck loser you know you're gonna fuck up your life you know what are you doing man you don't even go into college Jesus Christ like and it's very unfortunate that we have this incredibly rigid system and and it really makes people feel like made me feel like a failure I didn't fit into the system I just because of I have a DD or whatever emotional issues whatever I had I just could not sit still in class and concentrate I had way too much fucking energy and this is just this was just not for me I was twiddling my thumbs and tapping the floor and looking at the clock and a critic luck yes when that fucking thing hit I was gone and I didn't want to do home I'd literally didn't do any homework my entire high school career I didn't do anything I just got by being smart enough to pass tests by learning what I learned in class and not putting in any fucking extra effort I just wanted to get out and I found something that I was good at I figured it out I file I got lucky that I did that but for a lot of people they just live these lives of frustration you know and they never do find and they're not taught to find a thing and there's also I think there's a great satisfaction to working on something that you enjoy whether it's working with your hands or working on something that's creative and working with the land you know you talked to people that run their own little organic farms like I know this couple that runs an organic farm and man when they talk about their their food they talk about the vegetables they grow and the stuff they grow they like beam excited about it they're excited is it's a natural there's there's an there's natural there's a gravity that we have towards that it's a natural human reward to be able to cultivate your own food if you didn't make a salad out of some stuff that you grew yourself man that feels amazing it really does and there's people that could be making a living doing that and they're never encouraged to do so and they might be way happier than selling insurance yeah yeah no I I think I could feed other people to men that's the other thing like if you could figure out a way to run an organic garden and you do compost you don't use pesticides you do everything organic and everything is regenerative and you actually can feed people oh my god wait how good would you feel pretty satisfying yes yeah I would think I would think really satisfying it's not for everybody it's gotta be for somebody yeah and they're not being no one's teaching you that it's cool right yeah you have to be one of those outside the box thinkers because schools essentially set up for scale right it's gonna set up for you got 500 kids you got to turn them into not losers yeah good 500 kids to not be a loser well just standard path you know like this like standard American diet so exist entered American education these like standard paths that will work for X amount of people you get ten people seven of them won't be losers if you just shove them into this machine and pump them out in this fuckin form yeah it's a bummer uh-huh we're now here we're getting education advice from the ultra marathon runner yeah but you're a good guy to get education advice from blood was a teacher for five years so well it's also you're you're a successful guy at an unusual thing you know you found a thing that you really excel at that you actually enjoy yeah and that is for so many people the ultimate goal of life like if you can make a lot of money in this life but you will not be as happy in so it's really contrary to like capitalist ideas like we were taught to think that the more money you make them to happier you'll be that's definitely not true but you will make more money if you're happier with what you do which is sounds like a contradiction but it's not you'll excel and if you're excelling you'll profitable obviously there's some things that you can excel out that are just there's no fucking way to make a lot of money as a bowler you know if you like I'm really in a bowling well you're kind of fucked because it's just one of those things that nobody gives a shit about everybody something else you're interested in - yeah yeah that'd be nice you found something actually paid the bills but if you can find something that you enjoy you'll have an infinitely happier life it's just you you can do that you just have to find those you have to explore those things and I think that's where we fail kids we failed kids and giving them this landscape of possibilities that actually does exist I think there's a landscape of possibilities for what you can do and everyone is gently I don't want to be an ultramarathon runner man right if you and I are competing I'm fucked okay I'm not going to win I'm not gonna excel I'm built like a champ I'm not I'm not the guy that's supposed to be running 200 miles it's just your realm and it's also it's not what I don't desire to do that conversely if you had to become a stand-up comedian you'd probably like well fuck this I don't want to do any thinking about things that's funny and the first time you bomb you're like what am I doing with my life and it's everybody has a different personality and these different personalities and these different interests and desires they take different paths and I think we need to open that up to people more and and just sort of in some way encourage people to seek more to seek to genuinely try to find the things that interest you maybe you should be a fly fishing guide you know maybe you should be a guy who makes homemade mugs out of exotic hardwood you know maybe you know maybe you're a knife maker maybe you're a person who maybe should make fucking dream catchers I don't know don't make dream catchers does anybody really like dream catchers those like something you buy and then you put it on the wall and you go what the fuck am i doing am i pretending I'm in a Native American or something but there's things you can do men you just have to find that thing and I think that's so hard for people and that's why people when they find someone like yourself that's doing this unusual unorthodox thing and you're extremely successful at it that becomes so attractive to people to hear your story yeah and I think yeah I it's I would've never guessed I'd be doing what I'm doing now 10 years ago it's yes equally surprising to me I think sometimes but it you know it is it is interesting when you think about just where you thought you would maybe be and then where you end up and all that stuff in-between and ultimately I think if you I think you want to be be smart about stuff like I didn't necessarily just quit my job and Sam would be an ultramarathon runner you kind of have like a few different options available or you just keep options open to like for me personally I like to coach too so I'm gonna do some of that and that supplement things and then you know podcasting has always been a fun thing to do so historically I always go on podcast and then a couple years ago it was like well if it's this much fun to go go on them it must be fun to do them too so you know starting these other I think when people start kind of really exploring where their curiosities are you find these different avenues to and it just kind of snowballs a little bit as opposed to being maybe you start out making the dreamcatcher and then you become something else that's right you just get really in the feathers yeah did you ever think about doing something like do you get revelations post training do some other things I always have after like really good hard workouts first of all I'm always feel filled with gratitude yeah I'm always like really thankful yeah after long hard workouts and I've thought about doing this thing called the gratitude series where I do a podcast like immediately after like really hard work out nice and just talk about my feelings and I mean it sounds fucking corny and it's and self-indulgent but but realistically I think there are some lessons that I learned off of really hard workouts you know where it's like at the end of it you know when it's all done first of all there's always this feeling like eight out of ten times I don't want to work out mm-hmm really eight out of ten I work out ten out of ten uh-huh but eight out of ten I'm like fuck this you're always happy always always and that's the hump man yeah that that fucking hump of just shot that part of your brain up and just start moving and then once you start moving you start breaking a sweat once you start breaking a sweat it becomes easier it starts feeling good then you start getting some satisfaction like ooh I almost didn't do this today Here I am doing it and you know and then sometimes it's fucking you know sometimes I'm looking at a three-mile run which is nothing for you but a mile in I'm like fuck two more to go Jesus Christ and I'm running Hills eat shit but when it's over it's like yes you know when I get back to the car and I'm saying hi to people hey what's up wave it in the neighbors dogs exhausted I'm happy everybody's pumped you know it's like and I feel good I feel warm I feel friendly I feel loving I feel you know I want to call people and tell I care about them it's like it's like there's moments like post-workout in particular where you just feel really good and I think life is sometimes about getting over those periods of feeling kind of shitty or low-energy or lethargic or unrest it or whether the fuck it is and just pushing through that because you know the territory you've been there before and then developing a habit of being able to do that and being able to know and have faith in the process and understand that this yeah yeah yeah I know you don't want to do it shut the fuck up and go just go yeah once you do go you always feel better yeah no I hundred percent agree and I think in my own training like I get that from a lot of different workouts but the one that I really love is like when I get closer to a race and I was saying before you start dialing things in to be more specific to the to the activity you're trying to prepare for I'll do a phase of training where I'm running kind of in an area of about like 150 155 beats per minute so I can go like on a it's it's just fast enough where I feel like I'm really kind of like working but it's also slow know if I can go for quite a while so I can like log a really big run and when I was training for this last race that at the Pettit Center I had a training cycle where I hit I had a four-week block where I had one D load week which is basically reduction of volume and intensity and three billers recalls D low d load because I'm like reducing volume and intensity and the other three though were build up on-site like 130 mile week some right around hundred thirty and then 250 mile weeks and they were just like basically loaded with like kind of just faster than or right about kind of hundred mile intensity so you know I would do and you can maybe pull it up I think I have a picture on my Instagram page of the I did these key workouts where I'd go to a track and I would just do loops around the track and it'd be like anywhere between 27 to like 32 miles at that kind of intensity and you just get into like a flow and a rhythm and it just once you kind of get moving it feels great and afterwards yeah you you feel great the whole rest of the day and you just want to kind of go and do it again you almost have to be careful not to not to do too much but who structures those do you structure them yourself yeah yeah it's going to go back to where in the beginning like when I structure a plan ideally I start out I start out with a good base a good aerobic base which I typically kind of retain almost year-round I'll take like offseason but I like to follow principle where I'll let myself kind of lose some of that peak fitness just so it's sustainable because staying at your peak fitness level is not sustainable so I let myself get like just out of shape enough so that I'm not always at that level and then I start kind of building in the structure towards the race itself which starts with those shorter faster intervals since they're further away and then I get closer and closer to the race where I'm doing things that are more specific so like the next step would be I'd be doing some longer intervals or kind of like what you consider like an anaerobic threshold type workout which generally speaking is about like your max intensity if you did like a 60-minute all-out time trial and then you know that's still not specific to 100 miles because I'm out there for 11 hours so I'm kind of still moving closer to that slower race pace yeah and it's a it may just follows the principle of you know hitting all the systems of training like you would in any other paradise endurance plan but always keeping that compass of the stuff you do for the earth intensity of the race itself is the type of work you should be doing closest to it so you're really just optimizing when you're closer to the race itself how do you know what your peak fitness is like when you say that you wanna you can't really maintain the peak fitness you want to back off a little bit so that you can just keep your your training running how do you know where that is and how do you know that you cannot expand that and then ya know that's a great question that's somewhat subjective too I mean you can analyze things if you want to go into like heart rate variability type things if you but that's a little more on the micro level for me personally like usually I'll get to a point where like I'll do a race and you know you can just kind of tell like I'm exhausted from that and I like to think of it kind of two folded where like physical recovery and mental recovery so if I do a big race and afterwards like I can't even like bring myself to think of another big training block I know I need to like let myself kind of get a little bit out of that fitness state that peak fitness state and just kind of reset or hidden that button this is just from years and years Tyler and you mission stakes I mean in the past you know a lot of times they'll do well big I think I got one more race left for me then it goes badly right now what is a long day like say if you're getting prepared for this 100-mile race and you know you're gonna have to run for 11 plus hours what's a long day for you yeah so the longest run I did for this particular one was three and a half hours it was I think 32 miles or something somewhere in that neighborhood I'll do I'll do I usually don't push up much past five hours in my own training if I'm gonna do much more than that I'll just jump in a race like the nice thing about Phoenix is there's a race company called air Viper and they put on like 30-some ultra events every year so it's not Wow you can basically it's almost every weekend pretty much yeah that's crazy so like the the guy who raced direct at jamil he he'll he'll let me jump in events when I want to and so sometimes all if I'm gonna do something like say I want to preparing for 100 mile and I want to get a really long day like a seven eight hour session in you know I'll just pick like a like a hundred K type event or like you know a 50 mile or type event and just do that at like I like to say like I try to eat those are you know those a training tool so I don't want to necessarily race it all out but if you can kind of keep yourself out like maybe 80% of what you're capable of you can get that good long stimulus but not necessarily beat yourself up so much that it takes away from the race you're preparing for and so 50 miles would take you or how long would that take you it depends on the course like I just did a 50-miler actually about a week and a half ago called the JFK 50-mile that took me five hours and 42 minutes and that course is kind of it's got you go over the Appalachian Mountains for about 60 miles and you get on a really flat toe path for about a marathon and then some rolling Street Hills so that's not as fast as you can find you can find I mean you can go on a track how much elevation you're going down that one was about 3,000 feet so haha it is but the funny thing about ultramarathon especially in north america is like you know the trails are where a lot of you know there's a lot of interest there so 3,000 450 is actually considered a relatively flat fast course whoa you know it's hilarious it's really interesting too because like some of the I live just about two hours south of Flagstaff and there's a group of ultramarathon guys who train up there and they I got a lot of inspiration from from two of them specifically for this last race that race it at the Petitte Center and one guy's name is Jim Walmsley and he's from my money probably the best ultra marathoner we have certainly in North America if not the world I mean he he's got the course record at the western states 100 which is the most tested hundred mile er in North America he's got the course record at the Lake Sonoma 50-mile by a pretty big margin he's actually got the two fastest times but the next closest person him is like 18 minutes behind or something like that and then he's also got the course record the JFK 50-mile the one I just was mentioning before and these three events are three of the most tested courses that we've had and he's got the course records at all of them and he can probably go faster so I mean some of his training is like he'll do like 150 mile week sometimes with like 30,000 feet of climbing and ascending and the kicker is one of his training partners Jared Hazen so if Jim is the best ultra runner in North America has from the male side Jared Hazen is by far the most underrated so this guy he ran the western states 100 this year Jim finished first jared finished second Jim broke his course record by running 14 hours and nine minutes on a course that has 17,000 feet of climbing in 23,000 feet of descent if you ran a hundred miles with that much yeah in 14 hours in westerns yeah in western states is considered a running course for the most part - like there's crazier ones that get way worse from a climbing descending Bob yeah we have to use trekking stick yeah yeah yeah so Jarrod though Jarrod so Jim he had actually broken the course record the year before and he took like I think was like 16 or 17 minutes off the old course record around 14 and a half hours this last next year he broke his course record with the 1409 Jarrod came in second and I think it was 14 23 or 26 just behind Jim basically pushing him all day so any other time Jarrod would have won that race except for that year and it would have been like you know a huge story for him and you know it just I mean it was an amazing performance when those two guys and just watching kind of their training and then their performances cuz I was out there creaming and pacing my wife it was a huge motivator for me when I kind of got into the training build-up for that race at the penet Center so wow it's it's it's it's just funny with ultramarathon because you have such a variety again I think we talked about this bit the last time as on you can have like these 50k races that are like I mean there's 50k races have 10,000 feet of climbing and descending and then you can have these six-day events that are on a 400 meter track right which is much different yeah you are doing something really bonkers right now right you're attempting to run across the entire country and to break the record yeah so this is kind of in its infancy a bit from the planning stages so I probably won't happen in the immediate future but someone you're very familiar with actually Justin Wren yeah he's got the fight for their got and I was actually on the phone with him last night and one thing I've kind of been interested in since I started ultra running is this route it's a 30 100 mile route basically that goes from San Francisco to New York and it's been done by you know quite a few people with walking running Pete Castle Nick he's got the course record he averages like 70 miles a day yeah yeah so it's like it's it's a pretty insane route and I've always been interested in doing it and I just haven't really been motivated I guess to really attempt it or I just didn't I guess I just really didn't know when I would do it I just kind of I would and then um last year one of my one of my sponsors the f-bomb those nut butter sachets I love those yeah but my friend RZA and they believe that the name should be changed they believe nut butter has a negative connotation to heterosexual males who think that it's sounds like something comes out of your deck a name change but maybe good well I guess in their defense theirs is called f-bomb not not better right so right right engine hums better right it's a better name yeah yeah stuff I love their stuff ya know they make a great product and they had actually proposed a Laster that I think they just were maybe spitballing a little bit but they're like hey ever interested in doing that like go running you know doing that cross country route and I was like yeah I've been actually wanting to do that at some point I just haven't gotten around with actually planning it out how funny is that as a statement yeah I've been wanting to run thirty-one hundred miles across the fucking continent and try to beat the record which averaged 60 to 70 miles a day god damn dude how would you prepare for that uh yeah you know I mean I might be in super unchartered territory because I've just haven't done anything like that before so it would be difficult you'd be a lot of learning on the fly I think really the big key thing there is you're managing a lot of stuff with that like you want to make sure you're sleeping well throughout that because obviously if you're not sleeping well it could end badly for you pretty soon so then I think you just end up trying to do as much specific things as you can to prepare without going overboard so just a lot of time on feet I mean you can imagine the pace is gonna be incredibly slow there's probably be like walking breaks I'm not gonna be like you know certainly not gonna running 6040 a per mile pace but my my first thought is like I'll probably target like a 12 to 14 hour range per day and you whatever I get out of that 12 to 14 days or hours is what I get and then that gives me kind of the flexibility to have like at least ten hours of buffer to kind of like prep and sleep and get ready for the next day do you know Eddie Izzard is communion uh-huh are you aware of what he did well you ran the entire length to the UK yeah the outside of it with no training right he's an animal man he really is a special person really is a special person I remember only knowing of him as a comedian and you know had seen him do a lot of stand-up before and then I watched this documentary where he's running I mean how many mile how many different marathons was it was like 26 27 and 27 days 27 marathons in 27 days he did wind up taking one day off for his feet were literally mangled um blisters I don't imagine he wasn't in shape which is just fucking crazy just sheer willpower I mean just to do one marathon when you're not in shape I just can't imagine the the just a fucking sheer amount of just will just pure will that it takes to do something like that and to just keep pushing left right left right left right left right even though everything your head your brain your feet everything stop stop stop fuck you left right left right left right I mean he ran how many thousand miles was it the entire length of the UK over the outside too though he did 43 marathons in South Africa right 43 and 51 days was his first one and then 27 and 27 days was the second one 43 43 fucking marathons the article in 2009 Queen Elliot celebrating after finishing his 43rd marathon in 51 days he's really really interesting guy yeah he called he's he's Eddie Izzard but he's a crossdresser so he's like it's he comes out as transgender I think but not really cuz he likes women and he likes women as a man he just likes dressing as a woman he's just a really unique guy but but he owns it you know I'm saying like he is who he is sub 5 hour marathon the connection is aimed at finishing on the sub fireman Misha's target by 30 seconds give it to him honorary 15 so fucking interesting interesting look thoughtful intelligent person really enjoyed talking to him but when he's talking about these marathons like a good Lord man like it's hard enough for someone to do who's like you like for a guy like you to run 40 what how many marathons 40 what nobody say a lot let's say forward for you to run 40 marathons in 40 days it's fucking bonkers right yeah that'd be a that'd be a bigger training block than I've ever done for sure that's crazy and you're a fucking world record holder you got a goddamn stand-up comedian out there right it's amazing what people can do when they decide they're gonna do it yes yes but yeah I mean I think with for for this particular run you know I probably would have kept punting it down the road in you know how to not talk to Justin Wren to be honest with you like you know when you do something like that like part of the reason I think you do that is for me anyway is when I see like endurance ultra endurance sport too it can be a very selfish sport because you're you know you're putting in tons of training race day is like an all-day effort with tons of people helping you out like they're taking time out of their schedule their day to come out their crew pace essentially like be your peer support system while you're out there kind of trying to you know do all these things so you know part of it is like I want to try to give back in a way as well as as opposed to just always going out and racing for my own my own sake and what will be done how will it the will you have sponsors like yeah I'm gonna do hopefully what we'll do is I was talking to Justin we sponsor you absolutely really yeah yeah we wear like a Gerry logo and one of your shirts or something no doubt about it yeah do it awesome we got we got one sponsor on board here we go yeah hell yeah but yeah so like when I talked to Justin I mean Justin is I mean you know adjustable he's been on the show that guy and I think it was on here that it heard his podcast for the first time I know I heard him tell I guess what you would call his origin story here and I think I heard it again on like the mind pump media guy's podcast and it's when I described just listening to Justin wrens podcasts or his interviews to people I tried to say like well it kind of comes in these stages where he tells his background story of like his experience with bullying and at first you just your heart just sinks for the guy you're thinking like well how could anyone have to go through that I would never want him to go through that and you kind of transition into this phase of like you kind of get nervous and anxious because you're thinking like well who did I say something mean to when I was younger or who did I who did I potentially affect in a negative way and then it's like then you just want to try to do something to support and you know it's really when you look at someone like Justin Ren it's it's mind-boggling to me that this guy isn't like an internationally-known hero or leader yeah yet anyway well he's becoming he's getting big he's getting big I mean the only thing that's holding him back keeps getting sick yeah well and that's just fucking crazy you know his parasites he's right now they know what they are yeah I picked up some parasites in the Congo they can't even identify the specifically uh-huh and it's he's really suffering and you would never know talking to him like he just goes about it like the guy's gotten Millea like most people would probably say okay I went over to Africa I got malaria I helped some people out I'm good I'm good now now someone will raise some money for this charity and we'll send it over to him or something I know he keeps going back and keeps getting malaria three times yeah and now he's no parasite so like when I think of like what we I think maybe like I mean Justin Ren is like next-level when it comes to like a leader I think and I think in the current especially in the current climate like you know our leaders today tend to be you know people like celebrities athletes and then politicians and things like that and it's like I you look around and it can be very underwhelming about just like you know some of like like how badly are like how badly are people actually trying to help people and how how much how many of these like politicians actually care about poor people how many of them actually care about someone who's disenfranchised or how much how many are they doing it doing it just get elected right did they actually care Justin it's just care yes it's all innocent there's no worry at all about ulterior motives they don't exist there's no ulterior motive to sleep on a dirt floor in a grass shack with the pygmies like he's done for months at a time he's just doing it for love yeah yeah so I think like when when when I look at like I think people want to help and I think people want to do things that are good for Humanity but oftentimes they don't necessarily have that example to kind of like to lead the way then they they look into a void in some cases and I think Justin is the type of person who you know if the more people we can get to know about him his story and what he's trying to do on the the wells and the farms and with the pygmy as well as his new branch on anti-bullying the batter so when I reached out to him I was actually like kind of surprised like I shot him a note on I think Instagram and Twitter and I thought that he's probably gonna see it he's not following me and he responded in like less than a couple hours like you followed me responded back and he's just like this is so awesome I feel super honored that you'd wanna you know help out in some way it's like he's just always looking for opportunities to help promote this great cause so then you know when I got that response from him it was like clarification of what I think I some I already knew about the guy just from listening to him on your show and others that you know he's really in this for a big reason and if if we need a fast track this cross-country event to bring him some some awareness we'll see what we can do but he's in everything he does he does to help and promote other people even when I was trying to talk to him about his parasite I had a key didn't want to yeah get him on track he's like you got to interview my doctor and what's going on man what's happening with you because I worry about the guy because yeah he's so selfless when he's talking about like blacking out and all these like like after training they got to get him in the shower because he's shivering he's pale white and like bro what is going on with you like what is this he's like oh you got to meet my doctor he's amazing like stop stop with the fucking doctor I gonna want to get what is happening he doesn't want to talk about himself it's amazing the most selfless person I've ever ever talked he's talking about fighting again right he's getting over these incredible bouts of antibiotics that you know weaken your ligaments right like when you take cipro or any of these like super intense antibiotics one of the side effects is a lot of times people get injured like your ligaments get injured because apparently there's a weakening effect which is really kind of it's really fascinating when you think about the human body as an overall organism and that it's really an ecosystem and that when you flood antibiotics into that ecosystem to try to prevent disease from destroying it you also have these unintended side effects and one of them is weakened ligaments and there's a lot of a correlation between people getting staph infection and then blowing out knees ACLs you know tendons and things along those lines afterwards so he both of his shoulders are fucked you know and this is post antibiotics and yet he's still talking about fighting so you can bring more awareness to the pygmies I'm like bro please stop just get your shoulders fixed yeah whatever you got going on let's let's heal that up for and then also find out what the fuck this parasite is that you don't even know what this didn't even know this is he's not even thinking about himself is like if I can get in and get a fight in by the end of the year I'm at the end of the year man it's fucking December like stop it you're not getting in by the end of the year you're not getting in the beginning of 2020 let's heal up heal up we gotta want you healthy yeah I'm such a rare totally selfless person and he saw such a powerful force for good for those peoples the people that live in the Congo and what he's done for them I mean I don't know how many wells they've built so far but they made an alliance with the cash app which is one of my sponsors so every time someone downloads the cash app when they use the code Joe Rogan whether it's for Google for Android or for I've for an iPhone for Apple you get $10 goes to this cause so they've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're building wells right now it's just this amazing thing that he's done and he's just like you feel like a piece of shit like when you're around him you're like why am I not just nice he's so nice it's it's like it was enough for him to find people who were hard off he had to go and find the most forgotten most hard off yeah that's right there's like so many people in Africa have it Robbie there's no know who's got the roughest yeah yeah that live and you know and on top of that the guy's a world-class mixed-martial yeah awesome he really is he's one of the best heavyweights in the world and how much better would he be if he was selfish and they spent all of his time training and not getting middle area three times not having this unknown parasite that they think might be in his fucking brain I mean they don't even know what I was just reading this story about some guy who was having seizures and it turns out he had all these worms in his brain and I'm like and I was thinking about Justin I'm it was from uncooked pork from this ah and Justin they think the problem with the Congo is it's so remote and you don't get a lot of people to go there and get diseases and then come back so they might not they don't even know what this is might be something that no one's ever got before sure and then made it back to Western civilization to be examined yeah Wow yeah Wow what the hell man yeah and then you would never know talking to him no you just doesn't want to talk about it yeah let's talk about his friend hey you got to get my friend on the podcast he's really sweet it's a great guy makes makes kites like once each kite is gonna generate X amount dollars from your bottle up Justin red and feed it to everyone I guess well you know it's an interesting I'm not just an interesting it's a it's a beautiful sort of expression of what can happen to a person when they experience deep pain and sadness and then they find a way out and then they find a way to help other people and that's sort of what he's done you know his childhood was really rough and he came out of that a super kind person as opposed to being angry and mean I mean this is what we need more in the world right we need more people building people up and helping and less people tearing people down and then hating means so much of so much of what social media is used for and so much of what the Internet is used for is hate his anger there's so much anger you know and to see someone like Justin this rare soul that has found a way to almost universe I mean like everything he does is channeled towards good all of it you know including kicking people's asses yeah which is like how do you make that good you found it found a way to make kicking people's asses a good thing it's beautiful I'm really honored to be his friend say he's one of my you know there were the rarest people that I know yeah no doubt no I'd say it's been cool to hear his story and you know I think thanks to you he's probably got a much bigger audience too so so what are you thinking about in terms of the timeline uh well so if if I go and try to get close to or right around the the record for that it's you know about a 40-day ish timeframe give or take so you're really I think the biggest hurdle or planning thing is to find the timeline where you're gonna run into the least amount of weather issues because when you're going across the country so you're going over the Sierras and you're going through the you know the middle of the country and then all that stuff so obviously you don't want to be going over mountain passes in the middle of winter but you probably don't also want to be going through the Midwest in the middle of the summer so some of us can be kind of planning around around that there's there's probably some good opportunities in the spring in the fall that kind of catched that window of moderate temps versus extremes what's the gentleman that did it before a peak oscillate do you know Pete yeah yeah it is man runs from San Francisco to New York and record time look at that guy still dazed peeps oh fuck you want to hear something crazy about Pete though so he did that and then that wasn't enough because he I think this was a year ago or two years ago he went up in Alaska and went from Alaska down to the southern tip of Florida all by himself with just like one of those push strollers and he averaged like I think was like 50 miles a day or something like that so yeah folks if he went from Alaska to Florida yeah yeah he did I forget what the English roller so that's his food his foods in the stroller yeah he was shocked bro you know it was funny it was I was about kind of following and while he did it crazies got a baby stroller with food in it what a crazy idea he uh he did when I was following him like I you know he was logging all his runs on Strava so it was hilarious to see like these these weeks after weeks where it's like 50 mile day 50 mile a 50 mile day like you know like 350 400 mile weeks and stuff like that and then if you like zoomed in on his routes you could see like he'd be on this round also he seemed deviate a little bit you'd assume any like oh there's a grocery store there that's why he turned to fill up his baby car my food where'd he keep his money I don't know I am the baby carbo bleed I'm trying to steal that baby cart where'd he sleep I think he stayed at hotels if I'm not mistaken okay I'd have to I'd have to look to bring the baby card up the stairs yeah yeah Jesus Christ there's crazy people out there yeah there's different kind of humans right like yeah you have this idea of like what a person is capable of and you see someone like dining okay I've got to rethink this uh-huh people are capable of way more ya know yeah it's it's nuts when you think about as soon as you think you find limitations then also and some goes out and does does something crazier or bigger or better and the baby stroller from Alaska to Florida what the fuck man um did you talk to him at all about this idea I haven't yet no I mean it's been are you going to yeah reach out to him he'll be good about it I think yeah yeah yeah he's a nice guy I know Pete so how many people have done this run hey you know I don't even know it's been it's a documented route so it's been done done you could probably google it and find out and I'll buddy I it's it's probably it's more than you'd think it just really usually comes down and actually you just and work with someone earlier who did it walking I think I think a maybe was a slightly different route but it was basically the same premise and he walked like some 20-some miles a day or something like that and was raising raising funds and awareness for fight for the Forgotten - so we'll maybe talk to him a bit - so um the idea is late summer early fall something like that yeah that's probably ideal I think you want to try to catch you want to get away from winter but you also want to be done before the the worst part of summer right with the global warming do you factor that in depends how fast ends up coming the route might be shorter by the time I get around to doing it if the coasts come in though so sometime around this time next year it should be completed is that the idea um maybe yeah my thought is it's probably got to either be about like you know a ten month like start point or 18 so I could either do it now or I guess to be a little less than 18 but by finishing so I would either maybe try to do it like this fall or if I don't have enough in place by then target kind of the end of winter for 2021 and what would change what would make you decide to do it 20:21 versus twenty twenty uh justjust I mean I'm trying to respect how much like planning it's going to take and I haven't really started that yet so I don't want to like necessarily get to find out like okay let's say I just put a date on the on the calendar right away and then find out oh I need to like and there's a lot more resources I have to try to acquire to make this happen and in this in terms of logistics like mostly logistics getting everything just organized enough to because I don't want to screw it up so there's that too and then also planning around my own race schedule to a degree too so obviously this will probably this will take the place of an the way I look at like seasons of racing is just kind of two key ones you have like your spring early summer and you're kind of late summer fall / winter season so it's kind of - so I'll basically just sacrifice one of those seasons for this and I probably won't I mean I don't really know what to expect I've never done anything quite like this before but I'm planning on dedicating one of those seasons towards that exclusively it's Jamie's nodding over here he's guys digging through this article is pretty interesting so it started here like this it's walking was a huge spectator sport and the late 19th century they would bet money that like you couldn't do it people followed it like it was the World Series so it continued on until the Great Depression World War two probably because people didn't have enough time to waste their time doing this and then it picked back up in the late 20th century and that's when you had to prove what you were doing look at this the first known transcontinental journey took place in 1896 by a mother-daughter duo who needing to raise money to save their farm in Spokane County Washington responded to a ten thousand dollar public wager that no one could make it by foot across the country Helga and Clara SB left home with $10 between them as well as a compass a knife a curling iron and a Smith and Wesson revolver don't fuck with those ladies they'll curl your hair and shoot you in the dick they made it to New York City seven months later but for reasons unknown did not receive any reward for their toils on their way home Helga and Clara took the train what the fuck why didn't they get paid someone fuck them out of their money probably someone fucked him out of their money some jackass yet so it started again picked up back up again in like the 60s and in 1980 somebody's somebody I was doing it had his team scramble to get witness signatures the whole way across so he could prove that he did it what he did right yeah yeah I mean people cheat on marathons right there yeah jumping cars and marathons and making on the train there was a guy I think before Pete broke the record that I think got caught cheating try because I mean you got a document stuff pretty detailed and you know it's crazy like I mean you'd think it would be enough just to track it on your watch and upload it right but like you know people do goofy things like they get in the back of the RV I guess and drive really slow but people who are really good at like looking at those GPX files can look and see like oh that's not a run that's you know they can see these variances and paces or consistencies that wouldn't be uniform with running or something like that Oh interesting well maybe there should be some sort of a video recording of it like for your GoPro in your head I want to do a live feed just have it possible satellite yeah it's just probably a way to do it yeah that would be dope listen man we're in we'll help you whatever you do it sounds sounds like a very worthy cause and it's a crazy undertaking and we'd be happy to promote it too and let everybody know and have people fuckin honk their horn and drive by as long as they want to like hand off a nice rib eye or something yeah what are you gonna eat along the way how are you gonna do what do you like what kind of food would you yeah so it kind of uh maybe go full circle we started before where we kind of talked about kind of what I peered eyes with carbohydrates and stuff like that where I think there is a point where the distance is long enough where like a strict ketogenic diet is maybe more applicable I think it's very pretty pretty well-established like if you'd follow a strict ketogenic diet or a zero carb diet and try to perform in some of these typical endurance events it's gonna come at a performance cost unless you have some weird like like outlying type situation and I mean if Trent Stelling worth looked at he's a guy up in Canada who works with a lot of the sports performance stuff and he did some studies actually looks at like if you do if you go super strict keto or zero carb you get really fat adapt you get really good at burning fat but it comes at a cost of your ability to burn exogenous glucose so like if I went zero carb for like a year and then I tried to take in my fueling strategy that I do now my body would probably reject it or at least I would have to be like like really really conservative with how much I used so if you talk to dom D'Agostino about the stuff not personally though him yeah I know I know I follow him and stuff I'm actually gonna be presenting at his metabolic health summit in I believe it's in January early February he's a very very interesting guy because he's a super legit fact-based scientist who's also a power athlete you know and ketogenic like for a long long time now try to get him on board for this attempt but like the what I'm trying to say with that is like he'd probably help you yeah yeah I'm give you a great resource for sure but like for something like this like my intensities gonna be so low that like I don't technically need to be taking in exogenous glucose for something like that so it might actually be move me to be as fat adapted as I can get versus what I'm normally doing is I'm trying to get as fat adapt it is I need to be but not necessarily so far that it comes at the compromise of being able to do my in race nutrition fueling play I was always under the impression that your body always knows what to do with glucose but that it has to be fat adapted that's yeah I say I I think you probably can to a degree but what happens is like you you down regulates like I can't speak to the science perfectly but Trent's telling worth did a bunch of research where it basically it down regulates the mechanism that allows you to take in glucose and utilize it in a meaningful way so like you know most people can tolerate probably somewhere between maybe mmm 60 to 90 grams of glucose per hour during some of these events whereas like if you went on a strict zero carb diet and tried to do 6 to 90 grams of a sports drink or fuel or something like that like I don't think your body could clear it because it would have down regulated the your body's capability to do that so many folks who are interested should look at trance telling what's work he he would be able to describe it in much better detail than I can oh you would just go on a real super heavy fat I think so that's where I'm that's what I'm thinking about I wouldn't necessarily Otto's coconut oil yeah meat yeah there's main line those f-bombs yeah i think a lot of fat and a lot of protein would be the name the game for something that that's that low and that or that slow intensity and you would try for how many miles a day well Pete did it in 70 so I feel like it would be cool to try to challenge his his his attempt but uh how many hours was he doing a day I don't know that's a good question I'd have to look back and see what he was doing if it don't know if it was consistent leave the same every day so maybe that's where my plan would deviate and I'm probably gonna learn along the way and maybe change things but I do kind of like at least on paper that idea of targeting a 12 to 14 hour window so that I have at least 10 hours to kind of like refuel and sleep and stay on top of that stuff and what if that'll likely mean is like maybe there'll be some days where I go well past 70 miles maybe it'll be some days where I go well under and you just hope that the your average to get the record but the records kind of secondary I'm gonna stick if I fall off if it's clear when I get to the Midwest that I'm not gonna hit Pete please record we're gonna just try to you know keep the main goal in mind of bringing awareness to fight for the Forgotten beautiful well listen we're in you let us know we'll help you we'll pump it up will sponsor you whatever we need to do let's make it happen awesome and thank you thanks Zach saying thanks for being here yeah
