was okay experience ghost train my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day well you did it again with the reverb you fucking freak strange man this Brian Redman very odd character unlike Jim Gaffigan looks like a serial killer sitting behind well we just got back from wearing a tie we just got back from a music video he never dresses like this never we both music video yeah we both usually dress like children yeah oh but your own children yeah we were in the back row who's a bar scene Brian and I rolled in hands and dance slow dancing right not really okay we're thinking about doing that but then we're like no maybe you should just practice it just for you you know just in case it comes up all right come on come on come on my let's lie down a cuddle here there's like a scene where we're supposed to cuddle Emily guys you want to be an anchor hi listen to want to be nekked you got to be ready 24/7 to act you do I want you to act like you want to suck my dick you know I mean not in a gay way you know I have to look at pictures of myself yeah what's confusing right yeah he's constantly doing that that's what the American public sees right now Jim Gaffigan turn a tional uh yeah the world gets it the World Wide Web we're not douchey we don't keep our friends overseas from getting the pheno communists or watching this there well we would hope that there they would learn something from this Jim Gaffigan maybe I'll come out of their shell remember whoever watch that uh what was it a was it the Robert De Niro starting that movie about communism and the in Hollywood in the 1950s how crazy was did you ever see that movie I think I think I know what you're talking about it was during the McCarthy era where they were just accusing everybody blacklist yeah yeah yes and that was kind of like that's what prompted the play The Crucible which was the witch hunt yeah and amazing right yeah it's kind of hard to believe that that existed you know just I mean in 1950s it's really not that long ago they were like but I'm after communists I mean we're events I don't think that I think that's happening all the time there's just larger examples of it you think like black baldies happening all the time is that what you mean well I think that we have a tendency to a paranoia I sure yeah I mean yeah yeah they're like you know you know the Arabs in this country or Muslims had to go through some shit because I think right after 9/11 people were like huh yeah I mean I'm not talking about just the it oh yeah well a lot of like Sikhs had to go through a lot of shit yeah guys who are Indian they have a real problem I mean it's so ignorant it's like you're not even talking about the same continent you silly people right now I know it's uh it's I I didn't deal with any yeah that skated right through Disney I didn't deal with Hania not even a little nothing but people didn't even they didn't think I was Muslim at all yeah do you think that there's a backlash to be a Muslim older I I don't think there is if you're like oh I think if you were like a Muslim act like wasn't like a Muslim actor unlost it was kind of a cool part of his personality I remember that was like kind of a cool part of his personality like I think there's been representations I think for sure the majority opinion is people are scared jihadist suicide bombers all that stuff but I think more now than ever you get a little bit of a positive perspective on on Jerusalem and Arabs know what at the neck you can't call them the same thing like the guy from lost like he was like it was a positive characters a badass man well he played a guy who tortured people in Iraq badass does you like them I would liked him I like it's a really interesting story yeah but he did like tortured kill people it was fascinating how that was like a part of his life and that it was you know shamed by it you know and it really fucked with him that was it was a great character yeah that was amazing yeah that was a great commander you got that mood that show was it for the longest time one of the greatest shows of all time the end I didn't really get at the end of it if it seemed like everybody's just walking through the motions the last few episodes I quit I miss that show I do too it's on yeah oh I thought you see I missed it well I said no one watched inlex and paid for it on itunes yeah I did as well I even have the DVDs which I never bought the blu-rays it's it's the greatest one of the greatest shows of all time but and no matter who you are I'm how creative you are when you're doing a crazy fucking show or people allowed travel back in time do all kinds of nutty shit from this magical Island it doesn't even exist when you're doing something like that after a while man you got a run dry must be exhausting trying to think of a nutty shit that you're gonna do on this fucking Island yeah I mean it's it's it's got to be amazing to also kind of tie it together with some semblance of logic yeah alright so we're gonna go back in time what would happen if we went back in time but we still want that one character in there ya know so they had two dead weird shit to like remember they had polar bears in the beginning yeah and then they stopped having polar bears yeah they just things disappeared right there was that that foot that had like four yeah just a Chia oh yeah that was numbered and then they started going forward in time member when Jack like had a beard and they were sitting on that bridge in every way yeah what happened great goddamn show especially considering it had to operate within the parameters of an ABC primetime show it's insane yeah it's amazing I don't know how um I I guess I hardest job in the world I don't think shows like that not really but would have a shot yeah you know homelands a good show well actually no yeah but I gave up after lost you did until you just don't want to tell of it I don't watch anything the show and Daniel through your flash marina winch Elvis the TV I uh I only watched that's it I'm done throwing it i watch mmm it's not a good thing it's not any virtue like I watch Bigfoot hunter and watch fucking two episodes I had DVR I made their final Coldfoot hunter Finding Bigfoot or something and it's like a series where they have like more than one dude it's the first episode to be like yeah we're not gonna find them what's up no the best part about it is the beginning guys I've been hunting sasquatches for 25 years Laurel quit now quit quit now you haven't even got a video of one and crazy ass I was like you know it's like hey you know those ghost shows are really not realistic like they really find a ghost this what if we did it with Sara what's next like chupacabra sure if they can sell it they would they would have it it's it's a fun show to watch though because it's so stupid I mean first of all everyone has a video that they want you to analyze that may have been a sasquatch so they have to recreate the scene in the video it looks sweet it looks so silly cuz the people knew exactly where the car was and this is the tree and so they line it up on the camera and they have this big guy named Bobo who kind of looks like a Bigfoot and he goes out there and he does exactly what he's always way bigger than the Bigfoot in the video so it always proves that it wasn't really on his resume right now oh I see here you were Bigfoot yep I was Bigfoot season 1 season 2 they replaced me there was like contract remember when I wanted to Hager see much more apathetic and Harry and the Hendersons like a whole family lived with Bigfoot you know why not ha ha ha imagine so many of my kids I'm pretty sure I don't even trust dogs that I don't know this guy's got a fucking Bigfoot hanging out he probably told these stupid humans a thing or two about love oh yeah Harry in the Henderson there's never been a real good Bigfoot movie how about that nobody's ever stepped up and it's not like the bars been said that the bar is incredibly low the bar is all fraudulent videos yeah that's the closest thing to a Bigfoot movie and I would think after like season 1 there's a lot of people that watch the show like why not like I think you should support never been oh there's I mean there was like this a really bad ones the 70s or some Swamp Thing monster guy yeah but there's never been a movie a good movie about a bunch of people that encounter Bigfoot why how is it possible that you have such a folklore that is completely permeated Society he's not that no one's ever made a not sexy bit big for those I made a movie about Finding Bigfoot that's amazing that's true that's can credible really when you think about how popular it is is a um movie would be some of the movie ideas they're doing yes okay it's like based on a matchbook yeah like so you'd think they'd have big votive things because she's in romantic comedies when you you know hear some romantic comedy premise you like what I don't understand they finally meet again at 60 you know I sometimes feel like I just established consciousness when I was like thirty because like romantic comedies like you know I was so dumb I think in my 20s that like when you know it would be like a you know meg Ryan and Billy Crystal you know like Harry Met Sally like to me that was just a movie I didn't consider that a romantic comedy which it was but now it's like this genre that is always existed but they just kind of like just churn out these just like those didn't exist it's romantic you know it existed movies were when a woman got mouthy the man gave her the back of her hand yeah back of his hand right yes that's what they used to do to the moon Alice yeah yeah all that stuff those were the good old days Billy Crystal fucked us Billy Crystal fucked up fucked us in the air meant something wrong tried to be he tried to be manly he tried to like be the best Oh example of and then he caved that asleep distance I see so you see when Harry Met Sally Harry Met Sally is like it's like a sad ending to you you're like you know what you're like yep there you go it's just no more the relationship seems like so much work I'm never happy with a relationship that seems like so much work works out because I don't buy it I'm not buying it that's nice you get stay gonna last you guys fight well there's a lot of you in relationships you just think that they're all acting you're like wow you know I don't believe that I don't I can't do this listen everyone has been in good and bad relationships that's not what I'm saying I'm saying when you when the one is a battle one is a crazy battle Harry Met Sally oh yeah no were there for nothing in common it's like we hate each other we don't get along but we got drunk one night and made out so maybe we should get married is it getting to the point you know I'm 44 how old you 21 you look great yeah yeah is it getting done point will you look at like older married folks and you know like that that are just barely into each other barely can communicate with each other and you look at any go I could see how that could happen I don't know not I I don't yet see how get out right there's nothing normal about what we do here I mean like I think in some of those married couples it's like I do everything with my wife so it's not as if you know the the conversation went like the scientist Island man like don't talk to me Virginia you know like where they don't let your wife talk that we tracer I'm you know a YES on Tuesday she's no but there's the the complete communication right breakdown I don't know that's the only reason to be married in my opinion the only way you should ever mean other than children and that of course kind of goes with the whole package of that sort of a relationship that I get really intense relationships I'm a phobic of you thank you but the only reason why you should is me you know is because you feel like that that's it and if you don't if you is anything less it's not easy I know I definitely know your own shit right you're like this is uh this is too hard but that's what whores before that's why pores no that's what that's what you know you got a flashlight suck it up you're gonna go long-term you know it's like stand-up comedy when you know I don't know maybe you probably did all right but you know there's a lot of nights where you just eat there but you're committed you've made the Commissioner remember one yes sir I don't quit a quick comedy maybe like I'm quitting and you'd look at them and you go I don't think I could ever quit I mean I really feel that way it's like this is not something like you know I'll try this and then maybe I'll try archery it's like it's not like I had a choice in this it's like I always resigned to be like the weird old uncle I didn't think that I when you're constantly making people laugh like you are like even just we're having this conversation all the three of us there's that feeling that you get when you're laughing really hard at something where you're all of our brains like it's Chuck it's like a real energy that goes off when you're really laughing hard at something people fucking love that yeah you love it they love it you love to do it it's one of the most fun things to be able to do to do that to a whole roomful of people to go out and see it it's one of those fun things for them to see yeah why would you quit why would you quit what do you do it's it's an absolute heroine right going on so age and being able to you know make a crowd laugh or yes coming up with a new joke and by the way I feel like it's also a responsibility because there's Jim Gaffigan fans out there and you got them addicted to Jim Gaffigan humor yeah and you got to keep coming you got to keep showing up you got to keep touring you got to keep coming to them they wanna come see you again well you know I think it's also you know even though I think fan is I mean I that's a different weird word I think it's a weird word a pity late for me but I think it's also really important to like do well your I mean yes not dead not not suck well you know with you know if if people are paying 30 bucks it's like they better leave like they don't leave going that was great yeah you fucked up some of my most inspirational moments and comedy have been from reading a review of someone who said that like oh I thought it was boring or I didn't like it you know like and I've read those before and even if you know it's just one douche bag like so it just makes you like just that anybody could think like that I have to stop that you can might you might not like the subject matter you might but if anybody thinks that it wasn't a good show and anyway I need to fix whatever the fuck that is it's interesting because there's also there's the new material police yeah which is hardened which is kind of it's it's painful but it's also good it's kind of like you know feel like wow you know like yes 75 79 percent of the show was new yeah it's like and then there's some people like you could do like uh you know 45 minutes new and do like 15 minutes old and they're like it was all old material yeah what about the first 45 minutes yeah people will definitely do that and I like hearing like Joey Diaz has some jokes I can hear over and over and I want it I want to hear some like when I go to see a guy and you know he's a guy that I would seen over the last year or two I don't mind seeing those jokes over and over again I just really don't expect in a year that he's gonna have a whole new Act yeah unless you just put something out and that's the the crazy when you're about to do that right now yeah you do the same thing you toss everything out then you start i i'm i you know yeah i mean when i'm in new york but you know if I'm doing a theater I think the most important thing is to try and make it half new at least but also make sure that it's a really good show so there is something about like I don't want to I don't want people cuz they like you said some people want to hear the old stuff is that weird thing though yeah I mean like a week ago it was all new it was like 75 minutes new but uh and I and I have stuff that I didn't put in this you know like maybe 20 minutes so I'll start over with that 20 minutes and kind of throw stuff out but like when I'm doing a show it's like it's got to be boom it's got to be both yeah yeah I mean you got a lot of people come to see it even though mine might be like boom yeah but I love I I think I'm sorry I'm not gonna let you talk but I think that that's what's so amazing about you know like we're making each other laugh here but like that's some of why podcasts are so fun it's like comedians wanna talk to other comedians we just don't have the opportunity yeah and so you know getting the opportunity to do something like this you're like well ya know I'd love to talk to Joe yeah I mean yeah alright and you were so nice because I asked to do it that you well I'm really excited that you're doing that you're special the same way Louie CK did it you're gonna reinstate completely on the internet the same price I think Louie kinda established it right yeah bucks I'm gonna do the same thing yeah and what I think it's it's uh you know Louie's not the first person to sell something on the internet but I think he figured it out a real simple thing it's like you keep it as cheap you keep it cheap five dollars is not gonna kill anyone yeah and then you keep make it really easy to buy and then you're just honest and and good you know people were looking forward to seeing Louis stuff Christian you know Louie's the guy that in my opinion is the the most prolific I think I don't think there's anybody as prolific as him every year a whole new hour and a half or whatever the hell it is it was whole new show I did a show with him in Boston like two weeks ago and he this is gonna freak you out I'm not sure about this but I I'm pretty positive he goes yeah I was writing material and I need 45 minutes for my show for those the comedy section of his show and I'm sitting there going wait a minute so he that 45 minutes that he's written for his show for his eight or ten episodes or whatever of that show that 45 minutes isn't even going to be part of his next hour which he'll do probably in two months really your Amin diocese I mean I'm not in two months but I think he does an hour a year so that's I heard that and I was like wow yeah he must just put himself in weird situations to make things happen that are funny to talk about at certain point time to start driving a bad neighborhood going to massage powers you don't even want to be at everybody on premises yeah and anything as I talk a lot about food I feel as though there's no more food I've talked about like yeah I have a pretty mum animals that can kill you I'm always fascinated by terrified by animals they can kill you how many tiger jokes could I do so far I could listen to you talk about lean pockets all day though cuz I am a huge I like I eat more than things markets well I do lean because he does night but but I I seriously eat it I'm joke oh but I eat like for a week like its way it's simple it's so easy that's you know not good for you that's the blessing and the curse of hot pockets right is it changed my life that that joke hopefully you know the whole beyond the pill was good but it's like that hot pockets it's a blessing right it's it's opened up so many opportunities yet you know me walking through the airport people yelling hot pocket is not my favorite thing right I mean I don't even know how to respond to it do you get discounts for the coupons and they send you a no but when I used to have theater shows and they used to have a guy dressed as a hot pocket standing outside passing out coupons oh wow or coupons and for hot pockets for hot pockets that's awesome and then Picchu like McGee deal with high pockets no people thought that I was in cahoots with them and I was like I had that like send a letter like you guys can't do that yeah you got to pay me Yeah right welcome to I don't that B you don't want to be associated I don't want a food product feed the hot pocket thing you know yeah you don't want people actually buying hot pockets and having fucking heart attacks on behalf right now one thing to crack Joe's oh so are you're doing this special when you get done with it only release on the internet same way and are you going to start from all all new yeah yeah you can starts going in age they're just going to get well the ice house here in Pasadena has an annex room it's an 85 seat room and we've been doing a lot of shows there and it's like the best place ever for fucking around and coming up with new shit I'll raise it's really small it's super intimate it's like real relaxed and you know and they kind of know that that's weird do it in alright so we have these podcast shows where we do all the comics will come and sit around and do a podcast and each one will go on stage and then come back and then green Wow yeah but it's a real green room I mean it really is us right before we go on stage and there's like you know you see like how much time I have left he's on now oh shit I gotta go ladies gentlemen thank you very much boom and guys will leave then they'll come back again and you know hey Joey Diaz just returned how are they all that fucking fantastic and then he'll start talking about the show and hey I do it oh that's fun yeah it's really because then you can have a different interview might have different interpretation of the audience yeah well yeah there's definitely that and there's also when you come back here just like this party going on now there's all these people and like Russell Peters came by we're like fuckin ten people with them it's always something crazy like that so it's like it's like a fun it's a fun environment and the shows are amazing and to me it's like God I'm just gonna concentrate on doing a lot of those shows like really small shows and I have a bunch of ideas that I haven't like fleshed out yet right and that's nice chuck them in there and see what subtle kernels do you feel like the podcast is influencing your act oh yeah for sure yeah well it also changed my audience entirely my audience well at one point was like a combination of Fear Factor people which were fading away it was mostly like UFC fans it was like kind of curious and then you know it was still half of them knew what I was going but now it's a hundred percent now it's like literally 90 to 100 percent of the audience is all podcast fans so they know you 100% they know you like as as much as I could know yeah that's fun yeah huge save place is huge huge gave me especially women yeah tall ones yeah lumberjack women yeah you're not you're not describing the titles and bodily you like right hey man I'm open to anything so I'll depending on what kind of situation I'm in at the time do you think there's a guy out there that just goes after like the butchy Asst course viens course there's there's people that like everything that you know there's a broad spectrum you've met people that you know you look at what are you men people I've met a few people behind of 7-eleven and West Hollywood do ya shit know what they're those too easy you ruin the vibe of the room I'm sorry I didn't mean to bring about the hum pieces he's uh talking about gay neighborhoods in Hollywood is that West Hollywood the guess I want gay is part of the world pretty much we were in Compton today and that like I was thinking Compton like oh my god we have to get a Compton it's just scary it was like nice there yeah well the part where we were at was not the where people live over in an industrial about it this is just a cheap he's thinking about going total Street just for the cred I'm actually from Compton is ooh uh Main Street Main Street comp Main Street right next to the Roses Rosa Parks Avenue right in corner Compton we were in a honey honey music video honey honey is this band that uh we just found out about like a couple weeks ago and they're like one of my new favorite bands and I went to see them perform in LA I got to meet them and then they came into the podcast they were fucking amazing and just really cool people and really really talented and so Bryan and I were in a music video just super awesome to me Jason Ritter was there and so the whole afternoon I just got to sit down hang out with Jason Rader and I'm a huge John Ritter fan so it's just so fucking weird I'm sitting there that's the guy that was on that one true story event through the event monitor was like he was like one of the nicest guys you ever work with yeah I did news radio with him he did a couple episodes in his radio he was great he was not strike yeah super super nice guy yeah that one was like that what a guy like that dodge like wow really really yeah yeah it's like 50 or something like that that affected me more than any celebrity death like like all the other celebrities like I don't know that person yeah it sucks that they're gone but for some reason that I still think about John Ritter all the time I would say that was up there but Phil Hartman doused it yeah those those does another craziest one and that's crazy yeah yeah John Ritter was hilarious it was a really funny guy off stage too like Indian takes did you ever do anything with him yeah I did an episode of Ellen's second sitcom with him uh uh and he was like a really nice guy it's so interesting you know like that the actors that when we were kids you know John Ritter was like I don't know who to compare he was like the Jerry Seinfeld when we were like kids was yes he was huge and such a nice guy Greg uh you know who is who was the guy who's the director he was in Starsky and Hutch and now he's a director do you know I'm talking about god dammit J eat well he's the guy who's what his wife I believe died of AIDS really yeah yeah god I can't remember his name can you find out Brian just Starsky and Hutch the the movie or the TV show rather just a TV show yeah the TV show not the movie with Ben Stiller not any one the old one when I was a kid I fucking loved this show started and hot yeah and then one did Starsky and Hutch ooh you seem like you could be a character on stuff starting so much no yeah I mean no cuz it's that was back in that 70s era you know like who was a Peter Falk he was one yeah Columbo Columbo and then there was an arena I mean there was like that the fat guy Oh jack what was the fat guy that was the detective it was a little later fat guy Jake the fat man I was making the fat guy like that's the that was the last TV show for like fat people for fat people you know that was it they're like sorry you know what Dennis France come on and you can get an Emmy but like the the guy was a lead and he you know Dennis France was just like a regular looking guy but that guy Jake in the fat man the lead character was a big fat guy remember Sammo hung he had a sit he had a show on CBS with Arsenio Hall and he was a fat kung-fu guy and he beat everybody up do you remember that Brian oh god damn it I can't remember the name of the show but yeah he was a it was like a legit kung-fu movie star but he's fat and he could like throw kicks and head kicks and did he do everything but he was a fat guy and he would fuck guys up right wonder what he's doing well but he was a fat guy that also a pig he had a good solid tvk now it's there's like you know I would be considered like a severely obese person on TV right well I guess the Biggest Loser there's big people on that right there's very big people in the Biggest Loser but there's there's like the the emphasis on attractive people in movies and television is it's like it's not like disproportionate it's like ridiculously disproportionate right but when you need a character God we need the wacky you know what does the dude's name like a Steve Buscemi character or something right you know movies he'll do that I think I saw I was at the gym once and and I saw I think it was an episode of Bones was on and again I don't know the show I'm sure it's a good show but literally the the show was you know like when you're on the plane and there's a TV show playing and you don't watch it and you don't have your headphones on you don't have your headphones on and from what I could tell it's they went you know the attractive couple and then they someone dies who happens to be an attractive woman and then they go to a restaurant that I think I put my headphones in and let's see was it it was in the bayou okay I don't know if the show set in Louisiana or not but it was in the bayou and the guy who was the owner of this authentic alligator Bayou bar had my accent and and he was he looked like he should be hosting the local news right he did not he did not look like if you've been a Louisiana the people in Louisiana I mean I'm a white-trash guy it's like you know that's funky genetics you know it's just like people don't like where I'm from people don't worship they were sweatpants on Saturday night you know I mean right when they go out because they're not working well Harry Connick is this Harry Connick is or is not the norm so that's good and so anyway so like I watched the show I kind of give up and hopefully this is worth it so then I I watch it and it's just like everyone is I think they're FBI agents everyone is like 27 like the oldest person was like 28 they're like now you've been here a year longer than me it just was very interesting that there was there was no one like 60 there was no one like 12 it was just everyone was the same 27 there was they were the same age they they were the same size like all the women were thin and all the guys were kind of you know like work out to it times a day kind of worked out body and there was no one that 27 years of age is a really pivotal moment for a woman sexuality very very important you know why because at 20 she doesn't know what's going on you take advantage of a little child and you know at 37 she's like probably desperado for relationship wants to settle down immediately only has a few eggs left 27 is like just old enough so that you're you're not you're not innocent anymore you're a dirty bitch right a dirty bitch newlin sorry dick you know that's a 27 year old girl that's like really the perfect time perfect time to fuck you just increase your pod a podcast audience I'm just a female Democrat a little explaining well I don't know I think it's like a simple if you simplify and generalize with well this is a broad term like I was writing out that these were broad like I'm not saying all women were city variables Jim Gaffigan don't go captain save-a-ho on me buddy I'm just trying to make a comedy example the women's alliance and it's a founding member of nobody would like women to be nice more than me nobody would root for them to be awesome more than me nobody's happier than when women are nice more than me but nobody likes to be or hates to be told what to do by a woman more than me I'd like that I don't like bossy women I really like this aggressive bossy women is there anything more uncomfortable when a woman gets aggressive and bossy with you it's like oh this is so dangerous like yeah somebody's going to hit you with something so you don't like strong women not that I don't like bossy aggressive women I like strong men but I like bossy aggressive men either yeah yeah there's something almost seems like all this stupid fuck you can't even help it it's in his nature but a aggressive woman to me is always like oh my god what are you doing you're like you have no brakes you're just driving crazy and you have no brakes yeah it's interesting cuz there's a difference between like being a nudge and being confident yeah yeah well there's a difference between you know being assertive and being aggressive and confrontational in an unrealistic yeah and whenever anybody does that it's always uncomfortable but it's for me it always freaks me out when women get like aggressive and crazy like when a woman starts screaming the guy and putting her hands in his face whoa what are you doing right like this is this is almost physical violence here you're instigating this right this ain't gonna end well this is crazy like I bet if we had a fight like all the men versus all the women we would kick the shit out of them most likely we would do that maybe we would totally you know like I mean I might get beat up but you wouldn't I think I'd get beat up eventually is this enough of them I think there's 51% of the population yeah now 1% means a lot if it was like a lot of chicks around you when you talk about millions of people that 1% could be pretty substantive annecy yeah oh yeah yep everybody knows the one guy that has every relationship he's ever in the woman's in control and she yells at them and tells him what to do and he's always miserable it's a terrible situation everybody knows that guy though right everybody yeah it's kunti but I wouldn't want to be a woman and have a country man either you know it's just the only reason why I feel this way is cuz I'm a man and I've seen so many guys get their lives ruined by women who probably don't even they probably can't even help what they're doing the reason why I say this is because I had an ex-girlfriend and she always she was a very nice person yeah she liked to fight she just loved it she would just start to fight for no reason and I'd be like what we do it come on this is crazy yeah and after a while I could we became friends but we we stopped dating and so she started dating another guy and was going through the same thing which screaming him and yelling um and but this guy would just take it he would just eat it and so we had a conversation one day and she's smoking a cigarette and shaken she's like I can't help it she goes I have to test him she goes and when he lets me walk all over him I just want to fuck I want to scream loud enough so that he turns me around and tells me to stop so that he brings me back to normal and tells me stop Hawaii you might be the craziest fucking person on the face of the earth like imagine living your life like that not a bitch she's not a bitch she's just compelled by her own genetics to not have a bitch for a man you know she was like a wild horse he needed to be broken Jim Gaffigan she talked about she did yep are you still doing pale force nope no I haven't done that for god since Conan had Fallon's what is was pale force pale force was where it was an animated thing that actually my brother-in-law Paul Noth who's a cartoonist for The New Yorker he came up with this idea of an animated series work Conan and I would were superheroes that would fight crime with our paleness sweetly woods we would shoot lasers from our nipples it was awesome it's the art style did he do that yeah all they did all that did he do the Saturday Night Live of fun house videos oh thanks very that's my goal house my litter yeah but yeah I loved it I think I thought it was a lot of fun he should do that more yeah I think while NBC owns it and NBC and Conan I don't know if they're and that kind of that's right oh yeah that's right yeah that's baiting bear they came in dude what a mess what a mess that whole thing what a mess is right so crazy just the whole idea was crazy putting the Jay Leno Show on at 10:00 like what you're gonna have the Tonight Show I mean earlier when they did that didn't you think that that was I thought that was their way of like well let Joe if Jay fails then we say we give him a try but I think I like that that's what I thought they thought was gonna happen but what happened was because Jay was on earlier I killed Conan's chance to even get an audience so people would watch The Tonight Show at 10:00 and then they wouldn't watch it later does that make sense yeah it does yeah is ridiculous it was silly it was a silly idea it's weird you know you're the comedy policeman no no you want you call me that before the improv what I told you that be very uncomfortable that makes you uncomfortable not really but I only I look I have but I'm not in stepped in for one piece of civil unrest that's something I've never done anything since well there's something about that whole situation with Leno and I don't know Jay at all and but it's you know if there was a Joe Rogan's of that generation maybe to go and explain it that's why you that's our new show you look for Bigfoot and you know comedy kind of well I think for all of us there was a there's been a few instances in the past where there was a guy that was kind of like clearly plagiarizing another guy and then you know one guy became famous with other people's shit I mean it's happened more than once and we've all felt the the real pain of frustration and watching someone do someone else's material well you know that they're stealing they know in their compensating them they're just stealing and it's it was like a Wild West thing it was like no one was doing anything about it and it was it and to treat it like it was no big deal you're absolutely crazy it's the core of someone's ability to perform on stage it's having great material it is our life it's their life you give you the best comic in the world you have nothing to say on stage for that moment if you go on stage and you have nothing prepared and you had nothing to say you're fucked it's not going to be good right you need premises you need material and so to pretend that it wasn't a big deal that the industry was per treating like it wasn't a big deal and we were like this is great like no I think you got an insane I told you that night what you did was very important I mean it was very important well for us it had to happen it had gotten to a point where no one everyone was just turning a blind eye to it because they're profiting off of it yeah and that's what happens when a person becomes successful and and as a plagiarist if it was any other form of art whether it was you know writing it would writing would be super clear I mean hail yeah you know it was music they take all your money if ya they can prove you have the same beats and you're copying it like you're take they take all your fucking money with ya and we're not talking about you know similar premises which we all have which is alright gonna happen we're Tiger Woods who has a fucking Tiger Woods joke put your raise your hand right everyone anyway everyone sat down and said oh this look is a gold mine yeah you can never claim a premise but you you absolutely know when we know and when you language is lifted yeah well you also know where there's smoke there's fire and they can't I say I truly believe that people who steal can't write I really do I think it's that I don't think you can do both I think something happens when you steal and that that this this being disingenuous this pretending that's bullshit knowing that you you are not really doing what you're claiming to be doing that you're pretending and that you're ripping people off and lying and project in this false self image which is like all ego which is exactly what shuts you off from the ability to come up with new shit like when you come up with new shit it's not like you thinking about you you see something of this side here's what what this is ridiculous right and that you know I mean it's not you you mean it's you coming up with a new thinking about but you're not involving yourself you're not trying to project a certain image you're not you know making sure that people think of you a certain way you're not even thinking like yeah because when you do think like that that's that shuts off creativity and when a guy steals what a guy's doing when he's stealing is he's trying to make himself better than he is he's trying to pretend that he's smarter than he is he's trying to put out stuff pretending that he figured this out when it real is really someone else it's all ego it's it's really sad too it's sad in a way because I think that it's almost as if you know like policemen they have like rabbis you know it's like I feel like almost comedian should have rabbis someone to sit there and go alright you know what you might not want to do that you know but there's it's such a strange business and we're all very individual and but you know the the irony also is is that any comedian would tell you that the respect of their peers is way more important than whether you're do telling out Saturday night yeah that hurts guys bad when their peers turn on them it's a roast guys bad it's like you know it's like you always heard about comedians that like you know like african-american communities when they would comedians they would lose the black audience I mean that's with us but like when when comedians you know don't respect it's a great way to us it's great for weight loss I heard their example no money for food Yeah right yeah um that that could be really devastating to guys let's talk about something just depressing no I mean it's I think you know it's what's important is like what we were talking about earlier we were talking about louis c.k like that when you're doing it the right way not just doing it the right way but like fucking trailblazing like way faster than anybody else is being putting out that kind of material and putting out great stuff it's not like the quality suffering it's just really fun great observations it's there's like a lot of thought behind it's like really great stuff so we sit here and we talk about that like how amazing that is yeah that's that's the positive thing and I'm sure you know he gets that all the time cuz that you know that's what the fuck he's doing you know and he's young he's in and he's he's got this whole momentum thing go and he keeps churning out the great new stuff people keep enjoying it is moving and moving and moving and that's really an example for everyone to see every young comic to see it can be done just do it the right way you do it the right way it's incredibly satisfying but if you hack and chop your way and take other people's premises man boy you're fucking you're not just fucking yourself up you're fucking him up you're fucking the community up if it gets tolerated well you know so it becomes a real problem yeah because I think some of the cliches and you might disagree with me I think I think like basic cliches about comedians are not true like they're a lot you know like all comedians hate each other I think actually that's actually the opposite I think most comedians if you're getting on stage there you're predisposed to like the guy yes or woman yeah and so I see Sinbad I don't know Sinbad but if I see Sinbad I mean I'm not really into his stuff but I feel like hey what's up man hey doing I'm like saying it's like hello it's like there's there's so many different types of comedy you're you're at least gonna be respectful yeah of course oh we're not gonna go out of your way I mean there are exceptions you know we're like I think Larry the Cable Guy and David Cross had like a feud yeah I think that was silly I read David's arguments about that I thought that was really silly I mean I think yeah Larry does have like a few sort of Islamophobic sort of raghead jokes and his act and so but I mean wouldn't that what it would mean is playing a character are we supposed to pretend that the character wouldn't think like that I get confused about that right when you know the guy's name is Dan Whitney and he's doing a thing called Larry the Cable Guy and this guy supposed to be stupid as fuck and live in the south I see Dave's argument that might be encouraging racism but I also like to really do you think you Larry the Cable guy's changing anybody's mind well there's also a bad censorships it's a slippery slope there's a very slippery slope yeah and then shit on anyone's choices when it comes to that I mean some of the funniest stuff I've always said is the most inappropriate ridiculous like Otto and George you know like you ever seen Otto enjoy no no are you kidding one of my favorite new yorky when I first got opening spots in New York around you know and I would tank and then they would there would be a middle that would do okay and then Otto and George would go up what year was this nah 1831 he's got something he's doing online check it out it's called the pig roast I don't know the exact address but if you google it just google Otto and George the pig roast I don't enjoys a hilarious puppet act in New York and he was always like that example of a guy who would just say don't the but the dummy was evil as fuck yeah tell me what's the nasty shit quote is is that people would leave and they would say yeah that one guy was funny but I thought the dummy was really rude oh my god like I I don't yeah he would say some of the craziest most ridiculous racist shit and then dump and he would still the dummy hey man you can't fucking say that it's wrong and the time when I fuck you in the ditch isn't what a great gimmick yeah you know to have a really angry psychotic fucking dummy and the comedy is him he says fucked up shit and you go man I can't believe you saying that every one of not even making brilliant idea I can't believe he did that but that's that's a style of comedy it's like death metal are they really killing people every day right right that's a good way you know it's a style it's it's a type of comedy there's there's you know and people want to say like shock comedy that it's cheap I so disagree because it doesn't work unless it is funny I mean shock comedy won't work on me unless it is funny and there's a certain art to writing ridiculous shocking shit this is there's an art to it and it's a type it's a genre disguise shock comedy is it's the Acela line on in the Northeast that's where why should the Axela a sellout line you know this Amtrak Amtrak from Boston to DC there's the Acela line of you ever oh no no I never have it and but that's where like that's where tough guy comedy comes from is like is like Boston you know New Jersey Philly right it's like that and that that Amtrak train goes up and down that and those are like those are the those are the tough guys you're a tough guy you know I mean how did we get to this well I'm talking about what we're just talking about I don't know I completely lost my did I just made me uncomfortable did I make you uncomfortable really okay but you know what I'm talking about like the I don't charge oh you Otto and George but I don't know or angry mean comedy yeah not not necessarily mean but shocking like I feel in New York it was it was a it's important to appear tough when I was starting out will not not having emotion attached you see that Louis Louie has it and a tell has it and Kevin Brennan has it and Marin I mean even though Marin is such an open book he has a little bit like being unfazed by release on stage right does that make sense oh yeah yeah yeah you don't have it too well you have to well you have to you know really be into what you're thinking about you're into what you're thinking about you know you're not gonna be really fazed if people are into it or not you know that there's a certain number of people that are your people yeah you know there's especially if you're doing weird shit you know I mean you're really clean but really funny but do you ever find yourself in a situation where like everyone in front of you around you is just ya talking about anal fisting or loads and rape and and then you go up and you're like okay if you're like hey who wants to talk about cake what about bacon oh well no it's you appear you know someone's uh you know fuckin a chair rather stimulating that's my look that oh that's my shit and no but it's hard to go up there and go you know you know it's interesting the first section of the USA Today it's hard right because you just appear so boring right but if you follow so if you don't follow someone really filthy or kind of like crushing so weather just crushes crushes or just kind of just irreverent you know just thick irreverence then you know it's not I mean you can do it it's just like it's different styles of comedy I mean it's like if like Metallica went on I wouldn't want Jana Taylor I wouldn't want to be James thanks so you called me dance Taylor James Taylor is awesome by the way I'm a James Taylor fan my mind Emma he's yeah he's a badass I like James yeah for real yeah no so it's your today morning they let me know you were go see I was growing up I remember bad motherfucker when I was 16 I got my driver's license here's another boring story but Jim gasps and I got my driver's license and uh went to a concert with I'm the youngest of six kids so my brothers and sisters went to a concert which was James Taylor concert I know this sounds edgy already so I was 16 and I uh I thought you know all you gotta do is show an ID and they'll let you have a beer and so I showed my ID I got my driver license driver's license that day so I showed him the ID and the guy took my idea because you're not 21 he took the ID so I didn't have an ID so that I got my driver's license that day then the next day my dad in the morning was like hey let me see your driver's license you guys and so then a week later my driver's license shows up in the mail and uh with a letter from the guy who ran you know I don't know what it was somewhere in Chicago alpine valley or whatever and the guy's name was James Taylor so like James Taylor I'm like James dude that was guys are like connected yep i scoped zeros go into my head you're getting crazy I'm getting crazy James Taylor do that it does it to women and occasionally hit the estrogen genes that you have dark dark in the closet tucked away yes see I'm saying the beginning of that song and you just I saw you swap a little EHR you melted a little I melted a little bit got James Taylor song a little back rubs like but that's also you know that's that's kind of now some of those songs it's like I know those songs because of my brothers and sisters right I mean it's not like I was sitting there like alright I'm gonna you know well somebody was you too but did you like did you ever buy James Taylor CD on your own I don't know I don't maybe I don't know no I didn't buy a CD I have proudly I even bought a but you're looking at me when you're like a martial arts expert so you're allowed to you lovely gay shit and people would be like he's still a tough guy I'm not gonna call him a pussy but you know like I sit there and I I read the New York Times and people are like let's beat up the librarian here I mean that's not lanthanide being self-deprecating no everything shut up are you reading the New York Times bit that's happened many times I actually played I was I played football in college people think I'm a pussy that's scary football is fucking terrorist Division three whatever it is do big people run an India man that shit's dangerous did you ever do any of that no I wrestled in high school and my coach was always like Robin you should play football you're crazy you'll be great I wrestled in high school I wrestled 134 pounds I'm 34 pounds that was the ladies division ya know that I was I was under the ladies I would help them yeah ready no I was 167 I remember I was undefeated my senior year well you really you were a killer wrestler 177 again this is a slot high school and so you know like we didn't have tons of guys on the team so like I lost like 10 pounds in a week that remember like people used to do that oh yeah I did that you'd lose ten pounds to go to a different division yeah and you would wrestle that because there was like some you know big fat guy who could do mine because they didn't have someone for that slot right so I lost 10 pounds I was undefeated and then um you know I went out there and I like blacked out God and you know and it was it was brutal cuz I was it was close to an undefeated seated that's pretty badass though I beat the guy that was third in state Wow how come you never did anything with it afterwards you ever tried jujitsu you know I don't like standing up exercise at all I mean ya know I used to be do then but you know I'm not talking about like back in the day I'm talking about like do you do anything right now do you I do that anyone 97 or p99 yeah I heard that's really good I heard it's good to know one I've heard it works that if you just follow what this guys doing it really will chant transfer me but it's all scientific print I just to work out I used you know I was pretty buff I've watched a video of it and let's fucking pretty intense stuff I tried it once it's I couldn't do it it's intense and do you work out five days a week at least five days a week do you have like a gym in your house I have two gyms in my house well that's normal everyone I have a weightlifting gym in my house and I also have a kickboxing set up once all caged in in my garage that's amazing yeah it's a company did it for rather a television showed you to call Garage Mahal it's pretty badass never release that yeah yeah yeah it's a Bill Goldberg that big wrestler guy yes the the host of it and they take over your garage in three days they transformed it my garage is just like a absolute and then and then just then you're kind of like where am I gonna park my car no no it's a four car garage so I have two cars to squad gentleman is a four years um so I - two cars is just Pat it up and cake kind of cars do you highways they're all cars yeah like cars online days well I minute you you got two cars I got a few cars how many cars do you have Jay I have four cars four cars really and what's what's the what's your the love of your life car I have a Porsche gt3 like the it's it's basically like a regular Porsche they take all the unnecessary shit out of it like the backseat they strip all the sound-deadening they make it lighter they pick up put a bigger stronger high revving racing engine in it tighten up the suspension carbon-fiber brakes the whole thing it just becomes this most the most ridiculous responsive car you could ever drive it's like you're glued to the road like you feel like everything it's incredible not even not even for driving fast like driving illegally this is this is kind of it makes me think at this point it's like when you started stand-up did you think that you were I mean maybe I don't know you that well it's like I went into stand-up because I wanted to I I never had an expectation that I would be able to afford to have a family from stand-up yeah II didn't expect that you'd be able to own four cars no never of course man I I never would have believed that I could make a living off of it in the beginning that was a dream a distant dream the great dream was to be a local Boston stand-up comic to be like a local guy you know there was a bunch of local guys that made a livin they drove look he's got a nice Honda yeah absolutely got a great fucking apartment a loft is these offices on the top boy that's where he writes he's a pro like this is a pal that gets paid to be a comic who's that I was doing he likes yeah living unfathomable yeah I just had a series of shitty jobs you know all of it drove a limo did construction did every pot delivered newspapers every possible ridiculous job so no and what I never thought I'd have four cars so I never thought I'd have money at all it's amazing yeah it's amazing weird it's it's well you know and I think the lesson that other people can learn always from anyone success is it might not be the same path but if anybody can do it you can do it it really is that fucking simple it might not be everything you know it might not be I can't play basketball I can't run a jumper I'm not fast you know like I'm too short I can't do that maybe I could maybe if I dedicated myself 100% of them and it wasn't their guy like Mugsy Bogues it was like five six you play NBA but the point is whatever the fuck it is just just do it just go do it find the weed Riley right I think if any if anybody can do it you can do it I think there's also adjusting because you know when you have these when you do like interviews like when you're you know touring doing stand-up headlining in clubs you'll get interviewed by the local paper yeah and they'll want to create some story it's like over a headline he's from Indiana he had no shoes don't talk to him about cake you know it's like these elaborate stories so it ends up you know it's like I don't even you our stories are real stories uh they kind of adjust like I think when I started stand-up I love to stand up but I wanted to be a writer for Letterman I thought that would be an unbelievable job and you know it's just it's an amazing yeah that's earning lievable job I mean that's like the elite of the elite as far as comedy writers like this is Bobby writes for Letterman whoa yeah I for Letterman holy shit yeah when we started yeah Letterman was always the top of the eye I think right now I mean I love Letterman but I think Jimmy Kimmel is at least as equal I think Jim is fucking brilliant why I really think these are all yes yeah I think well yeah Conan is always equal I mean he's always funny in his own way you know he's I think he's very different those are the those other guys and I think one of the beautiful things about his show was all the things that people have grown accustomed to that they pulled from him that he can't even use now and I think it's really fucked up the whole it's so silly the whole thing to me is they're so stupid what you can't do the talking dog anymore you can't do it you know you watts there's like a million things that you can't do anymore like that's just a petty horseshit I think that's completely paddy yeah it's ridiculous it's it's a strange you let the show go that's the show the show's over there now it's with Conan come on man yeah this is so silly it's very strange they should be able to buy it back they should just sell it back to us what happens in the NFL you know someone goes and they you know they're the head coach here and then then you go there he goes to another team you you get something for yeah it's not like you're sitting there because I think there's no like these coaches they're not supposed to be able to coach right you know like if they leave they have to finish their contract of seven years or whatever they're not supposed to be able to coach for the rest of the seven years but they do anyway well that's a didn't that happen with radio with Tom Leykis oh really Tom like has had a deal with the 9070 1fm talk in LA and they syndicated his show all throughout the country and those talk radio shows I don't know what killed the man what would kill talk to you like is because look man when you think about what that was that that net network I believe they had Howard on in the morning right was Howard yeah and then it was was frosty Heidi and Frank and it was like there's a bunch of good fucking Joe's it's like how did that get how did that go away like what what happened what killed talk radio well radio is just hurting in general and they were they were fighting on these podcasts yeah no no no I don't know is cuz that was before podcast before we had ever done oh it is like this was off the air yeah but satellite radio was climbing them was podcast but podcast really popular when one like us was off their podcast we obviously weren't doing but where was anybody yeah pop guys were really popular and then it went away then the iPhones kind of came out and it like they start that was pre Carolla podcast it was right Corolla still have the radio it was satellite radio that's my said it was the morning show after a while remember he lured with the satellite that's what do people listen to in the morning in LA like living a nice little radio you used to be awesome that's one of the things that I used to love the most about driving to work and being stuck in traffic was that I was listening to Howard Stern well you would recall it so no no he's still on but I mean a regular radio regular radio that doesn't yes anymore there's nobody like that anymore me there there are some morning shows like Kevin and bean and Ellen yeah I'm okay they're still great are huge yeah they're they're little I don't know Carson Daly and secrets don't they have shows Carson Daly has a radio show I thought so does this do I don't know I know Seacrest does Seacrest has like a hundred thousand fucking jobs he must be insane yeah nobody works harder than that guy I know who has put some more hours a day than that guy he's on that a show he's got a radio show he's on he's on the Star Search whatever the fuck it is what is Dancing with the Stars with the fuck is he on the big white American Idol the big one that's you're still on DJ is amazing there is some early sometimes what you're saying there is something about people want to it's not greed it's like I think that and I don't know Ryan Seacrest big surprise and uh but I think he you know he wants his empire yeah oh I think some people want their empire but I think you recognized I think that he's a smart guy think that's you know and it's very smart but it's maybe it's crazy I think it is a little crazy probably look really want to have a little fun well and also he might just superb that the only thing he's into is like entertainment it might hurt to Brian what are you doing with the fucking thing you crazy asshole what what are you doing with that effect I'm getting ready to get the bathroom oh oh so you gonna leave the screen like this yeah I saw my life tie dinner that's very clever do you feel weird right next to each other on this video screen can we just talk look just let's look at the screen and let's see if we can have a conversation this way I bet we can I bet we can know how to even agenda over there it's too weird it's like I'm not the brightest guy it's a weird thing to watch yourself talk I don't think that's healthy yeah I'm not I I was editing my special and you know my wife and I were and it was it's I hate a thing is like it's one thing it's like I'm out of shape it's like that's the beauty of like not looking at yourself is not realizing how out of shape you've gotten not that I was easy to look at before I was out of shape you're half your act is about like a little bit about self-indulgence and yes the delicious things and gluttony do you think that if you if you got yourself in like spiffy condition that might fuck up your material no I'm a variable say shit like that before that's interested you know there was a point you know when about a year ago well I was doing this something else but I thought you know I was I was working out khun's I had more time so I was working out more consistently and not eating horribly at 3:00 in the morning and I was like you know it entered my mind it's like am I gonna be too in shape for some of these jokes but I don't know that's kind of that's just me being neurotic right what can we do it J for these jokes that's hilarious what a great escape clause I can't I my act is so important I can't do sit-ups I can't you know I work out but it might mess up like that third chunk that's in the hour this is so stupid but I really believe this that I was getting into meditation and I was getting into yoga and a bunch of things when I was young and when I first started on getting in a comedy and then I thought about I said you know what maybe I shouldn't do this because maybe becoming more enlightened it's probably bad for my a that's interesting because then I wouldn't be making fun of as many things or picking as many victims yet now that especially that's a comedian fear right she's especially Boston style comedy so mean so you know you tack it's a tack style you know I was thinking man if I became enlightened and I was all like peace in love like this be terrible for my act and I'm not gonna stop being a commune you know might not I wouldn't want to eat healthy you know hahaha I'm like okay I got another hour and maybe a fag I'm not so healthy I owe my fans yeah and then you run out of shut and then you go healthy and then nobody wants to come see anymore well I used to be really thin I mean I did I know you're looking at me like no I believe you no no I don't know I I actually remember you being thin just uh I mean not even a decade ago Yeah right yeah how many how long ago was it um I don't know eight years ago who was the guy there was a guy who was like a really funny fat guy and then he lost a lot of weight and then he kind of like stopped being around I want to say Vic Vic something in Vic Dunlap was it very funny funny I was thinking Vic Vic done yeah very funny is really really heavy and then he lost a lot of weight where he had the surgery and the surgery I don't know if he did or didn't but whatever whatever method he choose chose me maybe I'm just not up on what he's doing these days but I remember seeing that guy everywhere when he was big and then you know he got skinny and you know don't hear about it too much no well you know it's it's weird because we also people will disappear and you don't even realize they're gone yeah that is weird right and that guys that you were like that I thought that guy was going to be around forever like that I've been really funny it's interesting here is that women is that getting married having kids you can't be that it could be some people get tired of the stress you know Jim and I were talking about how much we love stand-up who never quit doing it but everybody's got a different psychological makeup and for some people the the anxiety and performance is like really intense yeah especially it's also it's I think that some of its luck I mean it's a real cruel business yes so I mean I was definitely an angry guy you know like for a lot of people were successful before me and I was I was a bitter couple years yeah really well how'd you get yourself out of that therapy really yeah Wow you know and that's you know just also I came to the conclusion that I was not doing stand-up uh you know I wanted you know I wanted to be I was happy for my friend success but I felt like I was a failure but like I had to come to the conclusion what is success and what success is is like doing what you love and actually getting paid for it and so then I adopted that attitude and then things started going my way and that's why I'm releasing a twelve book series that's interesting man that's really cool I love hearing stuff like that I love hearing somebody figuring things out and just turning it all around a lot of wasted energy on it yeah that's really yes a lot of wasted on haters always saying no haters or winners there's no no no no people out there writing scathing YouTube comments where they just break down your fucking soul right winter student they're not happy young way you are you're wasting your energy wasting it you know yeah it's also it's like you put out you get what you put out yes you do yeah and it does make you feel you know like if you're feeling shitty it's like and you help someone you feel better yes but ically if you steal from them while you're helping them yeah I don't know man it's uh it's it's just really nice to me to see someone kind of figure things out like that and like get a get a new perspective of it don't win we have to learn these lessons like sure over and over and over I remember who said it but they said that inspiration is effective but it's like bathing it only lasts for so long why we recommend daily yeah and the idea being that you know I guess it's easy to fall into a pattern of just not not having your shit together or not thinking right or you know letting yourself get jealous or letting yourself go down a negative way yeah you know people like this is a big cliche like you know I'm just trying to keep it positive strike you sometimes keep what really keeping positive means is addressing some shit that's not positive at all you know and getting to know what the fuck is making you tick and if you find out that you're getting angry for someone else's success for no reason it's like your your brain knows you're talented you like you know you're telling but why isn't anybody else seeing it instead of your brain using that resource and going let's just make sure it's undeniable let's let's just concentrate on being funnier and funnier till no one could say shit yeah well it's the on denial but I think also it's for me it's it's very much like I have to be in touch with being humble I know this is sounding really corny no not like usually when I'm angry is when I think I'm in control I'm somehow like I'm crazy enough to think that I can control the entertainment business or I can control whether you know my flights delayed you know that yeah that's just insane you know it's like well maybe if I'm angry too this flight attendant the plane will take off sooner you know it doesn't make sense so when I'm in touch with you know being humble it it ends up paying off yeah that's a very important that's not a 13th book of my series well we're talking about early about guys who wind up stealing material and the that stealing is the opposite of being humble you you want more credit for what you've achieved or for wool yeah what you've you know what who you are what you're selling you want it you're pretending it's better than it really is it's the exact opposite of humility and that is the exact wrong state of mind to be in for creativity I think yeah yeah yeah that's that's so fucking awesome that you figured that out man I am I was for sure at certain point in time early in my career I really had a hard time enjoying comedy because when someone would kill you know when someone was really good I would always thinking is mad they better than me fuck hope they're not better than me man fuck how good is that like I it's got pretty fucking good like it bother me that something was good and I couldn't just enjoy it I couldn't just sit back and watch and it took a while before I figured that out leather that that was holding me back that I would work with people and if they were really good I would get nervous you know instead of the way I do it now I bring like really funny people on the road with me on purpose because I want to be laughing to like I want you know when when I work with Ari Shaffir I don't know yeah yeah but him and Duncan Trussell and Joey Diaz and Tom Segura all he's really funny guy so what I'm sitting there waiting to go onstage I'm laughing my ass off and it puts me in the perfect state of mind like I want them to be brilliant I want him to kill but when I was young I was terrified of it I didn't want anybody else to be any good I wanted them to be terrible so that I could fuck it skate by on my my shitty act yeah well it's amazing how you get alert all and I think it's I think it's insane how I think podcasts are making comedians like it's it's siphoning out I mean I'm a joke Smith and it's it's adding a a you know discourse or kind of reflection back into stand-up right whereas it used to be like what's the deal with keys right and so now it's I feel like I don't know maybe I'm wrong but you know it's it's like podcasts are influencing some of this you know it's like Pete Holmes even said that to me said that his podcast is changing his act I'm like that makes sense it's it's got to be so fun to like when you hear a bit and then you can go you know what because you know when you hang around some friends you know like 3:00 in the morning you don't have someone recording it right like when you're doing a podcast you go back to like that in the middle I said something funny that might be a bit that might be a bit oh yeah I've definitely come up with some bits from the podcast 100% for sure right yeah it mean you're talking three hours at a pop you know many times we've done many three-hour ones we did a Kevin Smith one I think that was honest way over there like three and a half hours yeah and it's thanks to Twitter to for reminding you you know be like like you'll say something and be like oh shit I did say that Oh Twitter is amazing that's amazing twitter is changing how I mean I've done things on Twitter and I remember like a year ago I I did some jokes cuz we just had a kid and I was driving to do a show and the guy who was opening he was like you're gonna put those in your act aren't you and I was like I didn't even think of that and he was like yeah and it's like they're great jokes like and now like Twitter is this source of like is this funny I mean yeah 99% of the time no but if you can get to great lines oh yeah open up a topic well you're gonna get them you're going to get some tweets from this podcast for sure well people will quick tweet quotes that you sell and laughs that happens all the time right and you'll forget you even said it yeah yeah and then someone will tweet it yeah what do you what's your numbers now would you have the numbers numbers for your Twitter followers I am it's so funny it's like with all in Hollow everyday there's a strange obsession but it's it's like it's nine I think it's 960 something but I'm gonna call 96 nine hundred and sixty nine hundred sixty nine hundred sixty thousand holy shit but I've I've been working dude I've been working you're you and also nine million you gonna feel different you know it's you know I've only over the past month or two started to even have conversations on there like first of all I initially I was like I'm not gonna have a conversation then I don't but here's the first one the first one is and some of my friends do this so it's like it's like to each their own it's like when someone says uh Jim Gaffigan was awesome tonight you know part of me the desire is to retweet that but that's almost bragging yeah you get a humble brag for that right that is so and so then there's the there's that and then there's even having converse like I had always wanted my timeline to just be jokes just jokes you know I'd you know like maybe maybe at you know an appearance page list you know it's like I'll be in Tampa blah blah blah by the way I will be in fine on June 2nd No and so because Jim Gaffigan calm Jim Gaffigan calm and so I would do that but there's also something insane about that because it's there is something social and the you know if your friend says something funny it would be fun to respond so I've just been doing that for the past two months but how many people do you follow I follow a lot I follow a lot do I follow over a thousand it kind of sucks I've been thinking about like cutting my numbers down later campus yeah but there's so many people are like dude I told you about the I tweeted it like for a week and I've cut I've cut a few celebrities I was following some celebrities as a goof and is yeah let's just say just moronic shit over and over again and I'd get crazy and I'd have to delete it well if this is I've done that but I also feel like that's that's kind of like inviting someone to dinner and then saying sorry you can't come isn't it I don't know no it's about people unfollow me all the time especially like really douchey people I'll so I got mature like some woman will get mad at my not wanting women to be running things right quote about that early fucking sexist pig by the way that all came from watching a woman yell and scream at a guy yesterday pointing his face and in the ridiculous situation where I thought they could escalate the violence and I might have to step in is like kind of craziness right so that's just the origin of that so you know but uh well maybe not really maybe I just made that up too you don't know we don't know I don't know but we're gonna agree with you cuz we're sitting in a room with you but uh what was the thing about the twitter thing it's how about this how about like when you have like you know a comedian afraid you know there's friends and then there's peers that you kind of know right and you'll be like hey you know I'm gonna send them a direct message and then you realize they don't follow you is there a little bit like really yeah really you don't follow me I've done that accidentally though and I apologize like I didn't realize it wasn't following somebody and this people that I knew I was following me for some reason it wasn't I've had Twitter Twitter's been doing that a lot lately and I think it's the iPhone I think if you have the iPhone you'll have the app open and then you could easily like hit it I know hello unfollow yeah because it happens to me all the time you know what else I've happened you know I used to have a blackberry and I had an iPhone at the same time and when I had my blackberry I would go on and check a direct message on Twitter and then I would go I gotta get I got to respond to that eventually but I don't have time right now and then I would go check it online and there'd be no direct message yeah it wouldn't exist anymore what the fuck well I do I do know that if they delete a text message it deletes it oh and unknowingly and everything so somebody can send it to you think that you didn't respond just delete it yeah and then there's another thing I like going to Doug if you if you go to somebody's page and it says that you're not following them if you hit refresh a lot of times then it will say you're following it like it just doesn't show up that you're following up it's then you might click it thinking like ah I thought I owned a ball that's unfair you on are you kidding me yeah yeah so anytime you oh great that's like I exist with enough guilt already yeah you know it's so anyway I got it I eventually am to go oh you got to get out of here right now yeah what time is it 8:00 yeah seat 17 yeah alright listen to you sexy bitch this is so uh no thank you anytime I please I'm bi you're awesome man anytime you want to do it please how often are you out here in LA not that often you live in New York City kids for kids you live in Manhattan yeah wow what is that like with four kids living in my hands like really hard
