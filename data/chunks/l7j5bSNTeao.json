so let's say this I think was trans McKenna that people have a problem was something that's real that you can't hit with a hammer right and I think that's a real way of putting it it's a real engine because sparks are real as dude and you can't wrap your hands around them but you know they're real sound is real but we accept it because we're so used to it the idea of this invisible thing can could transmit music and harmony and and beautiful feelings and make you pumped up and you here in your car sing another one what the is that this invisible and invisible shitty but it's coming from  satellites down plus we want to think that we've got the whole world figured out we want to think that we know what's real and what's here and that all the we consensus all that is there and I say that I say that's ridiculous [Music] dude we're weird we're weird and we don't realize how weird we are like while we're being weird we don't realize it well well it's you know you got to work on this life to make money what the  is money who are you what is this what are we doing here and if you look at the resources that you have available to you being 24 hours in a day and a certain amount your health I think about what you dedicate most of that resources to and what's your reward on that will you get a house you got a box where you can pass out every night in front of the television is that what you're doing the idea that you need to do anything is stupid and people used to always tell me that you like all you need to grow up you need to grow up what to do what to die do I to fall into line to follow a pattern you don't need to do anything nobodies do anything you need to breathe you need to eat food the rest of it is the structure that we've sort of invented to sort of give ourselves something to do when we wake up in the morning well time to go to work works not real the car's not real life's not real this is what's real heart beats and when those bitches stop all that that you created and stockpiled and worked for means nothing these objects don't even exist when you're dead when you're dead you're gonna go to another dimension where you can't take this with you you know or not or delight you shut up what life is about us interacting with each others and if you can contribute in any way there's a lot of people that are great paths that contribute to this world by being a great parent by raising someone's gonna influence other people and a lot of them don't necessarily get too much credit for that that's an incredible resource and the idea that every one of them is just  up the world whatever the world's period it's where we're 2014 all right though the direction that we're going in is wait wait it's all where's too many of us there's too much pollution it's not changing there's nothing as the global warming is happening whether you like it or not whether you blame it on Democratic vagina sponsors whatever that whatever you do doesn't matter yeah let's live just live be alive I could just see like being cut into one of those YouTube videos that somebody chose and in the background there's like people walking fast then the Sun rising really it's slow and
