I don't know if I can handle that what clocks wrong I mean just subtly so subtly we live yeah one of them is wrong which one is it I think they're both wrong that's all if that says 1211 once is 1215 1213 on my 1213 this one says 1214 that one says 1211 what I want to strap c-4 to this and this one I want to spike against the wall yes are you OCD with time or with everything good everything yeah yeah like my reloading room is disgustingly perfect and if I load the dishwasher all the forks have to be symmetrical on one side the spoons have to be in there there well like all the mugs that tall ones have to be on one side and then like yeah what's that all about I don't know I came back to pull the sucker up to your face the when you when everything is the same and something's not the same it's easy its easiest to see that way right right so like counterfeiting like if you're if you're buying a check in a 13 year old girl in Tijuana and you're gonna want to get the guy for counterfeit money and you want to get him for human trafficking and you starts handing you crappy bills the easiest way to spit-spot the bills is to be able to see have all of your proper bills all in the right order so the one that's fake is gonna stick out and they're like ah man only you would use that example when you're going to Tijuana and someone's trafficking human slavery that's a good counter fit money is a good example yeah and if you have a 13 year old girl with a bunch of 18 year old girls you can see the 13 year old get a little a little bit easier right yeah so applies to everything you know and feels like a hunter a bunch of if you reload and you have a bunch of grain bullets and you're gonna measure and then lot them all point 5 separation and grains so it's like 175 175 point 5 176 174 point 5 and so on when you stack them all together the easiest way to group them instead of measuring every single one is to look at them and just put the ones that are similarly sized all together smallest to largest and then you can then you can weigh them in kind of batches have you always been like this Thanks everything yeah my mostly what about was like when you were fighting your training did you like map out everything to the rap yep to the detail yeah training notes mm-hmm great Greg if you watch some of our fights and I mean your cage side for almost all of mine in the UFC you'd hear Greg be like okay so that went according to plan or all right so let's go ahead and change things up a little bit cuz you just got your ass kicked you know then we'd have to adjust he's one of the more interesting corner guys he's so much fun yeah he's uh he enjoys it and seems to like want you to enjoy it too he's like all right that went amazing you know is that cookies let's get some deep breaths you're doing fantastic yeah in between rounds with Michael Bisping there's a five-round fight he comes in and tells me a joke he told he told me like a knock-knock joke and then why I chicken cross the road joke and I sitting there and there's a picture of me like quizzical you're looking at him I'm like I'm gonna kill you out of this like what are you doing and he just wanted me to relax you just wanted me to breathe one because I was doing everything I was supposed to be doing and I just needed to you know he just thought you were too tense apparently oh yeah a dick playing mind games in the middle of in the middle of a fight well you have one minute to figure out what to do I want to say to a guy and just was what some people for five minutes yeah yeah some people have a little more do you know that I discussed that yesterday with Big John Big John the podcast yesterday we fucked up and he forgot to talk about it during the podcast but after the podcast he explained what happened he says that it was the UFC cut man's fault because he left a giant glob of Vaseline on yells I he didn't want to touch it because he felt like if he touched it could open the cut up again you know he called the I guess it was the guy's name Tate he tried to call and get the guy to come back in the guy wouldn't come back in so the corner men tried to come in he said no he's like you got to bring the cut man back and then he wound up doing it by himself it was a perfect storm he said he fucked up he said yeo-hwa was definitely playing it off and he said but if he had to do it differently he would a made yo l stand up and B he would have made sure that fucking cot man didn't leave the cage with that big glob of acid I was just talking crap uh planning rap about yeah it was um so but that was a giant issues a thirty second thirty second issue yeah for a guy who was really wobbled at the end of the second round yeah and my route to the title yeah it was a big deal yeah that's a bummer but it was the perfect storm you know and um and now he's fighting for the title so you know hopefully he represents Cuba well he's a bad motherfucker yeah he's a freak yeah he really is right yeah listen yeah I mean when like it's there's so much going on there it's like this the years of training and that crazy Cuba Olympic program there's phenomenal genetics you know his experience and competing there's so much going on there with that guy mmm layers and layers Olay and layers of the highest level of competition mixed in with a life that I think has been very complementary to a mindset of an athlete you know he has pretty much been shaped most of his life to be a highest level athlete tricky part is man Whitakers good whiticus very good very good and very young you know and Whitaker you gotta remember had his knee blown out in the first round he got his knee hyper-extended Torres MCL pretty badly in the first round and still was able to stuff takedowns and arguably the best wrestler who's ever fought in MMA yeah pretty impressive shit that's a great fight that's a couple weeks from now well yeah jock ray and what's-his-face just fought Calvin yeah was it you still d still are you like you're so close to the division you're paying attention to it and you're just recently retired do you still get itchy I have a crazy competition bug but not to fight I'm gonna do a bunch of jujitsu this year I'm competing in long gun smart marksman stuff three gun you know have you steal stuff so lot is what is a long gun is that like it's like LaLanne yeah really long range but not so there's a bunch of different styles of competitive shooting you know there's like guys that run around shoot around barricades very quickly and then there's kind of a slow aim fire an array style where you're going standing offhand or weird shooting positions and then there's it doesn't matter it just matters how far you can shoot that's it you have a buddies into that yeah he's into bang and steel like a mile away or what yeah the fuck it is yep that's that's a crazy ballistic calculations and literally calculating the curve of the earth yeah yeah barometric pressure I mean the temperature of your ammo to a degree plays a factor that every imaginable measurable thing plays a factor and how the bullet is gonna fly that's a it's a real touchy subject in hunting because it's uh there's a lot of people that are getting into that with like really long range shots on animals yeah question about whether or not it's ethical and who's it ethical for yeah III don't know worst in on that um I really love I bounced between rifle hunting and bow hunting as a kid the first time that I took a shot that I wasn't 100% positive the animal wouldn't just fall over I mean my dad scuffed me up you know and I was like 11 so there has since then been a this the preponderance responsibility has always been on the hunter too without question no the animal is gonna fall right then right there we're not stocking it for two days you know I'm not following a blood trail for nine hours to see an animal hyperventilating now then the meats not even good huge adrenaline spike you know it's like right there that's your meat and you're gonna go get it so that's best-case scenario but even then animals jump the string yeah and how do you do that when you're shooting something that the bullet flight is gonna be up for six seconds right yeah you know is it really that long yeah how long is it like them if you're shooting say a thousand yards Oh a thousand three three seconds yeah that's a long time that is a long time animals can take a couple steps in three seconds yeah hearts this big you know sighs our two fists and that's not a lot of margin of error the wind changing one mile an hour one mile an hour at a thousand at a thousand yards could could make you miss that heart Wow yeah yeah it's it's one of those weird sort of things where people are getting into it because there's a bragging rights aspect of it you know you shot this elk at 800 yards and most people go 800 you are you know you tell somebody shot some of the 200 yards they go oh it's a good shot yeah that's reasonable ethical you know if you have you crosshairs on an animal's vitals at 200 yards basically a dead animal absolutely well you get you get to like six seven hundred like yeah that's a tiny little spot you're aiming at yeah shit gets Wiggly yeah I mean and yeah I think you're a conservationist yes I think I'm a conservationist and you know you know we're talking in the tens of millions of dollars go into conservation from hunters every single day from from hunting and you know the u.s. Wildlife Department of Wildlife they don't know how they're going to be paying for the protection of habitats without hunting permits because the number of people that are hunting or shrinking so I mean there's a huge influx and question of about how moral are different styles of hunting and what are the best how are we going to make sure that we protect these animals and protect their habitats all the while you know I was telling you about that elk I shot at the beginning of the year and I had I had a clean broadside shot at 600 meters and I was like I'm shooting a threeway totally super doable you know I could I can do that almost in my sleep on my home range but I'm shooting an animal you know I was like no I mean let me just walk this guy down another Ridge yeah so move up when come back down and my next shot was that like 320 you know one shot and he sits down so that there I think the responsibility always in all things should fall on the individual but now it's just getting all the individuals to actually have responsibility that's where it gets really really stupid yeah there's there's just there's just people that they're not good people they don't they weren't raised well or good some people in in moments yeah what do you mean when you say that like my mom and I we argue about this a lot yeah it's like she thinks people are inherently good you know I don't like what you've seen so much of the bad but yeah obviously I'm gonna have a callused I'm not gonna have the most objective perspective but like I want I think people are good but like I think hunters in general let's just use that as because that's what we're talking about right now of a hundred hunters what percentage are gonna do the right thing are gonna do the moral thing the ethical thing the thing that's the best interest for the animal for conservation for nature out of out of 100 you know if they're on a hunt they'll be saved for sure the majority okay and now it gets down to you know guesswork as to what the numbers are but like 60% well I'd seem more oh I like to think it's in the 70s or 80s I wish it was a hundred for sure you know and I wish anything other than that was just a mistake you know but there's gonna be people that poach it's gonna be people that cross property boundaries when they know they're not supposed to it's gonna be people that shoot an animal when the season opens tomorrow morning and they get there you know a day early and they see an animal they just say fuck it I'm just gonna shoot it and hang it and say I shot it the next day there's like gray area stuff you know where you're you're definitely doing something illegal but it's still hunting you still have a tag you know and it says people bending the rules yeah like when and then there's people that just you know they'll shoot two three animals I mean am I supposed to shoot one they'll hide the meat yeah there's there's there's always going to be people like that assholes yeah yeah selfish no it's always gonna be people like that unfortunately and the thing about hunting is it's so controversial in a world where 95 to 97 depending on who you ask percent of the people eat meat it's still very controversial to go out and kill yourself just weird I still can't understand this weird I know in addition to people being you know maybe moral or immoral or most are good or most are bad this the contradiction of people not even using their brains you know um I had the best tacos I've ever had in my life last week and I was after getting waterboarded yeah yep yeah maybe they tasted extra sweet but I had a bunch of friends over we we had some wine from right right next door to where my parents like where I grew up and that the animal that we're cooking man I saw it for a day as I walk this thing down I mean the most beautiful majestic creature like I said I was 600 moved into under just under 3 or right at 3 and so I got to see it in life I got to see it at its death I got to see after death you know I have I have the whole entire trophy you know just just like you but I have two freezers yeah garnered six almost 600 cumulative pounds from the hide the head and the meat for the owner to shy have 400 pounds of meat off that thing there's not a two freezers full of meat you know it's big animal it's a big and delicious it's so good it's so good it's the best for you too it just feels differently so good in your mouth yeah it's the best for you and your man yeah it's best for your body - I feel like it charges me up I want to fight velociraptors after I think I mean I want to go to Colombia to Mehta ain't where the good stuff is steel some of the good coke you like the old Pablo Escobar style coke and then bring that back to whoever I am and I think that's the equivalent of what good elk tastes like in your mouth I've never done good coke or bad coke so I've never done any coke but judging from the amount of money that Pablo Escobar made and the way that people talked about it and know how rich met een still is I think it's pretty good stuff so I'm definitely a high demand yeah contrast that the contradiction would be like people who are animal rights lovers would be like you just talked about this majestic animal that you watched and you admired and then you shot it and killed it yeah god is beautiful you can say yeah I still love it yeah I love every single ounce of it I know and I agree with you but for people that are you know maybe and where I talk to this well many of them have ever been to not that I'm dogging on the cattle industry because I'm not I think they try to do the best that they can with what they have to produce enough food to feed a huge ever-growing population I mean that says this is a hard thing you're been to one of those farms I have yeah I don't have the good ones and I've been to bad ones yeah I know how my animal died yeah and it died fast peacefully right where it loved bean and never felt anything never saw anything it just crumbled yeah there's also the balance of life - there's just unless you want to bring wolves and more mountain lions into Texas and to wherever you know you're they tried that that's not that's not working that's not work no they brought the wolves and now they're looking to hunters like me to come in to balance the wolves because that wolves are decimating the herds to a degree that they've never seen ever because there's there's no balance there's nothing to balance the Wolves right so what was the amount of available food resources now the wolves are just killing everything so even Yellowstone they're like can we bring in some Pro hunters to try and balance this if they dock down the herd and Yellowstone by 90% at one point huh 90% just from the wolves they brought in the 90s yes okay we lost the Wolves from the 60s to the 80s so let's bring back some wolves in the 90s and think that we can balance things and while it paid a positive effect for about 10 years then 20 2010 rolls around they're like wait wait a second they're killing entire herds like we might lose all indigenous elk here if we don't do something immediately so now they're bringing in guys like me to dart them and retry and relocate them and bring cows whatever well the whole idea behind it was so crazy they went and got these giant Canadian gray wolves and brought them over here and into a place where the animals had do you know they had no knowledge of wolves they had wiped out the wolf population and besides the wolf is bigger than what was originally here so naturally the amount of calories that that wolf needed was greater and with with a hundred years of lack of evolution for the animals that were there to know what to do yeah it was just fish in a barrel for these wolves that I'm adapting though they're adapting hopefully adapting quick but they're still getting jacked the inner part of the problem is people say well so they're they're killing the weak animals but they're not using the weak ones go down into the farmlands you're getting like the the cows and the calves the smaller elk the female elk and the babies they're moving into farmlands and the big males when they're not rutting they stay up in the mountains and they use usually form these like bachelor herds and then when they're not rutting and when this is happening that's where the wolves are so the wolves are killing I mean I have friends that live in Idaho and friends that live in Montana and they're like it's bad like there there's a lot of fucking wolves killing giant elk I've been failing in communicating well so right now we agree with each other and we're you know almost echoing the same sediments so that person that doesn't agree with us that that vegetarian/vegan the conservationists that looks at us like no no you guys are hunters you can't be conservationists where does the conversation start where is the middle ground where you can find what one or an opportunity to build rapport and have a conversation have a discussion to have maybe even a debate where you can intellectually talk through your different perspectives I've been feeling at this miserably of late and I've been getting a lot of it's it's weird when my social media a lot of I think I have a lot of conservative military you know pro-second amendment types that follow me when that whole entire base is mad at me which is weird and then on the other side the the far-left progressive side is looking at me and be like oh we hate you too so I'm like I have now pissed off 95% of people social media because I'm trying to find middle ground so he can talk have you pissed off the Conservatives yeah have you done that um Lance Armstrong and I were talking about gun control after the the parklands shooting in Florida and he asked me do you think gun controls a solution and I said absolutely I think gun control can be a massive solution verbatim that's exactly what I said now to me gun control those are words words like well-regulated militia the words in the Constitution that that's almost synonymous to me gun laws also a form of gun control just like a well-regulated militia I think that having good safe gun laws save lives I don't want to have a felon an ms-13 guy an illegal immigrant somebody that's been dishonorably discharged for the military to get their hands on a gun we had those laws those are forms of gun control in my opinion but the Conservatives second amendment if you use the words gun control like I was immediately called Benedict Arnold I'm a traitor I was a Duff I don't even know what a Duff is that was a reoccurring one I think was the guy from Roger Rabbit the guy that would hunt around with the gun but he didn't know how to use the gun because he always missed Roger Rabbit do you mean Bugs Bunny yeah yeah Bugs Bunny step that's a little Elmer Fudd yeah a fight that's what they called me a bud yeah so I know hundreds of people and I would just I'm trying to have a conversation with Lance Armstrong a guy that had never shot a gun at the time that was against private private citizens really owning guns and he couldn't be more for gun control but I wanted to talk to him yeah and so I had no problem using his vernacular using you know the words that he's comfortable with like gun control even though to me that's just gun laws that's well-regulated militia I mean I'm a huge Second Amendment phone I don't think anybody has ever questioned that until this moment we if they just pay attention to you for five minutes all they have to do is just go to your social media and it's not an anti-gun guy no it's on the range how many days a week six fire come on yeah like I'm mad that I'm here with you he's I'm out on the range yeah but I'll make it up tomorrow yeah you're you're a gun nut yeah for sure for sure that meets an Occupational thing yes I have no choice this is this is this is what I do now if you want to be excellent at your job you must be again yeah yeah well in that conversation I disavowed apparently my my huge group of Second Amendment loving people I have a theory on that I think there's a lot of people are just looking to get pissed off and if you say any word that they decide is a hot-button word like gun control they don't care if you've thought it out you have a rational perspective on what you consider gun control like there was a statement that was released by a group of hunters it was hunters for gun control and they had a bunch of reasonable reasons why people shouldn't have a firearm that could get a firearm currently and it all made sense but the the response to that the backlash of it doesn't it's not debate it's like people on that that side the pro-second amendment side they are so terrified of any new regulation and they think that you have to hold your ground because any slipping backwards is gonna eventually lead to someone taking your guns away I mean I I do understand the death by a thousand cuts you know I think that has always been the perspective you know if you look at it's not like Adolf Hitler said okay we're gonna kill all the blacks and all the Jews overnight that's not what happened right it was it was over the course of seven eight years where he just very slowly incrementally changed laws okay they're not allowed to shop here okay they're not allowed to go here okay now we're gonna move him all into the same area and very slowly not slowly in a matter of five six seven years he started a genocide of an entire ethnicity and that's that fear it's okay it's gonna be it's gonna be incremental and we're and at some point we're gonna turn around and look and be like look at all of this freedom that we've lost I think it's the same you know I with during right after 9/11 when George Bush you know that the Freedom Act or the Patriot Act the Patriot Act you know like that was one of the largest losses of privacy that Americans have ever experienced but we're fearful we are scared and you know like I love dangerous freedom but overnight we lost a ton of that not incrementally just overnight and but the most efficient way is to take it bit by bit by bit so I get that but for Christ's sakes man I'm like you can't find somebody that's more of a proponent second than me except apparently on that day when I pissed off so I'm trying to figure out how to have a conversation I can't do it I don't think that there are any more of a second Amendment proponent than you are I just think they're ideologically so rigid in this idea that you can't change gun laws at all do you think that someone who's on anti-psychotic medication there are bouts of manic schizophrenia you think that person should be allowed to have guns when they hear voices that aren't real they see things that aren't really there to be reported the FBI handful of times the sheriff knows about them the colonel knows about them the per well obviously the problem with that is someone can decide to report Tim Kennedy they can make up some story like Tim Kennedy's been acting crazy Tim Kennedy's doing these same he's gonna kill my family Tim Kennedy's doing this Tim Kennedy do it someone just decides to actively target you in that way they can sort of frame you as some sort of a crazy person and then use that as an excuse to go after your guns I mean this is what people are terrified of yeah and that is possible it is I mean there's an objective and there's no due process on the back side okay so if somebody was wrongfully put on a list or you'd not be allowed to buy a gun how do you get off that list right I don't know I mean is a guy that spends quite a bit of time yep but I think hopefully protecting gun laws and protecting gun ownership I don't even know how to get off that list no that's care how but we don't ya ever get off it's like the no-fly list there's just not a way to right get off it who the fuck ever gets back on the fly I know you were off the list but you're back on come back get more no worries sit near the window no okay I'm a beverage service and peanuts please yeah it's things where there's a left side and a right side if you say something that the left believes in you're a traitor and if you say if you're on the other side you say something the right believes and you're a traitor no conversation has to happen in the middle right does yeah so how about how the conversation with animals has to happen in the middle when you're talking about the consumption of animals you have the hardcore animal rights activists who don't want anything to die but how do they feel about wolves eating elk asshole first TAM apartment you okay with that I mean are you okay with natural predation you are you just not okay with humans predating so how do you want to balance out the population of say wild pigs like woody what's your proposal they don't have one no you mean there's not enough resources in the world to go out and trap them and if you did trap them when you can do give them you gonna fix them you're gonna give them you know that's ectomy so we try to give them to the homeless but the homeless weren't eating them in Texas really yeah why would you not eat wild pig I don't delicious I know what Texas wild pigs pretty is it funky it's pretty funky really is how you just how you take care of it yeah well you have to take care of it that's the thing is these are swamp living rough pretty nasty things so there was a period of time where we could go and during the eradication were trying to curb that ever-growing population if you shot X number you could bring maybe a sow in and to the food shelter and they'd have a butcher and then they tried to serve it and they're like nobody was eating it so then they tried that for about six months and then they said forget it we're just wasting money try that is just so goofy what a goofy world we live in where people who are starving or picky yeah like I don't want that wild pig well maybe I mean in their defense maybe it's just really poorly handled and by the time they get it it's tainted that smells bad and I don't know I mean it's it's entirely possible if somebody fucked it up along the way yeah they don't treat wild pigs in Texas like you would treat like a deer that you shot that you hunted down took a long time to track and you had to you know get into perfect position and you cherish that me Wow pigs are shooting out of helicopters I mean you I'm sure you've seen those ted nugent videos oh yeah I do it do you do that hunting yeah they'll be farmed so a farm in let's say Central Texas north of Austin south of Dallas they're losing ten to fifteen percent of their agriculture every single year two wild pigs millions of dollars yeah yeah so if you have a ten million dollar ranch you're losing one and a half million dollars to output to wild pigs yeah and there's not a lot of profit in in being a farmer so one and a half million dollars is a lot of money to these guys and not on the flip side you have a bunch of I'm using hunters the guys that are coming too because it's sport fun I mean there's not there's not much fair game here there's not stock in these animals it's thermals it's white lights off Jeeps its any way you can imagine to try to kill these things and we're not even making a dent in how fast these things are breeding yeah you know they a sow can have weight like at the age of one it can start having three or four litters a year we get six months oh it's crazy I think they can start breeding at six months and they're having multiple litters a year and each litter can have six to ten pigs yeah we're done if they're zombies where it's over it's over well if they were predators I mean imagine if these things were like wolves red like that yeah yeah you know Tim goes to sleep at night you just nailed it Joe you got it I mean could you imagine if wolves were doing that if there were that many wolves and they were just roaming through the countryside packs of a thousand have an erection now whoo yep per bit pull back pull back do you mind okay I mean that conversation is the conversation where the vegans run into an ideological wall like what do you say about that you want to just let live and let be well you're not gonna have any vegan food because they eat vegan food okay you're not getting any food the pigs are gonna eat all your food unless you're growing your own food and then that what are gonna do if the pigs break your fences and eat your food you don't have any food left oh they break your fences they do break your fan they break your everything they they are big and they're powerful creatures and they decimate ground nesting birds anything that's small I mean there's there's some videos that we have from Texas of a big boar running away with an axis deer fawn in its mouth I mean they eat everything they can it's there they're monsters and they're delicious so I don't know about Texas one self never had a tits I need to eat I've eaten a couple of California ones never fantastic yep my dad you know he's in Monterey County he he has his pig trough pig pond and he has a herd of pigs that come every night and the I mean it's almost like a visceral response for me to watch my dad drive down in his four-wheeler and feed these things where I'm like oh no dad why does he feed him okay cuz he loves them yeah you could help come through there you know he has truely elephant wonder since his property and so he has bunch of these wild pigs and so he and his my mom they sit on the porch and they watch the wild animals and the deer and it's kind of cool super cool but then like the the Texan and me is like I'll just get rid of all of those things they're abomination Missouri has an interesting take on it they're they're making hunting them illegal and the reason why they're making hunting them illegal is because people are bringing them into areas and releasing them in public land so that they can hunt these wild pigs and they're recognizing this so what they've done to start to curve the the desire for people to do that is first of all they're trapping them instead of like running down them down with dogs or shooting them and they find by trapping them there's a great podcast at Steve Rinella he has the meat-eater podcast it's a great podcast but he had a guy who's a wild pick wild pig eradication expert from Missouri he works for the Department of Fish and Wildlife down there and or I guess they called Fish and Game down there for California they called Fish and Wildlife but they're they've used these traps they've they can get as many as like 63 pigs at a time and he's like if we tried to shoot 63 pigs it would take forever to do that so they're using these large scale traps catching these pigs and you know they're just killing them and the way they're doing there they're like get a lot of backlash from hunters because the hunters like well why don't you just let us hunt them to say no we want to get rid of all of them these are a dangerous invasive species you guys want to keep some of them around for fun but you're not going to manage the population correctly you really can't yeah so they're just they're on an eradication bend down there yeah I'd love to see how that works apparently doing a really good job in keeping them from spreading into new areas of public land they'll get a notification so I'm gonna say hey we saw sow and and and two baby piglets in this one area and they we'll just go there immediately and just track those things down and try to kill him the areas where populations are clearly established they're trying to get them from spreading yeah it's it's huge industry too though yeah I mean hunting in general we're talking billions and billions of dollars and you know whether you're trophy hunting in in Africa and your pain a few hundred thousand dollars for a water buffalo or you know you're going and you know you're just getting some blessbuck or an Impala and you're still paying ten thousand dollars the flight the donating the food to the village the troph the trophy fee the processing then the shipping you know the gun itself the ammo paying for the pH paying for the guide paying for the tracker that that's all real real money and then on even on the local and American side deer hunting elk hunting pig hunting still billion dollar industry yeah and that money directly goes back to habitat protection conservation you know not not in like incremental percentages massive portions of that money yeah the pikmin roberts act right it's like what is it 11 percent Jamie see if you could find that they I think they established that in the 30s and this was a in response to you know what Teddy Roosevelt did when they were trying to keep large swaths of public land available for people to recreation try to bring back populations these animals that needed funds to do that because market hunting people think it was like just hunters that decimated the population sort of but market hunting it was hunting wild animals for people to eat which is now illegal you can't just go shoot a bunch of deer and then sell it to people it's illegal and one of the reason why it's illegal is they wanted to stop market hunting so they take all this money which I believe is 11 percent is it 11 percent 11 percent of all the money from hunting supplies gear guns all that shit all of it goes towards conservation that turns out to be billions and billions of dollars a year yeah and that's that's what keeps the protection here it goes right here ok the 9th early 1900s many wildlife species would disappear declining the firearms and ammunition industry asked Congress to impose an excise tax I mean that is amazing they asked Congress to impose this tax on the sale of firearms and ammunition to help fund wildlife conservation in the United States the pittman-robertson Act passed in 1937 known as the federal aid and wildlife restoration so this is this is how wetlands get preserved wildlife habitat like traveling corridors for mule deer how they keep them from getting developed all that stuff is through conservation money that comes from hunting the difference between the amount of money that comes from hunting and conservation acts that gets donated to preserve wildlife versus animal rights groups is so stunning you can't even count I mean it's like not even pennies on the dollar it's like they don't donate it I mean some people donate a few dollars here or there to things but the the vast majority of the money comes from hunters which creates this really confusing place for a lot of you that's the middle goes to killing animals that's that's ends up being like the middle ground conversation that nobody will actually have right yeah well that's the conversation about Africa too right that those animals when you let people hunt them they're worth a lot more than if you just let the poachers come in and they're protected and they protect at the moment that the hunters go away they disappear but the animal rights activists and the vegans would like us to move past that and get to the point where we don't kill animals at all and animals you get on the lab it's not impossible but it's go to Africa it's fucking hot in Africa it's probably impactful because yes some massive evolution happens with consciousness and people just stop being people yeah in the so Limpopo which is north south africa right on the botswana border they kind of like gave this whirl of trying to I'm 90% I have the exact right location but they outlawed the hunting of some specific wild game and the farmers that had them just kind of okay we're just gonna we're just gonna let let me go because you're not worth anything to us all of their animals disappeared in a year poached that's correct in a year one year all of them were gone just disappeared so the intent was okay these these are nearing endangered so we're gonna allow people would hunt them and then they went from endangered to almost endangered - absolutely endangered the critically because nobody was protecting them because there are no hunters that wanted them yeah it's it's hard for people to wrap their head around because it's so messy it's not a clean issue it's so messy and you see some fat slob holding his rifle over a lion and you go and there's no way in nature this fat fuck should be able to shoot that lion and just you know and mounted on his wall there's a photo that I got off the internet of a guy he looks like he's about 500 pounds I mean just overflowing with gluttony just and he's got a rifle and there's a deadline there and I'm like okay there's everything this is everything that's wrong with hunting because he's not gonna eat that lion like why did he go over there to shoot that light it's one thing if that lion was like hunting his family or interfering with his cattle business and no no that guy flew over there he waddled over to the bike the bog pod rested the rifle down and pulled the trigger on you know one of the biggest apex predators on the planet everybody should have a problem with that it's fucking weird it's weird but now here's the contradiction if those animals aren't worth money for people to hunt then what happens is they what happens in Zimbabwe they just kill hundreds of them because there there's too many of them now because people aren't hunting them so they're decimating the undulate population so they have to curb the Lions so instead of getting $50,000 or $100,000 a lion from a hunter which goes to the villagers goes to conservation goes to hire professional hunters now they get nothing and they have to pay someone to go and shoot these lines and they shoot all of them you should all fish it all and you're like well this sucks this is not good none of this is good this ain't good both way it's not good - look at that fat guy standing over a line and it's not good - look at these you know these government people shooting 200 lions and just dumping them into a hole somewhere yeah the whole thing's a mess that's Africa here you know we try to do the right thing or you know if you're gonna get a if you're gonna get a bear tag from Colorado or you're gonna bear tag from new go for that tag to be issued you know they measure the amount of food that's in each district and then you're they're gonna issue six tags because there's enough food to there's 12 bears there but there's only enough food to feel to feed six of them so they're gonna issue six tags that or all twelve of them might starve to death or the majority of them so they're gonna issue and you can go and buy your six tags that leave six animals in that in that area in that region they are able to hunt you're paying for that tag a lot of money sometimes if you're out of state you know you're paying a few hundred dollars five six seven hundred dollars flights hotels it's for a bear it adds up it adds up but you know I understand the mindset of people that don't want any of this to happen I do understand that but I do think that they don't understand nature I really don't think they understand that this is the best death these animals will ever experience and they're not going to live forever in the wild in the wild they're gonna be torn apart by something bigger than them that's just how it goes 100% of the time or they freeze to death or they starve to death or they're starving they walk down the road to try to find some food in the town they get hit by a semi-truck yeah that's yeah and if I have a buddy who lives in Iowa and when you drive in his neighborhood at night you better go 35 miles an hour because those fuckers are just darting out in front of the street and right there everywhere yeah and you know what's the what's the solution don't drive cars drive your bike everywhere man well okay good luck with that yeah I get it I get where those people are coming from they're coming from a place of compassion but it becomes very culty and it becomes very like very team oriented they're the team vegan and there's like words it were circling back were you know when you're trying to have that middle ground that discussion that conversation there's like this pre-assigned talking points yeah where everybody from every respective side makes essentially the same arguments and you're just regurgitating what you've heard other people say but there's no new thought there's new and there's no one taking a step to either side like okay do you want maybe maybe there's something I'm not seen here let me look at it from this perspective or vice versa where this side the hunter is like no no you you stupid snowflake you know go get your Starbucks latte you know with your soy milk and but they're never looking at it from anything new they're just regurgitating their talking points like when you said gun control and people freaked that freaked out because I didn't stay to the script right and there's a script well you mean if you if you pull up my my any of my social you will see that oh you what you should have said was or hey you know shall not be infringed upon yeah man I got it yeah shall not be infringed upon believe it to death have you fought for it have you bled for it you've been blown up for it you've been shot I'd I have you know I really believe in the shit but I didn't stay to the script and then I get murdered by both sides so then how do we I mean you do a pretty good job so teach me Joe how do you bring people in to have a talk there's got to be a lot of people that disagree with you and say I do a terrible job that I repeat the same things over and over again and I agree with them to for for a certain amount of the conversations like this one I mean we I've had this conversation about conservation and animals a hundred times but I think it's worth having a hundred more because I think it's an important that if someone is listening to this podcast and they didn't understand how it all works and they didn't understand that people who hunt and eat meat there aren't monsters they're not evil people just like people who eat grain aren't monsters because you callously disregard the lives of mice and rats and all the things that get ground up in combines and bunnies like if you buy grain large scale agriculture is bad period it's bad in terms of factory farming but it's also bad in terms of growing food if you grow a thousand acres of corn you are absolutely displacing wildlife and when that stuff gets harvest you see vultures fly over those fields and there's a reason it's because there's a bunch of dead things in fact more dead lives more dead lives occur in a pound of grain then occur in a pound of beef because if you think that a cow is more valuable than a bunny because it's larger like you've got some weird life thing going on in your own head okay you can you tell me how to balance the souls worth and how would you feel about insects because they are a large-scale poisoning those fucking insects and you know it everybody knows it and they're grinding those fuckers up with earthworms and mice and Gophers and chipmunks and anything else that gets stuck in those wheels that is just how large-scale agriculture works so unless you have some isolated farm where everything's fenced in and you only have you know a certain amount of acreage and that farm feeds you well you are karma free and congratulations to you you figured out how to do it but most of us who buy pasta if you go and buy it bread in the store you're paying someone who's killed a large amount of living things in order to harvest that green that's just a fact it's just a fact and it's an inconvenient fact that they like to look at with blinders on because they you know like I'm hashtag cruelty free not to that fucking bunny rabbit that's a part of your tofu because this is this is what's really going on I mean a good part of the B the vitamin B that a lot of vegans get is from ground-up bugs that's ground up into their grain and ground up into their vegetables I mean this is you this is just you can't get it right around that no I mean no not if you are being real okay or not if you're being real yeah maybe that's the problem in the first place is nobody is gonna have the courage to come into that middle ground and let let go of all of their baggage and all of their bullshit yeah and it's just cool with eating bugs you should eat crickets get cricket meal eat cricket proteins fucking good for you yeah if you don't want to eat animals you're like I'm just not into anything that's warm okay I have a friend who only eats fish and I go why he goes fish don't even take care of their babies I was a good point that is a good point fuck those fish Fisher yummy too yeah he's like I don't want to kill a mammal because I don't want to eat him am always like mammals take care of their babies they're the babies milk from their you know their udders I'm like okay I get it my wife is pescetarian for a while that didn't that didn't last it's just not the best source of nutrients yeah well it was when she's pregnant and the doctors like all right so you're 90 pounds and I need you to put on like 20 more pounds really fast and you're not gonna do it eating a halibut yeah so into her iron was low yeah iron b12 I mean all the fat soluble vitamins that are very difficult to get great they're very good yeah this company called well they changed their name they used to be called off what they call or go depo now they're called fully and this is called the capisco it's a the best organ amma chair i fuckin love these things i said these things hours a day my back never bothers me III really can't sit for very long period of time yeah my desk at home my reloading station it's all standing height one of those standing desk guys yep I'll even take a medicine ball like the balance balls and I'll get on my knees on it and I'll just balance that's a good move yeah it feels good in Judah but it is time tighten your core strong it's less of the core and it's more like a 7 year old brain you know that if I'm not doing a lot of things at once I just get distracted so I just do lots of things at once like having to balance on a ball so I don't smash my face into the desk and knock myself out while I'm reloading the ammunition and playing with explosives like that is a perfect recipe for me to be successful at reloading bullets you reload explosives as well as bullets no no oh I'm gonna powder is explosion like grenades and shit - no I will take like if we are gonna go do so tomorrow I'm playing with the Dutch Special Forces at roughly peak ranch in Austin Texas and we are going to set up a bunch of booby traps for them when they come in to do their like their final culmination hit the full mission profile so they're gonna spend all day planning and they're gonna figure out how they're gonna walk through the woods and not get caught and I'm essentially the terrorists that they're gonna try and come kill but I'm a really good terrorist so how do you guys keep from actually killing each other when you're doing this well they're using simunition x' so they're there it they use our real guns with different bolts that shoot like paintballs yeah and then the expedite feet-per-second these paint balls flying 800 okay it still stings like a motherfucker I'm still wearing like hockey glasses you know like the are snowboard glasses never catch one in the mouth yeah yeah I have another friend that has like a tattoo in his lip from the pain from the paint Oh wonderful yeah I just like it's all the way to the flesh like it won't come out and here's like a chunk of pink in his lipfird I offered to cut it out he said no I'm really good with a knife so I bet you are yeah Dan if you're listening right now let me cut that out here he likes it yeah what is finding Hitler all about this is a show that you're on and it's on Annie that one yeah Annie is the parent Network it airs on History Channel and we just had our third season that just finished airing what's the thought process behind this is a visit legit because a lot of people are like finding Hitler get the fuck out of here found Hitler he died yeah I mean not really we don't know right that's the that's I mean this isn't like ancient aliens this is we they Declassified a buncha documents they both the Israelis the British and the Germans and Americans in the past 20 years have been D consistently declassified documents and there were a bunch of specifically FBI documents that we were spending millions and millions of dollars actively searching for Hitler after the war as was yeah like millions of dollars like Hoover was like no no no send more FBI agents to South America to North Africa go to the Canary Islands go to Spain trying to find out where this guy went sons of real FBI documents with real leads with real informants some hand or some first eye accounts saying that they physical so anyways that's the show is us trying to find out sift through reality and the fiction of the lore the mists the mystery of that asshole so what's the official story the fish stories that he killed himself right killed himself in the bunker never brawn yep and is there any photographic evidence of his death or anything so what the Russians got the body and they got his skull and when they brought it back to Moscow nobody has ever been able to independently verify who and what this body is they let one genetic test occur and the body and with the bullet holes that they said was Hitler and have said and that's the narrative that's a story that's all the eyewitness accounts that are in even the vicinity of collaborating with each other and cooperating each other's testimony like the closest version because none of it seems to be very accurate is that okay here's Hitler's skull and when they did the genetic testing it's that of a 35 year old woman so like oh well this isn't Hitler but they've said for the past 80 years that this is Hitler so okay first before we start throwing stones at Russia let's go back to 1945 April MA in Berlin you have the Allies coming in wrecking shop dropping bombs blowing everything up they can in every single which way you have the Russians coming in from the opposite direction they don't even of guns to arm all their soldiers so if they have 200 guys they are 200,000 guys they have a hundred thousand guns at the guy in front of you dies you just pick up his gun that's what's happening in April of 1945 in Berlin so the noose is tightening there is no it is chaos anarchy pandemonium this I mean you can't this is hell on earth is Berlin 1945 so I don't know if you could get a real story a real the way that we do it now where we have you know this forensic experts that come in and document everything and we look at all the different testimonies say this is this is exactly how it's just not it's not CSI this is 1945 Berlin it's crazy so I don't know there's there was no like absolute proof no and a lot of Nazis did escape and go to South America the majority of anyone with power the Nuremberg trials were with not a winch hunt but it was too close a chapter so we could start moving forward with communism that's what it was the threat of fascism the threat of Hitler the threat of killing all the Jews the threat of world domination by the Nazis that threats gone what's the next threat Tommen is communism right so that had to be a closed chapter of our history so we could focus our resources and our efforts to what inevitably was going to I mean the wall goes up we stand whisper Lindh you know we're already looking at Korea I mean this this happens almost overnight right no one patents like no no homies we need to go all the way to map Moscow this is not the end of our war and we didn't listen to him we then have been you know fighting communism for the past 75 years so the the ones with power that went to South America I know a bunch of them went to Argentina but they think they went to Honduras and a few other places where where do they think they wound up so what you had in South America both Chile and Argentina back-to-back had fascist regime regimes you had a Peron who was part of the Nazi Party starting all the way back into the mid 30s he's the President of Argentina so the Red Cross they were facilitated there was about three different rat lines that guys were able to successfully get out of Europe into South America and these are there's no question that we're talking thousands if not tens of thousands of high-ranking Nazis made it there tens of thousands and I'm not talking like little soldiers I'm talking high-ranking Nazis officers got guys like Josef Mengele and the Adolf Eichmann I mean these are the most disgusting despicable humans to exist at the time if he'll if Hitler is dead Josef Mengele is the guy that would take syringes full of blue ink and inject them oh and you have blue eyes Joe or you haven't found eyes let me see if I can make them blue and then take twins and start torturing them to see if one would feel the pain that's Joseph Mengele I mean that's the guy that then in South America was helping high-ranking Argentinians have abortions and he set up have you seen the movie Colonia about Colonia Dignidad which is that if you're listening right now almost warned you not to google it because it is it was a torture camp that was started by Joseph Schaeffer a Nazi and Joseph mangle a the the doctor of death that escaped trial in Nuremberg and made it a pest of her own into Argentina he set up the hospital at Colonia Dignidad which was another safe house safe haven for more Nazis in South America go to my air and David and ben-gurion the presidents of Israel they they took the gloves off and they were just sending assassins to try to find these people and kill them but what you got in South America were isolated German only communities you could go into bariloche argentina and you know I'd be like what else do as me go stand there like guten morgen I'm like oh yeah I mean I meant good morning yeah sorry it's 2017 right I thought we spoke Spanish so in 2017 you were there and they were speaking German yeah whoa why I'm I don't look very I might look more European than I do so is just them seeing me walking down the street and be like yeah and there's tons of communities I mean if you go to Colonia Dignidad which is now called via Bavaria the Bavarian village it is uh only German in the center of Chile in the mountains of Chile like you there's no Spanish beans being spoken there it is exclusively German and these are the descendants of Nazis powerful Nazis holy shit and this is going on right now yeah yeah what are these communities like I mean what's their ideology are they I mean they're pretty white yeah but are they like I mean are they do they espouse Nazi values or not openly so Colonia Dignidad if you look at the second generation there's a bunch of so it was a huge problem for Chile that they tried to hide for years and they they got so much power from the torturing that they did at Colonia Dignidad on a whole bunch of other high-ranking South American dictators that they are almost untouchable and this this is I mean you'd blow your mind if you look into this show you'll love it but the second generation the kids like the grandkids sometimes they're even more fanatical than the original generation have you ever seen this where if somebody's away from like when you travel abroad then it's so cool to to get into the culture and get into the food and get into the like you're dancing the this style and you're you love the flag and you're like I'm gonna go to a soccer game because we don't go to soccer games in America and then i'ma go but then maybe after like two months you kind of miss home you know and then like a year you really miss home and then ten years like you really really miss home and you see the same thing in the United States where it's not really a perfect assimilation it's not the melting pot where you see generations that are espousing to be more like their ethnic heritage than they are American you know they're flying the Irish flag and like I'm Irish well it's just times a thousand with these communities because they're exclusively German yeah it's pretty cool kind of weird so exclusively German and really missing home yeah yeah so in the years later the second generations I was talking about some of them came to the United States and were high ranking white supremists that are now in jail in prison for their racial crimes and they came out of South America they came out of Colonia Dignidad that came out of bariloche they came out of Fort Abad they came out of Misiones they came out of yeah Wow crazy so that's the show hunting Hitler fucking amen to separate how many people are we talking about all told in South America that can come out of this I mean tens of thousands went there but how many German communities and Wow bigger there maybe have 50 German communities 50 fish how many people if you had a guess it's a few hundred thousand holy shit yeah a few hundred thousand descendants of Nazis you know wow yeah and mean it's weird when you walk into somebody's parlor and it's like you're stepping back in time into Europe like I'm walking in it's it's 2017 and I'm walking in Buenos Aires Argentina into somebody's parlor and all of the tile is European and all of the style and all the art is very German you know we have like deers and you know not not like red stags but we're talking German everything things that Hiller loved and that's the style that's everything and then they come out and like with white gloves they're holding their grandpa their grandfather's memory box and inside of it or his war medals from you know when he was in the SS or when he was and it is the respect the I don't even know the reference yeah I mean it's like a whole like it's the pup I think this is a gift from the Pope that they're holding their hands white gloves no I can't first of all Tim can't touch it that's but I can appreciate it and then they tell me the story of every single one of these things and how he got there and how he then went and worked for the Buenos Aires news you can't touch anything no they wouldn't know cuz I come yo you're dirty I'm dirty dirty America is too Brown yeah fuck man so we followed the first two seasons it was really just unraveling the rumors of what happened to Hitler the third season was my favorite because I actually got to do real work they said okay I got the second season I got to bring in more Special Forces guys CIA targeter Nadia who helped my unit kill zark how we in 2006 that this is the team that is now looking at real evidence trying to figure out okay how did we find bin Laden how did we find said car as our Cowie we looked at their associates and we looked at how they moved and we look at how they communicated we looked at what routes they were using to get chewing from places and then we just started tightening the noose and that's exactly what we did in this third season was ok let's start following the Adolf Eichmann's let's start following the josef mengele and let's start following the scores in skis Hitler's personal body yard that was a colonel in the SS that went on to work for everybody after the war fighting I mean fascists do not like communists so this guy was working for everybody to include the CIA fighting fascism in South America are fighting communism as a fascist in South America in the 50s 60s and 70s creepy stuff yeah so so hunting Hitler are there any legitimate eyewitness accounts of Hitler in South America or potentially legitimate absolutely potentially whoa yep I eyewitness counts I saw him get off a boat I saw him meet here and if it was just some person saying it it's almost meaningless right but if you look at the context of who this person is the wealth that they have that they shouldn't have can you explain how you got so rich in two generations you know like okay your grandpa got here from Germany in 1946 that's weird and he he's on a legitimate visa with an Argentinean passport also weird and now he's a war refugee that's now worth millions of dollars how does this how does this work so but people and then this is the hard part people want to be connected to significant events and especially in small rural areas of the world developing areas like they want there so nothing there so little happening they want to be attached something massive and like the fact that they saw a u-boat land on this beach and the pot the hatch opened and you know this these cars were sitting there and they're doing Morse code and this guy gets off and he had this little mustache like what for it but you boats can't Beach that's not how that works you know and and but you know what they're trying to do they just want to be connected yeah so and now we're removed seventy to eighty years from the facts it has been painful to try to use real science real investigative tools to try to sift through this lore you know what do you think happened I mean you've been studying this for how long now three years years yeah if you had a guess if you had like a million bucks you got to put it on one side or another did he go there yeah whoa I I would say man it's it's in that and that's the first time I've ever said it flat out like that what what I want to say is the way history is written is wrong that that's that's clear there's no way that we can say he died on this day this is what happened here is his body and that's what his physical proof is for sure the woman that had yeah they were saying was Hitler is definitely not Hitler was absolutely not that's a so they don't have so then our other option was Kate is Ava Brahms that they just grabbed the wrong bird body right so there are still descendants of Ava and we tried to have them allow us to do it then we tried to go through like when they can get DNA off of the skull yes meat on it it's like Oh a tooth yeah and but they wouldn't consent to it so then we tried to do you know like where people have like that the tree their ethnic tree you know what's those websites called 23andme yeah yeah there's like a bunch of them right we try to go that route but um they wouldn't consent to it no the Ava Braun's family they just want it gone they just don't want yeah they're super pissed we even found them I'm sure which was hard which was really hard hold him down get him to spit in a bucket yeah the I know I got I mean or pull their trash and totally not do that definitely not do that but I mean that's how they caught the Golden State killer right was off a fuck cigarette butt yeah they got DNA off a cigarette butt so history's wrong to for it to be black and white like that and and if and again if you go back to 1945 we needed scientists we needed every single German electrical engineer mechanical engineer aerospace anything you're on the v2 program you know any we want all of you because now it's a race it's a race we have the bomb now we need delivery systems now we need to get to the moon now we need to you know like all of those things are real time it's a war a war of dollars in a war of science and we got all those scientists yeah the Russians didn't well they got some so not very many Operation Paperclip was what brought over the what Wernher von Braun who was when you talk to Jews that were in Berlin during the time that Wernher von Braun was running his rocket program there he would hang the five slowest Jews in front of the rocket Factory in Berlin just to give everybody motivation to work harder yeah it's a Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if Wernher von Braun was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity yeah he was a Nazi straight-up Nazi and people there's apologists that say no no he was a scientist he was forced into doing that like that's like okay he's a Nazi yeah there's photographs of him wearing Nazi garb hang out with Nazis he his rocket factory killed Jews like this is these are all undeniable facts I said the war ends and they're not not that's not how that works exactly but they were they were forgiven because they came over and contributed to our rocket program I'm not that I'm not that good of a human I don't have that in me I don't have that like okay it's your freedom because they wanted to beat the Russians and they knew the Russians got a bunch of them too yeah you know the Russians got a bunch of them for their rocket probably hell the Egyptians yeah the Egyptians were trying to create a delivery system to drop bombs into Israel and then ben-gurion started having these Nazi scientists tried to have them assassinated they were mailing the Mossad was now you're familiar at this the Mossad was mailing package bombs into Egypt and throughout Europe trying to kill these these German scientists and they were all German Nazi rocket guys that were working for idiot Egypt and Egypt wanted to go blow up Israel this is into the 60s so they're still trying to find ways to kill the Jews and they're like oh yeah we'll go work for you Egypt you know so it sounds crazy is how fucking technologically advanced the Germans were so far ahead of us it's so amazing and to this day you drive a BMW and you go whoa Chevy Malibu right now and I'm like you drive a Corvette get a new Corvette they're pretty fuckin badass it's on what you buy but I mean you mean there's German engineering in the 80s is fuckin phenomenal I mean if you drove a German car for the 1980s and an American car from the 80s it's like there's no comparison now a 1991 Porsche and it's a fucking piece of engineering man it's a marvel of engineering it's not fast like a modern car but when you compare like the build quality and how they constructed it how is put together in comparison to you know a fucking Dodge Daytona from 1990 that's a hunk of shit nobody wants one of those today well unless you're gonna build a VBIED then you want it that's the only time you if you could blow it up again it's you the way you think is different you know thirteen year old child trafficking counterfeit money and yeah do I it's will be will be in some country and I'll be walking by and I'll look at a car and be Ike that would make a great bomb yeah this sort of God she'll go through my head you know yeah yeah well that's how the business works yeah yeah we'll grow up someday so when you're over there in Argentina and you're meeting with these people and you know that they're descendants of Nazis and they bring out this grandfather's chest of things and war medals and all this jazz like what is this feeling like do you feel like these people got away with something I mean they kind of did but these aren't the people that did it but they're the descendants of the people that did it and they're still worshiping those people in some way yeah I I had um I had a lot of soul-searching trying to figure out what is that the appropriate thing what's the appropriate response what am I supposed to be feeling right now and I think I'm a pretty exposed person like I'm in tuned with what I feel and one of the hardest days we're in Chile and I interviewed this this man and this woman and they are both one of them is a 2nd generation so she was born on the Colonia Dignidad on this compound as a Nazi separated from her parents she didn't know who her parents was I'm sorry I'm sorry she was brought there at like age 3 or 4 but she grew up there and she and they're separated for her parents didn't who her parents was her husband was a Chilean boy that was local and he heard about this new hospital that's that's built by dr. mangle a and how everybody has food there and he's a poor Chilean kid so he was able to get on to the the compound well the locals and the Germans aren't supposed to be together so he was kind of kept separated well because he was local they started testing him and group it got really violent and disgusting by the time he is a teenager he's being thrown out of out of windows having his bones broken being nursed back to health being set on fire being nursed back to health for like 10-15 years he finally talks his what will be his future wife into escaping with him and they sneak out on in a cheese truck because one of his friends when he was a Chilean kid grew up to be a police officer and a nearby and he was able to get a letter out to them be like please come help us and they came into a health inspection and they ha inside of this cheese truck and they got away so I'm I'm talking to this guy and he's telling me about the things that happened to him and I'm not gonna get into it I mean but there are the most horrible things that could happen to a little boy that you could imagine you know beyond rape beyond being burnt alive beyond being broken for years and years and years and I'm shaking because I man I'm an Afghanistan and you know they threw some acid on some kids and I found those guys and killed those guys because that's what you do when you when you hurt little kids you know I got a soft spot for people that can't take care of themselves I can protect themselves I think every real human isn't gonna let anything weak or them ever get hurt in front of them and so I'm shaking listen to this story you know and I was like um and I know I have to go back to Colonia Dignidad the next day and and put on like I'm a tourist guy hosting a Travel Show and that's was that's always our disguise to get in there was like how you know this is a beautiful bavarian village you can come here that was the our little way in and I was just gonna go in and destroy that whole entire place that was my plan and the guys looking at me and he's like I see your anger you know and he and I was like yeah I'm gonna go hurt all of them he's like no you know no more pain I said okay what's going on he looks at his wife and he goes that's she saved me every time that I was burnt every time that's broken it was just love that's how I got out that's why we're alive today and we're gonna die of old age together with the woman that I fell in love with on this colony the only thing that matters is love I was like god damn I like you but I still would go hurt all of those people you know so it's like so these people that were doing this to him what was what was their objective they wanted to understand I mean so the same test that Joseph Mengele was doing in Germany in 1943 he's now doing in Chile in 1953 he just has a different population to test they're not Jews they're Chilean boys they're strong and they're wiry and they need less food they're not like the amusing quotation mark the cockroach Jews that you just couldn't kill you know these were these were young strong Browns like these are their words verbatim that I'm using you know and it's like yeah I want to tear your guys faces out and you know stick soldering irons in your ear because you guys are so evil but not on the same as them so I just wrote torn I didn't know what to do I just want to kill them all well son the worst aspects of human beings is that this desire to hurt people yeah that are weaker than you torture them and this is just coming into contact with that and then some guy who has this most beautiful response to it yeah you know I'm I love saving I got it I just want to dial oh fuck you're a better human than I so I never knew how to respond to these things I wanted to every time I'd see a new SS medal or I'd see you know like this the cross that they won for valor like crazy the equivalent of medal of honors these guys have in their parlors like these were Nazis you realize your grandpa yeah yes yes total pride swelling in their chest you know as I can crack in the face do you so how did Mengele died he died of old age old age he died on a beach in Brazil his journal was found on the beach in Brazil motherfucker yeah married a beautiful Brazilian girl Wow Adolph Eichmann he got snatched by the Mossad in Argentina scores sanski he died of old age actually in nineteen in the 60s the Egyptians when they're trying to build that rocket program to annihilate the to annihilate Israel scores and she started working for the Mossad but he didn't really know it for they're paying him millions of millions of dollars to hold these parties for what he thought was the rise of the Fourth Reich whoa yeah so he was bringing in like crumb Mercedes and um crucial steel Cruiser steel crushed steel these massive billion-dollar corporations for the time he was hosting these soirees and talking and having other high-level nazis that were still alive come in and he was just really being used by the Mossad to try to figure out who was facilitating this Egyptian rocket program so they've just were putting on these parties to kind of get everybody together so they could keep tabs on everybody and figure out who's who that's what the Mossad was doing yeah he was doing it with the intent of making the fourth right yeah rising the Fourth Reich so the Mossad did this and then what did they do once they figured out who was who finally they I don't like this part because I like just getting killing bad people they figured out that the the big problem with the delivery system for the Egyptians in their missile program was the navigation system and they are trying to hire a whole bunch of these experts to come work for this program and they diplomatically kind of went behind the back and they got all of this really the only experts in the world they prevented them from going and traveling to and work for Egypt so they kind of diplomatically ended the the development of the delivery system for their their warheads so that's how they handled it after they poisoned some people and they sent some mail bombs and they kidnapped a guy and tortured him and killed him fuck yeah real torture not not fake torture it's amazing how few people know about the Nazi escapees that went to South America it's it's amazing how when this this comes up it's it's relatively unknown I mean your show has done a lot to shed some light on it and I've read some articles about Nazis that escaped to South America but it's not common knowledge know it by design I mean when you're down there there is a there's a shroud of silence you you you're not supposed to talk about these things the it takes a long time for me to get an interview with a guy it takes a long time for building rapport I mean we're talking like we have some pretty high-level people working with me special-operations from every single branch to include the CIA Army Special Forces and we are pulling out every trick in the book to try to get these people to talk to us to include bribing them and the it's hard so they still don't talk about it to this day do you have to bring in german-speaking people yeah a lot of time Wow I mean what can be done I mean obviously there's not the same people right these are people that benefited from the people that went down there so you're talking about like third generation removed yeah but what could be done the its kind of the damage is done right yeah but that's a lot of damage out what can be done as the ideas can die the ideas of fascism the ideas of racism the those those things we can kill right but are those ideas are those ideas being fostered and easier these communities I think it yes yeah they're being cultivated yeah cuz it like you experienced it yeah yeah I mean if I'm a walk I white guy walking down the street I am I am a higher degree than the locals right you know like I can I can go and shop in some places that they can't I can go in and sit down and have a meal in some places that they can't I can I'm being greeted on the street good Morgan you know not not the brown dude next to me he's not and his kid definitely can't date the the blue-eyed blonde girl at the high school that's not allowed so they basically created these little colonies yeah Yahtzee colonies in South America yeah did you google google Colonia Dignidad yeah did you you will have nightmares see dude I'm freaking out right now it's not it's crazy how many people got away with it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach that's Julian wife I mean that would hurts me because he's a guy like me just on the ops cuz he he's a special operations guy he was an SS he was he was a physical specimen especially for the time you know like we didn't understand I mean he was he was a very early on into one of the first real Nazis like this isn't okay all of Germany's going this way the Chancellor is Adolf Hitler this is where we're going I kind of just have to go along and you see some of that in the third and the 43-44 now it's okay we might be losing this war now it's not so in vogue but when you got guys in like 1939 that are talking eugenics and you know higher calling for breeding and segregation early on you're like yeah I don't like that guy I'm gonna beat him to death with my hands but he's massive so it'd be a pretty good fight yeah it was uh there we go reformed Nazi cult trying to what does it say Jimmy was the full feminazi cult what is the so that that's just a marketing thing because it's still the same place reformed Nazi cult trying to open its colony to tourism and where is this that's in Chile yeah I spent a lot of time there right there they made a movie about it so that's current day right there Jesus Christ later hoses range it's freaking gorgeous though it's I mean it is shangri-la yeah German flag flying Wow they've tried to hide the Nazi things they've had I'd dinner right there look at them all I know I know that got in the left do you really yep what's that bro we talked in the bertrand butchery there he is right now Josie yeah so I had this guy with me Mike Simpson he is a he works in me a sheepdog responds he's a doctor he was a ranger that became a green beret that then went to medical school and then came back to special operations for the rest of the war and he's our director of training for sheep-bell response he was with me he and I both speak Spanish when we were down there but they didn't know that he was a doctor and they didn't know that we spoke Spanish and they didn't know that our translator that looked very Chilean could also speak German perfect German she translates for Porsche so they thought that they could have all these little conversations with the the stupid Harry handed Irish guy hosts from the tourism Channel that and and they could get away well we understood everything they're saying so one of our tour guides was formerly a nurse in the hospital that they closed down and we stole one of their their little ID cards to get into that hospital and we stole a bunch of documents of them documenting them torturing little kids in the hospital in the hospital none of this made the air because it's it's there's so much litigation going on where all of these victims of Colonia Dignidad are suing via Bavaria and what time period are you talking about when they're torturing kids like when was this 60s to 90s and so this is essentially Nazis and the ancestors of Nazis carrying on those practices in secret yeah Jesus Christ it's crazy isn't this isn't just people that got away with it and their ancestors and their and they evolved and changed so what do you do with that place you saw the pictures I mean that place is worth maybe a hundred million dollars and they bought that with Nazi money what do you do with that where does that go where does that go I don't know that Nazi money we're talking melted fillings from Jews mouths we're talking wedding rings off of Jews fingers they bought that land with that money and it's gorgeous Jesus Christ and you have a German colony there what well I don't know I don't know what the right answer is I mean how does Chile feel about it Chile has been in a tough position because of the amount of power that they have had there nobody so in the in the 60s they were at behest of the president they were bringing in people that disagreed with the dictator and they were torturing him and they're getting that information and giving it back to the president well that went on for like ten years and so that the Nazis were doing that for yes okay for uh oh my god I cannot believe whoever the dictator was yeah but I'm so embarrassed I can reverse name right now because it's around the tip my tongue anyways but that information they also had so it not only the information went back to the president that he could use against his rivals but they also had it so they know all the dirt about everybody they know who is having sex with who who has a kid with who who went to this prostitute place who has a deal with the CIA who is working with the Venezuelans who's working with the Argentinians like they have all that dirt because they gave it to the president they have it too so they had been untouchable politically for you know thirty forty years because they had so much power because they had so much information because they had so much dirt on every single high-ranking person in South America Jesus Christ no yeah it's been a trip year for me from that show and then straighten to hard to kill the show for the Discovery Channel from going then to point to Africa like this year I don't even know I can't even how does that all work while you're still serving like how do you get the freedom to do all these different things when you reactor you re enlisted so the army will always get with the army once first of all but it's got to help them having you be so high-profile that's a that's a few tentative of the military if you're listening right now go to your local recruiter that's why but seriously we are having Special Forces specifically we are we are gonna have the biggest deficit of eligible up a pool a population to select from because you have to have a certain level of intelligence certain level of physicality just to be eligible for Special Forces to pick from you that pool is the smallest that has ever been in history kids are playing video games they're not eating Cheetos they're less participation in sports I mean if you could just go to a high school it look at a high schooler now compared to twenty years ago it's a different thing really yeah we weren't like barely getting kids past obesity twenty years ago now in a high school if you walk into a classroom half the kids are obese so you think this is just because their sedentary because they're playing video games and fucking around online all day it's not just it's not me thinking this is us absolutely quantifiably saying we do not have enough people to pick from right and that would be one of the best ways to really find out what the actual average health of viable males is right yeah for sure there's always gonna be the best of the best that want to test themselves you mean this is just always how it's been yeah so we teach a hundred forces we only of that hundred we only get six or eight but that's a hundred people that go to special forces selection that hundred that goes they have to have a GT score they have to they have to have a scores high enough on the military entrance exams just to be eligible they have to have a PT score high enough just to be eligible so we can't even get that hundred and then of that hundred only eight or the eight of them are making it so we are we are this is to answer your question how am i able to do these things is I'm in a position where I can say for the love of God please get healthy please walk to your recruiters office and please take a test to see if you're eligible because we are just needing people like we've never needed them before Jesus Christ it's scary Wow well that's one of the best indications I mean most people don't know like people like me I'm fifty year old father taxpayer out there doing much I'm not paying attention to with fucking high school kids look I know I've no idea yeah go to like a Marine recruiter right now and be like hey bro how's your job right now they're a you just fight him from taking that pen and stabbing it into his own eye because he just can't get somebody that isn't smoking weed somebody that can pass a PT test somebody that can passed a tape test and then somebody that can was a tape test um like they're not so we measure their neck and their waist and they can't even pass that so the two fat the two fat is the neck too little or too big so if you have a big neck right and a big waist this is because like I have a big neck right but it's from working out yeah but I have a tiny little waist so that gives me my BMI and my body fat you know they measure it's it's a pretty it's it's a gross measurement height weight and measurement right and you know there's only like four things that we need for some for us to say it's harder to get into military than it is to get into college that's that's absolutely true not regular military but special force no regular military what yeah really yes it is not easy and then from that we only pick combat arms and then of that combat arms we only pick the top armor is it harder for someone to get into the military than it is to get into college I thought it was fairly easy to get into the military I'm pretty sure anybody can go to college anybody well you can go to a community college that's college right yeah I'm not saying it it's as easy to get into MIT right but anybody can go to some cop can go to any college that they want not any call any college they can get in they can go to you know local Community College and then two years there they can go and get into the next you know you know state you school and then from there they can get a girl I mean anybody can do that right well you can't go to military if you smoke weed you can't go to military if you have bad eyes you can't go to the military if you're diabetic you can't go to the military if you have asthma you can't go you can do you can go to college if you have all those things right you know you you can't go into the military if your IQ is x-number depending on your job well you can still go to college you can't go in the military if you can't run a mile or two miles in this speed and do this number of push-ups in this many of sit-ups I don't think any college has that requirement so I mean just in those seven things alone we just cry we just xed out eighty percent of our population and do you have this they're also a problem with people's attitude towards military um with young people yeah a little bit but that that is mostly a physical issue yeah it's let that is way less of an issue the perception of military way less of an issue than us just having a qualified population of viable candidates for us to pick from I mean it's really bad we're we're we're freaking we're we are borderline freaking out about what we're gonna do so an average special forces Oda has supposed to have 12 guys in it right right now you're not gonna find a team that has more than 10 and we only have 70% of our teams with 10 yeah thank God we didn't go to war with North Korea fake how that war ended and now we're not dropping nuclear bombs anybody because we're in a we're in a Hurt Locker for qualifying most people have no idea about this no it's scary Wow so this is by part of that one of the best ways to measure what's wrong with the way people are living today yeah I mean they forget about whether or not they want to go and serve the the viable quality candidates like this is a number of them that are even available is the lowest it's ever been well what about high school athletics I mean have they decree minused yeah really yep they're the same rate part it's very very similar the participation in not so you can go and play for your the rec time volleyball but to get onto the the varsity football team or the varsity volleyball team or the varsity track team the number of people in percentage to then so if you have a thousand people you had a hundred of them that were picked to participate in those athletics nice wait 10 percent that number now is down to like five or six percent so the the overall percentage per capita of the number of people participating in these sports has been consistently decreasing for the past 20 years especially when the internet became a huge thing you know I mean that's basically the same timeline you looking at like 94 99 you see obesity going like this yeah you've got bad food we got a up to our jobs are giving less and less physical the the focus on what jobs people should have everybody's been okay no go to college you like become an academic so you can be this intellectual that can go and do this job and then you graduate from college with a student loan and you have no job to go to where there's this guy that needs welders but it's not cool to be a welder so don't don't do that or to be a mechanic like all these trade jobs that are just begging and pleading for and they are sometimes physical but they need people but it's not cool to do that because you know I got want to go to I don't go to Long Beach State or I wanna go to UCLA or you know I want to go hang out with a bunch of hot chicks at LSU you know it's the focus has been wrong for a while and and that is evident in Special Forces selection when we don't have anybody to pick from we can't select Wow why don't we hear about this is this something that trying to keep hush-hush or it it has been a problem because our community motto is the quiet professionals mmm that's our motto yeah I don't I mean I get so much crap all the time but thank God like guys that really understand what I'm trying to do they realize I don't shut up because I'm trying to help the regiment I'm trying but the best ways that I can the best ways that we could figure out with people way smarter than me helping me you know I was on the phone yesterday with some of the the best and brightest and the Special Operations recruiting battalion about how are we gonna fix this how are we gonna market how we gonna develop interest and so thankfully they're smarter than me but we were almost screwing ourselves over because that is what how we live and that's how we would do our job if you read about us on the news we failed you know if you read about Army Special Forces doing something we met we have done messed up you know this is not the Navy SEALs we're not writing books you know we're not talking about our exploits we didn't kill bin Laden this is us just doing our work and nobody's supposed to know about it but because of that we now have a huge recruiting problem what is the what's the approach try to balance that out I mean there is there any strategies in play yeah we talked through a bunch we're trying to figure out yeah I think just getting the word out letting people know one we have to get that population healthy so let's let's go specifically at after athletes let's let's go to a high school wrestling room and be like hey fellas like this this that's where I heard about it when I first heard about Army Special Forces was a guy in a really bad cut suit from probably like JC Penney's or Macy's walked in you know and he's like hey guys you ever thought about army special forces I was like I don't even know what that is that like the Navy SEALs he's like yeah check it out and he gave us this crappy car and walked away and I never saw him again but that planted that seed you know and then 9/11 happens I was like I know where I'm going I'm going to that dude that had that bad suit I'm gonna find him go work for that guy so just we're talking about in my show hard to kill you know it's not just Army Special Forces it's marine recon it's the Navy SEALs it's Air Force PJ's every special operations that has a selection process they don't have a population to pick from they don't have that that body that pool of qualified applicants to select from so everybody is having the same problem so let's let's do the top gun thing let's show how cool it is to be an aviator another job that we don't have enough guys off we don't have enough pilots so is this the motivation behind hard to kill like part of it for me hmm and the reason why is allowed to do it like we're gonna have an episode every single season where I'm gonna highlight some crazy badass military job doing things that wait you're gonna jump off a zodiac a mile from water you're gonna swim in to walk four miles with a rucksack to then go do a raid on a bomb makers house hanging off the side of a player's with a machine gun you know there's like freaking awesome but this is the job so let's show them what this job is let's show them how hard is because it's hard you know this is not easy stuff that these guys do and hopefully somebody will be inspired and somebody be like all right I'm gonna get off the couch so what what is hard to kill because I've heard of it I've heard the name but I really haven't looked into it I've tried so I tried so hard to get Discovery Channel to let you show the first bit of it no they won't why not I don't they said it's a rut something it's a rough it's a rough cut and they want everything perfect okay well when they get it perfect send it to me we'll play it so we find a job that is inherently dangerous that people die in doing and is necessary for our way of life that's the first part we find whatever that is that that might be a guy that changes light bulbs at the top of cell towers that might be somebody that's hanging off the side of a building washing windows that might be an experimental test pilot that might be somebody that works on a bull ranch it might be a guy delivering antibiotics in Alaska to families that live out in the bush so it's not necessarily military jobs now will its jobs in general no no not I think we only do one military job in this first season I thought okay I have a very distorted perception of it I thought hard to kill was all about military nope just one it's it's anybody anywhere that does something necessary for our way of life and they die doing their job that's that's the show and I'm trying to highlight and I'm trying to pay homage and respect to these people that nobody thinks about or appreciates right you know like let's go walk on our Southwest flight and we're like hey I got my beverage service and my peanuts man but in the 50s and 60s the average life expectancy of an experimental test pilot was like four years you know you have stories of these sr-71 pilots that are flying at Mach 2 and the whole entire thing just disintegrates around them one of the guys is killed instantly the other guy starts falling but there's a 30,000 feet in the air strapped to his chair so he can't even use his parachute he wakes up he's blacked out he can't look out of his visor because his visors frozen and he's just did the Deadspin falling at 200 miles an hour and he lives because he's amazing so let's see how did he live well I recreate that whole entire thing in the show yeah did that I'm full stupid what the fuck is wrong with you I'm dumb man you did that yeah how did this guy survive so he wakes up he's in a freefall he's strapped to his chair his parachute won't deploy his visors frozen he gets his harness off and then he goes into the box which is this freefall position which kind of stabilizes super impressive that he knew how to do that in the first place a lot of pilots never even practiced freefall so he's free-falling and first let's remember this guy was a combat pilot in Vietnam and in Korea so I mean this guy's been he's actually been shot down before so pretty heroic fella and he gets out of his harness he's in the box he deploys his parachute in the box again how do you do it you're you're pretty much driving your hips down it's up a massive sprawl okay that's what it is it looks like you're driving your hips down in a massive sprawl your arms are pushed back so air is evenly flowing off of your body from spinning it makes you stable so the air the friction of the air off of your body makes you stop spinning in circles or tumbling overhead and he because of his Center Sat parachute he actually had weight on his hips which dropped his hips down and then he just kind of stabilized coincidentally through his parachute and then he landed on his wreckage which was on fire holy shit yeah which we recreated from me too I got burnt pretty jacked up they put me inside of a experimental test plane put aviation fluid on it locked the cabinet or lock the the cockpit and then set it on fire with me inside of it why do you do this cuz that's not even like real like you're choosing to do this yeah but they did it they did and they survived yeah you're doing it to recreate it in their honor what we have I mean there are there there are safety measures in place we're like I only got kind of got burnt so my shirt got melted and my I was able to get out of my seat belt because my seat belt melted but I thought out because it melted yeah fuck and then I was able to I couldn't get the cockpit open cuz the cockpit held melt had melted closed so I just tore the cockpit open but we're maybe one or two seconds away from the fire department just descending upon me to save my life and then take me to the hospital so the motivation is everybody I think takes for granted all of the things that we have in our life and there are some pretty heroic courageous people that risk it every single day to do these jobs to get our food to get our oil like that stuff is pumped from the center of the ocean sometimes yeah there's a guy diving down breathing helium and nitrogen at a few hundred feet messing with gases that if he cuts just one millimeter too deep he's gonna get sucked into the pipe because the negative pressure you know guys that are flying a plane there's no test dummy for flying a plane right some dude is gonna sit inside of a plane sometime and be like let's say fuck it let's see if this works yeah think about that why so that's the whole point was we wanted to show and there's hundreds and hundreds of people that do these jobs that we just don't think about in the middle of a hurricane like how is your power still on there's somebody out there trying to fix it you're in the middle of a blizzard and just feet and feet of snow or descending on those power lines and you think they're just stayin up there no man there's somebody hanging off the side of that tower that's negative 20 outside and he's trying to fix that stuff so you so your heater stays on so you don't freeze are you gonna get in one of those planes that flies into hurricanes yeah man we do the dumbest stuff are you gonna do that yeah you are yeah how about putting me at the bottom of a mountain and setting off an avalanche right yeah let's do that take it are you gonna do that or we did oh dude dad I don't died damn I like you taking r22 helicopter into Arctic Ocean and go and crash it into the ocean and then make me swim to an iceberg and live on the iceberg did you do that yeah I did that cuz somebody else did on the iceberg for I was too cold to count um what I had to do once I got to the iceberg I had to get my I had like these tasks that I had to do for them to come and get me so once the helicopter went underwater and I had to swim down into the helicopter and the water was 33 degrees and then I just swim about it a few hundred meters in his 33 degree water is about 30 minutes total time in this 33 degree water I fortunately was able to bounce some ideas off of Calkins Berrien and went off and a bunch of guys from on it because they they're pretty into that cold weather stuff called one of the mean what does Kyle know about swimming in the ocean he doesn't he knows about extreme temperature he does the the contrast showers and like the heart rate breathing and so I was just trying I experimented with a bunch of it before I went and did the episode to make sure I didn't die how much time can you spend in that water I thought it was only like a few minutes that's they said and I was in there for 30 yeah I want to see how long I could do it so once I lost small motor function so I couldn't move my hands I could still swim so then once I could my arms went next but I could still kind of do the the eggbeater kick from swimming and water polo and that lasted about another 8 or 9 minutes and then it was kind of like I was just trying to keep my head above water and then they sent in the rescue diver and pulled me out fuck dude yeah and it took me four hours to get moving to be able to move again four hours they can't warm you back up either so they like they put you in a sleeping bag but no heater and no you have to very slowly because you can go into shock if you warm up too fast oh Jesus yeah it's me I should I should be a golfer it worked Tiger Woods is surging again you know like yeah what the heck but yeah you want to get bored so there's um a bush pilot an Alaskan bush pilot that you know they like deliver food to these people living out in the middle of nowhere in Alaska and he's flying and engine stops you go that sucks so an auto rotation is they still have a little bit of lift from just the friction of the blades so they they kind of can control because the the blades are still kind of like rudders keep talking about a helicopter so they can somewhat control their descent so he finds an iceberg he's like ah I'll go crash by that iceberg so goes and crashes in by the ass near the iceberg and the has helicopters submerging and he dives into this emergent helicopter to get his survival equipment and then he swims over to the iceberg and he sets his kind of like shelter up and then he has to fight off polar bears for a couple of days he lives this this dude survives and he he was like the source for our bush pilot episode was this one guy but there's hundreds and hundreds of stories of these guys crashing all the time so we just try to figure out what the job is why it's hard why it's dangerous and then what is the worst case scenario what is the worst day on the job and let's see what that's like how did he fight off the polar bears so he he had a raft like the his floatation raft and it was in inverted which he had turned into like a small igloo and he could hear the Bears starting to like come up - and it doesn't get dark their dependence on the time of year it's only had like one or two hours of darkness so he could still kind of see and he could see the Bears coming so he was sitting inside that just horny I'm super still and they could just smell that something was off there trying to figure out what it was and then it would stand up with his raft on his shoulders radda I'm banging on the big plastic Erath thing and this you know they couldn't figure out what it was because there's just twelve by twelve raft rising and running at them and with lots of noise and that's and he was able to scare him away I think three times before he's finally rescued oh my no weapons no weapons Oh fuckin Christ yep whoo I don't have those balls yeah well you would if you were there you do whatever you have to do I don't know if you were there polar bear to scare me they scare the shit out because they actively hunt us oh yeah they're one of the few animals I mean that's all they do is eat meat anything that moves largest carnivore on the planet yeah like you ever see that video where they took a guy from BBC and they put him in a big giant glass box like a plexiglass box and put him out into the Arctic and the polar bear came up was trying to bite through the box and figure out how to get him you know so he's inside the box filming it and this thing can smell him and it's just opening its mouth is as big as this fucking that's when you really get a perspective of how large these things are and it's trying to bite into this box there it is here's a guy so the thing comes up to him I mean we're hey this is the Klondike bar thing this is the guy who likes Coca Cola no so giant super predator and it's trying to figure out how to get smart too yeah well they have to be yeah he's got this I would have checked that lock like fifty thousand I don't understand this box so that box would have smelled like shit for me if I were there right now that's all you could smell in that box yeah it's such a strange task I mean I don't know there's a boat behind him I guess so that is dude with me with a trap eliezer hopefully rifle yeah look at that oh my god it's trying to figure out I get him it's a it's a very disturbing video and it went on for a little while the thing left and came back and left and came back again and finally they've got him out of there fuck that it's amazing it's a crazy animal yeah we couldn't find any polar bears did you want to I did I'm always gonna try to scare them off that way yeah I'm gonna end it really badly that was but another poor decision in Tim's life the the Discovery Channel this is the most expensive insured show that ever done I would imagine and they're just some things we know shit took explosives TNT threw them from the side of a helicopter to cause avalanches that I'm that I'm in and so do you have one of those inflatable suits it keeps you from getting tweetly compressed yeah we tried that one time uh that I definitely use that and I think that saves me one time it kept me up on top so those things don't keep you from being compressed it keeps you on top it's like it's like a flotation device a life preserver for the snow so it gives you more surface area friction which rises you does that mean like when you have a big jar of pebbles and you shake them the biggest ones go to the top right it's that's all that's happening is you're trying to make yourself the biggest pebble to raise you to the top of this huge friction so because most people they actually die of traumatic injuries during the avalanche not from a fixation really even though when they finally put me in the avalanche I was I was inside of the snow for 30 minutes that was the amount of time that the network would let us would let me see if I could survive and I had I had a button if I clicked it every minute on the bottom of the minute they would leave me in there for another minute so I stayed in for 29:59 and so as soon as it's over 30 they're like that's it that's all the time we allow yep Wow what was it like in there for this really cold yeah super cold it was dark it was hard to figure out which way was up so I figured out which way was up cuz I was able to like I took my snowboarding goggles I put them over my mouth so the snow went so I'd initially have a little bit of a few breaths of air because what happens is you get an ice seal around your face from you exhaling melting it and then it freezes so then you have this cocoon of no fresh air coming in so I was able to so I locked my hand inside of my helmet and I held my goggles over my mouth so I would have a little bit of air so then I was able to take that off and get it over my so that I have a little bit of air here and that was like moving snow with my pin and to but then I saw a drip of water drip off of my glasses at a 45-degree angle to my left that's like Oh up is that way that's route that was like the best thing for my brain to know which way up was that was the only way you could tell yeah was because you just you're weightless no wow that's a crazy feeling like you don't know where the up is yeah so up could be your feet okay absolutely yeah you wouldn't even know no so I just gravity watching that drop of water drip off of my snow goggles as like aa piece for my brain what if it went up I would I would have pissed myself what if you like spit there's no moving you either get rescued or you freeze to death and so there's this is not a controlled Avalanche they're just so you're just actually starting an avalanche yeah how many of these episodes you planning on doing Tim I mean can we stop now no I think I think we got a bunch of people that the world needs to know about that that we take for granted how we get our food how we get our gas how we get our Wow and I think I got a bunch of Special Forces recruiting slots I need to fill and this is the way to do it I hope cells killing yourself every week I didn't I mean I went oh I almost only died three times in this in this first season and if somebody's like that's a cool job or wait the only way that Tim I'm there there are some times where you're watching me inside of a cockpit that's on fire and the only way I got out is because I'm a savage like I'm just a beast I was like I don't feel like getting burnt alive today so I tear the cockpit open I think somebody at some point is gonna draw the conclusion that I was able to do that because of physicality that if you're a fat person sitting inside of there you would be burnt alive maybe they'd get off their couch and they'd go and do something maybe they there's a weird way to motivate people anywhere anyways a good way I'll take it whose idea was this for this show that's my idea Jesus Christ dude you're an unusual human it's fun though and how many of these episodes have you done we have finished six and you know that is that the entire season yeah that'll be season one comes out in July you excited about it yeah I'm pumped so 50% of the time you almost died yeah yeah I mean that's gross math rounding around okay so there's the water one well you almost froze to death yep that definitely and then the avalanche one you know when you lasted 30 minutes what was the other one oh man yeah worse yeah it was less pleasant like I was a bullfighter for an episode oh dude and not a bull rider cuz they're insane but the bullfighter is the guy that's on the ground so when the bullfighter gets thrown he's The Bodyguard for the bull rider his only job is to take the hit so the bull rider doesn't get trampled to death because the moment the bull rider comes off the bull's back the bull is turning around to crush whatever was on its back right and that's where the bullfighter runs in to save him and you know the the PBR the Professional Bull Riders Association those guys are the most selfless courageous guys trying to protect those bullfighters bull riders so I trained for a while and I was went to the biggest rodeo in the nation and was bullfighter and I mean this isn't one of those shows where people don't get hurt like you see the inside of my body you see people get really really really jacked up and go to the hospital and like you have a punctured lung is that guy gonna live this is that type of show cuz there's no other way to do it the only thing the only direction we had from Discovery was don't fake anything that's a great direction it's great direction and glad they came up with that know what happened with the bull well I I got oh which is humiliating because they're not really smart animals you I you're fast over there Jamie's a wizard yeah it's encourage all little boys and girls that follow me on any social media platform to stay in school become engineers architects accountants or anything that doesn't lead to permanent brain damage or need of an orthopedic surgeon lets you legs up and a bowl launching you through the air yeah that was the training week so this was when you're trying to distract the ball yeah what kind of techniques do you use football running back stuff just jus come young way that faking things that the thing is you actually have to sell that body movement so your weight half your weight has to shift far enough where the bowl is gonna really believe that you're gonna go to that direction I wish Bulls were so I wish they're dumber than they are because they're not because if you fake them once one direction they won't take it the next time they'll they'll you try to fake to the right they'll already start going running to left so then you fake to the right you go back to the left and you're like oh no I have done and it's at that moment that Tim realized he had fucked up yeah then it just gets owned I got destroyed and so when you get launched to the air by a bull it's it's it's weird because it's it's weightless you know it's just a second and you are completely inverted no control over where your body is going because you didn't generate that energy but the other part of you the other part of your brain is knowing that that bowl is gonna try to turn as fast as it can and get you when you land on the ground because that's when it's really good is when you're down yeah so you're trying to keep track of where this bowl is while you're hurling through the air like okay I got to tuck my chin so I don't break my neck you know hopefully I'm not close enough to the fence which the fence doesn't move the fence is metal you know the ground is pretty soft I'd rather land on the ground then land on the fence but the fence will mess you up anyway so that's it up and how'd you get away from the ball I'm an athlete not sure if you know that that is it that's it just athleticism yeah luck a little luck no they're the luck they didn't get stomped no so there was some some real bull fighters in the ring with me that I think saved my life every single time because I suck at the end of this show people are gonna look at this and be like one tim is an idiot to everybody that does this job these jobs has the biggest balls and our show badass hopefully that's what they're gonna get because this isn't like a Tim Kennedy look cool show this is that guy's an idiot and everybody else is pretty huh my god oh my God look at that picture notice that that's a different Bowl did this more than once so this this bull is he's got his feet up in the air and his head is inches from you and it's about to collide with you and there's no fucking way you got away in this situation there's no way that thing's way too close what does it like to just get launched a 2,000 pound fucking meat vehicle it's it's it's the other things that um so the we did like commercial fishery for commercial fishermen as an episode like Deadliest Catch just like that but you know those shows in this episodic way they really go into the personalities and the the people that do these jobs and I think they really gloss over how hard that job is I mean they're on this decks for 14 15 hours working a net pole to a net pole to putting out a net to next and then they go in and the net is out and they have 45 minutes to sleep before they have to pull the net back in and they do that for 28 days so they're getting like cat naps so then slowly they're there the cognitive ability is starting to diminish and their physical capability is starting to diminish and so everything is but then they're on a platform that is in 10 12 foot waves that's slippery and the water is 38 degrees so everything about what they're doing is setting them up to die so that again those are great shows I love it Deadliest Catch and there's there's a handful there shows now but I don't think it has ever gotten close enough to showing I mean I always been I did that job for one day and I was like I just need a break dude I don't think there's any way you could really accurately portray it unless you did a 12 hour show you know I can showed you and then multiple 12 hour show yes I mean if they did a live stream of you that would be the way to do it right like through satellite feed somehow I have an internet connection showing you fishing for 12 so you could just tune in here's Tim still fishing I'm gonna go to sleep I wake up eight hours later get coffee get breakfast let me check out Tim look at Tim still awake one wrong step one wrong knot and you gotta count on these other guys that are also exhausted if one second if that you have one second to realize where that person went if he's in the water one second and he's under you know fog in 38 degree water with 12 and 12 foot swells and you've been out for 20 days and what kind of fish were you catching there there I think we were pulling scallops those were scabs so now the stuff I was just pushing off like we weren't even using any of those we were just pushing them back into the ocean with my scabs they're like these um they're like little stingrays oh that they'll chop them up for bait sometimes that's all that's all the left stuff so the bucket to my left that's all the the fish that we had picked and this is the leftovers well that's an inefficient process that's crazy so all those things die so you know those are all like a bucket oh they're still alive yeah those go back in the water oh okay and so what's in the bucket they're scallops clams Wow how crazy is that all that stuff scooped up and you you don't want it [Music] that's bizarre yeah actually I think a second after this photo was taken I took a step and I stepped on one of those things see they kind of match when they're facing down or not on their belly up when they're white but when they're brown and facing down it's the same color as the rust the deck and I stepped on one that I thought was the deck and in my in my right hand right now that is a it's a pike it's a spike with a with a nail sticking out the end of it that you that's what you use to sort and I step on this thing and I fly I mean mine I swear my feet were all the way up at the top of that wall I five five feet up in the air just inverted flying through the air with 12 foot swells in the sea and onto that spike holding on to that spike and I'm two feet three feet from the edge of the boat Jesus Christ these guys do it all day long you know I hope you like the that fish that you walk to the supermarket and plug out at Whole Foods you know it got there somehow yeah if it says wild card it's freaking wild cut this is a we have a real problem with a disconnect from things like that disconnect from food disconnect from how difficult these jobs are where's the fucking power how we're going back on somebody's out there so he's out there in that blizzard I mean to every you could look at I think that's one of the things that's wrong with this society right now is everybody's just taken for granted everything about their lives they just want to easy they weren't fast they want it quick that's why people are getting fat that's why they're going to the grocery store and getting the thing that's on sale that's why they're there getting mad at guys like you that go and talk about hunting because they just want the easy solution and truth be it there isn't an easy solution that's the right solution usually it's the hard way usually you know yeah it's there can be a smart way in the smart way sometimes is the hard way but everybody wants this quick fix everybody wants to take a pill and they feel better better that's not how it works you know like you can't manage suffering from depression and like you've been having these thoughts come on take a pill I'm gonna feel better while that might be a portion of the solution how about you lose 10% body fat how about you get off the couch how you go make out with your wife how about you go down on her for a couple hour give a bunch of orgasms you know and then have sex with her and then go to the gym promise you're gonna feel better after that you know instead I'm just gonna do I'm gonna have this easy solution and it just doesn't work so I I mean I think for me this show is hopefully an opportunity to give people it's not that easy we've made a weird society we made a society where we've nerfed all the hard edges and we're trying to make it safer and safer every day and there's some things that just they're just messy they're not gonna be safe and by us making everything safer it's making us weaker you know you know and every time that we've had a weak society we end up with tough times and then tough times make hard men then hard men make good times then good times make weak men then weak men make you know and this cycle just keeps going and right now we have week we can't even allowed to say men there's some men out there there are some but like I don't even know if we're allowed like I just driving driving here to your studio I saw the Girl Scouts office is one block away and your neighbors that have no security cameras right back behind fries with their back door lodged open with like all of that right here in lit more importantly the Girl Scouts which isn't even a thing anymore now it's just the scouts there's no boy scouts and there's no Girl Scouts there's just the scouts and in a week a half a million members of the Boy Scouts have left because you can't have just Boy Scouts you have to have just Scouts is that what's going on now is that how they're doing it yeah yeah and a half a million Scouts what does that mean that if you go on these camping trips the boys and the girls go together yep that sounds like a good idea if you know that's bad that's bad idea kids get raped yep for sure it also changes things I don't know how I feel about I think women in the military should be able to go anywhere to include special operations if they meet the standard but when you have a girl present it changes men act differently yes period and it changes the chemistry of the team and when when you're trying to raise men when you're trying to rear boys and and have them becoming men and you're doing these you know you're taking them horseback riding or you're teaching them knots or you're you know showing them how to set up a tent or how to purify water if there's a girl there the focus isn't on tying that bowline the focus is own is Christina watching me tie my Bolin right and well that's good and bad it's bad if you're trying to have an opportunity to to nurture elements that are very beautifully separate equally for girls like can we teach Christine of that bowline absolutely could we teach you how to ride a horse a hundred percent take her honey should be able should be do everything that everyone of these boys should be doing I believe so yes but there's a boy in that mix it changes things changes things yeah that's why I've always been supportive of all-girl gyms I'm like they should be able to have a fucking gym when no one's trying to bang them 100% I mean there's a lot of women that want to be able to go to the gym and not have somebody autumn and stare at their ass where they're doing squats but all boys gyms you watch the title fight it's squirrely this last weekend which one mashenka or do you think if those were to I star at the end of the end between the fourth and fifth round when Raquel penance and said I went out and her team said no that it would have been different if it was two male fighters I think it would have been I think it would been as well yeah one I I believe that had her team let her out she would have regretted it the rest of her life the failure and didn't happen by her team there in between the fourth and the fifth round it happened in preparation getting her ready for that because I think that that those words would never be uttered out of my mouth in the middle of the fight it would be my team begging and pleading for them to end the fight I don't know if there was a route for her to win that fight if there was a path to victory for her I don't think there was and I think she felt that but I think the journalist and the MMA media attacked her coaches unfairly won because she's a girl I think that played a part in it everybody's like oh my gosh this girl fight her in between 4 and 5 she's just a fighter first of all right and her coaches know her better than anybody I'm not defending what they did or attacking them what I'm saying is you're not on either side of that fence and you've never had your feet on that canvas and felt the fury and pain of defeat and the sweetness of success and the worst thing ever is regret and I have you you feel like she would have regretted even though absolutely agree that there was no path to victory yeah I think Amanda Nunez was she was surging she was destroying her her nose was shattered she's getting beaten down and she didn't have anything left true and so she's like I want out you know Big John McCarthy and I talked about this yesterday and he feels that his that the corner did a big disservice to her by letting her take a beating in that fifth round and that every fight takes something out of you and some fights take more out of you and there there comes a point in time where there's a tipping point fight and that that could have been the tipping point round that she might not ever be the same again and he was saying that you know you've got to understand that you only have a certain amount of holes he can punch in your ticket and if she especially me talking about someone who's if that tickets off the tickets of fight card right that's the ticket yes it's it's not she's not a she's not a janitor right her yes she only has to fight again or be beaten down so badly in that fight that she's never the same physically I mean we have many times we talked about this with Robbie Lawler or Michael Hayes being but it might work ace with Robbie Lawler me if you look at Robbie Lara's last fight with havel dos Anjos he didn't really look the Robie la revolt now could that be because of dos Anjos very well could have been dos Anjos is a beast it was our business to tell him when he's done that's not it's not our business tell him he's done it's his ticket but it's his ticket what if he wants to quit could I says if he says he wants out like she said she wanted out like there's certain times in a fight where someone says they want it like here's a good example do you remember Jeremy Cleland when fought Nigel Benn yeah this is the fight that put him into this catatonic state and bleeding on the brain people are criticizing him because he took a knee people were saying like the commentators to say what is he doing why is he doing this well he fucking knew something was wrong and he took a knee and then blacked out and then eventually had bleeding on the brain like general McClellan was a beast I mean world champion boxer but he knew something was wrong now if Raquel Pennington had said I want out and her coach said no go back in there and then she goes back in there and collapses and has bleeding in the brain and wounds up in the same state as Gerald McClellan then people would be going crazy yeah I know your point because that's the kind of fighter you are that's the kind of fighter you were you are a die on your sword guy that's that's what you always did yeah and you've had some fucking amazing fights because of that attitude and that never-quit mentality where you were in there to win or die trying' god I'm so scared of that regret though I understand it you know and I don't know if all the things that I have to because I have you know like mentally checking out at the end of the UO Romero fight you know I regret that - the day I die that I didn't stick because I'm looking at Dana anticipating my money you know I'm already looking and be like you know you're gonna pay me for this one this is one hell of a fight right right looking thinking about me destroy Michael Bisbing this that's what I was already thinking about I already left the ring so I have that regret that like nags at me I can't even imagine what the regret would be like for me not to go out all this all like all my I don't have post-traumatic stress but all the things that nag at me it's the things that I didn't do and it's a regrets but there aren't those things what make you better the the realization of the mistakes you made those are the lessons and that's what makes you a stronger personally you don't you don't get stronger by doing the right thing every single time part of getting stronger is by fucking up and having this horrible feeling that you fucked up and realizing you never want to feel that again yep yes that's how muscle and that's how a brain works is is you you damage it and it comes back stronger yeah you know and I think that's how the human condition is to a degree but you know the the hurry to failure the rush to failure or yeah that's how you get better but I want that that point where I'm gonna fail to be so unattainable and so hard to reach where if I ever reach that point of failure and I I mean I every time I go to the gym and I'm training on it and I want you come and hang out with us one day if you ever make it back to Austin and we try and find the quitter in each other every single time that we train every time that's what we say like we even have workouts called find the quitter and we have we have guys professional athletes from all sorts of sports come in and join us and they they will quit in the middle of a in the middle of one of our just strength and conditioning workouts and it's because my little group Shane one myself we are looking for that failure and it's getting so hard to find just like shooting I'm looking for that miss because that miss is that opportunity that I'm gonna get better I'm looking at that that that rep that I just can't get or that 530 mile one more time you know cuz that's gonna be the opportunity for growth so I agree with you but it also has to be hard to reach cuz failure should never be easy so you think her being able to say I want out that she still had enough left to keep going I don't know I think only her and her corner are gonna know that I would say I would say that I agree with you except I have so much respect for her and I think she's one of the toughest girls in MMA one of the toughest people and it she's a fucking animal Raquel Pennington she really is tough I'm a big fan of hers when someone like her says I'm out I'm done I just think she's beaten down so badly that she doesn't physically have the ability to fight anymore and then she went out and proved that in the fifth round and took a ferocious beating but she agrees with you she agrees with her coat she agrees she says now after the fact that her coaches were right and that she had hit this moment of weakness if I sit on the stool and my coach and I told my coaches I went out you know I got Greg Jackson Winkeljohn Nick Palma Sean o all sitting there and they let me out I would hate them forever I would I would regret my decision and I would be mad at them forever and they're there they're there some of my best friends now what if right after you said that you collapsed and they took you to the hospital and they had to open up your skull to alleviate pressure in your brain because you were bleeding internally and your legs stopped working and you're in a wheelchair like Daryl McClellan trying to relive the pass through distant foggy memories that would be less than ideal sure well I understand what you're saying it's like the the balance of the physical limitations of the human body and then the limitations of the mind and the minds willingness to find a way out yeah which brings me to the one thing that I wanted to get to before we leave this is waterboarding yeah and this is this is something that came up because you were defending what Gail Medina Gina what is her name hospital hospital and she is the the person that was being appointed by to lead the CIA yeah and there was a bunch of people that were saying that she shouldn't be because she advocated torture and you to defend her decided to get waterboarded yeah we've actually been talking about this for the past hour and a half yeah we have we've been talking about the slow erosion of of the human condition us getting softer and us getting weaker and us getting nerfing the edges and finding the easy outs and the easy solution the conversation of middle ground finding a way that we can communicate with people and have a discussion we've been we've been having this discussion for the past 90 minutes and what I have is a bunch of people that are saying what something is but they don't know what that is mm man I know what torture is I've seen it in Africa I've seen it in South America I've seen it the Middle East I've seen it on almost I'm pushing twenty trips overseas in a military capacity a handful of combat deployments you know from looking for poachers human traffickers drug cartel kind of piracy the things that I have done like you want to talk about knowing intimately what torture is I fucking know what torture is pouring water on somebody's face is not torture okay if you starve them if you beat them if you isolate them if they're there for you know you're their only giving yes we can start adding things on to it but the thing that was the most irritating was everybody's just throwing out this let's talk about morality and this woman is immoral to be in this position I remember people jumping to their deaths on 9/11 because they didn't look at burnt alive right and then I saw a guy on his knees and have his throat slit open by somebody pulling his hair back and sliding that knife across his throat that was one of the guys that she interrogated now I'm not saying two wrongs made a right but she interrogated them to get a question to get questions out of them to try to save more Americans the intent was to try to save more lives they say okay well if it's not that bad then why did it work and this is why this is what nobody understands and it's because they can't understand the difference between the easy way and the hard way is because these people that we were waterboarding are cowards they were pussies they were impotent little bullies their whole entire lives if I put you on that waterboard I could waterboard you for days you have your moral convictions and you would never change because you believe in what's right and wrong and that's a great and beautiful thing they're not you they are pieces of shit that that throw acid on little girls that fly planes into buildings because it's capitalist that that's who these people are and they're only tough when they're surrounded by 60 70 other of their friends but you take one of them away from that and you put them in a position where they're powerless and that's what waterboarding is the powerless and they K and they cower in seconds I don't need to drive a nail through their hands I don't need to pull their teeth out I don't take a drill bit and drive it through their fingernails that's torture this is us pouring water on a coward's face and they freak out and people can't understand that because they can't understand what these people are and they're animals these aren't beautiful religious people that are trying to do the best thing for the families these people were the worst of our kind these were the Nazis of the 1940s but this is the current version of it in the these radical fanatics that are doing anything for any reason to hurt anybody so they can feel better about themselves and you take them out of that power you take them out of that control you take them out of that opportunity where they can be the bully and they're just shadows of themselves and then they give you everything that you need and what you need is an opportunity to save more lives well there's two there's two things that were discussed about this one that your situation that you were in was not in any way similar to the situation they were in because you were doing it with your friends you knew you were gonna be okay you willingly did this the whole process was very controlled you you weren't being held by people who spoke a different language and a country that hates you yeah it's it's a situation where you knew you were safe so you could relax yourself and calm down and tolerate it to the point where you knew that you you would be okay you know there was the other side the other side is if torture works isn't that the best form of torture you're gonna be okay I mean if torture does work and I don't know if torture works I've never been tortured I've never been around torture and I know there's a debate both in both what torture doesn't work it doesn't work doesn't work so that's not torture No so you think you feel like that works but torture doesn't so I think - and maybe we're arguing about vernacular and verbs well you're forcing someone to do something they don't want to do and you're freaking them out yeah you're doing something physical to them so I think we just have to define torture if if it's me doing something to somebody that makes them uncomfortable is torture I mean me asking a pointed question at somebody in an interrogation room down at LAPD could be torture right you know if you smack him in the face is it become torture yeah is that is that torture right well if I had weapon if I hit with a phone book maybe the problem is the word maybe the problem is defining the word your I mean they then they call it enhanced interrogation techniques when if you're trying to get information out of someone that would save American lives it seems to me I mean I may be ignorant but waterboarding seems to me to be one of the most humane ways to do it I agree with that you're not gonna do any permanent damage to the person it's not like what they did to John McCain you know when he was president Vietnam and that disturbed the shit out of me when that guy was on Fox News and he called him songbird McCain because he was saying that you know terrorism that or torture either worked on McCain like how could you stoop like that I mean how could you do that I mean you know what that guy's been through to humiliate him and humiliate yourself by by taking that position on television like that was so disappointing it's about usable information we're questioning and if you cross that threshold of torture where you are doing damage physical damage where they'll tell you anything that's not usable information right like you're gonna say that you've you've been you know dating your producer for you know seven years and secretly like I could get you to a say anything under the right conditions that doesn't do it you just want to stop the pain yeah just anything to make it stop that's not what was happening here and and when we start talking about morality if they're saying okay if this is a moral act then then okay this make me and all of my friends that have done all sorts of some in some cases terrible things are we now immoral people because we did it in the interest of protecting our country and serving our country and and providing protection for our freedoms and I know those are cliché phrases that that people grab onto and I don't want to but then by extension throwing and lobbying those accusations at her extend to to me and to the things that I've done and I think I'm a very moral person and I try to be a good person and in every way I can imagine I'm not perfect I'm not but I try and the politics of bleeding over and and misusing words manipulating everything just so it fits your agenda but nobody's in the middle of ground nobody's agreeing and nobody has the best interest at heart and that's the people like the best interest should always be serving the people and none of them are doing that they only care about what is gonna get them reelected or what's gonna give them more power or it's gonna be more money from the lobby or what's going to give them more clout for the next vote or it's gonna give a little handout from the president or what's you know whatever games that play that happened on the Beltway that's what the and that was an example of that in the most horrible of ways because it came down to human lives it came down to somebody they'd been serving their country since the 80s in the best way that she knew how in the ways that were legal for her to do it and everybody else just manipulating the narrative to fit their agenda when I'm just sitting here being like how about the people and how about freedom who's fighting for us is it are you guys just gonna keep bickering about this so me strap strapping myself to that board I'll tell you it's harder do what's easy is to lay there strapped and have somebody put water on your face do it's hard when I did to steven crowder watch his hands where he'd reach up and pull the he couldn't have he couldn't take it he would pull the rag off his face see how many times I pulled the rag off my face not once right every single time I said no nope or longer no no use the hose use the bucket right now you're at a - I need you at an 8 no I need CIA interrogation friends right and I'm sitting there willingly with my hands what the sensation of me drowning as that water is running into my sinuses showing that was intentional I understand people are like oh no he was safe he wasn't even tied down I did that to demonstrate how a man of resolve can do it effortlessly and how it's not torture because I could Willie Lee lay there with my hands-free to pull the rag off at any juncture but I did it I just sat there and I asked for more I understand that but I also understand the position that people take where they say you knew you were safe and so this is why you had this resolve you or you're not in enemy soil being interrogated by Isis being strapped down by them where you didn't know what was next if you didn't think this what would be next let's say Rachel Maddow from MSNBC because we agree on so much she's like hey I want you to come on to my show I'm gonna bring in five CIA interrogators and we're gonna do it live you're in control of nothing do you think the result would be any different it's not the same because you're on a television show and you're still you're you're Americans are gonna do this to you you haven't been captured you're not an enemy soil you're not you know so how far did on how far do we have to go you have to kind of be what the person who's really captured is really captured it's not a game it's like if you get choked out in the street you can't tap out right if you get in a physical fight to the death to someone and they take your back you can't tap out right in in this situation you know you can tap out you know that even if it's CIA interrogating you and they're yelling at you there's a part of your brain that knows I'm on Rachel Maddow Show they don't kill soldiers on Rachel Maddow Show this is true so I don't know how I could better have Illustrated I think you did a fantastic job I think the problem lies and it's impossible to really recreate it without you being an actual prisoner of war yeah do what we do reverse the roles we're talking about snatching these guys from their bomb-making facility and whisking them to Abu Ghraib and and pouring water on their face what happens to me and my friends when we're captured oh we waterboarded no no no no I'm not I'm not saying that that what they do to us makes what we do to them right where I'm saying is it's better I'm saying it it's better I mean so it's what I was saying before if it is torture if you want to use the word torture like we'd use the word drugs right drugs are coffee and it's also heroin right there are drugs caffeine is a drug right yeah torture if you're just gonna say torture I'll take that torture every day because that's what that is yeah cuz even if it sucks yeah I'm gonna start alive I'm gonna be slowly carefully methodically painfully murdered yeah and that's my only option there there is never any other option if I got captured there's no moral equivalency I think we could both agree there's no I mean between us and them there's not but here's the thing McCain himself said that she shouldn't be appointed because she willingly participated in torture he said that yeah the what did you think about that I one respect his opinion I things that he has done whether we agree on things or is irrelevant his his resume speaks for a spell I agree and I think very few people could speak to torture better than him I agree with that as well so him coming from that position and saying that she isn't eligible to serve is a very powerful statement um I also feel that I'm pretty intimately familiar with torture and that I understand the full spectrum of what somebody can do selflessly for their country and selfless selfishly for their own satisfaction as a psychopath like Zarqawi's enforcer that would go around and kill people in front of their own family members and had carried around a battery-powered drill and like I saw that we tracked him so I also know that when she was doing all of these things for her whole entire career one they were you have to look at the context of the time and what was happening and when she did every single one of those things they were authorized techniques they were encouraged they were successful in some degrees to some degree and so she was trying to do the best that she could in the with the so in some cases limitation that she had and I think that is a trait that I want and somebody leaving the CIA that is that they're going to do the best they can with what they have and what they're allowed to do and I got like that yeah I realize that but this isn't someone who's talking about this in the you know the comfort of a boardroom this is someone who's dealing with it in time of war yeah and you're dealing with some of the most horrible people that we've ever experienced that are making these videos of cutting journalists heads off and sending them to their families yeah I mean this is this is this is really what we were experiencing when people were deciding to use these enhanced interrogation techniques this is what they were up against this isn't something you can discuss in a classroom and and get a full sense of the the tone and what was happening in these people's lives 9/11 was the tip of the iceberg when that happened there there were hundreds of other plans to do similar things with the that one was just successful they had been trying others and they have tried other since whether it's a shoe bomb whether it's a Paris train whether it's a San Bernardino bombing whether it's a garbage truck in France you know or London Bridge it's any any they they have consistently been trying to do that and duplicate and replicate that the reason that it hasn't happened again to that scale to that level is because of the uncompromising selflessness of heroes trying to protect Americans now I don't want to go into what is the greater good okay are we losing morality coming that's the rabbit hole that we could talk about forever but I just want to preserve life well I think that concept is so hard for people to grasp because it's Gary well not just that but the concept that the reason why this hasn't happened more often is because of these people doing the hard work why is that so hard for people to understand you're seeing hard work I just made a goddamn TV show just so they could see for the first time that people work hard so they can have food and they have work hard so they can have oil and they got power but people they look at a post when I don't have a shirt on everybody says man Tim love and being off you sada I've looked the same since I was 19 years old I have looked exactly like this with the same eight pack with the same muscle definition since I was an 18 year old kid I don't even know how many times I've been tested from the military for you sada two different events I've been clean my whole entire career but nobody can in their mind they can't understand to get from here to there is hard work though there has to be an easier way it has to be steroids or it has to be this or has to be that it's the same way they're protected and they're safe but they can't grasp the idea of the hard work that it took to keep them there I don't even think they're thinking that deeply into it I think they're just talking shit I think people see you you look jacked or storage I don't think there's that much thought but I think it's just I think it's the same lack of thought it's the same lack of consideration of what it took for us for us currently to be safe and what it still takes for us to be safe that's that's the departure that's that's the break in in in in the thought processes they just want the easiest way and they don't want to even believe that this hard way is the way that actually has happened what is the alternative what's the alternative suggestion and instead of enhanced arrogation techniques waterboarding instead of letting the CIA do what it's done up until now what is the alternative does anybody offered in you know in response to that like instead of doing it that way do it this way I mean now we're just leaving them and nothing we're leaving in muhabba grape for how long years you know it's it's like now they're in perpetual purgatory for eternity that there is no other solution nobody's presented one they're just complaining about the options exactly but that's the point is that there's no one said look the CIA has done a terrible job this is the way to do it right they're just saying look know what that is don't torture people and I agree with that yeah shoot people with paint ball pellets don't shoot them with bullets shoot you know hit him with rubber bats don't hit him with you know what are they saying what are they saying if they do you think part of the problem is the vast majority the population will never truly understand combat they'll never truly understand what people are capable of in the worst case scenario god I hope so yeah I mean I hope that 99% of this population never has to see any of the things that we've seen otherwise I failed like do you think that maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to force people to have some sort of mandatory service whether it's mandatory service in the Coast Guard or whether it's the Peace Corps or whether it's the military just some service of your country for a predetermined period of time like they do in Israel like they do in South Korea likely doing several other countries yeah I would love that do you think that that would fix things I think people and understanding of what's required like send people to Afghanistan for six months let people understand like holy shit like goddamn Kansas is pretty fuckin badass yeah how about send them to El Paso yeah I'm working down there oh no RS yeah yeah let me understand that the world is not San Francisco there are dark places and you could see that on CNN all you want look at it on RT until you can smell it until you live it until we I have to take these pills every single day which give me the shit's or otherwise I get malaria right we are there are all these people walking around are they taking these pills oh they're not they some of them have my oh wait having that reality sink into them that way I'm gonna eat that goat and I have to pull the pieces of hair out of my own mouth that that's the reality for the majority of the world it's um I would love for somebody to force everybody to have a taste of hard work well everybody wants something free right they got want the government to do many things for them to provide services and do things for it but the government is essentially just a group of us yeah and I think a group of versions of us yeah I don't want anybody telling me I have to go do something I don't want anybody telling me I have to go serve somewhere but I don't think it's the worst option to get people if we really hit a pivotal point where people have such a complete lack of appreciation and understanding of what it takes to make the world work correctly that might be one of the only viable solutions is some sort of mandatory service for some agreed-upon period of time yeah hey you're young I I don't think I think a warfighter should always and only be volunteer I agree with you but man serving your country for two years working on the border working in a homeless shelter humanitarian aid working in a hospital I mean all the different things that we could do with all of these people that would have their eyes opened that I think would strengthen people good I think it could there I mean their character their soul their bodies our minds all of it yeah just being forced to understand that there's a lot of messy work that's required to make this thing work correctly and we all benefit from it but a lot of us benefit from it and just sit at home and play video games and eat Cheetos and do nothing and you still complain about Mexicans sneaking in here it's fucking crazy you know everything that we want whether it's like success or food good looks a beautiful girlfriend beautiful boyfriend all of that is always just on the far side of hard work everything I don't know there's some dudes are never gonna get a hot chick shit rolls the dice out there genetically they're just it's never gonna pan out everything I've ever wanted has always been and everything I've ever had everything I've ever gained everything every bit of who I am has always been on the far side of hard work Lance Armstrong and I were talking and arguing about performance-enhancing drugs you know and I fought for two world titles and I lost two world titles you know he won seven and but he's in the dirtiest of dirty sport yeah I mean and he doesn't Tim Kennedy you know world champion doesn't that sound better you know and yeah it does it does but I would have lost everything because everything I've ever had has been from hard work and that would have been easy is he trying to justify his own existence do I mean what's happening there and also it's a different sport you know it's just a different thing between no one gets hurt if you take EPO and you run your bike faster it doesn't no one gets hurt if you're on something and it allows you to beat someone's brains in better and you walk away from a title knowing that you cheated but the guy you beat was natural that to a guy like you is it torture that you're gonna be you're gonna be in prison and the rest of your life with that thought bouncing around in your head I don't know that's not the same thing so I don't know if the same thing I mean we guys like Vitor Belfort who failed multiple tests were world champions multiple times sort of he really only won once against Randy nose cuz Randy got caught member you got that crazy I caught and he won the tournament when he was 19 but even then he was sauced up so he still feels like a world champion to him I would never want that I'm not I'm not rationalizing it we paid the price though yeah he is and he will pay the price but I mean he paid the price physically you look at the transformation between TRT Vitor that knocked out Luke Rockhold with the wheel kick and Michael Bisping and Dan Henderson he was a fucking monster yeah and then the deflated version of him where his body his endocrine systems failed it doesn't produce testosterone anymore can't take a punch anymore as he doesn't look even remotely similar to what he used to look like you know it's a look at the difference between him and then look at y'all romero okay Yoel Romero is 40 41 years old he looks the same older than Vitor and he's fucking jacked obviously you're dealing with significant genetic advantage and you all said that when he's on the podcast you know it was a great podcast don't know if you saw but Joey Diaz translated for him back and forth and they spoke Spanish and Joey translated to English but he said if you go to cute but it's like regular people regular people you see a bus drivers jacked he's like you're dealing with a phenomenal gene pool yeah there they saw players that come out and like they touch the ball and it goes over the fence I mean three printers let's say this is the I mean this is the dark dark aspects of the slave trade I mean this is what you're dealing with the best of the best the strongest most athletic the ones who can work the hardest those are the ones they wanted I mean that is essentially a big part of the gene pool that is cubed then you deal with the decades and decades of extremely high level athletic performance with with all these different sports and all these different programs where they develop the very best athletes in the in their area I mean they just the wrestlers the boxers of the judo players I mean phenomenal athletes and that the gene pool just outstanding yeah the Hector Lombard yeah another physical example but looking at V doors body shrink and you all stay the same minds do the same what do you think the heart not not the actual beating cardiovascular system but like the soul of Vitor he visibly looked deflated and every one of his fights post you sada yeah you know knows he's going into that in a compromised state yeah so when he was going into it like when he got tested when one of the times one of the reasons why the whole testosterone replacement therapy got eliminated Vitor got tested randomly and he was off of the charts like like to the point like superhuman levels of testosterone they're like what in the fuck are you doing man like you have this massive advantage massive confidence advantage and just physically looks like a demon right one that when that's gone now you're less than a regular man physically and mentally physically and mentally because you're tired all the time your body's tired you're not producing good levels of testosterone he talked about it openly about Lee tested his testosterone it's like the testosterone was 70 year-old man and he's fighting in a cage for a living at a very high level and the I still think it comes down to hard work I think it certainly does but all the hard work in the world if you're built like you know fucking Kevin Smith no disrespect cat I love you yeah Romero yeah just fucking you all Romero's gonna pound your face into the dirt every time yeah there's by Kevin Smith is a millionaire that is massively successful in what he wants to do and disaster for super smart that he didn't go into cage fighting yeah and he works hard does you go all the way back to the beginning when he's writing scripts and he's doing stand-up comedy right that dude was the first they're the last to leave and then his success is know is unquestioned yeah no I agree with you 100% he most certainly worked hard but I'm talking about genetics yeah like there's Jeanette you mean Francis and Gallo has free his genetics yeah I mean you know obviously stipa Miocic also has very good genetics still a giant person but the genetics that Francis have has in comparison to the average person you could work all you want you're not competing with that yeah there's some people just get a shit roll the dice yeah yeah he also lost his title fight though but he lost his deep a he was also got pretty fucking phenomenal genetics he's a giant Duty's toughest shit very skilled and has a just a lifetime experience I don't want to see anything nice about that guy first of all I get that it's hard for me to say anything nice about him but I worked hard worked hard and toughest shit became the world champion uh and he looks he's had a dad bod for forever yeah I don't ever remember looking at him I mean like that's a scary dude I look at him like god I want to fight him then like take that British accent shove it down his throat and make fun of him they make some more videos about him then beat him up again well he's been clean his whole career and never never exact like a guy who was doing anything suspicious in his it's always hard work hard work that made him a war champion yeah got it toughness all right no more talking nice about that talk about anything else but but after you retired can't you just let it go with a guy like him words you guys talk so much I just talking shit still yeah no totally I mean I've never really had a real problem with anybody you know in 17 years as a professional fighter I mean I could pick a couple of instances like we Mike and I would never be Fred it's like we're not gonna go drink a pipe together but like why not though I think we're just different people but why not now if he retires and you retire I mean we're good we're just different here in the airport one day yeah we'd totally hang on to each other you're at a bar let me buy you a drink you fuck looks like what are we talking about hunting we're gonna talk about shooting let's say we would drink a pint like we're never gonna be friends oh I would totally sit down have dinner with them and talk about the good old days and because you one also helps me I don't think it out that way no I was like Luke Rockhold you know I'd sit and talk to him jacory I'd sit and talk to him you know we got to get you out here because I know you got a flight to catch but I want to tell you at all my times of calling fights one of the most powerful experiences that I ever saw really wasn't even televised it was in between you you knocking out SAPO in the fight for the troops and you got on top of the cage and all the troops were there cheering you on and nobody there was nobody this wasn't televised nobody saw this but you were pointing at all those people and saying I love you I'd do this for you I love you and they were cheering and it was a fucking powerful moment man that was a powerful moment to this day I think about sometimes because that was a different kind of a fight it was a different kind of an audience and it was a it was a different kind of a moment and when you launched that left hook on him and connected him and stopped him and then jumped up on the cage and did that that was that audience the love they had for you and the love you had for them was it was in the air man it was fucking amazingly powerful yeah I never forget that moment to the day I died not not the fight not the fight camp I couldn't breathe I had so much love for everybody that was like I would have melted I would have fan oast myself vaporized and taking every one of my bits and just handed it to everybody there and not existed just so that they could have anything that they wanted because like there was just nothing in me that I wanted more than just to give them anything I had and I think I believe that it came out when you were when you were saying what you were saying the way just you could feel the the honesty and sincerity in it I'm not a good liar I gotta work on that no don't work on it Tim Kennedy you're bad motherfucker I appreciate you man keep doing it bro I will you too all right that's it bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
