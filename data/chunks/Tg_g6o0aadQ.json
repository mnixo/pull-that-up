hello freak bitches oh I did BET's comicview thrice three times yeah so I mean like who was hosting the first one ever was Lester Barry who was a black circuit comic but very religious nice the second time I did it was Arnez J in Miami and the third time third time was funny cuz I said by this point I go I'm not doing comic feel ever again like that's why just I've written that one off I'm not doing it it's always an awkward situation when I go there too why because I'm the only white guy the production is white and they put some weird responsibility on me to be like the den mother of the comics No so I think smoke cigarettes and I'd go outside mama go outside and smell the signatures okay wait a second Jews everyone J's going to smoke if you want to smoke go out now with him and everyone's gotta be back in here in 15 minutes and and then she gate tried to give me all of their food tickets so I'd be responsible for them it was very bizarre just because you're white yeah I may I assume so why that said a lot of the black comments will do things like I'm gonna go out and smoke and then go like you know fuck a chick for five works try to come back 50 minutes before the show starts like that did happen well what they want you to do just hang out all day waiting for the show star oh they put you there at 9:00 in the morning until night I went on at midnight what yeah because they just don't want these wrangle everybody say they don't believe any day yeah I know you know belief they're gonna stay there they've done entire shows about how happy they are like they'll do a show where the same joke gets repeated by different comedians well yeah and so what I went did it Kevin Hart and then a posting the who I think one of the last ever seasons but it was called one mic stand and or something like that I think it's what's called one mic stand but it wasn't called a comicview and keV called me and asked me if I wanted to do it or if I would do it and I said yeah but I don't want to comicview anymore because it's not common feel it's different they're flying people out now they're doing it all right and set it up good and it was when I signed the contract it's comicview presents one mic stand they gave us a big speech before we taped anything and the guy was like we're changing comic view it's gonna be different and the guy specifically said no more stool humping and DJ hit it and pulling out fake teeth and I mean we weren't three comics in before a guy was wearing fake teeth and fucking a stool I mean not even a teeth and by weight when he's giving this speech to it these same guys who were getting ready to fuck stools and put in fake teeth are doing like you know like staring at him give the speech and like nodding their heads like like Pacino speech in any given Sunday like it's like an emotional powerful speech how we're changing comic view now and then they wouldn't put the 18th and they're like yeah let's go out there and show the world something and then two minutes later you're like DJ put that shit back on you can fuck the bitch with fake teeth to this one no I couldn't agree more about DMT and and the the opening that it can give I mean I had the great advantage of taking it for the first time with Terence Mckenna and he was he said do you want to check this out okay and that's pretty cool on the resume by the way first time you did DMT it was Terence Mckenna yes I won't say where or when cuz it could be put down on some record somewhere that's probably already yes don't worry about it but for me it correspondent in many ways with what people talk about near-death experiences because i went out through light into a realm of great bliss and beauty and then i came back and it was like coming back from a million miles away and just coming back into my body and as it were being born again so it was it was very much like a death and rebirth experience for me and and it was very very transformative incidentally i think you know what i've been trying to understand this american phenomena Southern Baptists and one of the things that I think is the key to this is that I think when they talk about being born again originally baptism was just that I mean now you can get this through DMT in five minutes but at the time of John the Baptist you could get it in five minutes through being drowned people were lining up on the bank of the Jordan they go in he holds them under if he held them under just long enough you could actually induce a near-death experience in a life review at the drowning man sees his life pass before him in old Amanda just long enough and they'd have a near-death experience almost guaranteed I mean occasionally they might he might have done it too long but that was before litigation you know you might have lost for a litigation yeah a good theory actually and then you see they come back they say I've died I've seen the light mm-hmm I've been born again I'm no longer afraid of death my life has been transformed in five minutes event and the Baptist's were the people who revived baptism by total immersion in the 16th century and probably now in in America I don't hold them under that long because this is post litigation but you know when when the Baptist's first got going this idea of holding people under long enough all their language is the language that relates to near-death experiences and I don't think that to start with baptism by total immersion was just symbolic I think it was drowning what's needed is is transparency what's needed is open do you think the transparency is gonna be in eventualities because of the internet deepening yeah I think it is right everything gets blown wide open it's very difficult to keep secrets and it also it erodes faith in the leadership when like is this a democracy is this a representative government or is it some sort of a weird dictatorship because if it is a democracy how the fuck are you keeping that guy locked up how is Julian Assange still locked up yeah because do you well I wouldn't I need to know please tell me what exactly he did that you need to export him to the United States oh he released some information yeah which is our information we have citizens that this is not you know information that should be kept secret it's not from a king it's relation it's it's information that someone who was being paid with taxpayer dollars did a bunch of shit that the United States doesn't agree with yeah everyone was upset by the information that was released yeah everyone was upset by that video the Collateral Murder video everyone was obsessed by this massive amount of of data that showed there was a lot coercion a lot of lies a lot of a lot of stuff that we don't agree with yeah and because of that this guy's like public enemy number one yeah that's that's so anti what we think of as the United States completely contrary to everything the United States stands for yeah compare and that and so in answer to your question I would say yes it is some kind of weird dictatorship yeah posturing and posing as a as a democracy because for democracy to be real you have to have complete openness of information people must be told the truth then they can vote and make decisions on the basis of facts what we actually have in our society is the continual very clever massaging and management of information mm-hmm so it ceases to be democracy when the voting when the voting public are fed lies on the basis of which they they make their decisions and vote but yeah that isn't democracy anymore that is and in a way democracies are the worst kind of dictatorship because they have this appearance of freedom you have this illusion of freedom and everybody can say well it's great because I live in it in a democracy at least if you live in a dictatorship you know you live in a dictatorship and there are certain parameters that you have to work your way around but when you live in a dictatorship that is posing as a democracy it's more complicated
