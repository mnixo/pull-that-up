fuck well we already live yeah dan watch me tweet and talk at the same time you know there's a lot of guitar players that can do that tweet in guitar yeah they can sing and talk at the same time me I can't even type and talk at the same time and I don't have to keep any kind of spell experience wrong how do you sing and talk at the same time it seems because I'll sing I mean sing and play guitar rather this yeah but they'll also play guitar and like keep playing the song and then talk to you about some something you know I mean like my god nah man when you get down they need to make a left and they're still playing the exact you know some of their brain can can do both at the same time yeah it's like drummers I don't get that and weird like a drummer has a one beat on one leg one beat on the other leg one else dude how god damn impressive is dices kid yeah Max is a fucking beast really you're oh my god dude we had max silverstein he came on the show with dice and we played a video of it and I had seen him do it live when we went to dices show because he duh he does like his band does a song before dice comes out so I knew that the kid could play the drums but there's a video of him at the comedy lab next to the improv and who show was it on uh I don't know whatever was the fucking kids insane I mean he's not just good at the drums he's sick I mean he's Lila he looks like a fucking professional really oh it's amazing man the hand-eye coordination is ridiculous I mean he fucking goes off on the solo and he nails it he nails it perfect and it's one of those one of those moments you like that kids a bad motherfucker that kid could be a bad motherfucker at anything he wants yet anything he wants his fucking dad did a great job raising him man that that kid loves his father you know that is a beautiful thing to watch Dyson his kid for real he loves his fucking kids man and they love him and they're all empowered like his son is super confident young and strong and smart and you know he's can got a real shot a real shot you know without anybody's help just from talent just from you know the the ability to play drums like that you can do that I really believe you get a plug that shit to anything and if you go to on it and use the coupon code Rogan get yourself something alpha brain and other the function on my level son so seamless people will make fun of me for this alpha brain but you can all go fuck yourself if you take it and you don't see any results I think there's something wrong with your brain need to go to a doctor to find out or you need to shit I got that from time that's huge Tommy buns he just held up his arms and shut his run throwing funds around the samples it's really a chucking guns around this room no Super Furry Oh what is alpha brain it's really it's all at best best explained on on it calm because it was written by sober people first of all mmm-hmm and second of all people who understand science other than my level of understanding which is repeating shit that other people understand but I don't ever really understand people's evolution well I think there is certainly a lot of evidence for natural selection adaptation and that it's most likely the way things have evolved but there's some holes in it doesn't hold yeah we'll talk about it yeah I have a question for talk about this a little of course hey man well I thought this way this shit rolls here I want to thank God it's I come for supporting us we got hacked recently folks and we had to like severely upgrade our um the technical system however it is that the website interfaces with I learned something new by the way on passwords if you use like a regular word as a password and maybe a number you know that's okay but the hardest thing that would take like I forget like 32 years for a computer to hack is if you just take three random words and put them together like taco fart handicap or something like that yeah and that way the computer will never it just the odds that we'll get to that point it's like 32 years well yeah but then they'll just have a new computer search engine the yeah what bitch and they'll nail it quicker we've got the capital and in lower case thing I don't think that matters that nose really yeah that's like zero most things aren't case sensitive here but uh either way on a comm spelled oh and an IT and if you go there and today is the 11th September 11th and if you go there for one more day use the code got your back and you get 18 percent off of everything that includes kettlebells and battle ropes because normally the coupon coupon code of Rogan only works for the supplements it doesn't work for the kettlebells and the battle ropes the reason being is that we sell those literally as cheap as is humanly possible but because of this fuck up because the fact that everybody feels terrible that this web site got hacked we don't know whether or not anybody's credit card information got compromised so far no one has reported any what they call substantiated fraud I think they call it but uh whatever it is some scumbags figured out a way to get into our system it's just I thought I don't understand the way they do it I'm completely talking like I'm explaining French to you though I don't speak French so I can never really comment but as far as I know I mean this it's really I think for a lot of these guys it's fun to see how they can sneak into systems even if they're not stealing anything I think the game script kids that are just really bright and they figure out how to sneak in your system it's all against the hunt man like yeah see how far they got I can see up to some hackers the other day but would you do I'll talk let me yeah let me just get through with this the so because of that because everybody's very bummed out about that that you're you know the credit card information has been compromised if you go to on it calm for it slash breach it'll explain all that it's just an unfortunate aspect to doing business on the internet we apologize and nobody nobody foresaw it this way we've beefed up the security considerably so hopefully it won't happen again whoever hacked us please don't do that Thanks you don't have to do that that's mean I know you can do it okay we know you can do it please don't do it I don't want anybody to get caught and go to jail for something stupid like that and you know and if that's how you're making your money how dare you go get a fucking respectable job you son of a bitch you're stealing numbers from offline you can't do that I'm a big fan of you guys whoever you are yeah I want to give a shout out powerful shout out so anonymous and well sir guys shout out right out of hackers of the world yeah man look that you know there's a certain there's a certain amount of morals that are on the internet when it comes to how things get done as well you know there's there's a there's a moral attitude of the Internet I think more mere society than it does the shit that you see on television the shit that you see in the news now there's a when anything goes down like the difference between like damn we shouldn't do this in a commercial oh yes we're this Joe Joe Rogan dotnet that's my website where you go to on edge comm use up all the other phone yeah yeah that's not for today though do not spawn just like that it's only a part-time thing with the thing we're just trying it out see how it works the phone is phenomenal though the Samsung Galaxy s3 and fucking is the shit is it really it's sweet it's sexy look amazing it's really great it's got a little fee you every now and then a little hiccup here and there but it's really special I needed to phone it's a special phone what's the queefs about it what it just seems like I think they're the iPhone is a really well-designed phone man tomorrow's the wait is it tomorrow becomes the way the the when you the touchscreen first of all is better than anything on the planet they're the best touchscreen the quality of it feels better than anything like when you have the case on an iPhone you just feel that metal in glass it's like the sexiest piece of equipment ever it's but you got to walk around with a condom on it yeah because you know it's so breakable but but it's still super duper fucking sexy I mean it's all you hold on to that thing I mean feel that that's a that's some genius piece of device and so it's that phone is always a little better than everything I tried the way it interface is just cleaner smarter makes more sense easier to find shit it's just better it's like our Tiffany's you think my phone really started taking a shit most today really and it's it's totally because it comes out tomorrow yeah yes Apple sending out our swear to God electronic popping up the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by honor comm go to oh and and I T we got to get this podcast start this is ridiculous that's it we're not brought to you by anybody else go to death squad TV though and pick up some some funky sexy cat shirts it has been proven that you're 20 percent more likely to get your penis touch if you were in a desk wad cat shirt 20% percent if we have a 43% with alcohol you add a desk one shirt and alcohol and someone's going to touch your penis and this is a blind study yeah it's like three out of five times touching your penis yes alright I feel good for you I feel like the odds are strong Tom Segura is here you dirty bitches let's get it poppin Brian the Joe Rogan experience train my day Joe Rogan podcast by night okay Oh sweetness Tommy buns in the fucking house ladies and gentlemen its Tommy it's good to have you buddy we were about to just talk nonsense and go to a commercial and Tommy buns hits me with do you believe in evolution like the throne heavy-handed questions that's a fuckin right hand balm to open the round well it's just funny to me because I was watching this thing about and this guy was like this guy fuckin believes that evolution should be taught in the classrooms you know it was like a political ad like that know right like that that appeals assembly they're like yeah fuck that guy he thinks evolution should be thought that's guy's fuckin asshole you're like really there's that there's there's actually enough people that believe like I I'm not a science expert so I don't want anything like wait a minute you're about you not a science X yeah I know I mean I have a what Brooke point do you become an expert because if you were just you and you lived in the 1400s you'd be a fucking science X you're probably right they'd be like electricity is God's Way of showing you his anger you're like well no actually it's just some shit that's born the atmosphere and my brother B you'd be a fuckin scientist you can explain so much shit to these people well actually I would just know it and not know how to explain it don't be like no very dry you dry the earth round and they'd be like how do you know because I've seen you would you would be work with those people for a couple days and you'd be so annoyed you like listen you have to listen to me I'm your new King and I'm gonna show you how to build an airplane you just may be like an airplane what the fuck you talking about get some wood get some what I'm gonna show you fucking good addy you need this has got to be straight like that think like a bird but then with the tail up in the air there's air draft from above and below able to go where did you get this idea from I don't know man they just come to me they just come to me you draw like bows and arrows for like the da Vinci was like from the future I went to the past I think the DaVinci had too many ideas yeah you know what people love to say when there's a guy like da Vinci what they got and I wanted to sit Josiah just at an insect it's probably I'd like Asperger's or something like you always want to say something like that like that there's no way you could be let off with that guy that brilliant and not be fucked up yeah I'm not willing to believe it you know I don't think that I mean keeping like I almost agree that like I don't think you could go to da Vinci and be like how do you like your eggs man maybe like you know actually I think he would be talking about all kinds of weird she would be like thinking about what you would look like if you cleaved you in half and told you I couldn't draw those two sides you want donate your body like today you're like nah I'm not dead yet did you ever see that exhibit that Body Works exhibit yes well they take human bite together yeah that's right that's crazy it's creepy as fuck dude and they were stopping us for taking pictures or they told us to put our phones away but I had to take camera pictures on the sneak tip yeah yeah we're like no flash the horse remember the horse they had this like real horse that had been like almost fucked up was that if you did this if you haven't seen it folks the body works exhibit is an exhibit where they take a bunch of dead bodies and through some new method of somehow another coating them with plastic and infusing plastic into the muscles it doesn't change the appearance but it completely stops them from decaying so it's really creepy give you different actors yeah they give you like they've an abortion cut well that's yeah that's what's really fucked up is the the clinical aspect of the dissection of the bodies on display was a little disturbing because it was almost like butcher esque it's like if this was a guy's basement you would want him locked up forever okay this guy would be one of the most horrific serial killers and twisted Fox ever ever even if he was a grave robber and he did this yeah you would want this motherfucker locked up forever but you can do it and somehow because you've involved plastic which means that it's been like government sanctioned or something now you can just display these dead bodies and people can come and pay like how where did you get these bodies exactly I mean it's not even like under like heavy scrutiny some of them had like Bullitt movies or something in the bullet holes that exhibit even stir around it's got a smell by now he one that I saw I saw it in Vegas it was at I think was a blocks or yeah it like that was I think yeah and um there were any much sadness for one day at the end they said that all the bodies in that exhibit were from China yeah Wow yeah oh my god yeah that's scary because when you're when you're from a country that has been known to do some really horrific things to like prisoners and shit pretty questionable track record the human rights well they doesn't seem to be that there's that many of them in China and so it's I mean rather that there's too many of them in China yeah but there's so many people so many in some areas the overpopulation has gotten to a point where they've sort of devalued life in a lot of ways I mean when you start hearing the stories about them you know forcing them to only have one child and so there's terrible stories of families drowning Chinese girls oh it's really horrific because they want it boy yeah I mean it's just fucking crazy and you know if that's propaganda those I really honestly shouldn't be yeah well I know outside of like outside of the major cities there's a lot of like straight like out in the countryside which is hundreds of millions of people there's extreme poverty either literacy there's you know there's not any health care or anything is just the hundreds of millions of people outside of the major cities so when you that mean that kind of poor I mean we have II we just haven't figured that out yet I don't I don't I don't think most Americans have really like put that into their head like that level the level of poverty exists in other country we have extreme poverty but it's you know there's it's not like really what you see yeah in third we have horrific poverty but even just existing in a welfare state is way better than a giant chunk of the world has access to you know if you think about like what what it would be like if you just had a shit roll of the dice and you want up in Nigeria yeah you're a baby in Nigeria and it just flies and mosquitoes and malaria so the dude's got a hyena on a chain and you're like what the fuck would you most of Africa's fucking crazy really so wild crazy place man I just got back from there did you really just in South Africa oh that's right you were doing gigs out there yeah was awesome was so cool people were so nice yeah crowds were fucking awesome and then I met other Africans that were in South Africa and I learned like that's the destination like if you live in Botswana Mozambique Namibia you go like I want to go to South Africa that's that is the crown jewel but that's the most developed like by far by far by far and like when I was in I was in a casino walking through it with with this comic who was from I think he was from a former quasi from Nigeria or somewhere I don't know Mozambique I think and I was like so what's like you know your country like he was like man he's like you know how you picture Africa and I was like yeah he's like that's what it's like like it's fucking open terrain and animals in tribal shit and he goes this shit right here the casino the only thing like this in my country is like where the King lives what that's it there's no shit like this at all that's going to be so weird to have one city that's like on top of the ball and everything else is just as yeah barely keeping it to air our Hara Lee keeping it together yeah it was but it was it was a good was an awesome experience people were what the crowds like so good very like mixed crowds and just juiced for the shows I mean I would say out of 15 how's your Black Goat jokes go fucking killed they understand American black humour totally really they got it they totally get it they got they got everything they got everything man Wow did you find you find them to be like endure like harsh material are they just it was interesting all the local guys we saw a bunch of some South African comics and a lot of them are have very political material and because it's a very politically charged atmosphere you know you think about that like they got democracy in 94 so it's kind of like us you know you just fast forward like you know like the 60s and 70s really politically charged in America right and then right and then you know there's just like it's fresh so that's what everybody talks about we talk about politics and things going on but it's like South African politics and then we go in and we'll talk about the mundane but just silly like observational shit and some of the local guys were saying they're like that's so unusual for them like - that somebody would just talk about some like small observation they made because it's all about making an impact with like your observation about what's really going on in the world or in the country right now you know so everybody's a preacher I mean there's a lot he said that look you can go to like you can do good with stand-up show in South Africa that's all locals and they'll all hit on political shit he said that's not uncommon at all that's interesting is it funny did you find honey there's this guy David cow is a South African comic and he was fucking tremendous yeah I didn't even know what like he was like you know when somebody's really good and you don't necessarily get the reference laughs anyways like you don't even heat you like you don't know I don't know what that was right right right you still laugh just because he's just timing yeah funny it was like that fucking dick devastated the place Wow yeah I mean he was so but he was all like it was all about South at like current shit in South Africa wow it was like it was one of that would translate like if he did the u.s. I think it's I don't think it would I don't think act would but I think he's good enough where he would just need to figure out figure it out well that was something that never happened with the Boston guys there was a bunch of guys from Boston that Boston like no other place does like local material like my first 20 minutes was all local material because you knew it would work it was like almost like was first of all there was a lot of really funny shit about Boston people from Boston loved laughing about Boston yeah so that like everybody that was like really strong had such a Boston centric act like Steve Sweeney in Boston I'll put him up there with the greatest stand-up performances of all time I'm telling you Steve Sweeney in Boston in the 80s used to lay them down to just boom like he was bowling strikes crushing with this Boston material and he's just such a funny guy he's just such a funny guy and he had been it through the like the hard Boston club scene for you know over a decade before I ever saw him yeah you know I mean he's just oh he was just a bad motherfucker yeah and that guy you know when he would go to California he would lose like a big chunk of his act because he couldn't talk about that shit anymore it so it was so frustrating to me I was like man you could do that about anything yeah you could hit that level of comedy yeah he could do that with anything yeah that's the thing about that we all everybody thought this by the way we'd all kill I was there christina was on the the show to finesse Mitchell Ian bagg Mitch Fay tell Brian Haner and we all watched David were like he just goes the states why I'm fucking like you know he'd need to work like had a week after week right and just if he did that for just a few months he would put together a stellar fuckin act I'm sure well I think now especially because the internet the guys that are coming up over the next ten years there's a lot of good guys yeah and I think that a lot of these good young up-and-coming stands the stand-ups have had a chance to see so many good acts online so that even if in their in their area and their areas not so good you know like there's all I'm not mentioning names there's some places you'll go and like oh he's the funniest local guy you should have them open for you and you have the guy open for you Enys fucking deaf yeah just nonsense and just bad hacky tricks you know oh Christ but if you're in that community all you really need a stage time if you've got like access to you know you can watch the the Kinison archives you can see Bill Hicks stuff you can see Stanhope you can see David tell you can see Norton you can see all these different comics online you can sort of get it what do you enjoy what do you enjoy I know you don't enjoy what that guys doing so it's instead of thinking about like the hacky stuff that's in your neighborhood you have access to all this stuff whereas like in this the 80s when I started out there was no access to that other than like CDs and cassettes it wasn't as immediate and it was more moves way more difficult to sort of create a scene or to you know to get good without like a good scene around you yeah yeah you know I think cuz I always feel like I'm only as good as the guys that I see around me on a regular basis and the guys that I perform with random basis yeah so if you're stuck somewhere where you don't see a lot of good shit yeah it would affect your game yeah because like when I see someone really good like when someone Stanhope's in town or when I see Diaz go up and kill or you know a towel or some you know someone I really respect when I see their act I get so charged up it gives me energy to buy make things yeah it definitely is yeah that that little juice that little little squirt of just some push to get you forward mm-hmm you know that's like so important for nothing like seeing great staying when you're staying out you see somebody great guy at the show you're at you're like fuck I'm not afraid of watching stand-up like you know I like when I'm at the comedy clubs I try not to watch anybody I don't watch a lot of stand-up but I do like if they're if I know so there's somebody either I want to see you know or somebody I know I'm like like a friend of mine or somebody who like you know this person is really good I don't sit through whole shows but I'll watch that person and sometimes it is like and that's fucking so exciting you get pumped up about it you're like that's awesome you get like like it makes you want to work I could watch Joey Diaz do a thousand sets in a row probably well yeah there's definitely certain people but like if I'm like you know at The Improv or whatever the Icehouse and there's like all these comics going up I would not I don't like sitting there watching them because it seems like to me to just it I'm too scared of going there and then having that like something in the back of my head from somebody else or it seems like that's really I guess for you I get bored and I get it I get anxiety when I when I sit around I'm just watching like a just comic after comic home not feel anxiety I get like man I can't sit here right now like I just get like I'm like I got I gotta get up I gotta I can't sit through this if I think it's like if I sit and that's like I'm a minute in and I'm like oh this is not gonna be this is not good I have to get up and leave you can't watch bad Stan that's what you're saying do it so you can watch like louis c.k for fucking hours but you can't watch a bunch of like okay I will not say any names but there's a certain group of people that you know you've seen them do stand-up and you're never gonna understand it yet they're still bumping around and you might like be in the back of the room one day and they're on stage and you got you almost have a heart attack fucking up and out you gotta get out of the room they'll infect you I think yeah they will well do you know this real thought behind that sounds crazy but it's um there's a schizophrenic s' something happens to schizophrenic sand I believe it's called Aleph Renia and it's a a very rare situation where people will go to visit crazy people and become crazy while they visited them really yeah and they don't know they don't know exactly what it is and they think it might be fur monel it might be um might be something in the way you interact with this person but it has happened before where people have gone in to visit people who are fucking crazy yeah and they all of a sudden people like we're going to have to keep an eye on you and then boom so it's just like almost like the association with that person but it could be that they were just always craziest right nobody just be like that or you're with them it's almost like when you what's it called when you like Stockholm Syndrome where you started to yeah you still I think that's organized with your kid matter yeah but I mean like it's like you there's a certain exposure to that person that starts to affect you like on a deeper level I don't know enough about how humans affect each other to really when I was when I was in college I was in psych 101 our teacher one day we were talking about you know you going through all the basics and then he gets to schizophrenia and he was like okay he writes it on the board he's like schizophrenia is the worst thing that could ever happen to you and in this kidness class in our class raise his hand and he's like yep he's like I have schizophrenia I don't think it's the worst thing that could ever happen and we were all like oh you just pissed off the schizophrenic guy and then he's like well what I meant was there are different stages of schizophrenia and that the worst one is the worst thing that could happen to you which one do you have like you have and he's like I have like a less like you know severe he's like oh yeah that's not what I meant but nice it'd be really bad if nice backpedal I'm trying to find the name of this this thing that that where words happened before so the rare case of people who visited schizophrenic so I can't I can't seem to find so I might I might be talking a little bit of shit because I'm just repeating some things that I think it was I think it was Terence Mckenna Terence Mckenna lecture but the idea was that one of the things that they think about some people when they start to lose their mind is that it becomes a pheromonal problem when they're giving off its weird smell to people like this this you know this what is a you know how would you describe a fair amount of hormonal smelling gas and people treat them weird they're it's offensive people treat them odd and they start thinking like am i odd am i crazy and that that tipping point is like really not that hard to do on some people really yeah because if you think about how you interact with people I'm sure you've had times in your life where you've been is socially awkward or you felt like real weird or felt like real vulnerable special when you were young Brian barely really really got one correct sentence yesterday with Kat Von D on that I've looked over he came in his pants three times how are you doing today so far I keep on thinking very beautiful I met with me a picture of you hugging her was just sick you just a bliss you look like he was like a Mack I like touching her I like girls that think like that like the energy thing she said about you know yes I I love girls I think like that she's a very nice person and she's incredibly artistic she's a badass bitch it's too many fans she's really nice to men she's really nice like legit nice like not a bullshit night it's just a nice person yeah it's nice when you see someone that's trying to do that that's trying to do the right thing yeah is read bro we did you get that from from Kat Von D for watching is that how she talks I think so well we're trying to do it again you don't you don't think Cameron Diaz hot are you saying something that she's hot urging I said I watched her show when I never stopped for sure look yeah man look me in the eyes now she's out only what she sounds like to me do it again but look me in the eyes I want to blow the big red man is that your impression for everybody like what spider-man sound like oh sticky in my head that's it a sucky impression do this Tara I thought that was fucking spot-on really yeah duper crashing now I'm a big fan of Kat Von D I watched every episode of that show really absolutely every Eddie Bravo episode prod missed that one but the other ones I caught why it's me man it's must be the ringtone fucking AT&T commercial you gave me shit about mine to give a heaven that would I have the same thing why I don't change me anything I just want to know if someone's calling okay that's all I want to know Brian I don't really give a fuck what it's have on D I love you just whoa Brian hey stop hims taking your girl just said Kat Von D I love you that's so not cool let's say you do you don't understand what it was like for little Bry yesterday really you know no storable you want to hear my new ringtone is a cab yes okay stop sup she's terrible man you really I need to find out what happened you that froze you in 12 did you spend some time with a schizophrenic yesterday yesterday there was some strange moment when you were 12 and you just stuck their emotional later than that ringtone I didn't even know if it's your phone if it's really fuck you just check how about that how about I don't give a fuck you should sell ringtones man I went through the ringtones store and that the top 10 ones are so dumb like sneaky unicorn was the best one and I was just really stoned but there's like one that's just like a black guy going yo man it's your phone that's what I want I want a white guy doing a bad black guy how is that bad yes if you were in like a really black area and you hear the phone cord and your phone motherfucker answer your phone pick up your phone bitch you don't think my impression of a black person that's a big turner I think it was okay he's okay it was a little racist what Jesus Christ did he like pletely I only said that I only said that because it was the funniest thing to say okay um I don't think you're racist by any stretch of the imagination but I did I put myself I put what some people thought was a racist tweet the other day I wrote I saw a black eye with a Mitt Romney bumper sticker on his car mm-hmm I go the minds were right this fucking thing is over yeah like that's ridiculous is black a basis piece yeah and all some people say on a racist piece of shit how does that racist uh I don't know I don't know no I need to know if there was a joke in there about him and black people or well my questions what black guys are relating to Mitt Romney well that mean it's gonna get you some more tweets I need to look I wish there was another alternative because I'm not really happy with either one of these guys this is it seems to me III mean I feel like socially Obama's way better way he communicates his better he's way smarter he's way more moderate we're way more reason I'll rather hang out with way more impressive fuck yet with Obama but look me out is that seems like fuck look at all the shit that got passed while Obama was in office I don't know how much that had to do with him it's it's so hard to believe that a young guy just a few years older than me would be so willing to give in to this ridiculous idea that giving the government more power over the people is necessary to keep us safe yeah because I think that's just total horseshit I just think they want to lock it down and they're slowly eroding our rights and they're doing it in a very unconstitutional way and that's not the way to do your job your job is to do it within a constitutional way and if you if you can't keep us safe in a constitutional way it means you suck at your fucking job you need to get better at that but we don't need to do is look at everybody's fucking email and listen to everybody's voicemail messages and track everybody's movement through GPS and you don't need to do all that this is crazy because who decides who has access to that information who decides you know he people could harass you because you have different political beliefs than them or you you're you know interrupting their campaign that you know this there's a lot of different things that someone could do if they have influence if they have enough power over you by being able to track your whereabouts oh yeah listening they're all your phone calls that shit is ridiculous and the fact that that's happening in America man that's what we always used to make fun of the Soviet Union about that you know everything everybody was being a spy and spied on and sure we never thought that shit was going on over here but meanwhile the government just opens up the floodgates and it's all of us and now it's so gross and that didn't you retweet that somebody I didn't even know about this and it amazes me that the like that this happens and nobody knows that they they audited the Fed and that they found out that like the bailout amounts were not even close it was trillions of dollars in secret really Dail outs and that certain companies were getting trillions not really not even like what we were told they were getting like let's say 50 billion you're like Jesus you got 50 billion no they got like 1.3 trillion dollars yeah it's insane and that was like the like it was in the news but like I feel like nobody really they were like yeah so what happened I don't get it man I don't I don't understand how any of it flies it's the mean the whole idea that you that first of all the whole idea that the only way to fix all this shit is to take more money from us fucking berserk yeah that is so bonkers that's the stupidest idea ever it's like you're telling me that you just have to no matter what keep these defense budgets the way they are now that's what they're saying essentially they're saying look we're not gonna shrink that so let's just concentrate on move it along why can't some things off and some other it's this giant chunk on monies being thrown at this ridiculous situation this horrific situation rather and no one can't fix that that is just what it is you know we'll cut that a little bit we're gonna cut that a little bit we got no money for pizza in school though yeah you know it's it's the idea that you don't want you're gonna need a little bit more from everybody like no you don't you need to stop spending money on shit attic we don't want you to spend money on what the fuck where's the money going and nobody the thing is like not only defense but nobody is ever really willing to make concessions nobody wants to give up whatever their cause is whatever the committee they sit on just go somewhere else so you end up finding a group of people that are all agreeing to not make any any deals like no just take from somebody else just not us and it goes around the circle and then alright that was fun fucking nobody gate made any concessions at all first of all the only way we're going to fix this whole world problem is we're going to have to be able to read each other's minds people are just too full of shit language is just one step on a never ending or never ending rather process of getting closer and closer to each other languages are the ability to do it in expression and you say which you you comes out of your mouth I know what you're saying I know you are you talk I know you are we're going to be able to get past that that's what the next step is the next step is we're going to be able to read each other's months and until then we're have a really hard time with this fucking thing because people are full of shit and people misinterpret people's words and people are touchy and people don't know why they're really mad and you know there's a lot of the problems through a normal human communication yeah and part of it is I can only gauge your intent like guesswork I can only gauge your intent by how you how you respond guesswork and and and then you know you put it into the the computer that is your brain and try to figure out if this person is good for my life it's firstly bad for my life this is first of my friend they looking out for me eventually we're going to just read each other's minds that's all going to be bullshit and you're going to know who's a cunt yeah cons are gonna know they're constant have to straighten up it's gonna be like a beautiful moment yeah but you're also gonna know you know all the creepy shit about people yeah we're good we're gonna definitely get past the idea that the only way I can communicate is through some noise some mouth noise and some text message just looking at somebody you think well look at the interface of text messaging I mean look at that's already you're you're you've already got this new way to communicate with people that are nowhere near you yeah you know so here you're getting a little bit of their information a little bit of their personality a little bit of their mind this little text that's coming in on your phone yeah well eventually that's going to it's going to morph into the next thing whatever the fuck it is it's going to be people that let you ride along where you could tap into their consciousness and you could walk around with them and shit yeah I don't see that being outside the realm of possibility I think that's totally possible that you could eventually get to a point where a person interfaces with some sort of an internet connection in maybe some sort of something that you would wear in your head that stimulates various parts of the brain with electrical impulses or something that can you know trigger certain experiences if they figure out how to really wire that maybe they'll actually have to fucking drill some holes in your head and shed put little little conductors they have just screw shit into but people would totally do it if you could actually work that out probably and ride along with each other yeah like you could go you did you a real for sense if you were real freak you know like those dudes like watching their wives fuck fuck other guys yeah they could like be their wife sure while she gets fucked by a giant black eye yeah because that's scariest big guys one big black ice is scariest if or that's maybe like what his thing was not like cuckolds yeah them yeah guys so like watching other guys fuck their wives in front of them that's it that's interesting that's to me it is and if that's the real fuckin that's the exciting point one like this guy's about to drill my wife this is fuckin all that's so crazy yeah yeah and they wanna they wanted to get fucking hammered you know what how can that end in anything other than murder-suicide can it I don't know but I was just thinking you could never switch it you could never fuck a girl in front of your wife and she's just sitting there brushing her hair really you know slow and I don't think so unless she was crazy but well it's but dugu it's not normal that a guy would sit there and get off on that no no it's not normal at all some guys are just real freaks yeah but there's everything you know yeah I mean shit that's well put there's everything that really is what the the answer is and we didn't really know that as much when we were kids that's why you were subject to get accosted by like some predator yeah because you never knew any predators so we did we didn't have access to nearly as much information yeah the internet really exposes fuck yeah every kid knows about pedos now yeah I got a pedobear hmm you know I mean pedos weren't something that everybody talked about when I was a kid it was like you keep away from that man he's a bad man any be like oh who's the bad guy over there why is another card anyways yeah yeah nobody understood was how kids know now you have files how many kinks there are like there's all these you go online yeah subcategories of shit you like that's a thing really yeah oh my god is exposed you know and and said we're like adults now but you realize that like if you look back on like fifth grade you he's aware yeah that 10 year olds are on look there's all these there's this shit okay there was always specialty things there was always like like but it was hard to find them like if you were gonna be in a weird freak shit yeah like some dudes are into feet yeah and they were they were actual feet magazines yeah nice a feat porno magazine with my friends I have in the woods okay we were wandering through the woods and we found a pile of magazines like in a plastic bag if you found them in the woods they were almost 60% of the time they were porn right if you found a dude who went to read magazines in the woods there was a lot of people that would go and they would just go beat off in the woods oh great I love that in dudes that go to read magazine heads and they left their stash back there so we would go find their stash and so it was me and my two friends and as they were opening the the pages my friend there were two one dudes from Argentina they do was from Cuba yeah and we're we're in Florida and we're peeling back these pages and this kid stops and he goes man I think this shit is just dicks and feet that's the quote of the day ladies yeah and it was one of the first times I had ever saw anybody like so clearly say what the fuck when they don't really want an answer right you know yeah that that you know when you say like what the fuck yeah you know really it was just like what the fuck like he knew I didn't know I knew he didn't know we were 11 we're looking at like dudes jerking off on yeah I get the whole thing I've been wanting that to be a thing I didn't know it was I found the creepiest new fetish out yesterday it's called belly punching it's just guys and girls punching other girls in the belly really hard really and they get off on it don't hate I don't want to watch them yeah and the videos are just really disturbing I it's from prison you don't I don't know oh please shut that off I got that stuff bugs me yeah I don't get off on it but I've seen it and it was like it was so extreme that I was like in tears laughing what wasn't the ball kicking Oh Jake's butt so I saw one I was like oh that's clearly that guy has a cup on you know you can tell mm-hmm this one was genuine she was like she was kicking like 50-yard field goals like lining up teeing off of his uh his legs were shaking and then she's like yes Suffern Suffern and like fucking what the fuck is that about I don't know man but somebody's like somebody's not watching that like - laughs they're watching that that is the most erotic arousing thing I got kicked once so hard in a tournament I've been kicked many times when I get kicked once in a tournament while my cup slammed into my balls and it I was fucked my my ball swole up they were purple and they swell up like it's swole up like twice the size of normal even if what I don't understand I don't understand how the guy can physically take it which I do I have what do you have any photos I don't know shit I was only like 16 17 how did they physically tell like is like that obviously if I were you like huh like I was fucked up man I've been kicked in the balls and it's like I can't even I wouldn't be able to like if there was a second kick I just shit myself I got a boner on the way home no so I was happy I was happy that it still worked was almost like my body was letting me know no way because that was when I was like when I was like 16 or 17 I would get those random boners I could be walking you know it just get a complete hard-on like out of nowhere yeah what the fuck is is doing here school - you didn't know it's like giving a blind person a gun you know you're like what it was what's up what is this a trigger I don't know what you're doing when you're when you're a 17 year old kid just walking around with a boner I would crank out so many fucking I'm so ridiculous you're always horny yeah and like that that chamber is fucking reloaded emedia immediately what's really fucked up is that that is probably like one of the biggest shifts as a human being that your life makes from no sex at all - boom having a girlfriend when you're in your teenage years which are confusing it's fuck yeah your teenage years are all mess and in that you're having relationships you're making out with people and penis is going into girl's vagina it's the best you've ever felt in your life yeah and she's on the pill so he can squirt it in her mmm I just so confused you get so baffled you're so fucking twisted just so absorbed in that person and that's why you see so many people that age like throw everything else away for the relationship because they can't it's also addict behavior yeah we've all been guilty of it addict behavior is not just physical addiction it's just like squirrelly thinking you know addict behavior is like some there's a lot of like different activities that shouldn't really exist for our shitty minds but they do exist and people can't help because the fact that they have access to casinos there's certain people that cannot fucking help it they're drawn in there and they want like gamble they want action that's what they live for it's it's I've seen it it's craziness and they'll go on these programs though I'm not gambling anymore I'm not doing this anymore I'm done the next thing you know I'm just gonna try a little handle it now it's all about management boom back in the slide crazy in debt never get and it's not it's just no just no drugs there's no dealer there's no just no poisoning there's just fucking this weird idea that you need to fucking pull that lever and see those lemons I don't have it oh and then they take that money and go right back in its fucking horrified there was a guy named white plains Charley when I was a kid and I used to play pool at executive billiards he was the first guy that ever met that was an absolute 100 percent gambling junkie this guy didn't do a goddamn thing for a livin he lived off handouts and games of hustle pool he slept in like homeless shelters and you know in different people's houses and you know had apartments in like real real squirrelly situations and he would just come down the pool hall and go to the racetrack and that's all this guy did yeah that's all this guy did he was always in action he was always an act liking ponies and it was such a sad guy cuz he was in his like 70s you know and he was like you know just a really tiny tiny man and people yell at him and they'd fucking treat him like shit because he was always broke and he would yell at them and and he would always lose his money shut the guy almost had those motherfuckers I'm supposed to have seven seven five you know they have some number problem that went wrong on of course you know that would have paid two thousand two thousand can you believe that shit I can't tell you how many conversations I had what White Plains Charlie well he would come in there and go Joe you ain't gonna believe this they got me at the track again I'm down and I was I was like at the time maybe 22 23 years old yeah so the whole thing to me was just completely baffling that's like wow this guy's out of his fucking head for sure this is crazy like you just can't stop gambling I've never seen anything like it I know a good poker guy like that is though they can't stop can't stop they get sweaty hands I was completely addicted to playing that quake game honey where's now quantum percent I loved it loved it loved it up to hours and hours a day didn't if you were talking and I was listening to you talk and you were born the shit out of me but like why am i spend time doing this when I could be playing quake and my time would be awesome as always really yeah I would not want to talk to people I would want to sit in front of the computer with the headphones on because you can hear like who's walking on the right-hand side over like footsteps on the right footsteps on the left you have to you have to creep because if you walk you don't make any noise but if you want to jump if you want a strafe jump if you want to run you make noise yeah and I would get a date to do wander down hallways rocket launcher and people in the heads fun as far I've been lost in video games before tears I had a behavior the real problem is doesn't make you ultimately feel like you got anything done like if I put the same amount of effort into making podcasts or the same amount of effort in so I doing stand-up I feel like you got something done mmm you know but if you're just out there fucking throwing squares with numbers around yeah you know what are you doing what are you doing you playing cards what are you doing nothing actually happening yeah you playing quake I fucking killed everybody nothing really happened no okay you just got you just got jolted DT nothing was really created in eight hours yeah you basically gave all your time you know to this to this artificial experience and you know you got an adrenaline rush out of it it was a lot of fun it was great but but ultimately nothing was created where's like if you took that same amount of time and you decided I'm gonna draw a picture I'm gonna paint something I'm gonna write a song like an actual physical thing manifests itself that people can enjoy or fucking rocket launchers it's lightning bolt guns and shit gunning people down hail oh yeah I don't get anything out of that it's weird that your game Halo used to be I tried to I I step away I literally forced myself not to get on game systems that much anymore because I would I would do that and I would do Madden and n-c-double-a mad fuck supposed to be awesome oh very Madden college one I play I was I like college ball a lot I would play you could create a player you start your team and then play a season did you make white guys win I would make my would make fucking Tom for 340 yeah of course I know you'd give a ridiculous power absolutely I'd be like Vikings 3 to 30 just fuckin yoked yeah absolutely just Vikings Vikings an army of broccoli I wouldn't play the fool I would say I would play I would do the spring thing spring ball and then play fucking 12 games season the conference game and the in the bowl game and then recruit players for that you can recruit and recruit them for the next year and fucking I played you know 14 games in a row and I'm like holding on for the next season to start and this is like in one sitting well yeah it's it's hours and hours oh it's not good man like well that's the same thing with poker too right I mean when people start playing poker don't they disappear absolutely and the guy's the guy that I know that that that does it the most like not only you disappear doing all that behavior but it's also fucking losing his livelihood you know like like shit fucking down 500 today hard cuz hard to make a living playing poker you mean you got to be super good you mean all props to those Daniel Negreanu type characters that have been able to fill IV and all these guys of it you like here I don't play it I don't like cards it's not that I don't like cards it's just it's not something that I'm interested in doing because when I was a kid and I would play pool the card games would always interrupt the pool action oh really and everybody like Jesus Christ is this a card place or a pool hall yeah but guys that would you would normally get bets with they wanted to go gamble cuz that's all pool halls were about all pool halls were about was like hobby people who were into just knocking balls around with their friends who never got good and then either tournament players or gamblers yeah and so the tournament players are usually both tournament players and gamblers so there's always gambling unless of asshole came around with a deck of cards because you can't you don't you can miss when you're playing pool you know you can miss you can hit play on a Gaffey table or the pockets are weird and this guy might know the table better than you do so he knows what spots to avoid but with poker you can't eat there's no missing it is you're really gambling you're just gambling you know you're using your intelligence but you're also gambling I don't get poke I'm of the mind for it men I'm really not full CTO coconut water thank you very much I'm not into it man the fee emanated by numbers and I'm intimidated by just like the game itself never been seems like an awesome game it seems like a real absorbing game though it seems like a very like you have to really be a bad motherfucker to understand the in and outs of poker and to have like you know years and years of intuition I mean those are special dudes they obviously have special Minds just for me my my I was always so absorbed with things that required execution physical execution as well as like mental and that's why I like quake because it was like this hand-eye coordination thing that was what I was getting my rocks off on and that's the same thing with pool so to me it's like it was always a physical thing as well as a mental thing I felt like the real the real thrills to me well when I can combine the two things together when I could combine a physical experience and a mental experience that's why I like jiu-jitsu that's why I like playing pool so the card thing was lacking the physical part there was no execution I didn't have to execute so that was it was like way less exciting I was like you can't compare the difference between when you watch the guy gambling and he's gambling for $10,000 to set a nine ball in every fucking pocket he's put his hands on his shirt and blowing on his hands and putting talcum powder on he's sweating and he's trying to keep it together you're trying to like really gently control how a ball spins and collides with another ball and you know make sure that you hit it just enough so that lands perfectly for the next one all while you're gambling you know I mean that's what's exciting when you're sitting there with cards and you know what card to pick stupid just pick the fucking card yeah it's like you when you don't win it's like it's not the same loss right you guys shoots your nuts in in a game of pool I give you playing 10-year plan to race to ten and he breaks and runs out ten games on you you lose you don't even get a chance to play like that can't happen that has happened really not to me but it has happened in the past ten in a row you'd run though things happened more than once there was one guy who did it for a million dollars yeah they had a insurance policy to see who could run if you could run 10 racks in a row which had never been done in the competition before you could win a million dollars it'd only been done like a couple of times like Johnny Archer ran 10 and out on Francisco Bustamante they were gambling and that was like a legendary story because Francisco Bustamante doubled the bet after Johnny Archer ran tenant out on him who's like this guy can't keep this shit up yeah doubled the bat and then in the next game which is really nuts huh and then the other one was this Earl Strickland guy who they had this ten rack thing where they were insured for a million bucks but the insurance company didn't want to pay because they couldn't believe it had been done they couldn't believe like they they found the statistics no one had ever broken ran out 10 racks ever in any you know modern 9-ball tournament that they can have on record so they said listen I don't think it's much of a gamble bet ability a million dollars if someone does it they win a million dollars Earl Strickland did the first fuckin tournament they had yeah I think it was the first it was either first a second he broke and ran ten racks like a Damon fired in combinations on the nine ball I mean was ridiculous shit was like movie shit I think they denied him I think he wound up settling but he never got like the full Megan I don't really think you like a quarter million bucks or something like that I hope I'm wrong but he's like one of the greatest players of all time and and you know and he Gamble's - he does like those action challenges there's action port matches where they they have on line they'll have like just two guys playing for like twenty five thousand bucks them yeah like put up the money and then they'll they'll have like a gambling contest you ever played what's the other one called like snooker snooker no I've never played that same principle but smaller well it requires some incredible fundamentals you there's more room for error in a game pool than there is in snooker first of all because a nine ball like the chosen gambling game nine ball the balls are all wild so what that means is if you miss the one ball in the corner pocket but it spins around and lands on the side it still counts you just you keep going when snooker I don't think that would ever count I think snooker is like very precise you know I think you know and you have to move balls I don't really totally completely understand it and the tables fucking huge and the balls are tiny and the pockets are tiny as shit and there's certain ways we shoot it it doesn't accept the ball the same way it doesn't a pool table like I don't think you can cut a ball down the rail the way you can on a regular pool table so it's it's a little bit of a different sort of a game but snooker players notoriously are good at pool they like some like the top world snooker players like these English guys can kill Steve Davis yeah these these guys are awesome snooker players like world you know world champions they come over to pool then eventually they start Ronnie O'Sullivan and eventually I start fucking up the Americans really takes time yeah well the Americans is um this is like a few high-level guys but the European guys have such a strong team man it's like there's so many guys like the the Americans might have like the best guys of all time like Johnny Archer one of the best guys of all time girls trickling when the best guys of all time Shane Van boning one of the best guys of all time and one of the best guys right now but Europe is like there's so many fucking players that are killers really so many pool is huge over there man it's weird how many good guys in Asia they say in Asia like there's parts of Asia where pool is fucking enormous the Philippines especially it's enormous like you go there it's like one of their most that were there like number one or this behind soccer I think I think it's soccer they're the Philippines in the soccer does that make sense there's a baseball what am i my cricket maybe no we're just making shit up bocce no well I mean I slip and slide I'm amazed by how sports like culturally evolved well also how certain places like so love a sport and do not give a fuck about another sport yeah like cricket would be a great example of like it's big in some of the islands it's huge in India Pakistan Australia's right I mean that shit is like this is a gambling game it's not why it's big I don't know if it's a gambling game but like you watch it I'm like out of the fuck's going on and clearly nobody in this country who's not from one of those countries like nobody goes I don't know their goals yeah it's it's I think it's difficult to follow like you see the the number you're like in what it's like a five day game you know you don't understand why they're so ass yeah I do cocaine I just I can't get into it but you know the same thing only billiards soccer football like those are it's very regional specific well I think you get into a game and then once you get into it you understand the skill behind it and then that's what you you know that look it's so weird and people willing to fall into things so on just look at the way baseball uniforms look like what the fuck are you dressing like why do you have to dress like that for this stupid game you're dressing like you live in a different century what kind of stupid button-up shirt are you wearing what the fuck is with your socks what the fuck is with your tight pants if you were just a regular dude walking around those pants in the street I'd say get the fuck away from my kids but because you're playing some silly game you have to dress like a pilgrim this is ridiculous this game's retarded beyond belief yeah I know it needs to be revamped it's like one step away from a pirate's fucking up it's ridiculous and it's a ridiculous game it just fucking boring a shit it takes too long I can't do it can't do it I liked it I liked playing it when I was a kid and when you liked playing it you underst and with the skills involved in you know hitting a 94 mile an hour fastball or fucking really skilled yeah catching a ball that's like over the fucking top of the wall yeah but who cares yeah I don't I don't like baseball I like football but by far my favorite sake women's softball sports are awesome I'll tell you what man anything that's hard is awesome anything where you get into it and you try to express yourself and you know and show your your ability to concentrate and focus through a ball or through whatever the fuck it is that you're doing in any sport I love watching it I love watching competition I love watching I love watching people but payoff like hard work paying off sure that's like to me I want to see that shit all the time even tennis I don't give a fuck about tennis but I watched some tennis the other day I just watched it I was like whoa that guy's really trying to hit that ball and he's really trying to get always really close impressed I don't really give a fuck what's going on yes it's not my thing but if I was a tennis head instead of a pool head yeah it's the same thing it is I could have easily gotten hooked on tennis or baseball or golf this is a fucking era a golden era for tennis - is it bad motherfuckers playing really fuck yeah I mean who's that guy the guy that beats arena and the other one was whether the other Williams named Venus yeah Venus and Serena he beat them both really and after he played he played golf drank beer and then played one one seven two one or whatever the fuck this really yeah beat them both yeah I don't know I'll do that anyway I'll do it I'll pull it up then it's a famous case Federer is you know like just amazed like you look at his he's like you're the all-time best right all right good by far yeah in a song he's he's like they could put him up there with McEnroe in his prime yes guys oh he definitely incredibly dominates people that's amazing and he's been doing it consistently now for just years men and the dolls also up there and what's his name just retired Roddick and everybody was like if his peer class wasn't so good he would be he would have won so many more titles but he just happens to be around and in this era of like so many just absolutely dominant tennis players yeah I don't follow it enough but I would assume that that's just the case with everything right now right i mean like summit is in the case of basketball towns here's an example of one where it's not like the heavyweight boxing division so people say this is just the an era where it's not as as competitive and as big there's not as many big exciting fighters so you know we don't talk about right now as being the most exciting time and I mean you know boxing in general is taking a dip but like people have always been drawn to the heavyweight division of boxing you know it's the most it's the one that that people always like big you know so the heavyweight boxers right now you know again the Klitschkos the Klitschkos pretty much owned it I mean part of that you could argue hey they're not American so Americans get excited about American heavyweights basically and those guys have been dominant they're not American but you know the division pretty much has a lot of journeyman and they go up and they give it a shot and sometimes the belt switches hands but it's pretty much glitch goes to to run through and people don't talk about this as like wow this era right now you know heavy yeah ox or it's not a great era it's not a great era no no sounded like a Holyfield or Lennox Lewis yeah and there's been this and then like another guy would pop up you know bow would pop in and you build oh shit who's this guy and it's weird the two white guys are running shit to White Russian dudes who are doctors this run and shit I'd say I went to this I went to this boxing gym and in Glendale and I was a guy there who like trained a bunch of them and he said basically like those guys they train like alright a thousand right crosses like yeah they're willing to do some shit and like if I'm on offense enough they're like start that shit over and so like technically every punch is always exactly like executed yeah like never off you watch them it's just like it's perfect execution and it's not exciting before anybody has a chance to get good they nip them yeah go get them quickly it's as soon as a guy becomes you remotely into contention go ahead and the guy the the trainer guy was like he's he's foreign so he has this heavy accent and he's like telling me about like different he's like now if you ever fight with a Mexican you know they're like dogs are just going to fight fight fight fight okay I was like do you tell everybody that right it's like but it's fuck - it's such that foreign mindset really this is no this is how it is just racism is it and just like it's like he's like de he's like you got to take a Mexican down because they'll never stop fighting and I'm like II think right and then he's like the blacks oh please just great you're like okay yeah what was he like fighting black I know he was like they're just that you know like he's like - talking about Floyd he was just like you know um technically just had fantastic puncher like oh yeah Floyd Mayweather does everything perfect perfect but on top of that has out-of-control reflexes skill improvising skills and he spends trained perfectly I mean yeah brother Roger you know I mean it's on Roger Roger Mayweather was a fantastic boxer his dad was a good box about Victor Ortiz yeah that was the best soundbite ever from 24/7 that thing was so ridiculous that I fight that fight was so ridiculous he sucker punched that dude yeah guys look at the referee he's like bitch we still fightin crying yeah blam we're devotees though - he's a silly bitch just so and then he kind of gave it up but then like we talked about what's his name I like the way Victor Ortiz fights aw man that guy's crazy yeah he's a tough he just messed up he just made an error yeah you know what's the Filipino I came to think right now uh Karen said who's the mini backyard Pacquiao um why you call it the Filipino uh when the greatest boxers I dislike though his name may be my greatest think about accomplishment but he you know tech like he leaves the ground like yeah oh yes roses legs hit his punches fucking powerful ooh he hit so hard a lot of his power comes from his legs he's a powerful dude Manny Pacquiao is a fucking murderous puncher he when he fought um fucks his name the duty broke both his eye sockets it margarita yeah tell you know yeah the guy who was disgraced for using plaster and his knuckles yeah yeah boy he paid that price karmically he paid that price man cuz Pacquiao beat his fucking eyes and he beat his eye so bad they had to replace the lens in his eye with an artificial lens oh my god yeah i'ma fight again yup man fuck yeah I did yeah he got back in there Jesus Christ got back in there fought Miguel Cotto and Miguel Cotto was one of the guys who he beat or they suspected they did something to his gloves because he's fucked too dude up like murderously fucked him up and he never really did that with anybody like he was just knocking motherfuckers out cold Cotto no no Margarito bar before they found the plaster in his gloves cuz he did it to Kota though right didn't he did either Cotto he did the first time the second time Cotto stopped him yeah but it was I think it was undercut or some shit that stopped him but Margarito couldn't couldn't really hit his heart after they caught him with the plaster yeah that was scary shit to think that a guy was like making his career he put rocks in his gloves what a what a mean dickhead yeah is that he's totally cheating yeah and getting away with it and giving you like definitely fucking more aggravated brain damage than you would be getting yeah I mean he's hitting you with fucking casts in your face yeah like that's really shaking up the inside of your head there was a fight during that I think it was the 80s where a guy had pulled Panama Lewis had pulled the stuffing out of a guy's glass I remember that and was this kid I believe the kid's name was Louis resto the boxer and then the other one was Billy Collins I think it was I forget I forget what the guy's name was but the poor kid had like ended his career and the because you just got bare-knuckle he dies away he crashed into a tree they think he committed suicide and the guy Panama red was Panama Lewis Louis was was was suspended like years the fighter I don't think he ever fought again and he denied any you know wrongdoing until a few years ago and he he gave it up on camera really yeah yeah the boxer would like which fight about the the fight that you're talking about but they found that right away though but the box the guy that was guilty of like the guy who Panama was training yeah I believe it was Louie resto he he denied it was like I didn't you did not that that he didn't know exactly like it right accidents that's silly new a family the first punch it through his family always had his back like they're like you know it wasn't it wasn't him and then on camera with his family there he is like now I know what I did oh they're just devastated yeah that's a terrible terrible terrible thing to live with man that's not just cheating that's like oh that's horrific man you basically you know you ruined the guy's life yeah you did ruined a guy's life a guy who was really good at competing under set of rules and you just fucking totally hijack the whole thing on TV you stupid fuck yeah on TV beat a guy up with no padding in your gloves that's unreal so you just bare-knuckle crazy you cheated you cheat an asshole isn't it crazy that you still get all these guys every single year in every sport that all still cheat cheat and you know the Olympics they took some I forget some somebody's medal was you know one guy had marijuana in his system oh really yeah the motherfucker had weed in the system yeah some ski or some shit that's not ski here I can see I saw someone got kicked off the team for weed well judo oh there was a judo guy yeah - judo guy who got kicked off see this performance enhancing shit you're like how are you still like you know they're gonna come after you men there's a lot of different shit that people are doing that they've got away with in the past I think and they're slowly starting to clamp down on that thing and fucking Armstrong will desire is it well the crazy thing about Armstrong is he's only done by this one like it's an American thing that's gone after United States anti-doping whatever the fuck is yeah but that has nothing to do with the Tour de France so when they say that he doesn't have the the eighth Tour de France notice I say France yes sophisticated I've been to the airport in body shalt not dock but when they that they're saying that I'd like that he lives there they do I thought so because I mean everything that I saw was he was stripped of his yeah I heard that he was stripped by these people that they don't recognize it yeah but I don't know if he's necessarily stripped by the the whoever the fuck puts on the Tour de France definitely did what they said he did you think so laughs yeah Tommy gun's one and hundred percent I do not believe in these witch hunts for for like people that are essentially like heroes and super like nobody accuses um you know Michael Jordan of having done this nobody a clique accuses you know Joe Montana of having done this they do it because it's there his teammates have all come come clean about it they've also we all did this shit everybody and then when you finally have your chance you finally have your chance to be like this is the last he's like you know what enough is enough really enough is enough that's the I'm just tired of fighting this fight well you have a chance now this is your fine this is the like the the final lap of the of the race this is when you go I'm just you know what the man at some point just placement in his defense he's been defending it for years give up and let them dislike take your name and well you're do you know that he has passed and I'm just playing devil's advocate here but do you know that he's passed like 500 drugs yes I do I do but why why is there a witch-hunt to get somebody like that I don't I don't I don't live with it this is what what gets me you ever see a dude is like killed his wife and he's on the he's on the news and they're accusing him of of you know like why'd you do it why'd you do it and he's like I didn't didn't do anything like that is not how you would react if your wife was killed and they were dragging you off yeah and you were innocent you would be freaking the fuck out you know you lot what happened you lost your loved one yes you're a crazy person you're a crazy person that they caught doing something yeah um so but like you you think that they would go after him though if he if there wasn't any evidence to support that I don't know like like how I'm saying like do you like for Lance right like I mean I don't know what they can do I mean I think once he's passed the drug test he passed like 500 fucking drugs there there buddy button but here's the thing where's the evidence what do you have do you have any of his blood and you can run it through a machine and find some shit that we didn't find before is that if you don't have that then what are you doing I think they do they probably have but if they do have that that would be no they would have said they had that if they do have that they would have put that shit in the news they would tell you what it is it's not something that can keep secret they have some sample because some sample was referenced with some sample reference because he tested positive for EPO wasn't that I feel like you got a tested positive something but what whatever the fuck it is you would you should have either got him back then or you need to let it go and realize that now with your new super sophisticated methods of testing he might not pass those tests before but guess what he did yeah let's fucking move on yeah well no leave the guy alone ruin his life because he did exactly what everybody else did he just was better at it because that's what happened so but they will have to run you gotta be you have to assume that he's a real motherfucker here's my question on that why did they why does he have to tell anybody that he was if they were all doping okay and that's what we're assuming that's the case we're assuming that everyone at the top of the list and by the way a lot of the doping does not necessarily even have to be unhealthy like the blood transfusion so that's not unhealthy blood doping is not unhealthy it just is an inordinately you have a much more easy way of producing oxygen you you can process oxygen better that's why being dehydrated is so bad for your cardio it's like one of the most important things for you know outdoor exercise well that was um I think that was a fuck how would how would they describe it it's um I just don't think any of them can achieve the highest level without doing at least some of that if it's not blood doping yeah if it's not taking EPO if it's not taking you know some fucking the roots that boost your testosterone that are legal today but won't be legal in six months from now and they find out about it there's a it seems like if everybody is doing it at the top of the list after all those guys on his team got busted yeah I can only make sense that he could do it too right so I just think that for me the assumption that I make and I again I realize that I'm not privy to any of the like evidence or information but the assumption that I make is if all these guys say he did it that he worked with all his former teammates division associates everybody says that and then the the doping organization see is so adamant about pursuing it like what why why would you do this if there's nothing there where are you trying to get they like Pete generally that doesn't happen people don't go after somebody just because do you think that's because like prosecutors sort of get a wild hair across their ass they're like we're gonna go get this guy and then it becomes a competition they could be it that's that's definitely possible and they get they get you know they that that obviously happened like in that Duke Lacrosse case where the the the prosecutor there was like he made a fuckin show of it like we're gonna with before even like reviewing what like the information and the evidence right and then he paid a huge price because he was boasting and trashing them before they even got in a courtroom and ended up fucking losing his license to practice but I think part of that what he did before was from that charge he got of like I'm gonna put these these rich entitled kids a fucking in their place watch this right now and then it came back to bite him so yeah I think there is part some of that people going after the big name but I just don't see I don't see them trying to do this to him for no reason I just don't say I agree with you but I don't know what the reasons are if you felt like if the guy passed that many drug tests yeah I mean is if and if everybody was doing what he was doing if that's what they're saying what's he just was he just better in spite of the doping was if everybody was doping it was the best he's that he's a super talented actor clearly he's unbelievably disciplined yeah so if you're telling me they all doped yeah is that isn't that not a level playing field man it's like the baseball argument they're saying this is like the asteroid whatever era yeah because like at first it was like a few guys and then a few more and then you're like hold on did everybody just juice for like this or ten-year period right and it's looking like a huge percentage where it's not even news anymore right when you find out that like all that all the big all the big superstars did it you know yeah it's great all the home run records were broken in that era when you look at Mark McGwire now and you hear him talk about it and you see here no I just like broke down when he was described here what he did you look at the best is when you see like when he was like in Oakland a bash brothers era and you see him and he's like you know he's like 6 4 and he looks like a fucking pencil dude I did a TV show with him did you really he was another episode of hardball back when he was really skinny super thin he was young this is the pre HGH days he turned into a gorilla he just went crazy we got working out but but look at the dividends man all of a sudden he's just playing over rising balls just boom and then but bonds to and you saw her Canseco higher it seems right even in his giant shit it's looking to him how big Canseco was yeah he's a monster dude I was walking I was working rather in the Boston Athletic Club when I was 19 and Canseco was in town he needed somewhere to work out and they must have been staying close to the Boston Athletic Club so they came down and worked out and that guy walked through the door I was like Jesus Christ like on TV with their silly 1860's outfits on they don't look that big yeah when that guy walked through mic he's like 300 pounds he's a fucking huge he might not have been 300 but he was like well over 250 he was enormous the I remember the first time when I was like holy shit at the size of some like fucking humans yeah was I was in high school and I played in high school football like two hours north of Miami I went with a friend of mine on like a recruiting trip with like his trip down to the University of Miami and we're standing on the field and the players run out of the tunnel and I'm looking at dudes in their chest like I'm standing at looking at the numbers and I'm like holy fuck I could never play gets guys like this like dudes that were like six six 330 and I was like these are fucking animals running around man do people like that exist just a hundred years ago I don't think so one of the reasons when I think they might have liked every now and then there was a guy that was the the heavyweight champion his name was Primo Carnera it was a like legit giant he was fucking enormous but like the best guys and see how big Primo Carnera was I think he was the biggest heavyweight champion ever I think up until like at least like modern times because I think there was some fucking giant Russian dude recently yeah that was even bigger than that yeah but uh I think this guy lived in like the the 50s I believe it was yeah he lived until 1967 so he was a seven foot one oh my god oh my god oh no no no no no okay now this guy's six-foot-seven the Russian guy that I was talking about is 7 foot fought one his name Nikolay value of he's seven foot one holy shit so these guys were giants back then but Carnera was only six foot seven that's still a big motherfucker yeah Jesus yeah up until that time he was a tallest heavyweight in history and I think today like what are the Klitschkos you're like six six yeah you know what his name sucks in dudes yeah they like the same size so this Primo Carnera but back then he was like a like a freak yeah I did um was it I did this fundraiser he was 275 pounds this guy was naturally any any uh that that was like by the way the biggest size of any athlete yeah through like the eighty like in the 80s like I remember that like lineman in the NFL were 275 280 and in and every team would have like a 300 pounder and you be like holy shit they got a 300 pounder on the team and now the entire line what the fuck is that is that human growth hormone what is that is that steroids in the beef I don't it's not is that what that is it's entered now everyone's 320 330 what's happening is it selectively growing what is it is is cellphones is it this is the first couple of generations we really understood nutrition made sure the kids have vitamins growing up and they grew to their full potentials that would it is part of it is that I bet that has I deal a lot with it right I think that is part of it yeah and also but now you have this thing where it's like you're they are can like there's more education on just you know like fridges and sports everybody has like you can be like hey I want to be this wait we're gonna program you need fucking 300 grams of protein a day and you need 5,000 calories yeah to do this type of workout and you're going to fucking swell up you know you can actually set that goal and somebody can tell you pretty much manufacture it like in knowing their their science this is what you need to do to if you want to obtain that so you can execute that you know right but back then they just be like a fuckin oh yeah there's definitely that like you definitely put on more size now than ever before but what I'm saying is that the actual number of giant humans has increased it's not just like the ability to put muscle on it's like the size of people is just it's more common to see these Primo Carnera guys in athletics today these six-foot-seven just naturally gigantic human beings huge like that's so that's more common today it just is so what the fuck is that why is it more common why is there two Klitschko's there's two giant six-foot six guys or boxing everybody up these two giant Russian dudes you know just think about how many of those guys existed itis how many how many giant human beings are out there there's a dude who fights in the UFC Stefan Struve he's fucking 7 feet tall man kids seven feet yeah yeah I don't know if he's 25 7 feet tall ok no the world is not designed for you and you're seven feet do then he's giant Semmy Schilt he's another one 7 feet tall she's giant kickboxers Jesus Christ where the you know this and I guarantee you kids that are coming up today the kids that are growing up and they're gonna be you know coming to fruition or coming to a full height rather within the next decade they're gonna be even more giant and so people are gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger till we start morphing you know we start supergiant we're gonna be giants there's no doubt about it man well as soon as they figure out a way to engineer the body selectively we're going to figure out what's the optimum size you can be and people are just going to grow to that size now you write that like a hundred years ago there was not a fucking bunch of six six 300-pound people do you know how much the average soldier weighed in the Civil War how much 125 pounds yeah they were tiny little dudes Tommy has a fifth grader yeah that is not the same type of human being that we have today because people were malnourished is everybody's catching fucking diseases is shit all for everything babies are dying nobody knows how to wash their hands right it's a mess there was a mess those are tiny ass little people those people who lived in the 1800s or tiny ass little people now we just have gargantuan and they're getting bigger there's Shaquille O'Neal dudes I did a fear factor which colonial and I have I stand dick height I'm just cool deal he's a he's a grown man I'm a grown man his dick is in my face I mean he's just so different than me just a great quote yeah I'm standing next to him we and we do a countdown it's hilarious because it's me you know I was like Shaq count him down he goes three two one go and you know the people go and do their stunts it was really cool cuz he liked the show so it was fun like having him co-host with me for a day sure but it's just so ridiculous I'm like a little child standing next to this giant super nice guy though Jonathan Ogden offensive tackle six eight like three forty played it and his hand he just like he just held to my little fingers it was like nice to meet you and you can like just squeezed a couple fingers I realized my hand couldn't even like get around like even simulate a handshake yeah he also like had a conversation with somebody like as I was talking to him like down here um I guess so it's cool to me he's like yeah man so this other day and I was like I'm down I'm like then I was like hey man like a kid like when your kid walks up to you and they're talking to you're talking to another you're I just hold on and you're talking good doll and they're like but daddy and you're like just hold on and you just talk over them I did that to me like I was a child oh I just looked up at him I was like it's nice media he like patted the top of my head yes don't go about your business it was not like a human though it was a fucking superhuman yeah it's amazing the variance you know how much how much people vary and in the height and you know size like that but yet we're still in the same species yeah but garlic Shaquille O'Neal's like it's such an extreme version of it like a huge friendly guy though super super nice guy yeah Mike Goldberg did a whole season of Shaq vs. with him oh yeah he did a bus goal she like goes go box Oscar De La Hoya and you know it was kind of funny did a bunch of different things I am you know do you know the other comic Bruce Bruce you know yes he's big dude big enormous guy not that tall but right like 300 plus pounds right i sat next to him on a flight did I tell you this already no and I'd never met him before and I recognized them so I was like hey man like you know I'm a comic and he was like oh yeah he's rich super fucking nice and he's just they're just this big giant looking can I guess where this store goes where sleep apnea no okay no it's so you know ten minutes and he's a fly he's got braids so we get we get delayed and first of all we're flying LA Atlanta and then I'm

him let these massive theatres and I was like Mike Epps is a funny fucking dude like just a naturally funny guy cuz we're just like talking oh yeah yeah it's like you know that guy just turned any situation fun he's like yeah but ain't no motherfucker funnier than Andy Griffith and I was like what like what'd you just say he's like Andy Griffith I was like are you not Eddie Griffin right are we talking to Andy like the whistle huh yeah he's like oh man I'm like are you serious right now he's like you've been to Andy Griffith Museum I'm like what kind of question is that manly like what kind of question and he's like oh man they got the like the the car from the from the show you can you can sit in the car they have like a set but like what the kitchen needs to show the kitchen you can go there you get all the Anna Griffin shit you ever want I'm like are we in the real world right now he loves any good man he I was like I don't think I like anything as much as you like Andy Griffith he's I love Andy Griffith and I was like clearly and he knew he was like uh you know I'm not exaggerating he's like you know there's two UH black actors that ever appeared on The Andy Griffith Show and I was like wow he's like one was uh February 8th 1963 why the role of Tony are you saying the right Dana sound I'm making update but he let these people know all right he knew the day I can hear sup in Google he knew the exact date and he knew the role and the episode and then he's like the other one was April 19th 1968 and that was when remember when they couldn't find a male I'm like not I have not seen he said what the fuck remember when they couldn't find like mail so I guess were to god I was like oh he's like Andy Griffith is a shit man I was like Andy Griffith real Andy Griffith shuckin loves Andy Griffith man Wow Wow there's a lot of people that are like they pay homage to the classics yeah like this dudes who really get into like old movies and yeah he shows and I mean I've met like super fans of some things we don't expect but that for me was so out of left field I saw Carol Burnett the other day you did Dan just look good she looked good telling me I mean I think the lady is in her late 70s mm-hmm she look very healthy she Milan laughs were talking to people she that show was great yeah it was great it was interesting we were talking about this the other day like there was like a big wave of women run shows back in there in the day with a woman was a star that was liver and surely there was Mary Tyler Moore there was road there was mod member mod you know and then there's mod and then there's mud Matt on Maude I remember that those uh those a show that was like a big popular show and then there was the older lady he used to be a model ran the newsroom the fuck was that oh yeah yeah yeah wearing a brown Murphy Brown that boring ass hypnotic what did they do to get people to watch that show for all those years what what kind of long hypnotism Pro Rosa Eddie run I was him yeah I've yeah there was a gang of them but I mean that did the era of Carol Burnett was like there was a lot you seal ball there was a bunch of them there's a bunch of them like really strong women comedian presences yeah it's like that has changed quite a bit now like the role that women have on these like you know you have like girls like Chelsea who have their own show you know but it's like her personality it's not like a like her being the head of a sitcom right then there's Whitney Whitney who had a show that people didn't respond to that well but then people said well it's gonna be tweaked and they're gonna figure it out but she but genuinely people seem to like her she just has to find like the right vehicle right right how many of them are there these days is not it's not like it used to be yeah well especially well also where they need to you know where they're getting their shot you know I mean like you know like how many how many people are getting the opportunity to have their show you know yeah is the because the talent they're still talent talent out there like you know there's definitely talented comics female male comics out there but they have to get a shot to get their show that seemed to be like that was an overdrive in that era that you're talking about yeah like if you were of women look good yeah of women but also I think just comics too like there was there's an era of pushing the comic to get the show and here's the thing that's funny they when you like why how come let that many stand up let's say have a show right now right right like having looks like Peyton extension of the the comic you look back on that era and all of those shows were hits like the stand-up where the comic was elite a lot of those were hits me yeah there was a few bombs though I was I saw I was there for view yeah but there's a watched a fuse I was part of a few that was it but I had my own sitcom you did I lit for NBC once yeah I was called overseas I don't even think it ever aired anywhere even has a pilot you shot the pilot oh yeah but super super expensive pilot but the the thing about like those development deals they try to do it stand-ups is that they would just throw a bunch of money at a comic and then get a bunch of like you know writers that supposedly had some success on other shows and throw as much shit against the wall and see how much of it sticks yeah you know and I think that it's it's real hard for you to take the one thing that you're fucking awesome at which is stand-up the one thing that you really can completely express yourself you're uncensored you're you you're producing it you're directing it nobody's interfering with your vision of how the jokes should play out and there's a big give a scene that and being on set concept and then that difference is it there's a it's really fun beyond good sitcom it's terrible being on a bad sitcom it's terrible yeah and it's not as Moe is not as much fun as long as rewarding as doing stand-up it's just not you know for me at least yeah it's like it's fun doing like a cool sitcom but if I had a choice between watching like the best sitcom ever or watching Richard Pryor do stand-up I want to watch Richard Pryor that's the best stuff the best stuff is stand up so it's like you do shit that's not as good as the best stuff and it's just because they're paying you to do it that was how I was feeling about it and that thing that you don't really love to do and that they're paying you to do takes all day then you don't have as much energy or time left over for the thing that you do love to do I can see that so the only reason why you should do it is to get exposure for your stand-up yeah which I hear like I mean some of the comics that really like doing comedy doing stand-up that's you know you generally hear them say is like it's just gonna drive more people to see my show yeah that's a newbie that's how it should be man that's how it should be it's the art of stand-up comedy didn't get any respect for a while in the 80s I think as an end destination because everybody was like you got to get a sitcom you got to get a sitcom that's what Jerry Seinfeld did do your risk I did your pilot in terms of like your career like I did in the middle of use radio a little while I was doing this radio yeah because it was the same producer so seed and that's shall spoil the shit out of me man because they were so good the writers were so good and they were crazy they would they were so nuts they wouldn't even start a script to like two o'clock in the morning sometimes and they would she would show up and it would be like taped day or rather a rehearsal day and we get like the first 30 pages and they're like we're the first five pages or whatever was like we're gonna give you the rest later and then scene two would come down at noon and they would shuffle down barefoot and slap it down they would go back and they would they would get to this state of sleep deprivation and come up with this really silly shit and I suspect it was because nobody had informed them about the benefits of weed really yeah I think I think if those guys were stoners they weren't stoners if those are guys were stoners what they did sober was brilliant you know well if they those guys were high they could have come up with the most silly and ridiculous show in the history of the universe how many seasons was that show up for five seasons five yeah that was longer than no it's just too short of syndication like the normal syndication length omit is in syndication oh it isn't but it's two to two episodes short we only did 98 instead of a hundred you're supposed to have a hundred so they can sell it yeah but it didn't become popular until after was canceled really yeah became popular when it would air on TV during like regular TV time like seven like an eight o'clock and a night and shit like that when he was syndicated and then people like this shows kind of fucking funny yeah just got monkeyed around back then man back in the day when when news radio was out nobody knew where the fuck you were if they moved you for like monday to wednesday you're done kid nobody knows the other thing like more to your point about the you know when you're just in charge of your stand-up yeah shows man you're talking about so many people are giving their input you know yeah the executive producer so I just like it so many people we should really do this we should really lose that yeah well I don't like it when you come out that way I don't I don't like it when you do that I don't like it when you oh stop please I don't care we can only do this one way yeah you know and I the only way I'm gonna get advices is from funny people I can't get advice for someone who's a business person so I just got to tell you that I think that approaching it this way when they give you a comedy note that's just like I had a conversation with a guy I was talking about a podcast because you guys have really nailed down your brand and I'm like oh that's gross like oh you're gross yeah that's the last thing we've done nailed down our brand oh yeah it's like you know I go what do you mean by then it's like well you know people know what kind of you know what you're putting out there it's like you know you've really like well defined your your brand mm-hmm yeah oh my god my brand what is that yeah fuck you talking about I love Village it's like showbiz talk well we're trying to right now we're working on his development deal but we just don't want to sign with anyone I really want to work on developing its brand yeah my brand you are you a bottle of ketchup you fuck define why do you need a brand sorry silly bitch if you're that defined and then you become a mobile you become locked into an emo Philips type character yeah magically emo Philips and Josh tries to do straight stand-up you like hey hey fuckhead why are you acting like you're pulling it up man weird up weirded up shithead what's this you just standing there tell me about butter okay get a move on I came to see your fucking funky act I love it man well if you're not gonna do it where's Judy Tenuta I want to see your weird shit yeah I'm here to see your you Journal dude you ever notice how do you go from doing that to trying to do just regular stand-up I only give him shit because I know he tells his opening acts not to swear oh really you know whoever from dude to vote I'm a time I don't know exactly I wasn't really there that could have been a bunch of bitter twats yeah but uh I remember who it was they said he got harassed for being too dirty opening for him man that sucks I might have been half fraud god I wish I remember who it was what happened to heifer I've had it to get him back in here man I've had it said passive-aggressively love half wrong for me you know opening for somebody like say fuck a lot huh you're like oh my and they're like oh no no no it's not a thing you're like you just made it a thing because you just hinted well the thing in in Boston they used to like always decide like headliners would decide who would open form and they would you know there get him out of here breaks the fuck meter it was like that was like the big thing they didn't want to go on and after anybody dirty yeah because if you wanted to have any sort of shock value to your comedy whatsoever but that just means your comedies are that good yeah that's how I always felt sure the best guys can go on after anybody it doesn't matter I seen yeah yeah it's just it's especially when people know who they are like I I got a chance to see Hedberg a bunch of times and I saw Hedberg in front of people who were fans and I got to
