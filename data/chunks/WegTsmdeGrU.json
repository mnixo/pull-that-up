the Joe Rogan experience and most of our lives you see we're dealing with a whole history of a species of structures of domination oppression that's the history of the species for the most part and there's moments in which there's breakthroughs in which there's a freedom of spirits and then you have some institutionalization of that which is democracy that's why democracies are so fragile and usually don't last that long because it cuts so rapid radically against the sense of really wanting to be free I mean those jet skis right most people really are afraid of freedom they want to defer to Authority they want to conform and when they're introduced to freedom and they really catch this whole they say oh my god it's tremendous cost to be paid but I like that there's something about that and they can hear it in the music they can see it in your comic art the priors and others and it allows these effects and consequences that people's lives to really enrich their lives before they die why do you think people are afraid of freedom well it's courage I mean there is no freedom without unbelievable unprecedented unstoppable courage and courage it's not widely distributed and the species conform they complacent they're complicitous they're cowardly they well-adjusted injustice and want to smile and walk around as peacocks rather than cut against the grain and have to bear witness and therefore end up on a cross or like Socrates condemned most of the great figures that we know yeah and there's more consequences for that now than ever oh yeah cancel culture that's exactly right yeah oh it's true it's very very true but I mean we live in a culture that's so corporatized commercialized marketized it's all about money money money status status status and you lose any deep sense of honour of character it's all about what appears to be the case it's the culture and superficial spectacle so it's all about image yeah you see yeah and image is just some surface phenomena for me everybody how did you do that you got tagged and I said but then again like I said it's a thinking man's game sorry I get hit from my point of view I made a mistake I switched the South Pole but instead of switching and stepping outside of his front leg I was right in front of his of his leg and he was just throwing a left right and I was walked straight into that and that's what that's what happened it's not that from our point of view that he timed that so it happened and from that moment I can do two things I can think okay I can jump into the fight you're trying to get that point or whatever in that moment back or just thinking my mind like okay fuck it you lost this round take it and let's go fresh into the second that's what I did so just think about okay I lost this round but I got four more to go and I got back into the corner and my choice hey you back so yep okay he's tired now yeah when he tried to unload on you he emptied out a lot of gas tank when you had you hurt yeah yeah so that's the game right trying to figure out when you can finish when you can check me yeah just stay focused stay relaxed and of course he with some some good shots but well he's a big powerful guy yeah he's always a dangerous fighter that guy's huge what is he like six nine six ten something like that yeah yeah then yeah it's huge in like 270 pounds of thing yeah that's so yeah now it's one one two come on man you beat me like six every year I beat you once unless yeah it was he had since then all right he won a tournament last year right so he set a few yeah so maybe their fight is gonna come but like I said now I'm in like last year the 31st of December my contract was finished with glory so we've been in negotiations ever since so from that moment on I said in my last contract you guys told me the about a fight was gonna happen and you it didn't happen so that's what I want first give me the butter fight and from that moment on we're gonna discuss [Applause]
