just get them out of the way we also brought to you by on it comm makers of alpha brain and new mood which I take both of them on a regular basis and the fucking awesome I support this not just because I'm making money from him because I if I wasn't making money from it I would still tell you to look into nootropics it's there it's a fascinating field of science really and it's all about chemicals and and and vitamins that enhance cognitive function I think they work differently on different people but for me I get a nice like good clear feeling out of taking these things and I don't believe it's a placebo you know there's there's there's evidence that it helps Alzheimer's patients when you give them like certain nootropics and I could actually can slow the onset of Alzheimer's most importantly though if you don't like this stuff you get a hundred percent money-back guarantee just say it sucked if you don't have to return it just say it sucked and you get your money back it's really that simple and if you like it but you think it's too expensive mine's what I say to you is please go buy the shit in bulk go and save yourself some money steal the ingredient list the website and just duplicate it I really did I hope you do that and I hope you enjoy it and I hope you look into the just the subject of nootropics I'm neither educated enough nor do I have enough time to go into depth enough and have it actually be interesting in a podcast you know I would maybe like to have some like scientist on explain brain chemistry to you know III but I couldn't do it obviously so the best I can say is go google it and look up nootropics and there's a bunch of different kinds and there's a bunch of different formulations that other people offer as well and a lot of them are really good I've tried Power Drive I think that's that's really good there's a bunch of different companies out there that sell similar stuff I'm not saying buy my stuff but if you want to buy my stuff you can buy it and go to on accom if you go to Joe Rogan neck click on the link for alpha brain and during the code name Rogan you get 10% off that ok or not whatever bro ok Jesus Merry Christmas hit that shit bitch Duncan Trussell is in the house ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan experience trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night I think that was one of the best commercials we ever did Duncan flowed seamlessly that has to be man I can't you just always say the exact same thing fucks it's too uncomfortable I feel like a big phony I was talking to Stanhope about that once man he said the worst thing is one like he like he goes to the UK and went to the UK and he saw the same people were in the same seat both nights they like really loud and they sat in the same scene in the second night they sat in the same seat but he's gonna do like most of the same material sure you know I mean you only have so much fuckin material and the art of stand-up comedy is to relay each piece of material as if it's really happening in your head right now you know but when someone just saw you the night before it's the exact same shit you know and he's like Oh makes you feel like such a fucking phony hate it oh when someone knows your shit as though it's flattering it's flattering they're just trying to flatter you they're trying to make you feel like we're superfans we're coming to see you two nights in a row well I do like I mean if they are super fans though I would like you know if Bill Hicks was in town in Boston I saw him two nights in a row I saw the same set twice in a row I wanted to I liked watching yes you get to see the nuances in the way they do it differently it's great but for a lot of people they don't want to see that but you know but I was a you know you're an open mic comic you know an amateur and you know a total comedy nerd you know the opportunity to see like a craftsman yeah I saw Richard Jeni a couple nights in a row - I saw a couple different guys a few nights in a row like I went to see them I saw Tom my rare a couple nights in a row you I wanted to see their their act over and over again I wanted to see how they did it and it's interesting man we you you see people's different reactions in different crowds like wow yeah why didn't that one work yeah this crazy this is weird I told you one of my favorite moments in comedies watching Bill Hicks bomb he bombed with the confidence and flare of a man who was crushing like it never bothered him like there's a lot of people who say it never bothered them but you can see this like fear or detachment in their eyes this panic look he never got it he never got a panic look he would bomb and as he was bombing he would talk the bombing and he was doing this bit where he went on after this other guy and this of the other guy that went up is a very nice guy but he's really hacky and he had like a bunch of like you know cartoons smoking pot jokes were do like a Daffy Duck smoking you know another guys it was one of those guys but he was a nice guy you know my point is he was killin this audience was monkeys there were Apes it was one of those dumb audiences and every now and then you get him you know in Boston you have some really educated people and then you have a lot of troll people too yeah yeah you got a lot of those well they did not like Hicks at all he came on like super confident and like real like slow and deliberate with his with the way he was putting his set out there you know and like real like just you know like you own the room you know and just would start doing his material and they didn't like it man and they were leaving in droves and he had this bit where Satan fucks John Davidson in the ass and he was like rotate people be John David's and it would be Oprah and and then he shits out Geraldo Rivera yeah and he's on that on the toilet shitting and he's making this shit noise for like man like two minutes which is a long time to just sit there and he's making this and he looks up and people are just leaving in giant groups his fuckin guards fuckin terrible fuckin gamble not funny at all after that last guy and they're leaving and Hicks looks up and I swear to God he wasn't even Fazio's you know this generally clears the room and just to me and my friends I think Fitzsimmons might have been there for that one to bring in my friends and 50 people it was fucking hilarious the bits were hilarious it was it was like so interesting it was it wasn't I'll be honest was not the funniest material that I've ever seen in my life it wasn't the funniest delivery but it was certainly the most thoughtful without a doubt it was a totally different kind of laughter I was experiencing I was experiencing a laughter and like fuck he just nailed it - it wasn't just laughter it was like wow that's an awesome point to just shove into a joke you know you know I mean yeah so wasn't like he was the funniest guy he you know if you compared him to like the guys that I knew growing like Steve Sweeney Steve Sweeney used to fucking crush I mean crush the point where you would be terrified to go on after him to follow a guy like Steve Sweeney in Boston when he's on Full Tilt when he goes up there just rabid and full of energy you're fucking doomed man he's just too good and it was hex wasn't like that it was a totally different kind of funny you know it was it was its own little thing man and it influenced a lot of people to sort of branch often into a more thoughtful direction you know yeah it's really cool when you see somebody who's got the balls to just say exactly what they're thinking on stage with zero pandering yeah that's not that's not gonna be that that can't be that kind of crushing comedy it's a dinner thing all together it's still super funny but you know my thing is dude I I like to sandwich it I like to shove it in between shittiness has no point at all just ridiculous and just the stuff that I think it's funny and it's usually it's just like gay jokes it's usually for whatever reason it's usually someone inadvertently sucking a dick or someone is sucking a dick for a reward my sense of humor is so fucking juvenile man I'm so childish and I actually thought like man maybe I got a problem like why am i such a child with like the stuff that I think is silly and funny you know like maybe there's something wrong with that and then I went to see Jim Norton and Jim Norton was in Austin and he had more dick jokes than me yeah and I said to him afterwards I go dude I was starting to think maybe I have too many jokes about dicks my ass and so what you see you I saw an hour's worth of dick jokes and I fucking thoroughly enjoyed it I'm like thank you that made me feel good because as a person like who was an audience member I saw it from an audience members perspective like oh it's just a big crazy silly ride and you go like it's not like you know you can't have so many jokes about dicks and also if you think it's funny then you kind of have an obligation to do it as a comic you think something's funny you should talk about it on stage because if you think something's funny you're like oh no no that's not highbrow enough I'm not gonna do that yeah another form of meandering that's yeah that's not it at all it's yeah exactly yeah if you have a joke about shitting your pants you're supposed to tell that joke yeah it's not supposed to be out - oh you're doing straddle logical material if you think it's funny that's a thing you if you're just doing it to get it shock out of people or you're doing out of laziness that's a whole different story well Ari Shaffir has been doing some bit that's been killing about he was in Australia and he got diarrhea it's a totally true story and it's fucking killing for him you know for someone to say that you're not supposed to do that it's funny it's really funny and it happened it's a real story you know - for you to say that there's something wrong well this for you to say that there's any kind of rule it's like telling an artist what you know you can't paint that was the right green that's that yeah if you come over someone's house like you have to really know that person before you talk about shitting yourself yeah it's a weird thing you know when you're on stage it's one thing right you're supposed to be exposing everything anybody and right but if you're you know you don't know someone they start talking about shitting off themselves yeah you come over here I need to talk to you about I'm cool with it you know it's like you're a good dude I guess you you seem like just an open dude and you're like how's the cheeseburgers and it's like well they're pretty good but listen the last time I had imma be honest we got shit all over myself I could even make it to the bathroom I would start laughing oh shit you think that's where it is I would have a normal conversation with you I wouldn't be like excuse me did you just say you shit on yourself why how dare you sir speak to me like such a scoundrel who are you yeah how dare you where do you get this confidence to come to me isn't that funny when you realize that you're a you're actually offending someone you realize that like this really is in some way something I'm saying is having an effect on you that's like causing you to shut down listen folks I know you've been programmed to think that you're the asshole when you're swearing and someone reacts like that but no no they're the asshole that's dumb it's 2011 yeah if you're really offended if someone talks to you about shitting their pants then you're the dummy you're the problem it's not the guy who's shit his pants that I was telling you a funny story okay you're just some weird stuck-up person who doesn't want to hear that well I'm you know like if I don't think something's funny and it's scatological I'm not gonna get offended I'm gonna it's not good enough funny it's not gonna bother me it's like whatever you're talking about shitting yourself fine I don't really it's not it's it doesn't bother me at some people they've never heard that stuff before comedians we we've been horrifying each other for yawns right you've horrified me in so many different ways you're really really good at taking a story that I already kind of know for example Grizzly Man the guy getting eaten by the bear so like you'll get me really high and then start talking about like yeah like what was the croisé grizzly man's name was timothy treadwell timothy treadwell and you start describing him getting eaten by a bear in this like precise microscopic way where you're like every moment you're describing the bones crunching and his femur snapping and like you're just really good at taking it like to the next level yeah yeah wait to come to werewolf us first you start talking about it you know when you're high I'm like you're higher like well fuck you're seeing it so clear I'm like I'm not gonna let I know what he's doing he's that he's gonna take this into the deep water in a second I'm not gonna let it freak me out and I still remember the Treadwell story I'm sure enough oh my poor Timothy Treadwell I could just see his bones turning into jelly and his eyeballs bulging out as he's screaming for the bear to stop attacking him but it won't anyway you're very good at that so after you've been hanging out with people who can professionally tell stories in the most detailed way then it's really hard to get around anyone who's gonna say anything that offends you and also the Internet by the way is also yeah it's like what's gonna I've seen every I've seen everything my favorite picture in the internet this is a strong same statement yeah that's true my favorite picture is there's a kid and he's standing in front of the goat see butthole and the guy's spreading his asshole open and it just says well welcome to the Internet yeah the kid is looking at that and I'm like yeah that's it exactly yeah you can't get you can't get upset by things anymore which is why it's kind of retro and quaint when you come upon someone you actually can get offended when you rise oh my god you can still get offended how do you maintain that that's amazing this I mean I really have the power to disturb you in a real way but you don't realize though you're not under the glove all day at work a lot of people are under the iron glove all day at work they're just stuck in an office where they're there all their behavior was restricted most of them even have to dress funny they have to wear like weird things around their neck to signify they mean business right and you're you're walking around in some office where everybody's stifled and you're all forced together today all day to do shit you don't want to do all day long you know that's that's not good so people are like buttoned down because of that where is you you're smoking pot and playing World of Warcraft you know trying to write some jokes you know and then we're gonna go on the road and we'll go to Chicago will do the Chicago Theatre January 27th and Joey Diaz yeah but you don't saying like that's your your world right you know you don't have like a shit job that you you know get up to every morning all right that's true that that's yeah so yeah I understand people are buttoned down and they've been conditioned and some it's too hard to just plus free you all the time and you're at work all day and yeah why can't we fucking talk yeah this is crazy its job sucks is ridiculous we gotta find another way to make money or like those fucking email forwards that those people send you know you get those email forts and it's like the worst what are the chickens say to the rabbit you shut the fuck up someone really said that you know my mom was brutal my mom was brutal with those I had to stop her I said I was really nice about it I was like jeez this is not that funny to me and by the way I don't want your friends sending me any crazy email so don't let's not link it off yeah please yeah he doesn't even know how a blind carbon copy she just copy copy she doesn't sent me one in a long time though but the one she did I would still just look back and I'm like oh Jesus Christ but what about this also when you get on those patriotic mailers oh those are brutal I've had a bunch of those countryís wants me know this is a story about a country and they just make things up yeah the thousands of terrorists acts that we prevented how about those could have wiped out humanity 17 times over but we're out there doing the dirty work they were stopped yeah there's a dog living in Georgia it always a party there's a dog whose master didn't come all those stories are great well you know what it would be beautiful if that really was the case could you imagine if you really had 100% faith in the US military and you knew that there was bad guys and we're the good guys yeah it's clean black and white there's no doubt about it we only do the right thing always like a great war whenever possible and we would never engage in war for profit like Ezard but that's what people like to think that like they'd like to think that that's what we are well it was like if every 50 years scorpions climbed out of the volcanoes of the earth and they were like poisonous and deadly and they shot lasers out of their eyes and they could like burn you alive and you met someone who's like I've made the decision to go down and fight the scorpions I'm gonna fight him I'm gonna give my life to fight these scorpions you would be like you are fucking here a hero that's a real hero amazing you're gonna go fight the laser shooting scorpions that's incredible now it's so muddied it's like well you know they don't even know a lot of them they don't even know what they're doing like well we're going to Afghanistan because um you know we're going down there cuz I you know Obama's not gonna veto this fucking this new bill the one that passed through the house passed through the Senate and the Congress apparently they oh okay that Obama's not gonna be told he turns the United States into a battle you mean indefinite detention yeah indefinite detention for United States civilians yeah doesn't have to you don't have to yeah you have to go to trial did you see the thing I didn't I was on reddit with McCain Rand Paul as McCain point blank does this mean that you can arrest a United States citizen and detain them and definitely I just weed it but and McCain is like you know pretty straightforward it's like if someone is a to the security of the United States we should be able to arrest them and detain them because apparently like a lot of the people that they didn't detain indefinitely and they let out according to McCain ended up killing some of troops yeah so I like what they're saying what they're saying is listen this is some fucking dirty warfare and we need some extra power but we're not gonna abuse it but the problem is you can't get that extra power because everybody abuses power once they get it there was just the otherwise there would already be in accounting for all the fucking money that's missing they would already be right you know there would be someone some repercussions or all the lies that we're told that led us to believe there was weapons of mass destruction just straight-up lies we think about what you can get in trouble for you know what would you what you know what you think about like how crazy insider trading is you can get arrested if you have information that you know a stock's gonna go bad think about that but then think about the fact that someone somewhere lied about weapons of mass destructions they they made up some sort of a story or they fabricated some some evidence and it became the real reason why people supported the idea going there and yet it didn't exist so if we know that and that's not chased down yeah you don't chase that down there's there's there's no like big news follow up and documentaries about it how they chased that down it found out how it happened locked everybody on and cleaned out all the people that they were in business with no it's just somehow or another it kind of gets swept under the rug that a war was started on bullshit yeah they've allowed somehow another hypnotized people to the point where people have allowed a war to be created on bullshit a country that had absolutely no connection that we could see like a straight connection to Iraq yeah the fuck is that it makes no sense all we got to go over there and get him he's got weapons of mass destruction okay listen we were gonna go to war with the people that killed us but we can't figure out who the fuck they are cuz apparently don't man they're nomadic terrorists that I've actually been living in America yeah training a lot of fun okay you hear you since we get the they're all dead since we can't get them let's go get some people that look like them yeah alright let's go get some people in another country not even from the same country it's like it's like Canada something fucked up and people go attack Mexico yes that fucked up it's that silly oh that's what it's like it's like if Canada attacks somebody and then they decided to attack Mexico in retaliation no that's what it's like dude I walk my dog and I walk my dog past this house with these two ferocious dogs behind a fence I will chew ama and so the Chihuahua loves coming and standing in front of this fence and barking because what happens is the two dogs come charging down towards my Chihuahua and barking at my dog and one of them is so mad at my chihuahua that it starts biting the other one on its ass and it's funny his thing you've ever seen it's just taking it out on the closest thing that it can bite you know somehow so it's like also isn't this known as it isn't it kind of like what happened in Afghanistan isn't that called bull baiting isn't that what it is it's like sometimes is what really creeps me out is I think that the the people that were fighting in Afghanistan and the war that we picked with people I think they're really good at fucking war you know Afghanistan is called the graveyard of Empires and I think that the people that were up against aren't just as stupid as a lot of people would like to paint them you know they can't fucking they can't even read they're just hungry starving people who can't even read they don't know what they're doing I think they kind of do know what they're doing I think that they I mean bin Laden said all we have to do is like make it seem like we're gonna attack and look at how much money the United States spends they were just like oh we have to work they turned on a fucking money faucet they basically like what look at what they did look at if look at what al Qaeda did we now have a country where our military can arrest us if we're considered a threat to the security of the United States so that you know what could that mean cuz I mean a journalism - meaning a journalist could that mean like a WikiLeaks hood Malcolm X if look at Malcolm X have gotten arrested and detained indefinitely with Julian Assange don't you think that he would get a rest all that law sure if he was in America fucking ever then being assassinated though well he hasn't been assassinated yet but if they could have ready to monitor assassinated about what they've done with that guy you know he's in a sort of a similar situation where he has to report to a police station like every day he's to check in and he's not allowed to go anywhere and his trial is like still he hasn't been they want to send him off to where was it Norway nor where he was charged with not actually Sweden sexual misconduct whatever he did is just some weird Moen was in bed with a girl apparently she's saying yeah stuck his dick in her without a condom and yeah well it seems like we are sometimes it feels like we're on the precipice where they're gonna stop even putting up this act that they're debating and deciding and using courtrooms they see that's the problem with indefinite detention because it's like let's imagine that I think I don't know let's imagine I think the Alex Jones is a threat to the security of the United States because of the things that he's been saying or weakening the government right so let's imagine that the government the federal government decides that Alex Jones is a real threat and so they they decide to arrest them they've got to put him on trial they've got to prove that he's a real threat was he like manufacturing fucking explosives was he planning on doing something to a Federal Building there will be a trial and in the trial they could use evidence to show if he was really a real threat play his tapes show what he was up to now the military can just arrest him it's not even a rest because they're not putting him on trial they didn't even have to tell anybody live arrest they just come and get you and they put you away indefinitely because somebody thought you were a threat to the security of the United States that chills me dude that is so fucked up and if you think that's just going to be used for I don't know whoever it is these invisible people that I'm not even sure who they are that are lurking in New York or wherever they're at you're crazy if you think that's gonna happen fucking turn on some Waco footage you know watch those fucking ATF agents torching that Koresh compound if you think that they're just gonna fucking use this law for the worst in most extreme cases no fucking way man they're going to use it they're going to use it any way that they want to use it for drug dealers they're gonna use it for yeah they want to use it for they're gonna use it for anybody man I mean what we could be doing this fucking podcasting inside a FEMA can think of what you saw that cop at UC Davis do to those kids that were on their knees because he thought he could cuz the law was on his side they weren't moving he told them to comply they did not so he thought it was okay to spray chemicals in children's faces yeah and that guy is representative of human nature he's a representative of abuse of power it's very simple it's a it's no logic abuse of power yeah I get someone has made your life a little more difficult they made your job a little harder because now you have to look out for you know all these kids and they're all this place where they you don't want it to be but guess what fuckface you're not allowed to spray them in the face with fucking chemicals that's assault you're assaulting kids and you think you're allowed to do that because of something written on a piece of paper fuck you stupid yeah that's dumb you think that that's all right that's like morally reprehensible just innately it's in your mind you know that's a negative thing in your mind you know that a peaceful protest with students with children who have this idealistic view of the world you're gonna squash it while you're wearing a bulletproof vest and spray them in the face with fucking chemicals yeah they want peaceful protest which is supposedly guaranteed us we're supposed to have the right to assemble well we're supposed to be able to get together even if it is private property you know what that is where the issue takes place well where the fuck else should they be well no yeah you you're supposed to be able to do that and you're supposed to be able to do a lot of and the community should embrace it and the fucking school should have a dialogue with them they're supposed to be wiring everything out you're not supposed to just you know new butt spray people in the face with fucking chemicals but because that guy could because he wasn't just some guy who didn't like what the kids were saying you know like if you and I went down there you know what these fucking kids are spoiled I'm gonna fucking spray him in the face with tear gas yo dude they would lock me in jail they would tackle me throw me to the ground because I don't have the authority to assault them but this guy has the authority to assault that just somehow another it's become his job that is exactly what's gonna happen with this bill that is exactly what's gonna happen with this a this amount of power you can't just give it to people and hope they're gonna be good this should be against the fucking law you can't do it yeah I can't ever do it you don't want you want a way to stop terrorist threats let's get the fuck out of their countries how about that great start about that that's a good start but you stop occupying these fucking countries that don't really need us we don't no one needs us in Afghanistan I want all everybody's relatives come back fucking home those people that are sending you over they're not looking out for your best interest that's ridiculous that's Rice's it's a time old story a timeless tale it's been told back and forth the last edition was Vietnam but apparently nobody fucking learned from it apparently everybody just still thinks that someone's looking out for you at the top despite all the evidence to the contrary I'm looking out for you man yeah well and also those that you know it's set up in a way that for many people they feel like it's one of their only options is to join the military they feel like they it's like they feel like it's gonna pay for their college and it's a lot of you know like it the fucking uh at the UFC there'll be Marines there you've seen those right and we're doing for the troops we do we do shows for the troops yeah but I'm gonna have troops that are flown in and we yeah get them tickets well no no that's cool I'm talking about outside the recruiters where they're like really really yeah they're recruiting people I don't mean it's awesome that fucking at the fights yeah at the fights where they're recruiting people and you're all juiced up with testosterone enough to see you know fuck yeah yeah fucking be tricked into that that's not fair that's like a whorehouse that's open right in front of strip club yeah like wow what are you doing here man I'm a fruit they were doing pull up contests is what it was so they're having pull up the contest and so they're getting guys there so I'll go do a fucking 100 pull-ups look there's 100 pull-ups I'm like man you could be a Marine you're really tough you could be a Marine and so they use recruiters we'll come on college campuses and you know it's a the the United States military uses many of the same things that cults do to indoctrinate the people into it you know cults change your identity they change your name cults will shave your head they'll make you wear certain clothes they make you refer to people in a very specific way they make you use a very specific language and cults people will tend to say the same thing over and over again that's just based on whatever the leader said so a lot of the the indoctrination is very similar to when cults come out to campuses and stuff it's a very similar thing and what they do is they they get people to join up who haven't actually considered the reality of what they're going to be doing some of them really do want to like fucking blast goddamn machine guns in the desert because it's fucking fun there's a great book by Sebastian Junger called war and it's fucking awesome if you read that book no oh my god it's so good a refreshment member he decided to write a book about it's this deadly valley in Afghanistan and it and so he decided to write with his name was Sebastian that shit wouldn't reach younger I don't know if it's younger younger he's written other things before the yes yeah yep that's right I don't know what else though but I just kept hearing about this book so I'm sorry I was just trying to remember what I remembered about it I can we said he's like he lived with these fucking troops out there he's badass he's like a really tough dude who like goes deep into the shit and like and he's a journal he's a wardrobe ICU CNN guy he's either guy that has like the accent I don't know like an Australian accent is that the guy I don't think he has an Australian accent but I could be wrong I only saw one interview with him I don't remember I don't know why I keep you interrupt you know I'm trying to remember the same yeah sorry so his what he did with his book which is remarkable and beautiful is he managed to write the book with no moral or ethical slant to it you know he's not saying like war is bad or you shouldn't go to war you should go to war war is good it's just describing the experience of war as purely as he can exactly what it's like to get hit by a roadside bomb or exactly what it's like to like be in the middle of a firefight and how they've studied adrenaline levels when you get into firefights okay now I'm remembering I'm looking at the pictures of him online yeah I saw him on a CNN interview CNN or c-span there's also did a documentary about - really about this group of people these badass fucking Marines out in the middle of it like in the deadliest fucking Valley it's called the Korengal Valley that's what it's called those guys those embedded reporter guys were fucking there's fucking crazy man favorite what a nutty job huh they want to go where the action is yeah man but the experience of war for a young guy who he says there's no drug like it he says that there's nothing that you that will get you as high is being an assistant life-or-death situation where you're defending your the people around you who you are like connected to there really are your brothers you're like surrounded you're with these people see for for the troops that's what their war is their war is protecting their dear friends from getting killed and and that's how they're taught they're taught these are your brothers you will give up your life for your brothers that's what they're taught and so you develop these intense bonds for the people around you that are formed from massive burst of adrenaline you know cause like when adrenaline when your body is experiencing super dangerous situations all the senses turn on it's I think it's an evolutionary trait designed to like teach you so that you learn how to survive like you know way back when if you're getting attacked by a tiger you would remember everything in a dangerous situation everything becomes crystal clear you see everything everything's kind of in slow motion and then afterwards you totally remember it with this vividness that you don't remember other things this is where a post-traumatic stress disorder shock to sort post-traumatic stress disorder comes from is that people are getting really intense situations in war they get these fucking memories burnt into their brains like tattoos they can't forget it then though their mind keeps going back to it like when your memory wanders and you think back to a moment it's kind of dulled and the colors are dim and you don't remember it their memories go back to it a hundred percent so it's like they're there their hearts start racing and it fucks up your life because this thing has been burnt into your mind so in these situations you're experiencing life at this super high voltage and you're experiencing with a group of people and you form bonds with these people that you don't have with normal with normal people in life you form these intense bonds maybe it's like the kind of bonds you form when you're with your wife and she's giving birth or something when you're in sharing those moments with people it's like that so I think they're you know these effects are studied by the people whose job it is to make the troops efficient and they use these really intense conditioning techniques and stuff that a lot of these people aren't prepared for they don't know what they're getting into they don't know that they're getting into more than just defending their country they're getting into a well-studied system of brainwashing and conditioning that transforms them from you know normal American citizens and the people who are willing to die for whatever their commander says you can't question what your commander says you can't question whoever the superior officer is about doing this or that you have to do it or couldn't work if that wasn't the case if like each individual person got to decide I don't think I'm gonna fucking grenade man I don't think you know what the place down there where all the people are with the guns that want to kill me I'm very not gonna go there today it's amazing how easy it is to sell the idea that you're supposed to go kill someone because some people that are in office even though you know that everyone in office is essentially corrupted but because those people are in office they tell you you're allowed to kill these people yeah not only are you allowed to kill people but when you come back they'll be happy to see you yeah sure whereas like in any other time if you find out that I got killed somebody like look you know at this fucking guy man he's a good dude but he went to jail for manslaughter he beat some guy to death in front of a nightclub and he's kind of fucked up with jail for 10 years yeah you you like I don't want to be around that guy yeah that got killed somebody but if you are around a war hero it's a different feeling sure you know and did different feelings for them too you know I mean some guys have issues over it but I met guys that don't I know some really smart guys that went overseas and they're happy that they did what they did 58 confirmed kill dude I know some snipers yeah I know one dude very well that was a sniper well I mean I said they got to be a weird thing man to be looked at someone from a distance and make them disappear from earth blimp in the distance you know that's what it is I mean that's what being a sniper is you're not there to fucking win a target Connor playing pinball you're there to peck people off yeah they want to kill fear they're those vaporators yeah you explode their brain yeah you know you you're a Widowmaker you're out there fucking making kids grow up without their dad you're out there fucking making it so that like for the rest of their lives there's gonna be sentimental moments where a guy looks at a grainy picture of the person whose face you just turned to jelly and bone fragments for the rest of their life they're gonna be looking at this picture of being like man I wonder what my dad was like how about it was pretty fucking cool Oh guess what you're not gonna know his fucking head looks like a goddamn blasted tomato that fell off a car his head splattered everywhere that's it and a professional did that who got trained in a fucking camp designed to teach people to do that in the most precise way possible it's crazy man it's amazing when you break it down like that when you look at it for what the actual physical act of it is instead of looking at it as a patriotic American it supports everything that we do overseas and you know put a fucking flag on your window it says god bless our troops you know instead of just looking at analytically not even like casting a blame it's described just describing it just describe it it becomes insanity it becomes a point where people are angry at you and they'll say you're talking shit about the American soldiers in the US Army well you actually not even you don't even have to all you have to do is just describe what's happening you don't have to talk any shit when you describe what's happening the reality of the details is so horrific that people will interrupt you with excuses sure interrupt you all you have to do is say what's having not even cast blame just describe it accurately well you're what you're doing there see as you're walking through the laser in the museum that makes the fucking door shut in front of the diamond you know it's like people have these trip wires in their brains where the moment you start talking about just the stuff we've been talking about now it's you're hitting a fucking can you're hitting some conditioning that's been intentionally put there that's potentially put there because if it's not there then you know the country can't function as an MP I mean it's got you've got to have if you're gonna run an empire the population has got to have deep and intense admiration for the military force because if they don't then the military force isn't going to function because the military force is made up of a population but it becomes at a certain point Tom you have to wonder when does the military force realize these guys that are paying you absolute shit money guys that we have to do foundations for we have to do benefits for you know to for traumatic brain injuries you know what people have to help and contribute that should to me when I found that there they need money for traumatic brain injuries for hospitals to deal with these guys when they come back overseas with these horrible injuries the first thing I thought is man how is that possible they let that become an issue how much would that cost in comparison how much fucking money they're making over there how much would it cost and who's making money how about the fucking people that are making the all the equipment he'll selling the caliber and the people that make the air conditioning machines they're spending billions of dollars on air conditioning over there you know they're giant tents that they're fucking air conditioning there's a lot of money you're telling me they don't have any money to spend on traumatic brain injury shouldn't they like invest in the best medicine possible with the smartest scientists how much would that cost would that be cost prohibitive if that's cost prohibitive then that means the fucking war should be cost prohibitive you shouldn't be investing in a war that you can't take care of your fucking soldiers and it's over what the fuck is that that's like that's like driving across the country with just enough money for gas and no money for fight it's the most fucked up thing ever man it's like and and that's the that is the the real sickening thing about is whenever you run into people who are soldiers like like that guy there was a coolest fucking guy at the hermosa show he did man who like said he listened to your podcast and like he was like a special force is gonna and he was fuckin cool man and every time I run into those people they're cool in an authentic way or you know you could be good friends with these people you could trust these people you have to have a tremendous character to get through the special forces the Green Beret you know say what you will about someone you know being you know a soldier a pup who's you know a puppet of a giant corporation or whatever to be like a Special Forces soldier you to be a bad motherfucker yeah you do man and those people are like some of our they're some of our best people yeah you really really are there's some of our best fucking people so to send them off to bullshit Wars where they're getting fucking liquefied instead of using them for real purpose for something for like really building the country up and really do like for in the inevitable event where some shit is gonna happen and we're gonna need them for a real thing you know to send them to waste them for these fucking politicians who are the real puppets of the corporations to fucking send these heroes off to get their faces blown off in a some country that they don't need to be man that is beyond evil that's some reptilian vampiric weird shit man it is it is yeah it is it's it's if you know if they were eating people instead of just killing them if every person that died they ate we would be horrified because everybody just dies somehow or another it doesn't seem like the kitten killed by monsters now they are they're being killed by psychological monsters they've been killed by people who are willing to kill people in order to profit and it's really that simple and it doesn't seem like it should be possible in 2011 but that's the business that they're in the guy who works at the fucking butcher shop the guy who works at the slaughterhouse okay do you think that guy at a certain point in time don't you think he gets used to killing cows the fuck yeah he does it says John but if you had to go there today and like you just were alone with the cow and all this machinery and then there was like a fucking manual that told you exactly how you pull the cow into this and lead them into the spot and then send the piston through his fucking brain and then hook them up and then gut them you would be so freaked out at the whole process Tama because you're not used to it because it's not it's not a normal part of your life yeah meanwhile yeah so these people are just used to it there that just makes sense to them yeah it's a normal part of their life it's a normal part of their life man it's you know it's like when you hear about the friends of Bush that got all those deals and Afghanistan all the contractors and shedew I'd like that and how much they charge for a work out there that they charge like usin my insane money for this stuff and you realize oh this is just a you know the act of war just a way to test out new technology and I get get a lot of people some work and make a lot of people really rich fuck yeah incredibly rich and the idea that everybody you know but people say there's no way that people would go to war just for money and I'm like there's no way they wouldn't yeah there's no way they wouldn't if they had a sacrifice a few thousand people here there to make untold trillions amount of dollars that is what it is - yeah it's yeah that's funny because if it was like let's say there was just a group of like robed demonic magicians that lived in some giant black tower and they're like we need five thousand of your strongest and bravest men we're going to sacrifice them at the top of the tower and from their blood we will reap great energy you'd be like fuck you that's the evilest thing ever but if they're like we gotta send our troops over there to defend and fight for our country suddenly you're like oh yeah it totally makes sense go ahead and do that they're gonna fight for your freedom war pigs man listen to fucking out it was a ozzy osbourne he sums it up perfectly and that's thought yeah why the war machine keeps turning yeah yeah it is a war machine and that's something that you know people have warned us about from the beginning of time you know that there's you know people that are in charge they're like everything there you're going to eventually get drunk with power and they're gonna leave you in some terrible direction and all corruption evolves and if it's not checked it gets stronger and stronger and all you have to do is just go back to the Kennedy assassination go back to Lyndon Johnson and go back to Richard Nixon and Watergate and they're all crooks yeah they've always been crooks and no one got caught a few along the way Nixon a few guys got popped for a little bit of this and a little bit of that but for the most part everybody got away with everything the people who drafted up the Northwoods document they didn't go to jail whoever the fuck shot Kennedy yeah you know who's Lee Harvey Oswald he acted alone sure he did sure he holy yeah all those people that heard bullets coming from behind them they're just crazy yeah they're just silly people fucker probably like five or six dudes with guns didn't got to rely on one guy and do you think that one guy really really was on his own Stallone not yeah shut the fuck up which is why when you see John McCain - pretty much directly telling Rand Paul that yes with this bill if someone is a threat to the security of the United States you know John McKee this is from the person who fucking chose Sarah Palin as his vice president so that's how fucked up this man is when you hear him saying yeah we can indefinitely arrest United States citizens who are a threat to the security of this country you have to ask well what is John McCain's definition of security I know what mine is what's John McCain's definition of the security of this country because I think it's wildly different from my idea and your idea and for most people's idea of the security of the country I think for John McCain the security of the country means that the corporations are able to function without getting disturbed by people who have the gall or audacity to say that a the way that wealth is distributed right now is unfair and as fucking up is basically eating away and eroding the foundations of what this country is supposed to be about I think fucking McCain would very much like to take those people and put them in some indefinite detainment if he could and eventually maybe it won't be McCain maybe it won't be this year maybe when this bill passes it'll be 15 years before it happens but eventually people just start disappearing people vanish in the middle of the night did you hear about this fucking ridiculous thing that Newt Gingrich said Gary Johnson outed Newt Gingrich about being a pot smoker and the fact that he was pushing for something that would make marijuana distribution after a certain amount with a certain volume but make it like you would be able to be put to death essentially you'd be eligible for the death penalty Newt Gingrich the guy who admits that he had smoked pot he's talking about like pot dealers yeah Gary Johnson outed him on this right so yeah so new right and those are men there are many people right now are in control of this country who know how crazy is that it's evil imagine that someone saying that a guy who sells pot because he sells a lot of it what if he sells one joint Wow one joint no death penalty okay I've sell million joints death penalty off with it hey you know what why because you're giving more people the same shit that doesn't even make any sense I've never understood that the idea of like a volume issue makes the crime worse like if you're selling a couple joints to your friends it's like a little slap on the wrist but if you're selling a hundred thousand pounds in the back of a semi yeah you're gonna you're gonna get locked up for the rest of your life take it a little further back you're talking about a fucking farmer you're gonna execute a farmer it's agriculture scenarios this shit grows out of the ground you you want it you're gonna execute a fucking guy you like who is a horticulturist or a botanist you're just gonna you're gonna kill somebody you grew a plant it's not like you was whipping up poison you know what that's that's the weird thing you could probably whip up 500 gallons of cyanide and distribute that around and you couldn't get the death penalty for that as deadly as that as pure deadly cyanide but if you're growing enough fucking marijuana Newt Gingrich thinks that he can he wants to execute you you wants to kill you Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich introduced in 1997 the drug importer death penalty Act of 1996 a builder required a sentence of death for certain importation of significant quantities of controlled substances it would have applied to anyone convicted more than once of carrying a hundred doses or about two ounces of marijuana across the border two ounces of marijuana across the border a hundred doses that would be the death penalty you'd be eligible for death yeah what a monkey what an old limp-dick monkey just you old dumb fuck you you ancient thinking shithead you fucking rule maker you write it down and everyone knocks the hammer and then it makes it right your fucking system is obviously bullshit all of its bullshit so your laws are bullshit all your rules are bullshit all this Posse commentator that's commentators whatever it is that's bull - it says we just decide people write things down on paper and we decide what is right and what it's wrong and then we know we're not agreeing to this we don't really get to vote on any of this there's no idea that they can just impose this on you is nothing short of imperialism it's nothing short of people telling other people what they can't do telling other people that they're not they don't they're not as special as them they're not worth as much as them that they don't have any rights they don't have any authority and that these people who write the things down on people on paper rather all of a sudden have the authority over the mass of other humans that don't they're special they override and now they're telling us that the override because they have weapons because they're gonna allow the military to actually enter into civilian areas and stop uprisings so you're gonna have tanks can stop operation wall street's right literally what happened in Tiananmen Square that horrified every American and we saw those kids get run over by tanks and killed it was terrified that their government is so fucking against them that their government is so cool and so evil they've been willing to run all over their citizens run over the people whose hard work literally funded the empire funded these tanks every person chipped in a certain amount but because these people defy because these people protest they're gonna run over them with tanks and crushed him on television yes one of everybody that's right and and and that's that's the type of person that Newt Gingrich's and that can come that can come from this from this action and that's why people don't understand like why you getting so outraged about this why's this like this is crazy this is like a movie this is like Batman okay we're we're in Batman right now and you know the evil people are slowly getting their grips on our on our government there's some guy with a fucking mask on and he's working for all the bad guys and he's pretending to be a senator and Batman has to figure this guy out and he has to get to him and right now that guy looks like Barack Obama Barack Obama was like he's got a mask on he's like some fucking lizard guy underneath all this and he's just a really good actor and he's got everybody convinced that everything's cool and David Icke is right man they're all fucking reptilian he's come back a man yes it's so ridiculous it almost like that would fit right into the plot have you found that Obama really was a reptilian it would like fit right in the plot have you found out that Newt Gingrich really was some evil reptilian that wanted to take over the reptile farm you know he doesn't like the way this young reptile runs things I would run these humans directly you know well you can you know before you get to dirt fuck before you get to the reptilian part you can just kind of look at what they really are and what they really are well here's one thing you know about Newt Gingrich Newt Gingrich is a murderer he wants to kill people Newt Gingrich feels comfortable killing people you know that and you also know that Newt Gingrich makes would make money off of that Newt Gingrich makes money off of would make money off of killing people the people who support war make money off of killing people they literally transform human beings into money they kill human beings and that turns into money and money's energy so what that means is they're vampires that's what they really are they're vampires they are they convert human energy through destruction into cash and then they use that cash to make their lives better just like vampires sink their fangs into people suck the blood to stay alive it's the same thing it's vampiric it's a vampiric form of existence and its really fucking terrifying when you realize that it's a hundred percent true they're not only is it 100 percent true it doesn't seem to be any way to get them out other than them dying and young people taking their place young people who grew up with the Internet yeah well it seems like a certain amount of the way the system is it's like they've sort of just accepted it you know and everyone's accepted that it's just just a fuck wash but you have to think I don't think that they're unaware of the fact of where they're where they're fallible I think they know where they're foul but they can't correct it I I think that they maybe they know what they're doing in a really intense way because they've had infinite amounts of money to study human psychology and to understand how to control populations and they got it down to a science man there's a great fucking documentary on the beat see called the century the south have you seen that no Edward Bernays it's this guy béarnaise he was like Freud's cousin and it's all about the ways that they started studying how to manipulate the perception of populations for the sake of corporations so for example cigarette companies approached Bernays and they're like listen women don't want to smoke right now cuz they think it's too masculine what do you what do you think we can do to make it so that women want to smoke and soup Rene's said well you need to make women feel like it's a form of activism or they're like pushing against male-dominated culture it's like make it part of the women women's rights movement so what they did is they got a bunch of these girls to march during the Macy Day Macy's Day Parade and at one point they told all the press that they're going to do this at one point the women lifted up their dresses and like pulled cigarettes out of their garters or whatever and started smoking in front all these reporters who are snapping pictures and so they're reporters put that in all these newspapers women's women want the right to smoke now of a sudden what Bernays did or what the cigarette companies did is they tied into the DNA of the women's rights movement smoking so now smoking becomes an empowerment and empowerment and a sign of feminism and all of a sudden women start smoking and totally fucking works so yes yeah totally works oh so it's like so stuff like free now is a long time ago man so guys a long time ago so they started studying you know they started studying it's just like imagine like somebody who heard sheep or imagine somebody who is in charge of any kind of animal a beekeeper for example or anyone who's in charge of controlling animals they're experts they know how to like they know how to do like turkey hunters are the same way they're not in Turkey cause and just a perfect way to make a turkey appear and to blast it so I think that people put a lot of money into studying human perception the way people work and I think maybe they what we think the amount of control that we think we wield is much it's an illusion I don't know when I see those fucking Black Friday videos you know when you see the Black Friday videos of thousands of people stampeding through a Walmart banging down the door of fucking Walmart like zombies you ever seen that video yeah absolutely when you see that it's really to me it's like man I mean maybe you and me and a few other people have these ideas but in general as I heard it seems like they've gotten people so doped up and dumbed down that I don't know that they're making too many mistakes I think they make mistakes here and there I think they fuck up in a drum you okay I think there's a lot of shit that's going on that is just coincidental and is more of a symptom of the way we've sort of developed as a society than a grand plan and it's more of them filling in the gaps that were available taking taking advantage of a lot of situations that are available I don't think that it's one gigantic group with a fucking finger on all the marionette you know handles well I think it's worse than that I think it's you know the term Gestalt you ever heard that term yes so I think it's the Gestalt I think it's like the somehow the the super consciousness that has emerged from this group of people collaborating his crew is there's like it's become its own thing it's become an organizing force that's organizing towards the negative and towards of the vampiric and not organizing towards the positive did you listen to the brew you didn't listen to Bruce Lipton I didn't it was really interesting he was on the podcast yesterday and one of the things he was talking about was had the importance of creating a community like a good community of people you feed off their energy and those people that you're around you feed off their energy you know if they're positive you'll you'll actually feel better you'll have a more positive life it totally makes sense oh yeah that's it's it's the most important that's one of the reasons that people advise spending time in our arms or spending time around people who are meditating because you from being around people who are working on also it's the same with martial arts you want if you're around people who are fighters and you see the different forms and styles that they're using that's gonna you're gonna evolve just from growing around them and seeing what they're doing so their technique yeah I said yeah it you know it's like you when you learn techniques of thinking - yeah that's one things that people always comment on this part cast people oh I get emails and tweets and Facebook messages on where people are always talking about how you know they don't know anybody that thinks the way they think they don't have anybody that has the interest they or who looks at things in the just a raw honest black-and-white view that you see and here's my perceptions and it's not flavored by what's politically correct and it's not flavored by you know what's what's thought to be acceptable behavior it's what I really think and I want to know if you think the same thing right and when when you do that people it resonates with people yeah they don't know anybody else who's doing that right well so yeah so when it's a right so in that seem like that like this podcast has because of the incredible connection it's given me with like shit loads of fucking people my evolution sped up because I'm constantly getting like amazing videos book recommendations basic things from links Twitter links all the crazy stories yes so it's it's certainly altered me and I for the positive now I'm at 100% of it many of me as well you know as I've been a part of it you know as like doing the podcast being a part of it it's a completely enhanced my my perception of things and people have cleared up things that I didn't understand before people have sent me alternative points of view that also should be considered like there's so many interesting bits of information that keep coming at you from all these different forms right it's great it's grating a feedback loop what I was getting at is that this what these people have put together with the people involved in the military industrial complex and put together is a very high-level evil version of that that's it man they have a high level evil version of thinking where everyone is thinking along the same way and you have to make sacrifices and you got to crack some eggs to make an omelet and all of this thinking is put into like a mindset and that mindset is enforced into the troops beaten into their head supported through the ranks applied to corporations and in many of them and it's really like when you consider that many of the people at the top of the power structures are fundamentalist Christians hilarious now imagine this imagine that they weren't fundamentalist Christians imagine they were just you know cultists and they believed in a dark God they worshiped a dark God and this dark God was a child sacrificer and it sacrificed its own son at one point spilled the blood of its own son out of some sense of obligation or power and that they were praying and worshiping daily to a dark God who was planning revenge on the majority of the human race and was right now at this very moment planning and getting ready to destroy the planet with plagues and different and horsemen and trumpets and weird dump like crazy fucking angels we're gonna fly down and kill and poison the large of the earth and they're worshipping this guy daily they go to church and worship a God that wants to destroy the planet every fucking day they pray to this God oh lord give me the courage to lead today so that I may be prepared for when you return and destroy the planet that's who they fucking pray to man that's God they pray to God they pray to a god that wants to wipe us out throw us in hell kill the fucking homosexuals destroy the majority of the planet so all that's left is a few john mccain style honkies with their feet in a river of blood waving up at Gabriel or worshipping God like in walking down streets of gold waving American flags that's the freaks who are a lot of them are running this fucking country man that ain't good that's not good that's bad I don't want anyone having access to a nuclear arsenal that worships a God that's planning on it's some random time blasting the planet I'm living on and wiping out the majority of the people because he's pissed about what they did to his fucking hippie kid 22,000 years ago like come on man forget about it I'm so I wasn't alive back then I can't help it they fucking threw your kid up on a cross I had nothing to do with it why are you coming back to kill their descendants you weirdo give us a fucking break your God travelled back in time and pluck him off the fucking cross man yeah and they sneak controlling this whole game doesn't he have it can he just get come down and give us better directions he just gives you this game and you just fuck this game up and he's supposed to read some old you on how to play the game and it's interpreted through three different languages and it was just a spoken word thing for a thousand years before that so who knows how much of its fucking valid and this is how you're playing the game and you're fucking up along the way and everybody's telling you keep fucking up and he's gonna come and he's gonna take you away yeah he's gonna take you away and put you in a dark dark place forever this is thoughts and they have these ideas these urges and they seem to be natural you better suppress those I want to kill them you can't do it you can't kill them and that's the most amazing thing that these same people a sudden you're allowed to kill them if some sanctioned group says absolutely you can even say you're doing it for God may God bless you all Wow go out god is blessing us to go Jackson people we don't know their God their God I call their God loon loon and it's this weird fucking creature reminds me of an HP Lovecraft demon spirit if you change the name of their guy though their God doesn't have a name its nameless it's a nameless God it's like out of fucking Conan it's a name we're all it's an invisible nameless God and they worship the invisible nameless God and and and part of worshiping the invisible nameless God is sending kids off the war and fucking letting the kids kill people and another part of worshiping the invisible nameless God is making it so gay people can't get married the invisible nameless one you know what he hates Joe what he fuck mud sucks hates butt sacks damn why do you make it feel so good the one with no name he curses the gays the one with no name he doesn't like butt sex he's like really upset them do you know the Little Richard song tutti frutti used to be tutti frutti good booty no I didn't do it that's why that's why Little Richard is on some booties he's eternally damned by this fucking Lulu tutti frutti good booty evil man he's an evil man did you see that dumb cartoon I made by the way no jesus heals a gay no I like redid like I took an old Christian cartoon of Jesus healing a leper and just replace the words with him healing a homosexual wasn't it I did in like four hours so it ain't looking a professional fucking I ain't gonna be don't have to give me a thank you to be now Pixar don't you know have to qualify at first you're so humble no I will when you yeah I have to be this is not a hey we should talk about that sketch that you did that's like that I got you so I'm gonna get you sucker oh it's clear that I because I know for a fact that Duncan did not remember that thing when he made that sketch and I also know because I didn't remember that sketch in that when he talking about Duncan made a video with Natasha a hilarious video what's it called it's called falling apart falling or Adam T and the idea of the video there's there's a scene where the girl starts taking off fake parts and there's a scene in I'm gonna get you sucka where is the same thing happened where he's alone with this girl Keenen Ivory Wayans is alone with this chick and she starts taking off parts I completely forgot about that even though I'm a big fan of Keenen Ivory Wayans and I know I saw that movie I completely forgot about it and I know that Duncan did not know about it because when first of all I know Duncan he would never do something like that you're one of the most you have some of them the most clear artistic integrity out of almost anybody that I've ever met thanks man it's your you're a hundred percent legit and what you do to the point where you wouldn't even do the Pauly Shore reality show that's true he walked away from a money job on a television show where he was gonna be on a reality show just in my integrity thing I would like to say there was no money it was it wasn't like I was walking away from but it benefited you I thought it I thought you get paid for it you were you know anything no money at all I don't think that's legal I don't think that's legal well they put you on television I think they have to give you they have to give you like some after minimum no that's what I thought because it was a documentary technically they weren't yeah it's a documentary yeah but it was all scripted everything you did was script I was my feeling they was all scripted there was my feeling but they they all they do that with all these reality shows when they create things for them to do well I think I think in the dilemmas no in the in the long run maybe someone could have contested it or something but really if it if there had been money I would have still walked away it would have been a good show good show if it wasn't when it was that was that Pauly Shore showcase but it could have been was like a real realistic viewpoint of all these dudes who are doing stand-up or out there scratching lawn that that real intense creative environment that was that comedy storm man there was there was some you know when we were around back then the Comedy Store with you and me and Diaz and Ari and you know there's a lot of good guys there dude I gotta tell you man it's fucking great right now I mean like and believe it it's fucking really good there right now the crowds are it's packed it's got a really cool vibe but like but that that fuckin paulie thing man it was like there was a lot of reasons that I walked away from that and and one of the biggest ones aside from the fact that I did not want to definitely didn't want to be in it was that I gotten trapped at that job as the talent coordinator I've been doing that job for a long time and I needed a way out and it was just a perfect exit mechanism for me and it was it so that show was like I'm so happy that that show happened because it got me the fuck out of there man you can get stuck at a desk man yeah you can get stuck at a job but as far as the Wayans brother movie stuff goes yeah so let me let me just explain it um the scenes are very similar but Duncan's sort of has a completely different point to it but look the idea of someone having something fake I mean how many movies are the thing when a guy grabs a girl's hair and it's a wig and she's bald like four or five straggly here there's been like a bunch of those Naked Gun yeah it means it's just one of those it's like a comedy device it's almost like a spit-take that someone's got a fake leg a fake arm but both videos the Keenen Ivory Wayans and yours took it to the nth mouths degree which is by the way what you naturally do when you make something funny you you always the more you beat on it the funnier it gets and is essentially the same joke well that what what um so where that idea came from that I did and I I have seen I'm gonna get you sucka and I did not remember that scene got and if I hadn't never done it that's a scary thing right when an ideas in your head and it comes out yeah god yeah that was too easy well no see here's the thing what that idea came from was from watching Natasha take her earrings off and I was watching her take her earrings off and then I started thinking about like how like when you're dating someone you're like try it like when you're in a relationship with someone or you start dating somebody and you know part of it is you begin to like disassemble their personality you know the more you get to know someone when you've been with someone for a very long time you're in a relationship or you're married you get to know the deepest part of them you end up getting to know very very deep parts of them that are hidden by the hidden by their personalities and things that they don't ever display in public or maybe they don't even know about you get to know the deepest levels man when you're when you've been having sex with someone for a long time and you know like the deepest level of a person and you've been living with someone so anyway I was thinking like man it's so weird how that's what it's all about it's basically just like plucking away the different pieces of someone until all they ours is this primal spark that you're fucking so that was the idea that's where it came from and you know what you look at think of when you look at Natasha taking off her earrings but so but so so um so uh anyway that's the that's what the idea came from I mean we had to pitch it we pitched it to Adam TV they never they kept talking I'm gonna peek we pitch it to Adam TV they didn't know about the they didn't mention the Wayans thing we made the fucking thing and then immediately a few people posted links to the oils brothers sounds like god fucking dammit is it really really similar because I saw the movie but I barely remember it I I think that it's uh it's the number fakely it's the exact same it's the exact same device which is disassembling a woman but the endings totally different and the point of the things totally different but to me what was really surprising and intense about it was that some people like really use that against me and like kind of like a really angry fucking way I got on Twitter right YouTube like have you been like I didn't even know this I got some like shitty messages from people but it's like if I'm gonna steal alright if I'm gonna steal I'm gonna steal something I'm gonna steal a sketch I'm gonna steal fucking something you know what I'm not going to steal it from I'm not gonna steal it from a fucking Wayans movie you know like right so obscure it's probably easier to hide I'm gonna get you sucka well it's one of the most popular you have to you have to consider it it is possible that your might had it in your head and that you forgot oh of course but that shit happens to me all now things are it Adam but here's the thing a lot of a lot of jokes or a form of math it's like an equation you take absolutely it's an equation and if you break that equation down it has natural logical connections on that equation and a lot of comedic minds are gonna yes if you give them a premise they're gonna come up unfortunately though you saw that other one first yes I do that kind of right it factors out it could have been juiced in my brain but I still though there it is like Wayans has got a transvestite I think it's a transvestite someone she appears hot at first and he takes her apartment she's not hot as I recall from it he flees and that's it you know what I mean it's like it is the same chord it's not the same he's not an absurdist yeah I mean it's like you know it's not the same joke because it's you can't really defend though because it is exactly the same joke you know I'm saying like if someone was someone stole the joke from you but then just twisted it into that I know you didn't steal it that would be no that would be no you know there's like there's no like no excuse you can't say well I did it differently of course you thought of it under but can do it it's it's there on the internet there's nothing I do about it and I agreed that you're not even Mexican my name is yeah I know man did some you know what I'm saying though it's like yes like it parallel thinking is just it's unavoidable what it is you gotta go oh shit I didn't whoops listen to me Wayans I'm gonna steal your fucking sketches from now on someone will cut that unleash the hackers joke they're gonna cut out that part and you just fucked up yeah it is a really fucked up yeah you said something you should never even jest well I say rude mean things and pretend that's a attired form of comedy give me a break you know fucking funny dude what the soup I did the soup this morning that shows funny dude I did not know they had a bunch of really funny sketches where they were making fun of the chick oh hi / Real Housewives I was stone-cold sober they were making fun of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills like one of the crazy chicks has kind of cracked out on the show this one of the writers says Oh hilarious version of this check like I had I just guessed by seeing it it was hard to hear because it was really loud in there but I asked her like right away I'm laying that's like the girl from Real Housewives she's like yeah I high-fived or was like really funny shit man that joel mchale dude he's fucking funny he's got great delivery and the writers are really funny man they had some funny shit on Kim Kardashian and dude I watched this one show this access morning show where this guy they were goofing on it's on tonight's episode you have to watch this because you can't believe this is real this guy is reading from his Blackberry and he's talking about his help his Mexican help we gave him a chance to serve the other day you know we've never served before and here you go here's your shot oh my god dude it's so gross and then he reads the guys text in broken English Oh me legs shaking all day reads it in like a Mexican accent oh dude it's it's like you watch it he go my god someone pull that guy aside and give him a mushroom trip someone give that dude a mushroom trip and a mirror and sit him in a room and tell me thinking about his life a fuck man yeah it's pretty disturbing that's just that's it's so clueless like in here I'm doing it's just so clueless it's like so weird that you don't you don't think that people are gonna find that really gross it really makes me believe an idea that like there's like two species happening right now like humans are differentiating and like some humans are jumping away from the what what most humans are I think some people are splitting away because like for me to be in a mind state where I thought like that or I acted like that or I read someone's text and and in like some stereotypical Mexican accent to humiliate them if I was for me to be didn't even think you assumed I would have to I think I'd have to have a head injury and it imagine if I started doing that you'd be authentically worried about that you think I'd breakdown or zone this is how this person lives every day of their fucking life so it's like who what is that who what kind what kind of being is that is that's that's a human I know it's a human but it's not the same kind of human I am that's a different kind of human that's a full-of-shit human that's a full-of-shit human that's a I don't know what it is how old is it how old is that thing how old is that guy he's in his 30s so this is a guy in his 30s he's managed to get to his 30s and he still like that nothing's knocked him off the path he's never you know when you see someone like that you know a few things you know that he's never smoked pot probably probably definitely never taken acid never eaten mushrooms probably he's never heard really good music and he's like he's like one of those salamanders that never really goes through the transformation cuz the water never reaches a certain alkaline level yeah that's what he is man you know you ever hear those yes there's certain you know there's certain animals that never met a more façades yeah the word yeah there's certain animals that if the conditions are incorrect or if there's pollution in the environment all kinds of different factors have to be taken into account as long as they won't make the connection he's like a puppy that size didn't open her ears didn't open you know it's a Thai state fucking shut it's a fucking it's just it's a silly hippie argument that everybody needs psychedelics better you know it's not every but I'm not saying everybody needs them but goddamn a lot of people could use them a lot of pages if they would just study them and they would just distribute them through experts imagine what this world would be like if we had centers where you could go as a young man to have a psychedelic experience to get a broader view of the universe and someone takes you in and they do blood work on you and make sure you're healthy and then they sit you down you watch documentaries and you take a class and when you graduate from the class and the class is all about pharmacology and the way that different things interact with your body and one thing when you're done with this class you feel educated and you feel like you can make your own decision whether or not you want to try this and if you do want to try it then they have a ceremony and every kid goes in there and you all with proper meditation techniques proper education as to what the the history of the use of these substances is and the the history and the anecdotal evidence that it may have been responsible for the actual religion that this might be what religion is all about it might be psychedelic experience if we could have that we could have communities where we did that well you'd have a big giant football field full of people that are doing mushrooms and are putting out positive energy and are there in our balanced healthy people that want to unite together as a species and want to embrace each other and help each other and no one ever get greedy but let's all work together and do this together and you could have a football field filled with people doing this a stadium filled with people doing it that would fix the world and it sounds ridiculous it sounds like you're saying mushrooms would fix the world what would do it better what what could possibly have that effect education education doesn't necessarily get through your subconscious education doesn't necessarily get through your programming education doesn't necessarily get through anything in your life that's that's really ingrained as a behavior pattern it doesn't always you can tell people all day like Brian that cigarettes cause cancer and this silly goof is actually a cigarette probably more than mushrooms no no wood mushrooms would do it better than anything sex is you support you there's no enlightenment involved in that Brian it's silly the psychedelic experience itself is important you need to be humbled it's not just you know everybody fuck everybody and feel good about it you know we've talked about this before when Duncan was on in like you know that might be good for like 5 out of 10 people and the other five they're so terrified they're not gonna ever leave the house again this unnecessarily case because they've probably it was done correctly through some sort of a shamanic Center where they actually evaluated people and and in you know and taught them and educated them he'd probably be able to weed out the people who were fucked up and he'd probably like dude reality itself is a little fucking slippery for you maybe you should not be doing this maybe we should look into like ritalin for you maybe we should you know I'm saying I mean sure I'm you know a lot of people are 100% anti antidepressants they're like fuck that dude you're ruining your brain chemistry fuck that dude don't let them change your brain I know several people where it's literally changed their life for the better and save their life maybe even I know several people so I would never say that I would never say that well man there's no fucking I mean the thing is there's no rules it's like you this is the main rule is it's this is your incarnation and you get to do what you want with it the idea is to like as much as you can expand and your your levels of happiness and your awareness so that you can feel connected and good in this existence and and there are a lot of tools to do that some of the tools take a long fucking time to do and I think like when McKenna was talking about mushrooms being the most obvious tool to transform the to create like a huge wide scale transformation on the planet he recognized that there's not a lot of time that's what he was thinking it's not like we've got a ton of fucking time to create like meditation temples or to spread good information or to spread some new religion there's no time for that shit you would if you really wanted to transform these weird people who worship invisible homophobic child sacrificing gods if you wanted to transform people who feel comfortable dropping bombs on other people then the quickest way to do it would be to give them a substance that allowed them to connect to each other into the earth and to develop an instantaneous form of empathy unlike anything else and then when they came back - it'd be much more difficult to think about to perceive what they're they're weird and visible God in the same way it's almost like we're moving in a direction at a terrible direction because we don't have the proper ingredients so because we don't have the proper ingredients we can't feel what we're doing it's almost like we have a numb arm probing into the darkness and that that numb arm is scratching the fuck out of reality yeah we don't know because we just can't feel it but if we could just feel it if we could add this other ingredient into the mixture that is life well then okay now all your pieces are in order and now you can see and feel what you're doing because the big problem with human beings when it comes to pollution when it comes to destroying the atmosphere when it comes to the idea of you know what would these nuclear disasters we're not feeling it we don't feel it we don't feel the damage that we're doing we don't feel the Garbage Patch in the ocean we don't feel anything when you throw when you when you take a water bottle and then you toss it in the garbage can you did your job I'm done I'm done I have no connection with this anymore and then we don't feel when it goes into the ocean and becomes a fuck pache that's floating that's as big as Texas we don't feel that and that that is a lack of a connection that's a missing thing that's an animal that doesn't have all of its ingredients well it's fucking blind that's what it is it's blind and everyone's stumbling around blind and their their focus is on material gain and their focuses on shit that can if it does make you happy it's a form very transient temporary happiness that's used for a lot of people it's usually followed by like depression and stress like people who botched it they can't afford get into debt to the banks and become slaves and so yeah man people are people have lost the initial or original connection with the spirit of the earth you know if you think about like ayahuasca and the people and drinking it in the jungle and communing with the mind of nature and then getting direction from the tribe from the mind of nature for people who think this is hippie bullshit when scientists first came to the Amazon and discovered ayahuasca they tried to call it telepathy n-- that's what they were gonna try to talk they were gonna name it as because the fact that they were able to have these telepathic experiences with each other and they all communicated about having shared visions and shared hallucinations yeah so they were gonna call it telepathy but it was already the chemical and it was already named harming or the the you know whatever the the substance was and so they had they had to stick with the name harmine but well see this substance I think for these people has been a form of spiritual compass it points in the right direction it reminds it sets you straight it's a like a tuning fork for your soul but it's amazing that talking about this how did this happen talking about this is ridiculous talking about this is absolutely silly I feel nervous when we start talking about mushrooms can change the world because I'm like who the fuck and you know what what is this idiot saying you know what kind of an sense is he's saying I mean while you're compelled meanwhile you're compelled to say listen I know it sounds stupid I know I'm a goofy-looking fuck I know I'm the fear factor guy yeah I know you know who the hell I am but barely got through high school went to 300 years of college where I halfway paid attention but I'm saying that we might be overlooking one of the biggest tools that human beings have ever had for evolving and developing and that might be why the fucking train is off the tracks and into the woods it might be that the animal isn't balanced and it might be that the animal literally developed eating all this stuff the animal might have become consciousness and aware from being a savage eating all this stuff it might be you know we might have a symbiotic relationship on this earth with certain plants that we've made illegal we might need them in order to be aware of our potential the potato farm that we can do the potential good that we can you know there's no value of positivity there's no might about it the value of positivity is so important when you're on a substance that is we're all bad trips come from all bad trips come from some negativity whether it's a paranoia whether it's a fear whether it's a bad memory that you have that you're trying to avoid shitty behavior that haunts you that you can't correct whatever the fuck it is that triggers the bad trip it's always a negative thing well what what it is is it's what what's happening is when you're when you're taking a psychedelic you're being given a glimpse at yourself from a distance that maybe you can't haven't obtained and you like meditation will give you that distance it gives you a form of intense mindfulness and so all of a sudden you're able to see the I think the root of whatever pattern your life has become and the root is a feeling and that feeling for a lot of people can be a negative feeling and so that's when people say you know I don't like smoking pot man because I it makes me get introspective I get paranoid and nervous it's like no pot is not making you paranoid pot is showing you the paranoia that exists deep within you that's causing you to act fucking weird and causing your relationships to be a little more dulled than they need to be and causing your actions to be a little muted because you're afraid of the reaction that people are gonna have to you because you're you're still stuck in survival you want to survive so bad that you're scared and you've covered that up with all the different whatever clothes you've decided you're gonna wear on this on incarnation and your tattoos or whatever you've learned but deep within that behind all that for a lot of people is a something that it's you could easily turn negative energy but I think it's a it's fear yeah it's fear and that in psychedelic show you that and so the way to trip and these centers that you're talking about and if they're really these centers were there then when someone started experiencing a difficult trip then these people would instead of getting them away from that baby in the best way possible try to turn the person to it like what is that fear is that fear real because the joy of a psychedelic is when you have the balls to go into the darkness and all of a sudden you realize that darkness was a complete illusion all the darkness and negativity and spooky shit and guilt and fear and crap you thought was inside you and all the bad things you thought you've done and all the things that you feel terrible about secretly you realize that's nothing it's an illusion the universe loves you you're completely embraced by the entire universe you're an incremental part of the functioning of the cosmos and you're an incredible wonderful perfect fucking thing and when you get a glimpse of that it's the greatest feeling ever because you're healed because that's what true healing is man true healing is realizing you are never sick in the first place true healing is realizing you were just you just had some fucking eye you got a little bit of dust on the windshield man you know that's all and that's and that's what psychedelics do for you and you know what else does that for you really good therapy but really get therapy cost a lot of money it takes a long fucking time and you have to be open to it yeah it open to change and smart and you have to have the ability to recognize your own faults yeah some people just have this weird shield between them and reality where they've become successful because they never admit guilt and they just press forward and they rationalize every single thing they do right press forward and that becomes a mindset just as much as you know what we're talking about yeah that becomes just how how work is done you know and that's how militaries work that's the only way they work they you have to fall into a mindset yeah well yeah that's how I mean that's the thing we're all we've all fallen in don't mindset and a lot of the fundamentalist Christians they've fallen into these rituals and patterns but they don't have a real connection anymore so they're faking it or they're actually just like taking cues from like really charisma radical lunatics wouldn't it be awesome if the military really was our bravest and boldest who wanted to protect us and who were led by the the most moral and intelligent people on the planet yeah and that these really truly war heroes and in case some shit goes down there never puppets they're only heroes there's no doubt whatsoever that they're only doing the right thing wouldn't it be beautiful yeah they'd be like celebrities would that be beautiful well you know they should be they real most of them really want to be heroes you know most of them really want to protect it's the people that are putting them there those are the problems the people that are pointing in that goes those are the bad guys go get them I'll be over here with a pencil to write down how many you kill and if you do a good job I give you a shiny piece of metal and I stick it to your fucking chest ah no it's so fucking sad man it's so saddened and disturbing and you it's like it's it's so easy to get caught up in that you know it's so easy to get caught up in the macro of the of the darkness that's in the world but man I think that the trick is to like only spend a little time on that and spend more time fucking working on the real basic things in your life that you can do right now to like to make things a little better like because a lot of people will focus on chemtrails when they need to be focusing on stopping smoking like I I had a person describe chemtrails to me smoking a fucking Marlboro life talking about man they're fucking dropping this shit on us that's sickening us making us stupid it's like dude you know you're inhaling you're inhaling cancerous smoke but created by a fucking corporation that's making money that's making money killing who cares about some fucking chemtrails brother you got to stop smoking personally way worse it many more people are dying from cigarette smoke they're dying from chemtrails yeah that's so silly so those are the steps but people it's a really simple thing to do you get caught up in the macro instead of being like you know what here's the thing you can try instead of worrying about chemtrails why don't you fucking get a good recipe book of like a while recipe book try eating raw for a few days and see if that makes you feel better cut out some fucking uh cut out eating processed food for a few days not forever just for a few days as well the issue is there a lot of them are really misinformed and they really do believe that there's this constant aerial bombardment but one of the reasons why they believe it is because they have done some chemical spraying on people and have done it against people's will it's a fact sure you know it's not it's I don't believe it's happening every day I think a lot of what people are seeing is called contrails it's a natural thing that happens when jet engines encounter moisture in the atmosphere is explained to me by a pilot and great D yeah but let's go fight the chemtrail pilots when we've got a clear head because we haven't been eating shitty food and and when we feel like fit because we've been exercising that's when we can start waging the real world way my point is my time is the reason why they believe that there's chemtrails because there have been chemtrails there really happened the government has experimented I don't think they're doing it all the time but it has happened there's not only has it had has it happened but in certain states like Georgia I forget what state it is anyway the point is that it's it's literally like written into insurance laws like there's there's things about you know like chemicals spraying that like you know you and insure against them I I believe I'm you know I'm speaking out of out of hand right here because I don't know the exact details of it it seems a little blurry in my mind right now I'm trying to pull it up but I remember whatever it was this little piece of legislation whether it was a something about insurance or not whatever it was it was written down it was essentially saying that there will be weather controlled experiments yeah that there they will do something to alter the weather and we know that in Abu Dhabi they made it rain 50 times last year Wow so they essentially made it rain once a week with a plane flying over but I think it's aluminum oxide and barium or supply I forget what it is that they they spray into the air but they spray it and somehow or another it makes these clouds form and it makes it makes rainfall in the desert in Abu Dhabi man it's amazing I mean it's incredible so if we know that they're doing that well they gave people learn how to do it over there is my point they probably practice some shit here and they they you know and they probably been doing it here in in small doses for a long time you know we I mean like pretty much anything that I found about the government doing I wouldn't be that surprised like no matter you say syphilis you're talking about the Tuskegee yeah they fuckin blasted Vicki what is the exact details that they inspected I think what I was was they told some that they're being treated and they weren't being treated with any medication they lied to them to see the degenerative effects of the disease sued on this century of the self thing there there's they were interviewing the fucking main psychologists for the CIA during the 60s and the 70s and he's just talking about all the shit they did with LSD experiments where they like white people's pasts away they would blast you on acid and give you electric shock therapy to try to fucking erase your personality like they've done all kinds of crazy shit and they probably are continuing to do crazy shit and there's a really good chance that when you're driving through any public space you're being bombarded with subliminal messages and all the billboards that you're seeing that are turning you into a mat and uh into a fucking rabid consumer that only wants to eat and drink and it doesn't ever want to think about anything more than getting a raise and getting drunk at night and it may be that this is all intentional but what I'm saying is if you worry about that too much then you're not going to do your dishes and you're going to have roaches in your fucking apartment and then you're going to start feeling depressed and then you get really caught deep in the trap to the first thing you have to do is like come to your senses that's the first thing and the easiest way to come to your senses is to like stop taking the fucking stop putting the pills in your mouth you know and they're like movies about mental asylums inevitably the hero will always start putting the pills under his bed and have that little line of pills under his bed and all of a sudden he's come to his senses again and he can plan his escape but until you fucking stop taking the pills you can't plan your escape so it's like okay yeah maybe there's some fucked up shit happening in the world but you got to stop smoking maybe there's some fucked up shit happening in the world but you should run a few times a week maybe there's fucked-up shit happening in the world but you need to take a shower brush your teeth floss get so that your get clean and healthy and then when you have more of a clear head then you can start making real moves and really analyzing what may be happening but until then you're all foggy and fucked up when you see more don't you want to go dude yeah yet about the government yeah alright take care of yourself so yeah you got a deal with a fucking tyranny and yourself you got a deal with the fucking demonic senators and congressmen inside of you that keep telling you to eat a fucking cheeseburger and a bag of Doritos before you go to bed stop those fucking people first veto their bills that are coming from inside your heart is a self hate thing is that it I don't care about my own safety thing it's just I'm obsessed with my goals I'm obsessed with my interest I don't care about my own personal safety to the point where I'm just gonna over feed myself yeah at low rational thinking just completely given to impulse it's a fuck what do I mean I think what it is is it's like it's a literal rut it's like you've been going in this circle for so long that you can't get out you're like a truck whose wheels are stuck in the mud so you just start stuck in this endless pattern that's what we do humans get stuck in patterns you know totally and so the idea is to get knocked you got to knock yourself out of that pattern somehow and the quickest way to do that is with a psychedelic if you don't want to take a psychedelic then just seriously start I know this sounds super happy start fucking juicing drink health eat healthy just eat healthy I don't care what you eat eat fucking healthy Vitamix don't shit juice three days Vitamix is the shit vitamins everybody makes his way better doing that right now right yeah I I just I got this fucking ah it's the best way to force yourself to eat a ton of vegetables dude you just drank it you know you think about like how much I eat I have up one big cucumber like six stalks of celery five big giant Leafs of kale and a big chunk of ginger and a pear and I just blast all that shit there's no way I'm gonna sit and eat all that look at ginger man so you know as you can throw in there that's good man fucking hell opinion it's so fucking good I've been work drop in how the scene is in the blender with almost everything I made I made a fucking chocolate mousse the other day and my blender news when I threw a jalapeno in there delicious kind of like spicy chocolate you can put in fucking anything you can put it in like you can put any way dude you need to show in the future you can do anything with a jalapeno I'll opinion my asshole today good chop what is this laptop you could be as flash jalapenos jalapenos in the slide shop I gladly do it you'd be like Duncan the jalapeno guy you can have my book I'm Duncan jalapeno please crazy I put it in my mouth and jalapenos inside tooth paste kills bacteria that even Listerine can't get to and this is like an ancient way that the Mayans used to clean their teeth they cheat on habanero peppers I love it I love imagine if that's true if it's like it kills all the poison well that's isn't that one of the things that uh Japanese people like to use wasabi with sushi because wasabi apparently has an effect on any any sort of bacteria right yeah I mean it's fucking blowtorch hardcore snort wasabi good luck I always fuck that up too man inevitably I take like a giant by detail of it I love wasabi I ate up a whole fucking jar of habanero salsa last night I had chips in this big jar of like it would from the moment I ate the first bite I was like god damn that shit is hot I couldn't stop a sweat you never get fire shits or anything oh yeah you just okay you're like all right no I'm gonna kill myself take it dude I do I fucking I get in a horse stance ride over the bowl I just think it as it like remember in the movie kung fu when the flaming pots in front of him one side as a dragon the other side as a tiger and he picks up the pot with his fourth I don't think it's a coincidence that I have a tiger on one arm and a fucking dragon on the other and I was a fan of the Kung Fu show okay well well how about that yeah it's like with I'm gonna get you sucker I stole that I stole that without even thinking about it it wasn't I'm just saying man I'm admitted I stole my tote bike my tattoos from kung fu but I think that's what the motivation was you hate conferring dude some kung-fu guys mad at me and said that the guard is actually called baby monkey it's called baby monkey it's guy so Arius it's really fun where do you find that because I already Bravo said to me any problems sent it to me it's a fucking hilarious you want to play it alright play I'll tell you what what part it cuz I tweeted it what part the guy starts talking shit about me but it's he's one of those dudes and this is this is truth listen there's a lot of people that got upset at me because I said things about kung fu and there's a lot of people because I said kung fu is kind of bullshit and a lot of it is just like a bunch of people practicing things like if I come at you like this what would happen I would move to the side and would attack this way it is it's it's it's like a one step you know in Taekwondo we step things called one steps and what it is is you know you would throw a kick and the other guy would counter and when it was is to imprint into your mind what to do once you start sparring and then actually you start sparring but when you start sparring that's when techniques really get weeded out and that's when you understand what is the most effective use of energy and force what techniques work the best what techniques are really truly applicable and what techniques are really kind of frivolous in a waste of time there's better alternatives well kungfu never did that they didn't have all the sparring they didn't they didn't have kung fu didn't like go and enter into an Ultimate Fighting Championship or it was public and everybody figured it out and it was spread out through the internet so there's the debate amongst all the minds of different martial artists whether they're kick boxers or wrestlers there is a genuine consensus when it comes to mixed martial arts and that genuine consensus is here's the school there here's the group of effective techniques this is what actually works yes you can will kick someone in the face absolutely it's difficult to pull off but you can wheel kick some of the face can you monkey fist them on the nose you can but that's not the best way to do it the best way to do is to jab and then one-two what's right what's Monkey Fist apparently there is no Monkey Fist apparently I made it up apparently it's leopard fist the guy told me there's no monkey for sure right there is no monkey face as leper fest but that's his style of kung fu because this dudes were also and were angry at me would talk man I hit you in the face with a monkey paw you're gonna be upset you know so I'm like you know so there's a monkey paw then there must be it must be real see in his in his style of martial arts it's real but in one kung-fu guy it's a leopard paw and that's the only technique that works I'm not saying that you shit won't work and it's definitely better than knowing nothing at all but as far as is it the best thing to practice no there might be some good benefit to it but if you want to look at the real true evolution of martial arts what it what is martial arts what a martial art is is an art where you figure out what is the best way to attack and disable a trained killer that's what you want to be good at you want to be good at beating trained killers you don't want to be good at beating people don't know what they're doing because that's what a lot of people are doing well a lot of martial arts are it's it's you're developing techniques that really will never work if you're fighting against Anderson Silva you're gonna get them off there is no best one the best one is all the effective techniques of all the martial arts it's TechEd takedowns from wrestling in judo kicking from karate and muy Thai Jiu Jitsu submissions from judo and Jiu Jitsu you know there's all these different things leg locks from Samba it's all of these and you don't have to have there's no correct combination of what to use some guys only use a few of the components but they have a very unusual physicality or they're very good at one of these aspects to the point where especially like a stand-up fighter like a guy like Anderson Silva that's his number one specialty stand-up and he's so good at it every fight starts standing up so he has an advantage at the beginning of every fight he has an advantage and if you can get to that spot you don't have to be like the best wrestler like Anderson is not taking people down I mean I'm sure he could if he wanted to but you very rarely see him taking people down he just blasts everybody you know so if you can get really good at certain aspects of it you know there is no exact formula what to do but as far as techniques there's a general consensus of techniques that work you know the basic kicks front kicks and round kicks there's the crazy ones Act kicks wheel kicks there's all this stuff works but you know what what doesn't work what doesn't work is like crane techniques when you're standing I mean it will work but it's better to box it's better to curl your knuckles up and blast them in the face it's better to kick them you know and to kick them correctly the best you got to go to assert I'll tell you one to go I think it's two minutes and four seconds go Logan yeah work for MMA safe comfortable use monkey fit non-playing Martha nonsense martial arts he's white there is no monkey fit there is a laugh at this but there's no monkey fit but I understand don't try to say all kungfu is nonsense your facts man I disagree the funny thing is Joe used the word monkey to laugh and mock income fool he's really honest don't know yeah no one used the monkey technique more than the MMA this late laughing this is Paul baby monkey is showing the Florida you will see baby monkey wear a lot of black talons of Marvin Munson waistline and the fact 65% of the time and that is exactly what MMA using the baby monkey 65% of the time inside the cage now who is the monkey here I have no problem of the word monkey me as long as it is a good technique like my monkey spending on lon monkey spinning on horses MMA fighter are strong and tough but don't be confused just because they do full-contact then they must be will martial artist do you think gangster people contact fighting then they must be all real martial artists absolutely not okay hold on teenage keep binder I think we might be getting trolled that feels like a troll yeah as I'm watching this under the influence of the sacred plant yeah like this guy's obviously reading off of something yeah he's ready not to decide I'm listening to it I'm like this guy it doesn't sound like it makes sense and then when he hits that armbar god dude he does that so slow that's a guy who's not a grappler at all he's not a grappler that guy doesn't know he's doing good one of the things was called monkey baby monkey well that might be a technique very well might be but it also might be a troll is why he mentioned my name cuz he knows I'm stupid and I'd bite ya right after it he he got me the fuck you and Sam sure baby monkey monkey wanker little Wow this technique is called baby monkey it's brilliant whoever did that congratulations did a good job well that it is real sir please come to Planet sorry tenth planet jujitsu in Los Angeles and I'd love to try out your baby monkey see if I could pass your baby monkey I wanna kiss your baby monkey I bet I could pass your baby monkey I'm just saying right now I mean I'm no I'm no killer I'm no Marcelo Garcia but I watched your role and I'm pretty sure I could pass your baby monkey that's all I'm saying challenge try your baby monkey on me man I'm gonna get some control I bet I'm gonna get side control damn this is hot okay fuck bro I don't give a fuck dude I'm gonna have to try that wack ass baby monkey I mean I'll show him what's up ten plants are Jitsu bitch and you know the other thing the music like if there was a meeting that video Joe there was one thing I thought it's funny but if he's cell you serious yeah if he's serious it's offensive to me cuz you know if he's serious I don't think yes but if he is serious it's offensive to all martial arts cuz that guy doesn't know he's doing the way he's hitting that armbar like Jesus clever now that he's hit an arm ball though the one thing though is he's hitting it like a kung fu guy because that's what the kung fu guys that's what I have a problem with kung fu guys react they do techniques they practice techniques as if the other person isn't going to react like to grab you and then I would pull you like this from this position you know and they they have all this nonsense like well how do you know the guys still gonna be there I know you have a game plan but it seems to me like you're this is like you're getting way ahead of yourself here stupid dude can I ask you a martial-arts question sure this happened a very long time ago I used to work at a summer camp and they would have like martial artists come every every term till like demonstrate martial arts to the kids and he was just some guy from like some local dojo or something and so he would get a kid and he is fucking head man he had like had he'd been shot like five times in the head he'd been taping in Vietnam he was really intense fucking guy been shot in the head really yeah yeah bike bull he he'd something he took something to that his head out of like shrapnel shrapnel so yeah shot in that pray not well so he um but you bring a kid down and he do this thing where he held the kid's wrist and he'd slap him in the neck knocked the kid out and then like they'd get the kid to stand back up again and I was something guy I've always liked from time to time wondered like what the fuck was that is that real well how hard did he hit the kid I just like a slap you know it's like it is not really hard no then it's bullshit so the kid was just like was that hypnosis what yeah it's a lot of it's a power suggestion a lot of people a lot of people dude and this is a very uncomfortable subject I think a lot of people have very weak brains just like some dudes have little dicks you know you ever seen a guy in a movie and like he has a little dick and you laugh it's so small you laugh there's there's people with little brains too they have a little dick part that's where that's what it is their brain just sucks that's that's it yeah and that's why when you go to see didn't you go with me to the the Boston comedy connection didn't you see the r-rated hypnotist with me now already went onstage now I didn't see that damn I wish I thought it was you Brian was it you were you there when the r-rated hypnotist no Muslim and Joey but the book but you know when you watch an r-rated hitman to show rest in peace mr. Frank Santos who is the guy discussing in a longtime friend very hilarious r-rated hypnotist but he would go on stage and he bring people and they would sit down and with the the smallest amount of work I mean close your eyes concentrate on what I'm gonna say I'm concentrating my breath I'm a three to one when I hit one you're gonna think you're with Madonna Madonna looks back when Madonna was hot but Donna is underneath you and she's naked and you're gonna have your wee-wee inside of Madonna on the count of one on three two one where are you John oh oh you see this guy who is just a normal person and was just 15-20 seconds ago he was just sitting there with his eyes closed and now this this guy really thinks he's fucking Madonna like I watch the guy coming his pants i watch two got coming his pants Frank Santos told him to come in his pants he's like oh you're not gonna be able to hold are you gonna come oh and the guy goes oh the guy came in his fucking pants he was embarrassed he was it wasn't an act he wasn't an actor he wasn't there's no way an actor could be that good I mean it was this it was the the look of confusion on his face when Frank cleared him up and sent him out of it and went back to his friend he'd have to be a great actor to come to make friends were laughing at him and dude you came with your fucking pants everybody was going nuts he went back to sit with his group he didn't believe what had happened he was like no I knew what I was doing I was new it is it the fuck you did dude like the they go into this trance I don't know how it works doesn't work on me this workout was like an old magic trick where like that dude was a really I think that's part of what that kind of hypnotism is I mean there's different kinds of hypnotism there's hypnotism where you can sit down and someone can put you in a very relaxed state where you are cleared of all your distractions and cleared of all your connections to the world and they talked you through this they talked you into a mindset where you're open to suggestion and where you're open to objectivity there's a that's a type of of hypnotism and it's a legitimate type of hypnotism and it does get you to a certain state but you're conscious of what's going on the whole time he's not getting you to suck his dick he's not telling you there's an elephant in the room it's gonna cut your head off you know he's not freaking you out with bullshit and nonsense and trickery he's just kind of guiding your thought pattern but there's also a type of hypnosis that doesn't work on everybody but it does work on dummies and yeah dummy hypnosis you give your a guy like Frank Santos you can get people to think they're having sex with Madonna in a stage on a stage in front of 300 strangers you really can do it I've seen it I don't understand it but I don't understand people that are lurch it to peanuts either yeah I don't I don't think the human body is it's not uniform is there some people that have a weird glitch it's like you know some some cellphones you can fucking hack into them you know with somebody else's cell phone but see here's the thing so if Frank Santos can make a man in Boston blast in his pants from four seconds of mild hypnosis hmm think what the fucking CIA can do to you if they've been studying this shit for like 15 or 20 years you know the thing the sacrifices they've made to and in the you know the name of progress when it comes to LSD they dosed a whole fuckin village in France including women and children they dosed their bread you know about that story how the Freedom of Information Act it was it was revealed like I don't know shit I want to say 2009 but I don't remember when the exact date it was revealed but the CIA did a fuckin LSD experiment in a small French town and dosed the entire town here I'll look it up CIA dosed French town acid yeah they didn't give a fuck here the CIA dosed an entire village with LSD yep incredible story back in the 50s an entire French village suddenly went mad it was not as previous the previously thought due to an ergot fungus contamination of the village baker's bread says investigative journalist HP a Barelli blah blah blah blah blah instead it was part of a CIA secret mind-control experiment with LSD in other words the CIA put a French village on acid to study them Wow Wow by the way they're responsible for the fucking Unabomber you ever watch that yeah I meant over the net that yeah yeah he was a part of the fucking LSD experiments at Harvard gee what a shocker what do you think there's a coincidence in that that one guy gets so crazy that he decides to make enough money as a mathematics professor to fund his attack on all the technology of the world and the way he's gonna do this to send bombs through the mail at people that are creating things well see that's the thing that's why you have to begin to ask yourself which components of my belief system are the things that I've arrived to naturally from my observation of nature and which parts of them are placed into me by a system designed to turn people into consumers and I think that more often are not a greater percentage of your personality than you would like his is not you at all it's a tapestry that's been cleverly woven by a system designed to make people feel totally normal spending the majority of their lives driving in a commute and working in a shit job and being tired all the time first of all let me just say that apparently this is this theory of the French town as also questioned some people don't agree with it some people don't think it's true well they were dozing fucking I they with Yeltsin soldiers they were dozing soldiers and they were dosing on whores were dropping it into their John's drinks that is a Rolling Stone article oh yeah yeah operation what the fuck was it called an operation midnight climax okay Rob the CIA ran a brothel in San Francisco in New York and they they dosed at John's because they couldn't find any willing participants and their LSD studies because unfortunately they gave people like Pepsi bottles full of shit and blew their fuckin brains out you know they weren't sure the dosage you know when I first started fucking around with LSD I wanted to know what would happen yeah risky son do a shot of whiskey and you'd actually do a shot of acid you know what McKenna described molecularly he said LSD has the power of an ant that could disassemble the entire Statue of Liberty in 30 minutes was that's molecularly that's what it's like that's how strong acid but imagine you like getting it into town and you don't know you're having it a lot of people that don't know that's the number one theory of the Salem witch trials the Salem witch trials has to do with the first thing they were saying about as previously thought it was an ergot fungus contamination of the village baker's bread apparently what happens is when you have a crop of like wheat or whatever the fuck it is any any kind of grain and you it freezes if they have a frost and then it when it thaws out apparently is susceptible to certain funguses yeah like it fucks up the plant and the plant gets contaminated sometimes by certain funguses and forgot when it contaminated the you know when they've live like done core samples of this this point in time you know whenever you know the 1600s whatever the Salem witch trials were and they found like these late Frost's that they think could have attributed to her got infection and then they found evidence of a got so they're pretty sure that when all these people went mad and crazy and they started burning women you know it's just like they just they just went they were whacked out on on their bread and they thought that someone was poisoning them yeah I really did think it was which class sure which makes much more sense than you know like it was just a religious thing it was just which is possible I mean we've seen horrible things done in the name of religion but when it's a whole group of them when it's all in one area and all those other pieces are in place there's a fucking psychedelic compound that makes you lose your marbles and it's in your bread of course that's what happened I mean it only makes sense why is this why is this one area think it's bewitched yeah because they were there was there was a fucking chemical bewitching you know they just blamed it on the wrong people they didn't blame it on the bread well how would they know how would they know yeah so these crazy assholes thought that these these women were witches you know they'd look at him all paranoid this fucking badgers why she's doing this to me you know really mean he's seeing giant mice attacking him with you know invisible swords you know he's seen all kinds of crazy shit everywhere he goes it's really strange to think that books have been written about how to torture witches there's a book you give her to the malleus Maleficarum Jesus no look that up the hammer what isn't cool it's called it's called them I believe the malleus Maleficarum it's called the hammer of the witches look that shit up it's a Delisle if akarin yeah I think it's malefic Hyrum I've I'm probably butchering the name but if you put that and you should find it and if that doesn't work put in dude fucking Internet it's amazing yeah and you spelled the shit out of it it still found it it's the way to spell correctly folks is the malleus ma ll e us7 ya ll e us and mela for karyam darien Maleficarum carom mel of a carom now if account is mal e fi CA r um and just get an approximation in that in Google and just finds it for the witches that's incredibly great look that was written during the Inquisition oh my god it's available on Amazon god I love the internet I'm gonna order that watch this watch this while we're doing the podcast boom bitches ordered that shit son 1996 Mon how dope is that I just bought an awesome but you after the witch trials though it they they still were eating the same bread though when they still be crazy you know like if that was true no because it didn't last for very long it's only for one season so you know for one season or whatever season that this happens where they get this grain and this grain is infected with the ergot that's the season where everyone's jacked and fucked up it didn't write but McKenna's theory was was I think more that it wasn't that these people were freaking out this is a macaron sir oh I know I just mainstream like I guess it was archaeologist Oh No mix that is that coal archaeology when you only go back a couple hundred years history he's gone I think that'd be Ark that could be Ark y'all I don't know I don't know I think there's a difference between historians and archaeologists I'd love to know but there I've read McKenna talking about how the getting rid of the witches was part of the transformation from the into male-dominated culture and that that was the burning of the witches was a representation of the shift from what is he he has a great name for it dominate her culture or something what does he call it yeah the shift from the the he was from eternal Society yeah material matriarchal mushroom society to a patriarchy that we're the way that you taught people is through like like the God of that society teaches people by beating the shit out of them and punishing them forever it's not the way that a mother is supposed to be and so the witch trials were they shift from one form of nature based religion into a new form of religion where people started worshipping the invisible like freak homophobic that could be possible but the other finding I think was after it was like I think it was even after McKenna was dead McKenna I believe died in 2001 I think this was I think they discovered this a little later so it's kind of clear I think it's just combinations because they're worried it could be that there were women back then who were practicing right it could be they would have never killed the witches if it was like a balanced society they were just good oh you're fucking witch oh no you're not oh my god it's not acid or something you know they wouldn't like get together with pitchforks and fucking torches maybe it could be they were already pissed off at chicks and then when they got on the acid or the ergot rather they'd be like well this is a fucking this is a perfect time to kill all these bitches yeah you know it could be that it's the last straw well you know it's a weird thing man when you know the whole idea of happiness and pleasure is a lot of it revolves around people wanting to be around you and a lot of it revolves around the opposite sex wanting to be around you and for most of us you know the reality is most of us are not that attractive you know this is you know this not that many people that are like really attracted to you and for a lot of people their life is a constant series of rejections and especially from women guys they're dumpy they have no self-esteem they'd get a couple drinks in them and you think maybe we argued over good good you like say something awful knowing you know like really it's just like a lack of confidence like people would say that they're a dickhead but really a lot of it is like a pre-emptive attack because you think eventually this person's gonna destroy your soul because that's your experience with relationships that's your experience with interacting with women every time you've attempted to interact with women they've let you know that you're repulsive you know thank you it will get away and that programming just enters into this guy's the definition of what a woman is of what you know who you are you're the person who brings the bad feelings you're the person who brings this horrible horrible sure right right you get a few drinks ago some have low in response to win yeah where you're pissed and you're fuckin all of a sudden you're like using tricks from the game to try to say shitty things to girls to like dis the other discombobulated them and somehow like trick them into fucking you yeah instead of just getting them to have sex with you because they like you because you're a good person you're fuckin cool well I don't think people can realize that and part of the reason why people can't realize that it's cuz people are selfish you know I have a friend and I will remain nameless but we had a conversation where he was he was getting dumped and he was super upset about it and he didn't know how to deal with it he was asking me for advice and I said do you love this girl and he said yes and I said well if you love her you should want her to be happy and if her being happy means her being with another man or another person you should respect that and you should love her still I go this is just a human being and people break up and I don't hate everyone I used to date in fact with time I loved all of them even the ones that I didn't get along with man when I look back on every single girl that I ever dated I swear to god I only will allow the positive thing I have some negative stories that are really funny and I tell them but in my mind when I'm thinking about that person I only think about them when I loved them I only think about them whatever no matter what went wrong you know no matter what you know what what horrible thing was said you know that made the whole thing fall apart I refuse to define them by that and I instead define them by their potential by what what they meant to me when they were at their best but it's really fucking hard to teach people that man it's really hard to over and over again realize when you fall face for it into the face first into the fucking dirt that you're thinking is incorrect and that it's not empowering and you're not helping yourself or anyone else and in fact you're devaluing yourself into this person's eyes because you become desperate and you have no personal sovereignty a man that can't be with a woman without a woman when a one and doesn't want to be with a man is a repulsive thing you know we've all seen it man it was an episode of fear factor we had this week where this there's this poor guy and his wife didn't want to have nothing to do with him anymore they divorced and she was fucking you know just living her life and they were still connected because they had to kid together and she would just mock him openly and publicly and she had no desire to fuck him again and she was kind of just ready they're ready to make fun of him and it hurts it hurts watching it man it hurts your fucking soul it cuts into you you see it you go this poor fuck he doesn't even know he's just trapped in this horrible pattern and this person has become a drug dispenser a negative downer drug this person gives them a depressing drug every time they see them it's crazy it's amazing it's cut yeah the bonds of Maya that's it that's one name for or you get entangled in the illusory aspect of the universe and you don't even realize it and then you're just fucking in pain but you're the reason you're in pain it's so sad but it's real and it's like it's a it's a plague and and but it's also kind of cool man those kinds of prisons thought prisons are the best prisons to get into because you have the key you get out of it though but one of the things is you can't be selfish because of you are selfish you always want that person to be with you you know and this is what I was saying to my friend I was like dude she does not want to be with you you'll have to accept that yeah you have to accept that this is a human being and if you love this human being you should want this human being to be happy and your definition of love is this only I only love this human being if this human being provides you with the sex drug provides you with the sex chemical you can't just accept the fact that she wants the sex drug from someone different her genes are compelled to fuck someone different than you and whether it's become because you have personality shortcomings or physical shortcomings it's not her responsibility her responsibilities is to go towards what she enjoys and what she's attracted to but we are so selfish that no one ever thinks that way well but also man aside from like letting someone have a happy life and not trying to manipulate or control them into being stuck with you the other thing is it's so much better for you to be with someone who really likes fuck yeah you know my god guys who want to like change a chick you know my god dude some savage is gonna come along and fuck her and a laundromat okay that's gonna happen Yuki you can't either well everyone needs to be extremely attracted to each other everyone needs to be extremely whether it's just on track attracted to each other's minds which is personality whether it's physical whatever it is there has to be a because if there's not if you don't have that one of two things is happening either you're not putting that out enough you're not a dynamic enough human both with your consciousness or with your objectivity or with your love or with your affection or with your your your generosity you're not putting out enough not working and if you're not putting that out enough people don't want to give it back to you so this this beautiful attractive healthy vibrant generous loving person won't be attracted to you because you don't want to enhance them you want to draw and take away from them and so you rely on wounded animals and it's just one more wounded animal after another wounded animal that's all you ever get because it's all you're attracting you're attracting wounded animals because those are the only ones that are stupid enough to fucking fall into your web yeah that's true man and also a lot of those systems the pickup systems are designed to trap wounded animals sure exactly yeah so it's like really you just prey on the vulnerable and the time because the the value of sexuality is it's such a it's a value it's very important like that you need it like it will make you feel better you know it will it's your medicine you gotta go you you know yeah but you know they're there let's get it on like Marvin Gaye son I'm your medicine open up and let me in it is a fucking drug man darling you're so great I can't wait for you to operate boom get up let's make love tonight wake up we go cause you do it right that guy was a bad motherfucker dude

nothing special compared to Marvin the fucking gang you're a regular guy you made a sign that's a motherfucker you made assume that his songs they play them without them words in elevators and people sing along to the music his fucking songs are so good that when you're in an elevator and a Muzak version of let's get it on comes on you can hear him sing you can hear it you can hear it he's a bad motherfucker dude he imprinted the consciousness and this guy couldn't deal with it so he shot his own son that's thing I didn't want to play the game so he picked up the board he threw it away yeah but win couldn't win the game unplugged it fucking Xbox shoot your own kid oh god okay what he did you fuck someone fucked up it has to be you two unless your kids a murderer unless your kids coming at you with a fucking sword and trying to you know he's on PCP yeah okay I get it you gotta do what you gotta do and you shouldn't you know your own kid makes accuser automatically a fucking idiot right oh my god yeah something happened on which is why it's fucking weird the story of Jesus it's like you're gonna send your fucking kid down to a planet a savage fucking but you don't understand he died for our sins oh oh no I somehow or another we could still sin but we get forgiven if we tell him if we embrace him when you get forgiven yeah you're allowed to still sin you could totally fuck up but at the end you have to like really realize and and really embrace Jesus as your God so what are you saying to do that once you do is a crazy leg escape clause it's like you know some corporations don't have to pay any taxes at all yeah you just fuck everybody over and match brilliance until you know what kind of loophole is that that's ridiculous well they just have to pay the right politicians and this loophole the death loophole is you can just fucking rape and pillage your whole life yeah but if you find Christianity at the end like general butt naked from Liberia you know that story there's Shane Smith yes on the pot guys are directly responsible for the death of thousands of people no by thousands be lying naked he killed babies and ate their hearts yeah ate their still-beating hearts okay and he's a Christian and because it's a Christian they didn't even prosecute praise God how amazing praise guys got God so beautiful God is gonna put him in heaven but not like a regular person who's born in the jungle Brazil and is good his whole life and only does good for his tribe and its family and you know and has great respect for the earth that guy's the earth that country respect for the earth I don't respect the origina snooze bag is going right to the fucking oven do it dude do you know about dispensations you know what disciplines to either called dispensations do you know about this no what is it yeah and I may be saying the word wrong but you used to be able to buy from the Catholic Church - bishops used to be do it yeah you could buy it say you like you could save yourself you could buy like no matter what you're going to have it like I gave you this much money huh so I'm set like here's like you know whatever - two hundred thousand bucks I'm cool right no matter what I do for the rest of my life I'm still going to have like yeah you're fine you gave enough money now you're fine that's hilarious it's amazing that's the cat that's brilliant like the Catholic Church you know funny that is to like come up with a trick like that when you start realizing like wait a minute I can just write down on paper the people are going an imaginary place forever and they'll get me thousands and thousands of dollars in gold and diamonds that's incredible it's incredibly talking seriously about like the Tooth Fairy like if we were having a conversation about the tooth fairy people are willing to die for that tooth fairy yeah they're willing to kill you yeah just degrading that tooth fairy Andrew and to ruin their lives they're what they're willing to they're willing to not use birth control they're willing to not wear condoms and fucking bring kids into the world that they didn't even want to have for that Tooth Fairy they're willing to do a lot of crazy shit for that Tooth Fairy and there's a wide spectrum of crazy and it varies from town to town Church cult to church cult and I think that there's like you know there's something that's an actual you know I think there really is a I don't know what you call it but I do think there's like a super consciousness you can tune into that will give you some direction in the directions usually don't be an asshole well that's why I was saying that the morality of the universe would tell you that you're not allowed to spray pepper spray in the face of kneeling children oh yes the morality of the universe would say these are peaceful people you have no right to do anything to harm them they have a legitimate griping concern whether the hand in the correct way is debatable but you you know though the morality of the universe the the true knowledge of what is right and wrong it's like instinctively instantly you realize that's an evil task and if that was your little girl that's your 18 year old girl idealistic first day and you know first year in college and this asshole is spraying her in the face with pepper spray you'd want to beat his brain flat you'd want to beat him to death if that was if if I saw that guy spray my baby in the face I would not be able to help myself it wouldn't if there was cars in the way if there was cops in the way I would have tried physically to get my hands on it here I would have to immediately stop myself it would be like a like a murderous animal-like rampage you would you would you would feel it from the bottom of your DNA that you would have to stop this person from doing that yeah meanwhile this guy's doing it because somebody wrote some shit down on a piece of paper yeah that's a detachment man that's a detachment from the the things that you do and the impact those things have and you could say follow by the word of the law and you could say will those fucking hippies weren't there you would never problem and while all these things are correct that's not the real issue the real issue is there's a detachment from the things we do and the effect those things have and that attachment that detachment is due to a lack of sensitivity which I think can be attributed to several things and a lot of it is contributed to awareness and our focus on awareness whether it's through yoga whether it's through meditation whether it's through isolation tanks whether it's through psychedelics what is through long walks where you sit by yourself in the alone in the park and you do an audit of your day and an audit of your true honest thoughts and try to be fucking real with yourself man and don't bullshit yourself so you can sleep better at night and think that you're doing the right thing every time and all you would have to do is imply though apply those ideas to life and everyone would be fine everyone would be fine could no one would ever start on just wars they would realize you can profit anyway there's always gonna be assholes out there you can profit on fucking tanks and you can profit on jets we need those yeah we do need those but we don't need that many and we don't need them everywhere we don't need a military presence in over 100 different fucking countries we've gotten completely out of hand those people making jets and making bombs and making guns I'm a hundred percent pro-gun I'd live guns and I think you should allowed to have consolute I'm Pro hunting and I'm Pro trapping I'm I'm pro all that shit man I I believe in the Second Amendment fully strongly support your right but but I think I just think we're at a stage right now where people are starting to realize that the stuff that's written down on paper is not necessarily serving the human beings that it's supposed to represent right and we just because it's written down on paper and because a bunch of people say it's written down on paper we are supposed to abide by it we're supposed to deal with it we're supposed to allow that cop to spray the chemical in the kid's face and not get beaten up and immediately thrown in jail like you should be like your instincts would be if any civilian did it and that's our real issue our real issue is we're we are operating under an archaic society we're using the wrong map yes we're using an old shitty map that worked at a different kind of terrain the terrain has changed now we need we need some new maps people have got to come up with new maps you don't just get the fucking luxury of using an ancient withered old map whatever the fuck the map is whether the map is your Bible or whether the map is the current version of the Constitution with all the amendments or whether the map whatever it is it's time to start making new maps based on the fact that we're now all connected when you see things like this new bill that's passed it turns America into a battleground and empowers that military to come in and in and and arrest civilians who are being disorderly and arrest anyone who is a threat and detain them anyone who they deem a threat that is the all the evidence that you need to know that it's over yeah that is the monsters clawing at the fucking at the head the gravestone is it pulls them underground yeah as the earth sucks them into its core the monsters are clawing as they're dragged down they are trying as hard as possible to gain ground yeah one way they're gonna do it is completely violate the Bill of Rights when one way they're going to do it is to make the Constitution invalid and that's what they're doing and they're doing it under the guise of patriotism and protection and you're like protection from what you fucks but see that's why that's why there what has to happen is people need to start continuing to take like the action they're taking with Occupy Wall Street but we need a fucking super genius or a group of super geniuses our collective of people to come up with a new map for how this shit should be working you know what I'm starting to think what this is what I'm starting to think is gonna happen I used to think there's gonna be some sort of a violent upheaval there's gonna be real problems I think that there's going to be people on the Occupy side that are far too intelligent to be ignored and that eventually they're gonna figure out some vulnerabilities to the system and then they're gonna have some power and once they have some power then people are gonna talk and then they're gonna have to work something out and change some the laws yeah change some rules because until there's some sort of a threat from the other side you know and doesn't have to be a violent threat it could simply be some fucking computer geniuses who know how to rework everything now to shut down the fucking Internet whoo now to make things invalid and unfunctional yeah it could be people who know how to manipulate you know money through through the internet who the fuck knows you know I mean with it's gonna be deemed a terrorist act whatever it is you know anything I mean that's really what that bother by the Patriot Act you know anything you're doing to attack the government now is like a terrorist act Yeah right I bet me even suggesting that someone may try to do this makes you under suspicion are you extrapolating and looking at history and you're looking at human behavior and you're looking at this situation knowing that it's gonna escalate well what could happen I think someone's gonna figure out a way to have some power over the occupiers but saying that by saying that it's almost like I'm cheerleading like I could become an enemy by saying that which is amazing you I'd say you're a little this is always there's an Orwellian it really is I mean it's it's amazing that life is now more fucked up than fair fucking people come out you know like the people who like are looking under their car because they're tight they got a flat tire like a what's that fucking box there and they pull the box out from under their car and it's some kind of magnetic bug and some people stuck on their car in the middle of the night tracking and then they come and get it then they come and collect it you know like that guy who popped it so what's cool about this Carrier IQ shit Brian you just said an update on this Carrier IQ what was the update again what'd they say that the FBI will not release any any records on this Carrier IQ shit yeah they won't comment on it I mean like the the the guys that from the company are there you know talking saying that they've never given it their information to the FBI right but the FBI will not comment whatsoever and they refused Freedom of Information Act requests Yeah right because it's an ongoing investigation saying don't have their fucking power there's so much power yeah it's so much better carry right and you know did the best way to abuse power is to say that we're doing it for your own good we're for your own good you trust us listen we need this power in order to get the bad people you know you're a good person trust us we just need this little provision to do it what's a terrorist exactly Oh some guy sells twenty joints Newt Gingrich yeah 200 joints Oh two hundred doses he's a terrace and he should be put to Jeff yeah someone who can grows plants these are the fucks that want to run our world man really that's why we did that Ron Paul guy even though he doesn't believe in evolution I've heard some the problem with work I mean I don't I talked about this in the lavender hour about Ron Paul and we got some people riding in that like shit that I didn't investigate fully I like I said I like what didn't universe is issues something about how he would get rid of the highway systems or something like he doesn't want to support like um he must go back to buggies no it's not bad it's in fact of Huggies horse running he wants to go back didn't know is some kind of thing there was a few things that were a little that I didn't know that because I really love the guy what are the ones that need to be more that's the problem I meant to go and investors you got upset at something that you don't remember no I remember they said Ron Paul would somehow get rid of the interstate system Ron Paul interstate system I couldn't find it you couldn't I don't I I don't think so just and then also the evolution think Interstate Commerce Clause is that it I don't I don't know that's something different I think but I love him right now I still like him so I don't know I'm sure there's some weird shit about him I guess if he doesn't believe in evolution that is fucked up man maybe he had a religious experience maybe ate some bad bread one day trip the fuck out I love people who's got an insight to people who believe the earth is 5,000 years older than some of the funniest fucking people out there there's a there's a big move for Ron Paul right now man he's moving with this Occupy Wall Street thing Ron Paul is fucking exploding Ron Paul is neck-and-neck with Newt Gingrich right now in the Iowa poll that is unprecedented people people they aren't expecting this did you hear all these other guys are falling apart that's the crazy thing about these dummy Republicans all of them slowly but surely are showing that they're morons first was Herman Cain is fucked everyone and then it's Rick Perry who can't remember anything and then it's you know it's fucking Mitt Romney he's got way too much moderate Perry shit fucking internet video about celebrate Christmas well yeah but you know we we know the gays want to get married yeah we can put gays in the military gays in the military we are celebrate Christmas meanwhile he's wearing the same jacket from Brokeback Mountain the same jacket the Heath Ledger war in Brokeback Mountain you almost wonder if his stylist has a sense of humor yeah you know I mean how brilliant would that be if

someone behind the scenes it's a $1.99 per Center and they don't like it they don't like it it's a whistleblower yeah man there's a there's definitely like little clues out there he's desperado and what it is now it's like one of those shows where it's about to get cancelled so they bring in a black character you know we need a nutty neighbor and he's a rapper you know or you know whatever they did just panicking right now this is a death spiral but they're all like all of them seem like they should be on Jerry Springer they don't seem like they should be running for president he seemed like just freaks and well Newt Gingrich is a clown and guilty of ethics violations and you know he was accused of over 40 different ethics violations and serves divorce papers to his wife dying of Kenya it's just so much that I don't like about him and one time this is but by the way this is the one thing that really sticks in my mind think about this Newt because this really sticks in my mind you really are Betty listen there was a kid that in one of those MTV shows that came up to him and said boxers or briefs and instead of having any sort of a sense of humor he's like that is a stupid question and I'm not gonna answer your stupid quite like the way said it's like demeaning to the kid I can authoritative figure the kid should have said bitch and just cracked him right in the face like you wouldn't a jungle you all rotten look at right now I'm old rotten tomatos sitting on a fucking windowsill yeah rotting in the Sun you're getting fresh with stupid that's a stupid question

different times you force things through that other people weren't comfortable yeah they've got this is the thing about Obama man that I think about Obama whether or not you like him or not I think
