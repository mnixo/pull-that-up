five four three two one hey Phil hey what's going on not much how are you I'm good how are you I'm great wonderful we're a little fucking high right bummed I was thinking about going to Hawaii the other day and in his fucking you know happen I'm like of all the times I was there I owe you were there when it happened it was in lanai I was on one of the other islands did you feel the earthquake no I didn't feel it it's you know it's separated by quite a lot there's a lot of water and the way the big earthquake happened actually after the plane took off so we were in the air when the big one hit yeah which it's apparently a big one like a five nine I think more than that was it 600 right they had a big one and then they had a fucking really big one I'm five nines big I think the way it works I'm sure someone will correct me here I think the way it works is a five six is like really powerful but a five seven is twice as powerful then the five eight is twice as powerful as that so when you get up to seven like that's some world-changing shit actually 6.9 oh my that's insane oh my god imagine being on the icon is that powerful that's so big that's such a big earthquake man did you see the I put it up it's so funny dude you put up anything that's from CNN and people want to put it up for a verifiable swords not CNN CNN's bullshit it's a video you fucking asshole it's a video of lava eating a car yeah but do you think CNN faked it what I'd like to see I like to see conclusive evidence at CNN's not full of shit and then I'll go to their website stupid - people are so goofy they're so goofy with this fake new shit it's lava it ain't a car it happened did you see the video yeah wait the white car yeah pull this shit up I I think it's cool that that cards forever gonna be in rocks like when we all died in like the future like people can like find this car oh it's it's broken down to the bare elements at this point I'm assuming it just got completely melted I wonder they say that stuff is 2,000 degrees and it's so hot but it's molten rock so like if it didn't burn through your feet or I give you if you weren't flammable at all for some strange reason you could actually walk on it yeah I'm like what like I thought you'd just sink in it but no and apparently it's cooling like right out of after it gets out of the surface this is so crazy this is like a monster so we're watching this lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island I like how Jamie went with CBS news folks you know bro folk that food news actually Brandon Clement got the video Oh powerful Brendon Clement but this guy whoever is a bad motherfucker cuz look what he was next to he was filming this I mean he was near this thing oh my god like imagine being on that street and staying what kind of a crazy fuck you have to be to be on that street and stay and then it's 6.9 hits during all this that's so big that's such a crazy earthquake but they live on a volcano I mean it's one of the reasons why a lot of people don't want to live on the Big Island so shit like this yeah that splatter one's crazy that there's a fissure in this neighborhood there's a subdivision out there and something estates I forget what it is but their fucking neighborhood dude though the ground opened up in their neighborhood I mean if you lived you know thousands of years ago this would be an angry God coming to attack your village could you imagine if normal days you're in Hawaii you're in one of the most beautiful places on the planet you're just chillin and the Sun is perfect and you see in the ocean you're hearing the seagulls and you see dolphins and shit and then the ground opens up in hell starts pouring out eats your house eats your Mustang fuck and they were talking about it today in the news of life there's nothing we can do there's nothing I thought I can't pour water on nope can't do shit you're not gonna stop it it's too big they apparently stopped it from doing something in like Iceland and they had to use billions and billions of Gao of water to halt the progress of the lava forget what it was that wasn't that big plume is in the air and you couldn't fly anyway I believe so and that is also that plume being in the air which restricted flying is all tied into the death of that journalist michael hastings do you know that oh that crazy conspiracy theory it's one of the weirder ones man it's one of the weirder ones this guy michael hastings was this sort of renegade journalist type character and he went to Iraq or Afghanistan I want to say Iraq but it might have been Afghanistan he went there with the troops and he got stuck there because of that volcano so because he was stuck there everybody got comfortable with him being around they started saying crazy shit they start joking around about Obama stuff like that and he put all this in the article and when he put all this in the article that general had to resign and he was like one of the most popular and most powerful generals in the army then shortly thereafter homeboy decided to go 120 miles an hour down sunset and slam into a tree in his car exploded and yes and everybody's like it's a fucking murder its assassination and then there was all these tech guys that were coming out and they were saying listen you absolutely can hack a car and change the direction change the the what what the car does take control of the car you absolutely can do that and they were like abso absolutely he's like absolutely it's like absolutely 100% you do it do you have we know these people there's videos of people falling asleep and they're Tesla's alright the car just drives you there you get on the highway just drives you we know that's real it turns it'll turn it'll make turns for you it'll park they've cars the park you don't think that they can that they figured it out a long time ago say hey wouldn't it be cool if we could just tap into that and make this motherfucker drive into a tree or star you know they didn't they would be so incompetent that I don't want to hear any conspiracy theories ever again because if the government didn't look at that stuff the if the government like this assassins didn't look at that go buh-buh-buh-buh-buh hold on a second so you telling me if the head of in a car and had some Mercedes we can hack into that car and make that motherfucker drive off a cliff we can do that okay well let's do that fucking a hundred percent those people all day are trying to figure out way to kill bad guys you don't think they would think that of course they would so that's the the scary thought but then the other possibility is homeboy was loses mine because of the pressure which is entirely possible you always have to like look at everything you gotta look at all sides you really do it's so it's so easy to just pick a side on any story or a conspiracy theory or anything even a political opinion so easy to just dig your heels in but on this one you got a look at this guy they definitely found amphetamines in his system they said and that's not uncommon for writers writers love adderall they fucking love it apparently I have a friend who's a journalist says everybody who's a journalist is on adderall obviously he's exaggerating the one guys out there look no boo folk not fucking me but um who was it that was a doctor oh my friend dr. rowdy McKee the the stem cell doctor from Vegas he was telling me about people that were taking adderall like when he was in college and he's like holy shit is my breath smell no no you see throws me mr. egress trips okay dude I'll fucking take one we flipped it right dude but he was saying that when he was in college is like a market change in everybody's performance once they started doing the adderall I believe it Jamie gave it to me he gave me a little tiny piece allegedly maybe not maybe I just made that up officer I don't know what that was I don't know what the fuck that was I don't take it either way I'm scared of it I'm scared I'm I take it and go yes this is what I need right like the same same reason I'll buy scared of coke I've never fucked with coke I like coffee too much I like it I drink it but I'm not even tired I'm just looking for a cup of coffee like come on have a cup of coffee it'd be nice right now I feel like a crackhead like cracky when I'm on adderall like the whole time gonna make you talk too much uh I've only done like three times but I remember I tried to do it and go on stage and it was awful I felt like I was on cooking my timing was all like jitter GTG jitter well you gotta take into account like there's the way you feel before you go onstage and then there's the way you feel on stage so the adrenaline you take into account that that Adrenaline's gonna be there it's gonna mix in yeah I did modafinil once did modafinil on stage there was a weird little balancing act that's that provigil stuff right it was weird it was like whoa this is weird you know you better off sober you just but the thing about those pills apparently is you get used to it and then you get used to that juice you know you used to just fucking having the energy to get shit done come on Brian let's start a fucking business come on Brian let's organize we've got to make a non profit that carries the same name as everybody gets super super fired up but you can get a lot of shit done that way so that's the thing with journalists apparently according to my friend just like dude everybody's on it they're all on it and they write like maniacs they just fucking pound the keys but it makes sense take your pills documentary on Netflix that's what they talk about - I need to see that percent of kids a nice high school college taking it - stick it through mm-hmm well I think it's a performance-enhancing drug so here's the question is it worse than drinking I bet it isn't and we don't have any problem with all those kids drinking the question is are they gonna get addicted to it more easily than they would get addicted to drinking because you don't have this I mean oh I don't know but I'm assuming you don't have nearly the same kind of hangover right it's how does it affect your liver in comparison to like alcohol because I think adderall and that kind of shit might be worse in that aspect I think we'd see a lot of bodies if it were I think there'd be a lot of dead people I really do this is what I think I think it's one of those where's the bodies thing like where's the bodies where's the bodies you know where are they it might be one of those things all you don't want to do louder somebody's gonna have heart attacks and Dali are you sure you sure everybody's not already doing it booze like there was a fucking stupid article that I was reading about the keto diet it was so dumb who's so poorly written and uninformed because they were talking about a study they did where they took people and they put him on a keto diet for four days and their athletic performance decreased and then they even included the caveat this could possibly be because of the keto flu which is something that sometimes people get when their body goes into before your body goes into ketosis takes a long time to switch your body off from a lifetime but burning carbs to burning fat the real health benefits and athletic performance if any all happen after your body gets through this transition area period so they did study about four days of the diet like who gives a shit why would you do that that's not how it works it takes weeks before your body even totally transitions over and then even then the benefits include increase rather over months misses plenty of science on this stuff like the people that have had on the podcast had talked about it like Dom D'Agostino and all the studies that he's done on it Peter Adio who's on the other day he's like real scientists who were like the data is out there you could look at it it doesn't work for everybody in terms of like the benefits of it but you don't do it over for days and why so they're saying it's dangerous potentially dangerous diet it's fucking food it's not dangerous you know what's really dangerous eating this the same way most people eat every day you know what I was well I was watching a video with this guy from you know the company called flavor god it's a Spice Company he makes like really delicious spices and he had this video he went to a store and he just picked out a garlic salt like okay let's try this one right here and he picks it up and it says sugar in it sugars the third ingredient in fucking garlic salt so I go home after I watch this video I pick up the garlic so I'm like that looks like the shit that I have in my house I pick it up it's under garlic salt it has fucking watch sugar it's like the third or fourth ingredient is sugar I'm like you gotta be kidding me they put sugar and garlic salt these monsters that's insane that's that's not right dude these monsters is he selling it as a spice or is it sake garlic salt on says it's a regular it's a big company it's a green it says garlic salt his stuff is just garlic and salt and real spices and whatever this flavour guy got so he's just pointing out like look man you're getting fucked over and I didn't know I had no idea I was pouring this dye put this stuff on my eggs I didn't know there's sugar in it that's ridiculous why would you put sugar and garlic salt you know don't call it garlic salt then call it Tony spices this is Tony spices I put a little at this I put a little of that you know what I like my grandmother always put sugar in everything fucking sugar that seems like that should be illegal should be illegal fucking asshole because if what if you can't have sugar it's never finger looking salt check every fucking label to make sure someone's not sneaking some sugar in on you creepy fucks speaking of creepy fucks do you hear about that nurse who is going to jail because she was infecting patients with H with hepatitis C she was infecting her hepatitis C blood into their medication why well she's crazy she's crazy she was giving them Hep C on purpose is what they're alleging at least here it is nurse allegedly use her own drug needles on patients leading to hepatitis C infections okay so I'd read it differently I'd read that she injected the medication with with their with her blood she had put her blood in the medication maybe that was just a shitty article I read but either way okay so what they're saying is she's suspicion of two counts of second-degree assault she's not been formally charged and her mother Eunice told the media at the news conference prior that her daughter wouldn't hurt a bug hmm so say Washington merge thiru nurse is accused of stealing narcotics and injecting to hospital patients with Hep C using the same needles that she used to inject herself okay so they're not saying she infected it with her blood their blood on purpose she just did something super irresponsible and used her needles on these patients so what she did was so what they're a legend is that she's using narcotics and she would get too much for the patients and give some to herself and use that same needle to give it to the patients probably because needles are tightly controlled because they don't you know they probably have to account for every needle missing so they don't give him the junkies and they probably have to account for all the narcotics so she would probably give them some of hers she says she intentionally contaminated medicine or other substance with her own blood see that's what I read see this is a different thing this is a different website you just pulled out your same intentionally contaminated medicine or another substance with her own blood then she administered the medicine medicine or other substance intravenously so the way she did it wasn't by putting her blood into the medication on purpose the way she did it was by taking some of their medication allegedly says I haven't seen ever any evidence that she would have that would prove that she intentionally infected anyone hmm yeah that's her attorney yeah um so go to the top because there was something about narcotics right I've read this um there's a book called dead doctors don't lie and it's all about this guy dr. Joel Wallach and it was all about mineral deficient diets and then how many people have mineral deficient diets because US farmlands are just totally overrun with you know you use the same land over and over and over again they're overrun from the crops like just drain the dirt so they have to add minerals to the soil they have to add shit to it and this guy dr. Joel Wallach was talking about how you have to realize like there's a lot of people out there that over time mineral deficient diets will show you poor health results right so he was going on about how little doctors know about health in general they know how to fix things but how little many doctors know about like good diet and what's important what kind of nutrients really need because they really don't spend that much time in school much less time than the average person who's sort of obsessed with it but then he started going on about how many doctors they find dead from overdoses and stories about doctors that just shot themselves up in a break room and tied shot locked themselves up in a bathroom and shot coke like if they're that tired and that warrant and they have access to coke I bet a lot of them did it especially when you could get if you get away with it especially they have that liquid coke and that in hospitals they're probably just huffing that stuff do they still have that liquid Co if they have lidocaine right but they have liquid what do they use the liquid coke for a numbing agent area well that's what lidocaine is right same thing though but I think blotto King gets you high I know this girl that used to I don't know if she made it but I always thought it was from a doctor it was I can inhaler type thing and she would just do that something or no no it was a nose thing like a spray nose thing like an flonase flonase for coat yeah and she would just do that whoa she's like she's just shoot liquid Coke I'm out yeah whoa that's how it sounds better for you then snorting oh no it's like moisturize I think the best way is apparently you chew those leaves you've done that now I've never even seen that before yeah the coca leaves that's apparently the best way but you never get that that's super rush it's like the difference between the sugar that you would get from Apple and the sugar you would get from some kool-aid like you drank a gallon of kool-aid homemade kool-aid we dumped extra sugar in there and stir that bitch up do you remember that how great was that what was your color what was your go-to god I've never met a cooling I didn't like I never drink one glass of kool-aid was like this cool it's bullshit the green one was always sweet they're fucking great I loved when the big guy with the pitcher burst through the wall - oh yeah kool-aid kool-aid just smash your house to give you he was so excited to see you and give you a sugary drink it would break your fucking house I did still around the kool-aid guy yeah is he on the mat on the package is still yeah that'd be funny if they made him thinner though you know to to like promote like no sugar or something like that like the change of time come on diet pills get kool-aid on the diet pills shot glass now add a row at all adderall at or wrong okay let's find out how many people die every year from adderall let's guess I'm gonna guess I'm gonna guess less than a hundred oh no no it's way more than that actually less than 100 100 in this country every year that's what I say I say 59 people die of adderall a year I'll say 21,000 the price is right it's just the chance you've taken yeah I don't have to go that hot sometimes go a little higher than you got how much is 859 people 69 okay 69 what do we got Jamie the first thing I found that said that there were 12 deaths associated to 7 to 16 year old boys in the Year 2005 and there's like articles about sudden deaths and 12 kids on adderall so just well yeah but that's like it's not showing for the year I don't know I think when you die on adderall they know where you live that come down they nuke your house they kill all the witnesses yeah nobody this that the money and adderall must be through the roof but look what you happen to CBD did you hear about this well I bet they have like the medicine companies have something to do with that they just made it a Schedule one for CBD did they really do that I thought they abandoned on that no I just read it the other day that with kratom to court rules CBD scheduled one compound cannabinol sales only where pot legal well that's just stupid CBD is it's got the most minor levels of THC and it has definite benefits especially when you put it on as a lotion that stuff feels a court appeals court upholds sea wheedies status at controlled substance well fuck you appeals court that's against the hemp industry also right that's a huge hit to him yeah across the board it's a huge hit to humanity it's just dumb that stuff's great for old ladies with arthritis it's so much better than a lot of medications you can take it in so many different forms you can take it as drops you could take it as a spray I take it as a point meant that I'll put on like I have a sore shoulder or some shit you put that stuff on it's fucking great I just got got some recently and my anytime my neck is sore from like laying weird or being in a hotel with a shitty pillow I put it right on like two minutes yeah loosens everything up it's amazing you know what I bet it would be great for like I must suck maybe get fucked up maybe too high someone give you a massage and CBD lotion I did it the other day yeah and and I got it in her vagina and I thought I thought it was gonna be bad like I was like oh maybe I should have done that and you know but this company CBD for life they gave me all these like they face lotions they have this stuff you put underneath your eyes like they have so much different kind of CBD stuff yeah Geno gave me some blue stuff it's like a roll-on you know like roll-on deodorant you put it on like sore elbow or something it's great yeah it doesn't do anything bad to you the fact these assholes decided that it'd be a good idea to make that illegal so dumb but if there's nothing wrong with it it reduces inflammation it's healthy that's it period doesn't do anything wrong so now you can't buy it anymore unless we buy in places where pots legal like we can still buy it because we don't live in the dark ages there's a lot of Dark Age states out there do you ever watch that show live PD I think it's called it's one of my favorite shows but it's so weird watching people get busted for like weed and you're like wait how old is this show oh it's live right now this is happening and and Missouri I know there's a bunch of spots we could still get like fully arrested go to jail you're a criminal Texas for pot yeah Texas they arrested Willie Nelson dude they pulled Willie Nelson off his tour bus you know that's like shooting a bass in a toilet bowl that's so dumb it's so dumb how could you do that national treasure man assholes of course he smokes pot he's a hundred and fifty thousand years old he's been playing music all across this land forever leave the guy alone let him do whatever he wants he's Willie Nelson I mean if you don't love Willie Nelson fuck you right even if you don't want to listen to the guy's music like not right now man I mean this Amanda Eminem right now okay I get it but if you like man fuck Willie Nelson no fuck you what do you think of the Kanye shit going on well Jamie's can't be fully informed he talks about every morning Jamie's got many many theories he's got a one of those mind boards his house where he's got index cards leading to the center yeah Kanye's record releases in the center and then all these things spray out to ease ease and and flip-flops and all these slot slides and he's got a bunch of theories along the way I've never heard your theory but does it involve the car accident that he had right before he became popular that like I think he has brain damage from this car axle that honestly think that he is still on he are sorry he said he was on opioids from getting a lipo actually yeah because a lot of the media scrutiny on him being fat he said led him to go getting lipo led him to having a painkiller addiction and he was on an opioid thing and he was very afraid when he went to the psycho hospital that he was gonna get killed people are gonna take him away for all the shit he was saying so he did have some issues and I think he's publicly said he's been on some other medication so he might be on or off of it right now well also he should definitely run for president then hippitty scoop I mean now he's in it's perfect he's got all the right ingredients I would take Kayne over Trump any day here's that thing that you do you mind here's that thing you just said though about the the accident you know that's the story of Sam Kinison as well oh yeah Sam Kinison was a when he was a boy he apparently was like super normal kid and then he got hit by a car really bad and from that point on he became a different person came wild and reckless and crazy it's that it's that what football players getting their head head fighters yeah yep and murdered their wife OJ Simpson you know that his doctor said that they would use that as a defense they would consider using that as a defense if that trials to happen today 100% it's like that other guy that the guy ended up killing himself the football player murder was his name he went to geology hung himself Martina yeah yeah yeah yeah Adrian what's his name Jamie yeah but they're saying that he probably had that too no 100% yet 100% it's not a matter of whether or not you have brain damage it's a matter of how much how much do you have and can you work with it you know that's what I mean if you get hit in the head a lot you have brain damage your your brain does not want to get hit it's just not normal Aaron Hernandez suffered from most severe CTE ever found in a person his age he's kind of like Brendan Schaub looks like it yeah looks like Brendan's way more keto right now very fun a brain like isn't someone younger than someone 40 and 46 he's like 25 yeah dude I'm telling you there's a fucking epidemic of this shit it includes all sorts of people that get their head hit whether it's BMX guys that are constantly crashing I mean you think about how many times BMX guy will crash in his career how many head head bumps he takes skateboarders notorious for doing crazy shit wiping you know the older you get does it look kind of like a pit bull does it swell and it gets worse no no they do say though the damage accumulative it's a cumulative over I think a period of like ten years from the initial incident so I'd say if you have a really bad car accident your brain will continue to deteriorate for ten years from the effects of that accident when when a guy told me that I was like how do you know and I don't know how they know I don't remember he kind of explained it but I was like so you mean a guy who gets knocked out we were at the fights when he's telling me this so I'm like you tell me a guy who gets knocked out today it's gonna feel the real repercussions of that knockout in ten years he's like yes it's very possible that's the case Wow it's gonna take ten years to show its full effects so if you see someone who's fucked up now like if they've got brain damage now like as time goes on it's gonna be like like Muhammad Ali was one of the weirder one because he had developed a neurological disease he developed Parkinson's but there's but there's trauma induced Parkinson's a lot of people try to say no no nah Ali got Parkinson's it was a disease yeah maybe but you know who else has Parkinson's Freddie Roach the boxing coach and he openly discusses the fact that it's trauma-induced he got it from his long boxing career this because it's a brain disease doesn't mean the brain disease didn't come from getting the fuck beat out of your brain I mean imagine if you had a game that you played or people like to kick you in the liver this is the game you know you kicked me the liver I kick you in the liver and then later on you develop liver cancer and people like yeah but he just liked to drink oh he had sclerosis had nothing to do with getting kicked a lot oh okay nothing to do I'm sure he has a super healthy brain after getting pounded on for decades that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense Jesus yes Jesus dude I have the probably the most minor of brain damages probably the most minor because I stopped when I was 21 yeah what's your number how many times I mean like you have any times do you think like you like oh that did damage a hundred percent there's a bunch of them there's a bunch of them that I could think back getting rocked and feeling my knees go like getting punched in and then keeps bar and keep sparring spar two more rounds that guy spar three rounds with another guy he's hitting you in the face too like you didn't stop it was really dumb he'd get hit and you get rocked and you didn't nobody likes at you down and go okay let's take the day off now you get right back in there man your fucking legs would go bang what your legs would go and you cover up and you'd you know people be throwing bombs on you and you'd next day sparring again can you get is there a way to detect it like hit it your brain scan see there's standard ways now there's better ways now but I had a limited amount of it I mean I had the real getting wrapped in the head for me came when I tried to transition from Taekwondo to kickboxing I do in Taekwondo I got I definitely got hit in the head for sure but I didn't get hit in the head as much because it's hard to kick people in the head you definitely get hit I mean I don't know how many times I definitely got hit but I never got knocked out from a head kick but I got knocked out from punches before all right at least keep TKO at TKO'd but when when a punch hits your face it's like your your legs go everything like shuts off like if you get rocked and you you see like a person go down it's not that they go down like there's so much pain I have to go down no you get hit and everything shuts off it just goes broke and then you you feel your legs like rubber you're trying to stand back up you just watch the last UFC where Edson Barboza head kick Kevin Lee yes you see I see spinning wheel kicked him and you see Kevin Lee's legs just go boy they just gave out for a second and then he came back and those those ones I got way more when I was boxing I got way more of those like I was I was not good at boxing when I first got into boxing I was learned I was good at Taekwondo but then I get into boxing I was not good at it I didn't know what I was doing I didn't understand the distance Taekwondo you didn't punch in the face you only punch the body so you had a real distorted perception of how good you were with your hands and then once I started boxing I was like oh this is terrible that's what I was taking like probably the most damage of my life of a period of like two years was like a lot of sparring I did a lot of sparring everybody sparred everybody sparred with everybody people knock people out all the time this is stupid so stupid I see guys get knocked out I mean out cold right hand to the chin boom eyes rolled behind their head legs give out they bounce off the canvas they put a cold towel on them they put some ice on his head he gets up he's like I'm good I'm good I'm good you want to keep going yeah let's keep going let's keep going no you were just unconscious you were just unconscious five minutes ago and you want to keep spar and this is crazy and they'd let him they'd let him keep sparring you did it from when you were like really young right Taekwondo from when I was like took karate classes when I was 14 but when I got super serious I was 15 it was like right at mice before my sophomore year of high school so like I got into it from the time I was in the ninth grade as I was 14 like that summer like right after my birthday around is when I started getting into I was probably either 14 or just turning 15 I asked like was there a point you could tell where people actually could be able to knock people out and give that damage because there may be but 14 year olds who knock you out all the time the thing about kicks is almost anybody can knock you out it's really crazy like when you think of the amount of power that you have to have like in your legs they say if you decide to put a heavy backpack on like one of those outdoorsman's Atlas trainers and put 90 pounds on you could walk up flights of stairs dude just think of how much power that is in your legs you could throw your body up flights of stairs for exercise just to push your body is whatever you weigh 150 200 whatever you weigh your body's just launching that through the air over and over and over again even if you're a girl that weighs 135 pounds you're still launching 135 pounds through the air and if that girl fucking shins you Bo bling right on your temple it goes across the jaw temple area got blind your legs are gonna give out your brains gonna shut off if somebody hits you perfect there's a video of us I think the guy was she I think it was I think it was mighty mo mighty molly I believe he was Samoan and I mean just like typical Samoan dude big giant fucking powerhouse of a dude and he fought this little Thai guy this tie guy was 175 pounds so much smaller than I mean it was crazy to watch the Thai guys just moving away moving away moving away and then the Thai guy roundhouse kicks him in the head this guy like look at the difference in size yeah and watch this this dude just comes over the top I mean the difference between the two of them my Timo is a beast too seriously dangerous knockout puncher he put a lot of guys to sleep so not as this guy in there with someone way but he's in there with a killer but look at that one head kick it mighty moe's down and out did I mean back that up again because that is a crazy thing to watch you're talking about a guy who might have been a hundred pounds lighter than him and Mighty Mouse just a vicious puncher bang you just clanged him right in the head that's what I'm talking about a girl does that to you night-night son I was thinking more like two ten-year-olds like no knock each other out that's a good point because the thought process is that if you teach kids technique don't teach them to just go in there's wild fucking haymaker exchanges but teach them how to do it correctly it's good to do it when they're young because they don't hurt each other because they have little tiny arms and they just kind of touch each other and they can't really generate knockout power they just sort of and if they learn how to do that from the beginning and then develop knockout power on the pads and on the bag then you develop much more technically proficient fighters rather than brawlers so the problem with fighting is like most people don't fight to the physical ability of their body like they they just they decide like they're going to knock this guy out i'ma try to hit him with this now and they think in this real limited sort of lid here too aggressive like almost obvious manner and then you got guys who see past that who take things to a new place you got guys who figure out that you can be like really elusive and confusing and then you see those guys fight like limited blocky like obvious fighters and like Anderson Silva in his prime it's a perfect example that Anderson was an artist I mean he would just he would you didn't know what he was gonna do it's study you he'd be moving around he'd be standing in front of you he'd be dancing he'd just be following you around and then all of a sudden he just say I got this motherfucker figured out but you just move in on your bank and you didn't know what was coming flying me he didn't know what was coming roundhouse kick front kick to the face he didn't know what the fuck was coming man is a totally different kind of fighter so the difference between that and a guy was just like a powerhouse of a person and can knock guys out but never never achieves this sort of mastery of space and distance they win fights through Halling and power and just kinetic brute force rather than artistry and avoidance and countering like Conor McGregor when he knocked out Jose Aldo perfect example all those like fuck you charge denim Conor slides back pop drops a fucking left hand on the button pop up and he's the champ champ I mean come on our champ then became the champ champ champ but that that you know that thing is it's hard to figure out sometimes guys just decide to out they'd rather bike down there mouthpiece and let the fucking chips fly it's not part of a fight yes like the last 30 seconds yeah seconds when I just throw it out crazy because they know there's no more time left yeah they just try to win try to try to stop it yeah some of those fights are awesome look as a person watching those things are awesome there's two different parts the way I look at fights like I love a good Diego Sanchez Gilbert Melendez fight where they just fucking go crazy for three rounds I love that those one of my favorite fights ever but I also love real technical fights where I see I see like two artists trying to solve each other's riddle trying to figure each other out you know like Luke Rockhold vs. yellow Romero was that like yellow just trying to figure him out trying to figure him out and maybe I was like this no and then BOOM drops that left hand on him same thing with him versus Chris Weidman he's just moving around hard to figure out what he's gonna do hard to figure out what's coming and then whoom flying knee to the chin or to the head he's uh he's a great example of a guy who just figures out how to break your rhythm and figure through rather than just running a game just clash clash clash you know Frank Mir was just talking about that phaidor fight and he was saying that his ego got the best of him did you see the fight mm it's really good fight really crazy until fade arcade odom cafe toe are cut on the left hand and dropped him and put him away but before fade or Kayode him Frank Mir had hit phaidor and it got interesting in the very beginning seconds of the fight but then fade or hit him with a perfectly timed hip throw just fucking boom I mean sent him flying to the air and slammed him to the ground and apparently Frank said from that moment on his ego got the best of me trying to get him back and he wound up just getting this crazy brawl and getting knocked out it's really fighting to me so it's so interesting you know it's just so interesting when you see all the different things and people can do and how they're gonna match up together and out what one person is gonna be able to figure out how to get there their ideas through my ideas I want to kick this motherfucker in the head how can I do this I got to figure out how to get and his ideas I want to take this guy down and punch his fucking face in how do I figure out how to do this and then the two of them are just like trying each other's strategy you don't really know you don't fucking know you don't know until they get in there for the most part it's crazy shit ever with the judging have they ever tried like sharing in between rounds what the scores are so you want to guess people throw rocks at those people what if they don't say what if they weren't there what if they're like in the back room oh that's even worse why aren't you there maybe the judging will be better if they were there in person judging they're actually elevated they're a little higher than everybody else - they're looking at it like above me because it would have like when there's when the actions happening on either side of the Octagon you can't see anything so I know they could get a monitor but like they should what's the point being we had a we had to make sure they got monitors they didn't get monitors in the beginning in the olden days they didn't have monitors and I I was going crazy I was like how is it that I a person who has no effect whatsoever on the score of this fight I have a monitor I can ask for a replay I have all this shit at my disposal I have a fuck I have earphones on with a microphone and I could press the truck I go can I see that again and they'll show it to me on the B screen my guys his ankle broke and so the production like sometimes during a fight will tell him hey Joe we got the head but it was a headbutt that caused that cut and then I'll say okay I'm just hearing from the truck now that it was a head but we're gonna show you that as soon as we can but I'm watching it on that screen right there why can't the judges get that how long ago did that change that seems like that should have been Dave 1 it wasn't that long ago Wow I don't think the judges have access to replays though they can't call up a replay like I can why not shouldn't be able should be able to they'd have a little bit too much time to judge or think about it or you need to know things you need to know things like if a guy gets kicked in the balls was that a real kick in the balls watch after the after the fact because I've said you don't want their attention taken from what's going the action depends stop and watch the replay depends yeah I mean I think it should just be an option for something's up like what happened there did he get rocked or did he fall on his ankle you know I'm saying like what happened there and there's only one way to tell sometimes you got to see it again cut see that again please they should be able to say can I see that again please how's that yeah well they they have instant replays now which is interesting like say if a guy pokes the guy in the eye and the judge wants to call for an instant replay but once they Institute the instant replay in some states the fight is over that's so crazy that doesn't make any sense so if I say no instant replay just take this I poke and keep fighting that's okay but if you want to look at it on video the fights over what that's why I compared to the NBA which I watched a lot they go to the replay a lot which is a little annoying as a viewer but they're they're trying to get it right which they have a team of people in New York where they're watching all of all the angles they can pull up anything they want mm they can see anything that they take as much time as they need to sometimes it takes five minutes but why not do that with fighting they get it right you know everyone sense why doesn't that exist it should definitely exist and I mean we talked about it with Michael Chandler yesterday that there should be more judges it definitely shouldn't be only three judges that's it's ridiculous it doesn't make any sense there's no reason to limit it to three judges I bet you would get far more competent far more knowledgeable judges for free then you would even if you paid them just pull up their fucking Twitter account blow their Twitter account up they'll judge you for free there's so many MMA fans out there that would love to judge fights and they actually understand fighting they really get it and they love it they're not just doing it because it's a job and they used to do boxing and you know this is a good way to make 1,500 bucks on a Saturday night or whatever they're met that's not what the you know they're doing it because they actually love it so many people would do it it'll be way better you could definitely judge from home too we could definitely should have I mean why not have like an online scorecard as well like why not have that as an option so the UFC could let everybody know how bad the judges are I mean I'm not saying that everybody online is gonna know what the fuck they're talking about but enough people online are gonna know what they're talking about where it'll balance out so if you had just like 10 judges and then the online judges have an online scorecard if you pay for five pastor what you probably are willing to have some knowledge on the support yeah yeah but also if put in the app to say like Conor fights unknown Bob you know they're all the Connor fans are gonna vote for him anyway yeah because unknown Bob will probably have some fence too and then people be a bunch of haters they're hoping that Connor fails cuz he's got a limousine what's my passion you got pay for your vote in that case you want to pay 10 bucks every time yeah exactly well you if you had an app you have a UFC app and the app all it has to do they just make it so it's interactive so with each fight after the fights over you click winner or loser you know that's all you have to do just quick winner and you if you optional you could put in your own score but the fuck out of here the scoring sucks anyway that 10-point must system is stupid it's it's a borrowed system it's not a good system for all those weapons it's a good system for two weapons punches you know the like you got kicks and knees and elbows chokes takedowns defense you got Slams and throws and come on wheel kicks and spinning back kicks what's better a spinning back kick or a jab boxing is a punch or punch like that punch was harder than that punch but unless someone's kicking you in the leg you don't even know what that feels like you have no idea the guys just walking around like nothing happened you can't score that if nobody's ever kicked you in the legs they should have a full body suit that detects punches and like how strong it is but then it takes away from the the fucking the rawness of it all can't have people fighting in body suits well in the future it will look like you don't have anything on a lot of gals have to wear that where there's something that covers their midsection right they have like a sports bra strapped down sort of jammy then they wear something that covers their midsection too that's interesting they have to have their stomach covered or they're allowed to have their stomach covered just to keep their boobs in check like everybody gotta stay in the party can't fuck up those titties cats and gon will be on soon she'll explain it to us cuz she had a wardrobe malfunction one of her fights little steer me put that up slip up the dark skin in that funny every dude shows his nipple every do two fights shows his nipple girl goes out and shows her nipple everybody goes crazy no it's funny twitch twitch won't even let a grown man take off his shirt you'll be banned keep your clothes on you freak people are always like why don't you broadcast on Twitch because if I can get banned for just showing a nipple what I'm eating anything a man can get banned like Bert Kreischer if you try to do the Bert cast on twitch twitch it would immediately be babe and he could maybe talk to them and they might be able to but most people yet it's against the guidelines to a show skin it's a lot of those things that's the only problem of Twitter you forget it's made for babies it's so silly you can't show man boobs yeah it's pretty really super flat-chested mmm what if you take your shirt off and you just smooth people taking their shirts off there okay what if you take your shirt off and you have like pasties on do have people that do body paint so there is a little bit of body paint okay like so if you decide to do like the British flag paint that over your body that's okay but you just can't be no paint strip clubs in Columbus Ohio the ones that serve alcohol they can't even show their tits they have to wear paste Hasty's but they have pasties that look like better areolas you know they know I'm gonna have these nice darker ones like fig whoa wow that's sick body paint is pretty cool when it's done well that is incredible that's really good go back to that again yeah that's neat there's a couple of I'm missing this she's doing this character on the side here right but that's all her really I'm pretty sure Wow well she's definitely got some kind of a boob pad going on wow that's amazing some people did that to herself have you ever seen the girl that's on the Instagram where she like will paint her eyes like up here and then have like a fake nose and a fake mouth and it looks like a completely different face and then she opens her realize and I go that's a night that's yeah this is basically you're looking at naked boobs they just got paint on them so we let it slide so is this his girls thing she just gets her boobs painted and goes on oh my god she does yeah that's her thing that is hilarious it's great that's a way that you could see the whole thing girls are trying to figure out this dress is just not tight enough it's not revealing enough there were some girls that were playing games on Twitch just in like a bikini or whatnot and they got in trouble for that so they had to take their scheme over to YouTube or some other sites how long before someone comes up with a non-toxic paint that girls can paint all over their body and it's like a thin nylon layer and they'll go out you'll see everything so you know there's gonna be a few girls that just go for it like this Deadpool here make a Deadpool girl like how much there's gonna be girls like that that just go for it my favorite is if you google a twitch girl doesn't realize cameras still on after-show and masturbates is it you got busted for that come on the one I saw looked really real you just you just you want that's ridiculous you call bullshit on everything this was like a well-known girl that did it know right did she contact you on Instagram what's your name Mary nine zero four five and did you say hello dear oh no I mean look there was no reason why it it was like a bad like she was half off the camera like it looked like it wasn't her see like that's how I do it if I was gonna fake something wouldn't you think that's right come on son how dare you just sad sad that you got roped into that I feel less of you know the first time it's happened Joe I there's so many scams yes too easy to get the new one I almost got scammed the other day than the new one I don't know what's going lately with robo calls but I'm I'm getting a call illness every day like this is the IRS we are you need to contact us now and or this is AT&T you need to we need to talk to you about your billing please enter your credit card info right now you like do they call you when you're high no I'm stuck no but it's interesting because like I think t-mobile does it how does your phone come up now just a scam likely like yeah like like t-mobile is now filtering out these calls and it's telling me if it's a scam like yeah like that yeah it's gonna be cool and say mergers say that uh as the rest of the world sort of gets online like for instance like parts of Africa that aren't online now will be online eventually that the scams will switch back like the Nigerian prince scam will be American scamming people in Africa they don't know about the scams yet because they haven't been a part of it that's like some theories that's not a bad theory but those people were really good at scamming lonely people there was such a sad show I was watching once about this old guy I think the guy's daughter was like trying to only tell him that this girl wasn't real and he kept going to England for he went to Europe twice to meet her and both times something came up but she couldn't meet him and then he went back again and he keeps sending her money hmm he's been sending her money sent her I want to say like a quarter million dollars and his daughter was like it's not ready could see the guy like like they're filming them and talking them and he had this like look in his eye like he was hoping they're wrong but thinking they might be right like he was going insane he was going insane from loneliness sad I see it every day on the webcam sites yeah there's guys that every single day I go they're the same guys there and he's spending money non-stop all day long and he's just on there all day you must spend like thousands of dollars a day how a billion dollar internet scam is breaking hearts and bank accounts criminal networks defraud lonely people around the world with false promises of love and romance you know you could analyze this from a lot of ways like it's a predatory behavior I caught a coyote in my yard last night it's predatory behavior right it's gonna have human coyotes you're always I didn't catch them like catch them catch them I just chased him out of my yard they're trying to get my chickens but this is a predatory behavior on a weak person you know so I get sits on one hand I feel upset that they would go after these people these lonely people but the other hand it's fascinating to me because like what a drug people's love is what a drug that is like how important it is that people like find people that care about them that like them and care about them it's so important when you don't have that in your life you just feel so empty and it's one of probably the most major sources of like bad feelings in people's if they just don't have anybody that loves them they don't know what good friends they don't have they don't have good people around them and they're just sad just sad the point where someone comes along goes we can help you sad come on come over here we've got girls girls who want to meet you girls in your town girls sign up you can meet girls like girls who Oconee girls you know it's like someone someone offering you food Facebook's new online dating service won't have ads I thought that said won't have what I thought it was like what the fuck are they saying it sounds like that'll take advantage of what you're talking about right now do you know online dating service won't have ads so but it will have Russians all Russians all the time well I mean it'd be nice if people you just meet people in the real world just meeting people online stuff it's so weird how like I talked to people that use tinder they hook up on tinder like weekly and there's a lot of these people like that's all they do they'll just fuck people on tinder all day and it just makes me wonder how many people just do that like all the old data women and she's already been fucked like seven times from you know your the same app you know like all these we were just like they're just like you're taking extreme risks yeah with your VD there was there was the fucking thing where they wanted to sue online dating apps like someone was saying should online dating apps be responsible for the increase in sexually transmitted diseases should they be responsible like as if they have some obligation to tell you to wear a rubber how fucking stupid that is like some they have some obligation there like you know like look you you know these poor little children and they're all fucking you need to tell them they need to protect themselves like these broad adults grown adults using an app tinder and Grindr don't want to talk about their role in rising STDs good why do you want to talk to them you muckraking piece of shit they don't have a role they connect people together people make their own decisions you got to be responsible for your own actions especially when it comes to something like that that's crazy and you know the other part is like the demonization of sex is a big part of this or what about tinder and crime what are you doing here's all those people is just having sex and getting STDs you're responsible what about your part what about your role yep get out of here that's ridiculous that's ridiculous do bars have a role in liver splices should they pay people out should they be financially responsible they're literally selling you the shit that kills you and they have zero responsibility as long as they don't serve you while you're drunk and driving long as they cut you off in time and say hey I got too drunk we cut them off all right sounds good they literally sell you the stuff that does it to you and no one cares as they should no one should care you're fucking grown adult this grinder those are dudes banging each other all day do you think that anyone's gonna stop that oh oh I shouldn't connect these people you should make money connecting them you shouldn't give them the opportunity to do exactly what they want as grown adults with a limited amount of time on earth you got 90 years if you're lucky if you wanna spend 45 of them raw dog and do you go you go boy who gives a shit are they response they don't want to talk about their responsibility shut the fuck up babies now that bad very excited upset about something especially Grindr now that Backpage is closed like all these web sites are closing it's very interesting to see what happens next where people are gonna find their hookups and stuff well yeah that was what I was reading this thing where sex workers are in danger because of this because before they used to be able to vet customers and then customers would have like a record of using other sex workers and they could know who the psychos were and who to avoid you know I mean and they could also screen people like actively screen they could do they could do all this they were saying I was it was reading an article about it where this girl who remember if they gave her name out or not but she was she worked in a brothel and she was talking about it and it's like what why are they doing this like is there is it because of a crime like what's the crime so if they get together like through tinder or Grindr that's fine because that's two people that decide to have sex but as long as they're grown adults and one person just wants to get paid and the other person is like wah pea and they go okay fine like what why is that illegal like we're not talking about sex trafficking for children we're not talking about slavery we're just talking about just let's just look at it from the cleanest perspective possible grown adult who likes sex decides she wants to work in a brothel is that possible is it possible for you to do that like - for it to be a grown adult who actually enjoys it doesn't have any problem with it decides that it's better than working at Wendy's isn't that pot is that possible I mean that people don't want to say it nobody wants to say that it's possible nobody wants to ever look at it that way the war on sex workers needs to stop now rolling stone yeah yeah it's it just seems like a dumb thing to chase down I mean I think if people want to have sex with each other nobody has a problem with it but if people want to pay people to have sex then it's a problem that seems so crazy again we're not talking about child slavery we're not talking about sex slaves are not talking about anything against anybody's will we're just talking about people who would choose to do that like why not and I've always used this example but it's a good example why why isn't it okay for me to get a massage s'okay for me to pay someone to give me pleasure all over my body except my genitals like they could rub my neck and my feet and getting all all been my feet man to get those thumbs and start working your feet uh they crack your toe pop pop feels great that's fine but they can't jerk you off they jerked you off that would be a terrible sin against God and man if they touched your penis which feels really good when you touch it can't do that I know a dude who said he gets asshole massages yeah that actually happens all the time the interior of your asshole they massage the interior of your asshole that's okay because it's just a massage prostate massage what's weird is when they do it and they don't ask you because a lot of massage people just do it that's a part of the massage and they just start yeah but no no I don't want that apparently some people get it where they use a tool and they actually go in side your ass hole and rub down no no no that's a tool the other one they use some sort of thing to fucking check your butt that's okay that's fine that's fine just don't touch the dick if you touch the dick it's goddamn crime they're waiting outside the door with a pistol you just let me know when he touches the dick and he's just rubbing his asshole check the books son all right oh it's Dick's not even hard ok ok we're ready we're ready we're gonna break into this fucking shade place as soon as we find out that he's dick touched you could get someone to just massage your asshole just get in there with squeeze your butt cheeks and get two thumbs in your asshole and what am i doing I've been doing is sphincter massage it's very important to release some of the chakras and negative energy and and and some of the toxins that are stored in your body from processed foods and modern lifestyle so we're just going in your asshole but to dump some guru let's talk people into thumbing him in the ass it's so weird that I've never like I just recently found out all that shit that's happening in massage parlors but like you know ten years ago I had no clue I'll go buy a massage partly I go oh that's what massages there's nothing bad going on here I wonder how many places like that are like like psychics what happens that psychics at 4:00 in the morning why are they open at 4:00 in the morning is that where you get your ass eating out and I you don't learn about that until you're 70 or something mmm I don't think so I think psychics are open late at night because it's a scam and B when people are it's late at night they're drunk and like maybe it's a gross driving home the guy texted her and she goes no should I text him back why's he texting me so late that's kind of disrespectful I don't know if he's the one and she pulls into that psychics office and she's like I just need you to tell me about my future and the psychic is like I sense there's a problem and romantic interest my boyfriend yes yes is you're stressed there's something deeply troubling you you're you're confused I am confused yes you're confused you're trying to the decisions hard to something coming up something's happening can you guys can you come over the house and fucking around yes that's it there's a thing that he's wanting you to do that you're not so sure if he's the one is that it yes oh my god that's what I said when I was on the way over here and then when he said you're not sure if he's the one I'm like oh my fucking god is it like written on my forehead how is it possible he knows he fucking knew about mark he knew about our relationship problems and he knew that I was on my way over there wondering whether or not he's the one I think you're my favorite girl voice guy you know like you won't be a fucking asshole and hang out with your friends and all this bullshit when I'm trying to figure out how this fucking psychic knows the one for me how does this know how does she no friend of mine went to money's like he knew my grandmother's whole everything about my relationship my grandmother I go don't you know don't you know everything about your relationship with your grandmother what the fuck you want you want to pay people to tell you shit you already knew it's four o'clock it is four o'clock you're fucking nuts I'm wearing a watch ah rains out you get wet whoa this guy's crazy tell me all the shit I already knew it's crazy I bet I think psychics are way better now nowadays because of Technology and like they probably have like earpiece hidden some guy in the back Slyke looking at their license plate number online of finding out where they live you know like the just feeding the person information I bet psychics are killer now I bet there's some they're like super hard scam you level mm-hmm because you want to repeat customer so if you're that accurate I bet there's a huge scam that it's a crazy thing if you're driving like you're driving through Burbank or some shit every couple miles you see one of those psychic reader places 5:00 in the morning open big hand on the front like a handjob place but it's a psychic I went to one once when I was in New York and I was going to these fucking stupid auditions like I did not want to act and I was going I was just it wasn't what I was interested in doing but like your agency would tell you well you know you really should look into this and you'd see what it was it was like some role that I didn't not only was I'm not gonna get it but I didn't want it like wow this is like Sunnyview funny it's like super serious yeah but you should do it so they just they know they know what you could do commercials I'd go in and read for commercials and I'd be like what the fuck am i doing so I left one of them and I was terrible at it too it was terrible auditioning and then I went to this um I went to this psychic and I'm like fuck it let's say it's only like I remember how much it was like 5 bucks 10 bucks she's like you don't get along with your brothers I don't have any brothers looked in her eyes and she looked at me and I knew that she knew that I knew she was full of shit I knew she is full of shit I looked at her I have any brothers she's like oh shit I got crazy she got gangster she took a swing she's like I'm sentient brothers from this asshole got a chip in each other shoulder brothers probably beat him up no it came from a bad audition you missed it lady it's weird how we all know that's bullshit for the most part there maybe there's some weirdo that actually know it can do some shade but like but we still accept it people still go to it even though they know deep it down like hey we have a gun to your head right now is this real if you do the wrong answer then we're gonna blow your head off everyone's back no it's not real even the people that believe psychics the most are gonna say no it's not real what do you say most likely if it comes to a bullet in the head right so like but we still do it like or crystals oh no these crystals are healing me oh yeah gun to the head do you think they're really healing you you think this rock is healing you know you know we're gonna say yes well here's the thing about those crystals those magnet things and all that shit the one weird thing is the placebo effect for SIBO effect is real it's very real do you remember those Holograms that people were wearing for a while on those rubber bracelets yeah Brody has like four of them dude there was world class UFC fighters that were wearing those stupid fucking things like top of the food chain assassins and they were like - I'm telling it's been helping my elbow like what the fuck are you talking about and I talked to one of the guys Goldberg was wearing one for a while my buddy Mike Goldberg was wearing one I was like dude I don't think that's real he's like you don't think I don't think so he's like you want to meet with the guys who take it I go okay I met with the guys who make it and they try to do one of those strength test things on you like here's what I want you to do I'm gonna I'm gonna put this rubber band on you put your arms straight out and I'm gonna push down on it and they're like halfway push down this is one of those things like okay try to lift your arm up and they're like push down in your hand and then go okay now we'll put this rubber bracelet on you now try to lift your arm up like wow this is crazy I can lift my arm up cuz you weren't holding it back you're not a machine like you could regulate how much force you're putting that you don't know what you're doing I go this is a goddamn carnival trick so I said to the guy go this is a goddamn carnival trick and Goldberg was loaded I mean like it's just fake I go it's fake oh my god is fake I know what is this you tell me how this works you have a piece of plastic you're telling me I'm gonna put on a rubber band it's gonna make me stronger dude okay I didn't spend a lot of time in school but I spent enough fuck you you can't do a hologram inside a hologram anyway life is a hologram you can't die well it's all hokum that's true they don't even exist those truths there's certain things that make you think it might be a hologram right power scam that's it power bounce admits the wristbands are scammed wait a minute no way bro like we admit that there's no credible scientific evidence that supports our claims and therefore we engage in misleading conduct yeah I called that shit out in like 2001 I was like what are you guys doing like what is this who's wearing that why you why would you think that would work they had to publish that in Australian media yeah because Australia is fucking smarter than us because of their bogus claims and pseudo scientific mumbo-jumbo but this seems to be the first time in which a regulatory authority has made them admit their claims are simply a fraud hmm derp look there's some shit that makes you strong but it's not a rubber band with a piece of plastic attached to it CBD oil you know I mean you want something that makes you feel better CBD oils real well I try to make that illegal there is some some people that say that there's no scientific proof that CBD even aids works it that it's always it's always the other ingredients that are mixed with the CBD you know like like they'll take like the same ingredients that's in bengay and then seedy and it also and they say doesn't this feel numb now like there's still about it there's no real I heard that there's no real concrete evidence that CBD because there's no test that I thought there was evidence that a decreased inflammation isn't there evidence that it decreased inflammation mmm the promised scientific studies all these things right it might be I might be mine fucking myself when I put that stuff on you might seems to work though especially for my elbow my gum tendinitis I feel it like it works finally getting over dude I finally could do chin-ups I couldn't do champs for months months try years CBD in it I I really I was I was not doing any chin-ups or anything heavy I was doing mostly running and yoga for months because of this fucking elbow I've never had tendinitis before I've had muscle poles and stuff and injuries I never had tendinitis this and this was a dumb one because I'm eat headed my way through it I'm eat headed it into a bad place I was like don't be a pussy just keep working out and then it got real bad and then it until I did a bunch of different stuff to it I did stem cells and regenerative this rubber thing that roller no it's not it's called a thermal band I've talked about this so many times that I can't thera-band rather I can't buy them on Amazon anymore people have bought them out but I'm glad because they work if you have a it's cheap too it's just it's just a piece of rubber and if you don't have this and you have something that can do a similar exercise it'll probably help to but what you do is you twist it and then in the release mmm yeah you twist this thing and in the release you like to twist it with your hand like this and then the release with the right hand the right my right elbow was the one that was injured and just slowly letting it down it works this part of your arm that is cool so even though it's injured it doesn't hurt it but it strengthens it that's great works a lot so I'll just pick this fucker up and do it ten times twelve times 15 times and do it several times a day and made a big difference man like right away I could feel it just it feels like everything around it's like strengthened and stabilized and it just started whew better because you're you're putting a load on it and then you making it release the load instead of like pulling it in the direction that you injured it your your strengthing in it in the I guess would be the eccentric way eccentric eccentric wet mmm so there you go don't get tendinitis kids I had recently from I think using cell phones too much and computers too much like carpal tunnel where to the point where my hand hurt legs I think it's the same shit it's repetitive stress yeah right secretaries get that right from a lot of typing and stuff hairstylist also get it a lot yeah I know a tattoo artist has it yeah and it right now just me he's even saying I'm like it's still actually really sore my hands two guys are hit in the wrist too and you know for a lot of those guys they start getting addicted to anti-inflammatories and you know different things to try so cuz if you have to use your fingers for work you imagine if you had to do something with your hands like that for work you started feeling that pain like this is just my elbow you know I mean I can do pretty much everything but your hands like if it's in your hands fuck that's a bitch I was reading this article about replacing body parts they were talking about all the different body parts they're on the verge of being able to replace they just did a face transplant didn't they they've done a few of those yeah they did a few dick transplants kanakam balls here's the thing they can't do the balls who wants the balls you don't need them thanks for ethical reasons because the dead person's sperm will always be in those balls so here's the thing say if you if you took my balls if I died and you took my balls and put them in your body and started having kids those would be my kids they would have my genes not your body growing you know are you gonna make my own come you could but that's the crazy thing you could make Jamie's come Jamie died and he donated his cock and balls and he took his boy put in your body you he would grow your come my company burn my cum it's his it's your balls so it's your sperm and your cum you write your jizz let's just call it jizz but for scientific purposes what happens if I have one of your balls and one of Jamie's what happens I have we have a fucking crapshoot who the hell that kid I have gay friends that took they had a kid through a surrogate and they took their come and just mixed it up like a swirly I like let's see let's see who wins the race you know they don't really they don't really know who won the race that's how the cute kid he's a great kid but they don't know who won that race didn't card to have it they have their guesses there's a Jenner baby situation going on potentially with one of their bodyguards John the mom of the most recent kid is the mom at the baby daddies and you need to get it checked he's he's a famous rapper you know you know the bodyguard oh shit I bet those bodyguards get in there of course they did they probably ripped yeah wasn't there one a big thing about Kylie she has a sexy bodyguard yeah dude looks like he's in a goddamn Bruce Lee movie right they all have to sleep with the bodyguards what are you talking about you have this guy that just works out all the time bastard Kylie James bodyguard cryptically responds to baby daddy rumors okay I'm out can't can't do it anymore can't do anymore he's a handsome fellow that bodyguard I wouldn't blame the gal what are you gonna do I just like to remind everybody we're in space and Hawaii is exploding okay if you really do fuck it really give a fuck which bodyguard is getting their dick into which poor confused young lady thing's gonna happen that way man things gonna happen if you're talking about those body parts I was gonna ask if you heard about what happened to Huey Lewis recently I've been hearing he's got some sort of inner ear infection I guess he's got many years and he would most like very recently he was on tour I saw people that were like I've been to his concerts but he said he can hear people talking like he was doing an interview with the woman he said I can hear your voice but I can't hear music and like that's what he does is perform it's pretty fucked up man like ears is really scary my friend he's an editor and one day he just woke up and he can't hear out of his left ear and it's he still to this day ten years later still can't hear out of his left it happen to me pretty sure every night is pretty bad yeah whoa what's tinnitus so ringing that happens I'm used to been a heavy metal band so like I never wear earplugs and oh god tons of concerts for like five plus years do every other night like the cameras and I thank you yeah yeah just have Cajun they just go real high like I can't hear anything out of that ear and that's I sort of like plug it up or do something I'm gonna go away eventually but some more recently it's taking a little longer to go away I had that sometimes it's usually when it's really quiet and we'll just come out of nowhere I hear just like ringing but it's not like everyday oh yeah that's what it is though yeah how do you get it it's just from one old - it's just hair loss to hearing loss now it could be you've heard loud things been the concert so over the years the damage but the real thing I think is people who around guns a lot I know a lot of people who around guns a lot as a kid like they shot those clays you know with shotguns you shoot those John Dudley has a real bad hearing loss from that nobody ever told kids back then that they need to wear earmuffs like nobody wore ear protection they would go to the range with just no earmuffs on just bang bang bang did concerts I don't think I growing up I ever even thought of that like I would sit right next to the speaker on purpose I got at a nine inch nail concert just because like oh man you know you're no one talked about that fact that's ridiculous wow that's crazy see if you can find video of them in a gun range with no ear protection cuz I don't think I'm making that up I think I remember look watching people on a range just shooting guns with no ear plugs nowadays it doesn't matter that because they're hearing aids nowadays it's like you have earbuds in now and you get bluetooth to your phone and everything yeah it's cool I wonder your hearing aids well they have those things called game ears you can put them in your hearing in your ear canal rather like a hearing aid and they amplify sounds extraordinarily and then hunters use them in the woods they put them in and you can hear the calm game here I think it's called a Walker's game here I put it on before it freaked me out that's crazy so I don't wanna hear this way of looking for exactly but this guy's trying to tell people how to do it he's just plugging up his ear oh yeah order that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for like old school nothing so he's saying this how I shoot guns if I don't have hear protection I just put yeah there's some articles to people discussing it but nothing's really okay maybe I imagined it but I remember seeing like an old-school range some dude with a pistol with like a thick belt like those hippies used to wear in a belt buckle he's firing off that gun boom boom boom boom I think the first time I shot a gun I didn't have hit headphones or ear thing reaction at all a lot of people 50 it's a bad idea this does guys not no ear protection you get something he's like I get a concussion almost catch his breath that's so dumb do you know how powerful these things are this is how powerful of 50 caliber is somebody decided that's a 30 caliber somebody decided to try to hunt deer with this so there's a video you could find it online guy misses deer and the deers head exploded as it missed the eyes popped out of its head he thought it was a perfect head shot because the deer just went down but what it actually was was that the bullet passing by had so much force it instantaneously killed the deer he's not crazy dude it's insane it's insane here it goes so this so he does this and he's got this is a big-ass fucking gun it says 50 BMG I don't know what that means is that 50 caliber is that what that means so look at this he goes over to the to the deer and there's no bullet hole it's just eyes had blown out of its fucking head just from the sheer force of that thing passing by it yeah look you could see it like there's a slow motion of it see it passes by it doesn't even hit it and the deer just disappears into the night that's nuts like imagine it has so much force it can miss a deer and kill it whoa that is so unnecessary that is such a war weapon fucking amen that's a crazy thing to go hunting with who do you use who were a lot like no you never yeah yeah I don't it's too risky I'm starting to not trust it's so weird like I'm I use it all the time I use you know delivery serve food delivery services all the time and I I'm having second thoughts on the whole thing I think it's great I think uber is great I'm just fuckin around my saying it's risky I mean the idea that you could just call a cab look okay how come I can't just call an uber the only argument would be that they don't screen the people as well as cab companies do exactly it's that's regulated right which is why people like limos though they prefer limos you know now I was in one recently that kid was probably he does seem like he was like 17 like I was I had no way this is my dryer and I felt like he was drunk like right I was like how do I get out of here you know like I'm running a highway right now I can't just you know tell him to pull over on the side of the highway but I feel like he's gonna kill me you know well there was a lady recently that went on this whole tweet thread she tweeted a bunch of different things too ooh BRR about a guy was it whoever it was it lifts one of those where a guy had taken her under a bridge and wouldn't wouldn't give her her stuff back wouldn't let her out of the car and some passerby stopped and helped her and she was screaming at the guy and the guy took off but it was to a point where she was like is this guy gonna rape me I guess this guy gonna kill me like is this how I'm gonna end like I just jumped in a car with stranger and now he's decided to stop somewhere and it's we're not it's not where we're supposed to go he's not telling me why that's that kind of shit like I guess that could theoretically happen with any rideshare company but with uber it's so weird it's just a person just get some person to come get you and you don't have to be hired by a company great you never thought that with taxis though like you never thought you didn't like you know you always kind of like taxis were transportation you never thought oh this taxi drivers gonna rape me or something right well especially in like the only time I usually take taxis is in New York New York is the place to date taxis right because it's there everywhere yeah and that's how people get around it's like it's an easy way to get around but you never know it's like a ride sometimes those people you'd get in the car like you'd be like whoa this guy is just riding in people's asses and cutting people off and slamming the brakes and honking the horn whoa like in this dude is tuned in he's doing this all day he's probably in this fucking car ten twelve hours a day and so you don't expect that cuz you come from Columbus Ohio Columbus we still have Mormons oh and Amish Thomas right yeah they're hip honest with the electricity still don't wear deodorant every time I go to New York and I get in a car and some of New Yorkers driving I'm always like whoa you guys are in the matrix like they just drive so much more aggressively like you know if you hire a car to drive you around in New York City they drive so much more aggressively they're just so used to it I just remember as a kid going to let Wyandotte Lake and like at the amusement parks they always went as a group to amusement park so there's like 200 Amish people mixed in with us and would be like 14 13 like look at those guys and the Amish people always acted like so almost like alien like like that they're from the contrary and they talk weird and I don't really talk like us like well they state it to themselves right I mean but I didn't know that they could go to amusement parks I thought there the whole idea was that they can't use electronics that might not have been that could have been like a different group there's different kinds of Mennonites too right yeah there's different kind of leaders those with re once we were in Massachusetts Western Massachusetts we stopped into this fucking truck stopped get gas and grab something to eat and there's a group of Mennonites and there's some girl that's wearing this Mennonite outfit and I forget how Ari asked her I really wish but it was hilarious it was something something along the lines of so what cult are you in something along those lines together and he might have been more tactful than that maybe it was something like what's this all about why you dressed like that I think I was there I think you were too it was something along lives of a group you're with like it was something to wear and we were all of course baked out of our minds you know we're traveling we'll just try to be silly we just try to have a good time you know I think Diaz was with us too yeah yeah but uh this poor lady was in this weird cult wearing this weird outfit I think she answered like politely and I was like uh I'm in you know but she was blah yeah yeah Ari is such a neat guy because he was as a child he was raised to be a very very strict Orthodox Jew you know I mean he spent time I forget what it's called when you go over to Israel and you you just read the Torah like fucking 10 12 hours a day he did that all that stuff he grew the curls he would have the little strings and hang from his belt he did all that schnitzel something what it's called it's called Orthodox right that's Orthodox Judaism yeah so when anybody tries to run any bullshit by Ari he's like I know this he knows all that stuff he's to have the weird curls too and all that he had all that shit yeah and then he just realized as he got older and wiser it's like oh my god this is all bullshit not that it is folks this is just re don't take you minutes word for it but he's uh he's a funny guy with that stuff cuz like I think only someone who's truly seen it from the eyes of an absolute believer he's gone through so many weird looks remember when Ari just had like like he would always wear the small hats or something like that like he wore small hats memory Hadley remember he always had like the hat on and this that would just hang on the side of his head and he I think he had like his head shaped like a bald he definitely shaved his head like a bald person for a while did he grow was that like a mullet Mohawk the Mohawk there he's an animal all right doesn't like that look I like the mohawk look yeah the the new thing is the no glasses look you got the lasix done oh that's right powerful vision now he could see he got an infected Tony had to get it chopped off what he lied he trolled me about like he got an infection on his big toe and he had to get everything you know good for that is kurt metzger his Kurt Metzger was in was he in the Moonies or the Christian Jehovah's Witness Jehovah's Witness yeah I think you're right yeah so he grew up the Jehovah's Witness so like he's like I'm not buying any of this like I know where this is like it's the same thing with psychics right like why do people have this need to hold on to irrational beliefs like there are some questions you don't have answers to you know you don't have answers to so why do you pretend that this one this this answers can take its place this answer you kind of know is bullshit it's gonna take its place why do we need to do that because so many of us do and I'm not immune to it we're all we all need that feeling you know the didn't oh no it's gonna be okay Brian everything's gonna be okay makes you wonder if you do the whole gun theory if this is real or not to religion how many people would say yes it's all real and who would go even the most religious person with like no of course I'm beyond that I'm just I like it helps me out um I think a bunch of people take a bullet yeah yeah if you want to punish me for my lord in heaven they take it right in the temple boom piles of people piles of bodies at Walmart yeah man people just blow the brains up for their heavenly father does command you to come see him in heaven boom yeah a lot of people would do it guaranteed but you know man it's like even what's going on with the Pope just recently said there's no hell and everybody went crazy like what what did he just say the Pope said there's no hell he's he's slowly bracing you for the fact that all this is nonsense but right now we're gonna get rid of hell like this is like one of the one of the purest examples of like the change in people's attitudes towards religious real yep yes the Vatican denies that but yeah the Vatican did not say there's no hell we'll find out an article where it says he did say that he's not gonna go back go back in time and find an article where he did say the guarantee we did say let's just assume that one day there see this is what they do they say it a little bit and then they take it back so they get used to the idea they're saying it that's what it is I'm full Eddie Bravo right now I'm full conspiracy dude this is how they set it up they start out with they tell you hell's not real then they say we never said that and then a year from now they say look we're pretty sure hell's not real this this Pope probably plays for tonight and shit he's like he doesn't have the Pope he's got his Kanye's on he's the cool pope he is the cool Pope he got rid of the throne oh yeah yeah I had a big giant crazy-ass throne for the last guy The Creeper he's got a gamer just got its Pope Francis in the fucking house Pope Francis has no problem with gay people either Pope Francis fighting with your litter kid yeah see look how he swatted the old Lou the old throne versus the new throne look at the to side to side the guy on the left the guy they just kicked out for crimes against humanity Wow and the guy on the right is the new guy who's just got a sensible chair much better yeah the other throne is creepy man that is crazy and he dresses much more conservatively too he's not wearing crazy wizard robes he's wearing like a one-color wizard robe he dresses like art Kelly on a Sunday like if he came out and like a polo shirt pair of jeans no right no everybody like hey hey you can't be the Pope without the fucking magic outfit where's your fishhead hat come on bro he's got body armor on he's got a hat on like a golden salmon that's coming out of the top of his head like show me that hat do this fucking hat sounds preposterous that's a that's like a monster that's it's a mouth of a monster yeah like a like a giant snake looks like a napkin at a restaurant when you go there it's city-owned by mistake making fun of our holy father this is on this fucking show sucks you're making fun of our holy father he's right there with the smoke oh my god how is this still legal look at these kids dressed up like they're in Harry Potter's seminary done no Dorf that they look good they do they look like they go to that what's that Hogwarts School they do this is fucking ridiculous universal talking to this dude who's holding up a golden version of where the Savior was murdered right he's got a golden cross this crosses all over the place like don't forget about the cross and he's standing there dressed like a wizard this is craziness and everyone's know this is our religion this is our culture this is weird this is weird and I'm not saying it's not beautiful it's absolutely beautiful I'm not saying it's any weirder than going to the Opera because I think that's weird too but this shit is weird this is some really old form of Education / entertainment that people used to do before they had plays they get together and some room what's fucking crazy different colored glass windows in it why doesn't have a mic on why that kid got to hold the mic because Jesus doesn't want him to be unmagnified that's a thick mic though yeah man Jeff was pink pink Mike what's the deal what's up why's it have to be silver I like pink big pink Mike it's uh it's crazy you know and it's a billion of us and I was raised there I mean I was went from when I was real little kid I did at least one year in Catholic school was around a lot of Catholics you know I know I'm not claiming to be an expert in it but I don't have to be that shit's bananas I should be an altar server I used to hold that mic did you really did you would you ever in the middle of doing that going what in the fuck am i doing now what the most of the times we did it when me my friends talked about we we would get out of class so we would because I went to Catholic school there'd be services during the day in funerals even sometimes we get paid to be out of class and then we would like miss 2-3 hours of school get paid 20 bucks get some doughnuts miss lunch you know that was really all we were doing I used to just have to light the candles like I me and this other kid would come out and light all these candles so bananas when you're in that room and those you see those benches all laid out up the pulpit like this is so crazy this is it's it's like people figured out some way to make the bridge between physical evolution and mental evolution like there's this bridge between us not being monkeys anymore but still we just want to get out of the Barbarian behavior we've got to figure out a way to get people to like have reverence for something it's all powerful and just control their behavior we got to slow down the chimp in a set of monkey oh my god that's why it looks like a monkey oh it's a stuff what is it it's monkey statue the Feast of the chair of st. Peter and they dressed what is the the statute was just a bronze statue of Saint Peter okay there's a dark statue trying to tell you st.

was sword sir yeah what's that place you eat at and they all look like that rear their horse Chows medieval Manor in tight places medieval times many times yeah well I believe medieval Manor was a place like that in Boston I think there's a few of those all over the I never went to one of those either I'm just scared of the people that go to oh yeah there is they were close I still don't want to go to it well isn't that Renaissance Fair thing going on right now yeah that's I'd rather go to that that's hilarious yeah let me know one it's kind of cool I used to collect copper soldiers for fun it's something fun it's interesting it was funny because one lady broke character um and she was complaining about her husband's medication and the other lady said I do not understand this medication that you speak of she stayed in her like she was like bitch we're here making believe I don't want to hear about your husband complained about his pills well they've got him on this one thing and I don't know what that's for but then it sort of thing is supposed to counteract this medication it's like ma'am I do not understand of this medication to speak up for I'm just a winch and I wait the Prince bizarre like you're not supposed to break character yeah and these people like really get into it and then I bet they get drunk and fuck each other don't you think I'm sure this must be a goddamn crazy person's orgy yeah they all get together with their wacky outfits on phone each other and fake accents my neighbors why they fence in the backyard why not they look hot to go for kids damn pretty people why not right why not why not why not put on a fucking like a pirate's outfit like why not have you ever seen those pirate themed bars where they all have to dress up as pirates right and yeah and when they get off work they still think they're pirates like there's a whole show about Africa what the show is called so like they get locked into that yeah they get they steak they stay in character oh Jesus Christ like what about when they get home then watching TV they're pirates sitting home watching Frasier so like when they talk to their Google home thing they're like hey Google let me know where the Ale is cold in the women are hot do you have a lot of home like Cirie and Alexis at your house that asshole thing or is that asshole that you you can make series say Oh motherfucker motherfucker yeah you can make serious a motherfucker yeah people think I was joking about that let me show you how to do that watch this folks here we go what is the definition what's the definition of mother come on you piece of shit I'm sorry about that what's the definition of mother she has given birth do you want to hear the next one yes as a verb it means bring up a child with care and affection do you want to hear the last one yes as a verb it means give birth - oh my god Siri bitch yeah they did they removed it do you know a red ball come on it was funny how did they leave it in there and then take it out did they took out the dead body woman I remember the first one that's a crazy one short for motherfucker yeah it would say as a you know yeah I bet Alexis still has it I think I tweeted what it said what exactly it said yeah I I did it I did it the day you did it it took me a couple tries because I didn't say it right but it ended up doing it it says as a noun short for motherfucker but it could be a verb as well right yeah if you're actually a motherfucker ass here with mother means and it gives you the correct definition then it asks you do you want to hear the next one you say yes it says as a noun it means short for motherfucker yeah I got it right but it was weird to hear like I heard it I was like what that's real like imagine if that's like your mom and she's like teaching a little kid to use Siri like mommy how do I know what mom means well we can ask Siri sweetie we can ask Siri what mother means okay okay nice to it do you want to hear the next one okay as a noun short for a motherfucker a little kids like what tell me what did they say do you know what a serious say if you ask if Santa's real or some shit like that mmm is Santa real I'm going to pretend you didn't ask that I don't want you to get a lump of coal this year Alexa tells you and uses the shares of Needle Siri are you allowed to swear I don't have is there something else I can help you with I just want to know if you stopped using curse words recently I'm not sure I understand well earlier in this week I had asked you what mother means and you gave me one definition then you had you said do you want to hear the next one and you said as a noun it means short for mother fucker I just thought that was weird Siri you sound like a crazy person I'm trying to talk to you about this issue that you and I are having about communication and what do you say to me you say that's not nice well it's not nice for you to say motherfucker in front of that little three-year-old just learn how to talk wow this is the future here's some of the we have enough us telling you about this is the future we're gonna be having arguments with our digital devices like that that's a crude like helper I get super crude helper right like what Siri could do and not do it's very crude but this is just like the iPhone one right maybe they could have thinking they're absolutely gonna have some sort of AI that can keep up with the conversation for sure that's going to it's it's pretty crazy how much ahead I think Google and Alexa are ahead of Siri there's terrible yeah I mean having both of the home pod on the Siri in the Alexa echo whatever it's night and day difference what's better Siri or Bixby Bixby's of Samsung one eye I think well Bixby is very new I think series better than that but like Alexa they've they've even improved the Lexus so much where you sing like hey Alexa sing me a love song and there's a whole song that Alexa sings do and there's like ten of these songs well I think that Google has it down the best with that Google pixel - phone then squeeze the sides and the Google assistant comes on and when the Google assistant comes on you just ask it anything if Google assistance is just better okay that's good it just it just works better it's just it's better it finds you results better it's not as clunky it doesn't seem as weird you know I think we're in this weird place right now with phones you know it's like we're expecting things of phones that we don't even want or need and they've never asked for before we're looking for a lot mented reality phones that double as projectors to project a fucking movie on a wall I've seen those their phones are doing that yeah it's it's very interesting I love paying with my phone that's my news well that's a great love Apple pay your face use your face yes you pay for shit or Apple watch you learn today Shea hey what did you think I didn't talk to you about this what did you think about the US government telling us not to use Huawei phones Huawei phones are made by the Chinese and they're like don't trust the Huawei phones yeah well I mean there might be something to it like it like if it say something that say you know like an iPhone it sends messages to Apple all the time of location and all that crap like that so that's like Oh foreign country that has an ability to track its people you know it's a little weird I see why they did it but it's a shape phone anyway who cares well apparently they're in some sort of a dispute with Huawei about Iran see if you find that like something Huawei to be punished something I ran something about servers that they sold to Iran they're not supposed to sell I don't know Jamie found the article but then they were saying we recommend you not using that consumers not use their phones and a bunch of tech guys that I was reading I was reading a bunch of articles and the tech guys were super skeptical because one of the things they were saying is like if anything is in there we'll find it like you can't just say like they might be using these things as spy devices without Annie without any evidence it says Huawei is under US Criminal Investigation for illegal Iran sales heels here's what's next so the other the other theory by the super conspiracy theorists is that they're trying to keep out the number three cell phone maker in the world from establishing a foothold in the US market and economically strengthening the communist government over there or pseudo communist government what are they now they're communist but they can make money but I literally saw something stumbled across something I think on Instagram is just a post about Huawei and then being linked to the CCP which is the Communist Party in China yeah people are like don't do it it's too bad dude because they got this fucking phone which one megapixels in the camera right that's in bitch don't shoot down my dreams I don't piss on your Yeezys need to check him on these Huawei is he took a day off of these Huawei has this something mate Pro Porsche Design RS something RS it's a crazy phone it's got 500 gigabytes of storage 500 500 gigabytes of storage it's crazy I think maybe even more than 500 it's got a 40 megapixel camera it turns literally turns night in the day when you take photos like when David's like a four second aperture will stay open and you see the pictures you like holy shit you see regular camera photos and then you see the photos with this camera they're like hands down this is the best camera in cellphones today you know hard it would be to take that picture though oh yeah super are you done still for four seconds or you be all blurry and fucked up I don't know how that works you do more than I do you would have to really hold it steady right like sitting on something couldn't even crack the button you'd have to have a remote trigger you'd fuck it up by even and maybe touching it and it'll give you a slight pause and they'll start they don't probably they might do that now actually but they don't need to typically do that see if you can go to that it's camera go to the Huawei what is it I think it's like the mate 10r is that it yeah do this phone is the shit I'm disgusted that it's a spy device cuz I want one so bad so I think isn't that good I mean have you looked at the reviews are we terrible their reviews probably like yeah it's not as good as an iPhone I like the fact that there's competition it makes me excited you just like the Porsche Walt I like that too obviously I like those cars I like their engineering they they're German wizards you know they know how to design shit in a really spectacular way they make cool stuff they make cool watches and shit but I think that what what's really well there's a bunch of things interesting to me about it but what's interesting to me is when these cameras and these phones from these Android manufacturers are so good it forces Apple to come with some next-level shit to like this is a technology race unlike any other race like computers have even stalled out right like you get a new MacBook do you even pay attention to what the fucking gigabytes are now now you know remember the gigahertz we're like the thing like you want to all got 2.7 should I pay more for the 3.2 remember that yeah $300 more $500 more for one point yeah remember they these take those seller ons and overclock oh yeah you know I mean people do anything to get to one you know one 100 megahertz or one what's what's like three gigahertz is like a good laptop right it's all about quad processors now for me right now it's cores but in the old days like you'd get like a seller on 400 right multi-threading process yeah hyper thread like when they hit one gigahertz people were shitting their pants like I can't believe we got a 1 gigahertz computer this is madness overclocking still I don't think it pushes above 5 maybe never overclocking dudes it go into the the little spacers what are those things called again jumpers the jumpers and move them around and change things the bios your fucking computer be catching on fire to be running so hot yeah shit's real I just worked that gateway that was always so fun cuz we always had that the brand-new computers like the day it came out like oh we have the new Pentium 2 you know mm-hmm that fast seller ons so I just got from my twitch channel said ask computer no badass overclocked to SLI blue cards whoo the shit called MDOT to storage which is super fast and it's crazy well now what is this what companies this from the company that made it is origin PC they put together the parts that gave me a pretty cool glass with my logo on and all that kind of shit there's LED lights in it someone's looking away sometime I got a razor yeah that razor laptop is like one of the closest things so like like build quality the way a MacBook fields yeah the metal frame and it's real tight tolerances and good keyboard and shit yeah it's a great computer it's powerful I mean I use it for virtual reality and it's got one of the best graphics cards you can buy you know it's it's pretty sweet I used to buy everything Apple I just buy Apple laptops Apple phones but I like it that it's a question now you know like I told you that I started using that ThinkPad I like that thing way better than a MacBook the keyboard is way more responsive there's what there's travel to the keys like it's easier to type like there's something about those little clickety click Keys that the new MacBooks have where you the you make more mistakes they don't they don't you don't have a feel to them because you're not you know like oh yeah that clicked oh yeah that clicked to a clumsy type or like me I type way better a keyboard that has some travel to it like you get some feel you get a feel of what you're doing and where the letters are the new MacBook Pro is probably one of the worst versions of any MacBook Pro since you know they started making I hate the new MacBook Pro with a passion in the double the dongle shit needs to stop like the other day I needed a USB port I didn't hey I forgot my dongle there was no way for me to do it anything that I needed to do it's the worst it's the worst you guys husband's just not everywhere yet yeah you know I mean it's a lot of things you could charge your phone with USB see but there's some things that you have that are old USB and if you have me like oh well this is useless I wish Apple would have a exchange program where you could go in and they'll take out your touch bar in that keyboard and just put in like any keyboard you want like I just want a regular MacBook Pro keyboard on my laptop but even in the MacBook for the thing about this Jimmy the way the keys work like when you type in on it there's all this travel they feel good like I can like I put my finger on J and F and when I'm typing I can they feel like they're pressing the press press press press press it's not like it's like no travel doesn't give you like the same amount of feedback and you got ports yeah ports that Lord but feel a light it is that's the crazy thing that's nice yeah I like that little light sexy really sexy great battery life to what you know what this processor is do you know what has no idea it's just Celeron 400 mm so we're gonna set up a land party here where we're trying to figure out the right way to do it but we're gonna set up a land party here what game nothing for tonight so all you guys are doing I think I think he will be addicted to fortnight in that underground more than anyone you know if I have a limited amount of time so we go right back to quake what happened yeah but it's bet it's like then it's if you like quake you'll love this but do the quake champions game this this quake online game looks so crazy good and the fact that it's all web-based now come on son it's yeah went away some time come on over man fuck some people up bring some people into a room you would be a championship gamer not wouldn't if you if you got into a things and if you got into it you would be like one of the top gamers you'd be the ninja no no I'm uh not quite autistic enough to be the top food-chain sad-ass um I don't know who he is you see the top guy when you say he's tough he's one of my favorites to watch he got yeah I think honestly that video games are product at high levels especially quake it's deceptively intellectually challenging like when they have these they would do a lot of these one-on-one death matches and they would be in a room and they would both spawn at the same time then you have to run you have to have knowledge of the map and you also have to have knowledge of when certain items are going to respawn let me steal the rocket launcher the another rocket launcher will respawn and like I forget how many seconds like 30 seconds so they would run the map shoot the guy collect the extra rocket launch before he can keep him unarmed and keep killing him over and over again and after you kill him a certain amount of time the game's over and the guys who were really good at that were just they're just really smart they're really smart really fast twitch super tuned into the game just like locked in and then they'd study those maps and then they also study like movement they could do crazy shit like rocket jump onto people and do things like that like get two areas of the map just because they understood how to hop they could do it in a way that other people don't know how to do that the kind engine he's talking about is what you're describing so then the game fortnight you have to build these crazies this fortnight yeah you have to but you find mats which are materials and you build forts so it becomes these one-on-one matches if you're playing solo where you have to like literally build advantage you have to gain advantage why is it why their bricks are flying in the air he's gaining the materials so you're mining oh and then that becomes what you're talking about you have to like either you have only a couple guns you can choose from so how did this build this bridge here he's doing it that fast he's he knows there's a guy over there he's going to attack right now and it's his decision on how he does it though and that this map never changes really they just sort of changed break through the building to get in there yeah you can break through and then build it back up I got a problem with this game adicted just watching these diction is the colors - this game has got some crazy colors which is like yeah crack for your brain yeah this is amazing and it's weird cuz grown adults just fallen in love with this overnight well that's what I'm saying like I was joking around about video games that I'm not artistic enough I think the best guys are going to be considered like chess players I think it's like kind of the same thing it's just chess is traditionally worshipped as this intellectual game right but I think that a lot of video games like Starcraft for sure is like this really high level strategy game you're you're doing things and you're thinking on multiple levels about different parts of the board and different things that you're moving around it seems to me to be like physically dynamic - because things are moving quick like you you're not you're not in control of what your opponent is doing while he's doing it's all happening in one time you're trying to think your way through things and put stuff here and move stuff there - this weird underappreciate them because when they first started out they were frivolous like pong and stuff like that - dude dude dude dude don't do do it do it so we think of him as being dumb but they're so sophisticated now and kids are making fucking shit loads of money there who was who was saying that he was saying that your kid like you should parents should probably encourage their kids to play a games because there's fucking money in it now yeah right you know Johnny Carson's old studio you've been there probably a million times you Jay Leno the old studio it's now a blizzard arena right down the street for me there's every day ready to go there ya go check it out I would love to go - it's right down the street for me that's crazy but it's every time I Drive by it's just crowds of people like a sports game okay now I want you to put on quake champions goodness gracious what do you mean goodness gracious what is this the game is called overwatch I'm trying to find it and arena things do you can see what it looks like just put on quake I don't want to see anymore this shit good he quick arena quit championships whatever they call it you're safe okay even on the on the sizes I'm about quake and Joe Rogan huh to work it out on quick watch this here we go son what is this is that an ad first whoa the gameplay dude come on see this is way better look at this this is old-school yeah this room I want to plate it cuz it reminds me of the old I mean look at the graphics in this fucking thing god damn graphics are good now I mean it's just a wonder if that's bad for your eyes or good for your eyes imagine if they found out that video games actually improve eyesight remember when we grew up they were told us not to sin x close to the TV but now we are sold VR units where we're the closest to a TV possibly made what happened to that like what oh look at this motherfuckers that old oh shit dude this game looks perfect this is still quake Britain endless dun dun dun see that rocket jump yeah come on son what was the one was a was it quake the one that they had this space one where you just like like trampled leaned over yes yeah yeah I think that was quake 2 they had that they that they had bouncy little things everywhere I came along at quake 2 I didn't play a whole lot of quake 1 but quake 1 was really fun I played a little bit of it it was really fun quake 1 was um he's like kind of blocky looking dudes with like helmets on they run around shooting each other but it was like real fast paced like unrealistically fast paced like it wasn't like this one of the things that some people liked about what was that half-life game that people would play was based off a half-life and it was like an army game counter-strike yeah he's most popular game probably still right now one of the things they loved about it was that it had more realistic physics how many times would your phone rings you take a picture of the screen Oh how many times.if how many of your photos are screenshots unnecessary screenshots over amount yeah a lot anymore what was I just saying how half-life turned into our me oh yeah so if you go to quake one what does this game your counter-strike it's honestly I pretty sure it's still the same levels as back in whatever night really really one HD which is better this looks incredibly this just looks good gotta get you guys computers like I wish got headshotted dead wake up with a knife trying to find a gun here we go okay go to quake one what's that quake 1 game live now oh yeah every gang everyone right now yeah oh that's crazy gonna see anything if you're curious about a new game you just go to twitch and watch someone this looks like a dude waiting for someone to play him I like to go to sleep watching a girl play some boring asked game look it's like there's people out there they're still into this this is how crazy quake one was the graphics didn't even matter because the game is all dark and moody and the gameplay was so fun that a lot of people even stayed with it after quake 2 and then quake 3 became like sort of fast paced like that so you can find a video people playing it there's a I think comparison of the old one versus the other updated graphics yeah it was super blocky what was the game that that there was a mod it was a mod but you're in the bathroom I can hear hiding in toilets and on toilet paper rules I feel like I've already asked it oh yeah those rocket arena there was like a rocket arena map where you could play quake in a bathroom was my favorite I would spend days on well there was a bunch of maps that people would create you know and there was even map making software and you could you could make a bap and guys were always doing it it was it was a really common thing there was a Joe Rogan level remember somebody made that oh with the JRE yeah look a little logo I think so someone did do something like that under that but it's uh I remember they would do all these new maps would come out and we would play matches on these new maps you'd kick my ass till 5:00 in the morning dude you like no don't get off yet I had a real problem with games you know Jim doing my best do my best to avoid them but we're gonna indulge a little bit here virtual reality man I just knew that's my that's my favorite man I can't kid and I love it and now you could play like it was a doom or a first person shooter forget which one it is dooms on there yeah all out for is on yeah you played doom doom in VR can you showing that show me doom in VR what's doom is it is it the more recently they can see original the original isn't it probably think so but it's probably like the CPU power probably isn't able to keep up I want to upgrade my age this is not the original one it's an upgraded version of it oh is it oh just upgraded graphics this um this does not look like this looks like the newer one took the original doom and remade it remastered if helos what it's called that's crazy yeah this is it actually bought this game oh yeah so this is doom VFR which is a special VR version and I think they might have some levels I don't know if it's the actual full game from start to finish oh my god dude but when you said it's the original game I thought you meant like with the original graphics these graphics are really good yeah this is this will fuck your life up I said I could have brought it dude this hoop this right here could fuck your life up this looks way too fun you don't have virtue area do you have virtual reality at your house no running I work out no we don't need to do that anymore man that scared the shit out of me that legitimately scared the shit out of me what that watch that video the doom because I was like that could ruin my life did the futures liposuction ask Kanye man liposuction opioids and playing virtual reality tomb so I shrivel up I'm trying to make 1:30 that's how you do it just just play video games all day you never eat steak eat oh yeah what games you playing uh I just got a God of War then you got a war which that looks almost want to see graphics that's amazing graphics to me I saw only in the commercial but it looks incredible yeah it's that and that's a real fun game I tried to get into Far Cry 5 but it yeah I like the call aspect like at first I told Duncan Trussell you have to buy this immediately expenses this is a real walkthrough gameplay yeah oh my god yeah that's gameplay this is gameplay yeah a loading screen there's no game dude look at the steam coming out of his mouth this is incredible yeah and no like he said no loads screens it goes in like that's just the game dude this is nuts yeah and yeah that's all third-person or do you do it first-person keep this going James James real quickie do they know it's that a dog just going crazy sometime just going crazy oh yeah here's hunting oh yeah oh my god this is nuts yeah do that again oh no all the way all the way the beginning I want to see like how they set it up good the shooting in the head he's trying to why would you do that this is real this is real clunky looking like it doesn't look real but it looks way realer than anything I've ever seen before so this is yeah check this out this is actually like this is you battling some of my guys trying to kill you with that big rock yeah it says his games are amazing now there's a shadows and everything it's incredible yeah but what I'm saying is that like I mean this obviously looks amazing but in how many years do you think it'll be indistinguishable from real life ten twenty twenty for sure right in twenty years you know thinks I'm sort of skeptical on this a little bit because I feel like the bar keeps getting moved at five years ten years every couple years we get close yep tick over here we get close but it's still like the winded the ones you get your first five it was it's been four or five I've had the oculus rift since beta testing I had always had it and I just had a big VRLA thing this weekend and I didn't hear anyone sharing anything that was like mind-blowing experiences that are making everyone God spend $2,000 on a well I think right now what's happening is the infancy of VR in a commercial level that's what we're seeing I mean it's like if you go back to the early day Atari boxes and then compare them to a new Xbox I mean I think that's what we're looking at you're just saying that it's not happening quick it's also that those already happen those are gigantic gaps but like you could look at it from a different perspective and be like it's still just playing with a remote control on a TV with some computer power behind it and yeah those are virtual stuff is also sometimes connected to those three-dimensional what are those things think how do they call them they don't call it a treadmill what do they call them neat rack omnisphere yes yeah that thing have you seen that thing yeah you're strapped into the center of this thing and it moves or else you could walk through these 3d environments but you know if you was gonna save just 20 years ago what kind of bullshit ass graphics are we looking at and now look at what we're looking at now if they just 20 years from now they'll probably have it like at the very least it'll be like watching Moana or something that's right I still feel like it'll still feel super fake we'll still know that this is still a fake world and it's not gonna ever feel I get lost in it pretty I think it's easy to get lost in it and nowadays they have big rooms almost like size of chuck-e-cheese where you renting out and so you don't need a treadmill because you're actually going through obstacles that are feel real like they'll what if they did it in a way where it's like it's it's it's not realistic but it's really good like like what if they did Despicable Me like you were in Despicable Me you know the animated movie with what's the dude's name the fucking bad guy yes I forget is the the bad guy in the characters name those it grew I don't have any candy I have kids but the graphics are incredible it's beautiful I mean stunning to look at like wow they did an amazing job with this but it's obviously not real you know I want to be like like that or like X not just a simulation of your life you'd want to be able to fly early you know jump over fucking buildings you've gone you've done the Simpsons game right in Universal yeah fucking incredible right so good all right the rock yeah well yeah I said yeah that ride where it's this huge video screen and your your car moves up and down and they're just taking you through this crazy thing that you're seeing in front of you and it's probably as thrilling as any actual ride where you're really moving right just the Back to the Future ride though before that I didn't see that one you guys done 40 yet and the 40 theaters out here no that's what you should try man that's where your the whole thing moves with the movie that's also smell there's also mist and water yeah it's it looked like I went pukey kind of is it like that Star Wars ride Star Tours at Disneyland you ever done that yeah it's kind of like that yeah nice moves and you could turn off like I don't want water I don't want fart there should be there will be something like that I feel like I was trying to look it up right now but I remember Steven Spielberg talking about developing a room type theater process process where you're not maybe you're not wearing anything but things are being projected into the room you're in and you're experiencing the movie like that like maybe like avatar in the future would be like 25 people jump into the room and it starts playing and you're experiencing it happen around you first is wearing a headset and watching something I don't think they've developed it yet but I have seen some Holograms and Holograms man seems big like Globe Theater is happening in like Vegas mmm I think I just told you about that yeah yeah I think group things are gonna be really interesting in that too of like everybody experiencing that in a group the same way you experience like a movie in a group you know it's entirely possible that they'll develop something like that right where they'll have warehouses where people meet up and everybody goes into these virtual worlds together like you go on missions and shit yeah just wear something that's it's tuned in to the the Wi-Fi signal of the building and you're wearing like a lightweight helmet like a bicycle helmet with you know it's straps on so it's not something that's really cumbersome you know it has enough battery life and enough juice to get you through a one-hour game or three hours to have battery they have VR experiences where you can go with your whole family and you're all in the game wearing these things and you're in the game together damn yeah what kind of games uh anything like virtual reality games like they have the this zombie game are you running from zombies in a warehouse yeah yeah I think I are linked from good mythical morning he was talking about how he brought the family and your he was getting chased by zombies and I heard that they were thinking about doing something like that now that you think of it but I didn't know there wasn't actually a place now yeah and rollercoaster about this before I feel like we talked to us in Utah right right yeah like but I think that's the future I think the future this is like you go to a football field and it's like a virtual game is being played you know but then you got to stop people from like physically assaulting each other in the virtual world yeah you have to have a babysitter any all right now I remember this you get off an elevator the future of virtual reality time axis employed the void let's save a Ghostbusters experience and this is incredible and that's cool because you're in there in the game with your friend like you can see your friends you're in a room with them essentially yeah so now you're wandering around and see what they're saying it's easy to see to see what they're saying this is gonna blow their minds as the verge Wow fuck yeah it's already here then so this is one place it has this I believe so yeah there's a place here right across the street from The Grove that's like the IMAX VR thing but I don't think it's it's definitely not this but they might have some similar I definitely have way too many of these stories in my head well when I went to did the house of comedy admit I'm in the Mall of America I was across from it it's great great huge but they have like they're like across from it they have a virtual reality arcade where it's one is skydiving you're hanging well you know and it was that was the whole thing like you tell that's going to become more popular kind of like a whatever those arcades are one of these in Anaheim yeah they do so it says yes Disney do the Star Wars experience oh is that new yeah oh wow I did soaring over the world you ever do that that's at Disneyland it's a giant screen - they've been in Disneyland it was bad you sit down in your chair you get lifted up and it takes you towards this giant screen and on this giant screen you us--or all over these different parts of the world how cool dude it's fucking crazy that the ride is amazing you fly over all these different spots and you experience all this like as if you're soaring and you feel like a light breeze and there's different smells that they send your way like the older one was soaring over California you would look at this at bears like what you doing bitch you would soar over these orange trees that bear looks so fake by the way right oh yeah I really that's clear that bear but the other one was Soarin over California which is pretty amazing too and you you'd soar over the oranges you'd smell them you'd smell the water from the beach and you things like that'll happen like the water will splash in front of your face then you all said you're be in Paris or you'll be somewhere else it's fucking awesome yeah I have that that's etham dare to talk about this on here I'd walk the plank I can't remember I said it on camera on your podcaster it's a real piece of wood and I have like it unbalanced wood where I have something underneath it so it kind of rocks we're standing on it I so you go up in this elevator in virtual reality Road and I have a fan that I turn on right when the elevator door opens yeah and you feel like you're walking on the side of the building like on this plank and it might I have my board kind of rocky so yeah and I can't do it I get halfway through it I like shit myself and and what's funny I pushed my girlfriend off the board and she was like freaking out and I just like gave her a little nudge and she goes oh and in the game if you fall off you fall down my god is that my girlfriend now this is crazy this is a new thing yeah yeah I think it's you know for the vibe I vibe yeah they have a new vibe out I need to get it which better resolution and stuff and supposedly they have a wireless adapter so you don't have all the cables anymore Oh coming soon I think the wires they have the most addictive archery game ever you have it those little monsters are trying to pack the castle have you put your arrows at them for some cool virtual pools cool - is it yeah is you have like you know you have controllers and you can like it's it's pretty realistic or you could play pool yeah but if you could only play virtual pool regular pool be so fucking amazing if you don't it's like oh my god it's a real table look at the cloth I can feel it look I can watch the balls click together they're real the real in front of me like whoa I'd rather have a controller that pretends it's my finger and the controller there pretends it to stick yeah but you could also be playing it on moon on the moon you don't have a space for a table yeah that's true - with naked chicks yeah there's video games you could play a - on your phone but I've never even thought about it you okay quickly cake Quigley's in okay she's in a virtual reality porn oh boy she's not naked in as she's sitting there but she's getting molested by a naked girl and it's weird cuz when you're in the virtual world you're Kate quick whoa you are her that's a virtual porn there's got to be a big market yeah it's not as good as I was hoping for no yeah I was weird about it I just like in your head you think it's gonna be like alright this is realistic I am just gonna make masturbating way bit better but it's still clunky because all the companies that make virtual reality porn they're not making like perfect masterpieces they're still filming sloppy and edited sloppy for the most part I mean unless I haven't seen all of it but this is just a set up for Brian's new career as a porn director virtual reality these people don't have to fuck they're doing let me show you how it's done did you do the avatar one - no I did not is that a recent one any world avatar just open that must be amazing that's the real Disney so they're gonna do a some crazy giant Star Wars thing out here right mm-hmm that's gonna be awesome yeah man it's just we it's just a matter of time till there's gonna be something like that at a consumer level like like the avatar game that seems like pretty doable maybe don't you think with maybe I describe this little cynical view on it just like maybe super cool super Sonico Jaime I like VR chat that's my favorite thing in the whole entire world right now talking to people in VR yeah it's it reminds me of the old days of the internet like when I don't know what would it be message boards first came out or something it's just like I don't like the wild wild west right now well this is crazy and you could be anyone like I'm Wendy and you can go to a Windies in there and all the windi's characters together look there's cement Pikachu so people just get together in these rooms to hang out together there's the musicians that will just sit there and play songs for you but dressed up as and are you talking in your voice yeah it's you but some people use voice changers and stuff like that some people just hello my name is me see a lot of racist people in there of course if you leave people alone they just become racist if you give them notes those the schooling do you know the way and put them inside of a video game with no repercussions for their actions that's the internet especially if you'd be like a little girl and say terrible N words you know a little blonde girl on the screen meanwhile you're a 40 year old man from the Bronx that probably didn't check it but the Instagram update yesterday said something about their blocking words yeah boys like that has hmm well I wonder what people are fucking assholes with that man again assholes with the being mean to people online it's a new toy we don't know how to do it yet you know it's also revealing a lot of people that you didn't know like a lot of people that you never got in contact with it just really shitty people mean I'm only mean that companies like I've switched to my online bullying to only talking about bad services a service at like restaurants or delivery services that's right well if it's warranted yeah that's what I say but people get mad at me for like when I post those things I got posted some of the other day at this chicken place they burnt everything they sent me like everything like the corn on the cob was black the chicken was black I had to throw it away and I was late to think maybe the chef and lady work the counter they weren't paying attention eat chicken it's probably some 14 year old kid I get a freak on Oh probably you know I mean yeah probably some kid wasn't paying attention right I just had a good fantasy of what was really happening it was fun I fucked Anna frigerator I was drunk hey Houlihan's easy fella I dated a girl worked a Newport Creamery with me what's that like I like a cold stone ice cream place it served hamburgers yeah who's that you mean if it's me this fucking phone I've got a phone that for whatever reason turns itself on to ring all the time yeah like even when I don't it turns itself on the ring it's done it like twice you know I think it's this case this leather Apple case I think it's a piece of shit look at your volume buttons look at mine they're sunked in the middle like this I only had this like for a week and it's already falling apart nothing not enjoying and it overheats your phone I think cuz of the leather there's no way for they air to get out so that my shit's running slower than it should you don't I did the other day I put a battery pack on this like a madman putting them thick-ass battery packs on it yeah I felt like a superhero I could just go all day why don't you have it on now cuz I took it off cuz I feel like I was relying on too much I should just charged it at night I'm using my phone less and less after my trip to Hawaii because my phone broke I dropped it the first day there and I had to order a new one but I mean mine just stopped working the whole thing yeah duty would just randomly call people I would hold up I would hold up like my contacts and it would just start calling people and then I would hang up and it would start calling another person no hang up and I was showing people's like my friend John Dugdale's like watch this watch what it's doing and then I'd hang up and would do that again I'm saying what if I just dropped it and just went haywire that's crazy yeah I broke it and so when I got a new one for three days I wasn't doing anything so for three days waiting for my phone to come I didn't use any apps and enough and and I felt better I felt better but you're in Hawaii yeah yeah well that's you're in Van Nuys anybody put any cool pictures of cars our technology is so fragile like that then why are we still so scared of like AI if we could just find it smack it in the brakes a silly way to look I know I'm nuclear bombs Jamie smoke too much weenie dude dude or not enough hmm we should be worried don't you think if Elan must thinks we should be worried he's like in the business of that though of worrying people no no no but I mean of technology it's key yeah well also yeah yeah thank you not the business no not on it for simple like that's his business 35 there's a future of all technology he's he's the one figuring out the problems he's the one here to save us from all the shit that's his business that he created all those Tesla's got recalled I mean did you saw that right like 130 thousand Model S's got recalled because their steering column was fucked up or something is that what happened I don't know exact problem but a lot of them guys okay I remember seeing something how crazy is it flirt cancelled all their car Bryan Callen loves his he fucking loves it yeah Ford decided to stop making cars except the motherfucking Mustang fucker and SUVs I think well their SUVs are awesome they make that Lincoln town what is it not I'm good why they make it that's there's a new navigator it's a fucking incredible car it's incredible it's like they saw all these other cars like you know that luxury SUV family wagon market is a weird market like there's Range Rovers and there's a bunch of Mercedes SUVs and BMW SUVs but this is like the first other than the Cadillac Escalade kinda but this is like another level like super high-tech family luxury sled that hauls ass it's pretty dope dude I watched some of the videos on it how they make these things and like all the different features that they have in them huge screens now everything has giant screens like a lot of these cars now they don't have a dashboard they just have a screen and you know you could just you could customize it in different ways yeah might - a fake screen or virtual gauges yeah yeah it comes on Instagram you see man it's crazy it's weird it's weird to see I got a video we should watch this coming up from the Google IO thing it might counter to contradict what it says no joke Google assistant will start making phone calls to small businesses to make appointments on your behalf it's called Google duplex the AI call or even ads thumbs and whom's oh Jesus that's awesome I love that cool you freaking me out yeah okay so now that's I think we just learned something I think we're gonna be having conversations with those things it's gonna be like that movie with Joaquim yeah Joaquim Fisher that's her that is her look man it's just a matter of time I don't know how much time but it's definitely 20 years in 20 years you're gonna have people calling you you're gonna have me calling you I'm gonna call you and say some goofy shit and somethin gonna be me I'm gonna call you up and go dude what are you doing right now let's come on fuck sleep let's go do something let's get in the car let's go drive let's just go drive to Joshua Tree right now and do mushrooms fuck it you don't have any kids like okay I'll be by your house in 20 minutes you'd be out there waiting you are home sleeping well it is weird when you talk to like you know they could call up Apple or something like that and you had the automated assistant and they have the fake typewriter sounds like oh every time makes me mad I'll do that yeah oh my god that's so crazy thanks right why don't you just take that out and just be fast let me hear something let me hear some of that fake typewriter south that's hilarious I forgot they do that Apple does that oh it's so clunky - sounds shitty I just wish Apple had more options you know like I get that they only want to have one phone and a few different versions of it rather you know they have a small one the big one the middle size this is a scammer attack scammer but what Brian said was that when you call Apple they would have a fake typewriter sound in the background but I did get scammed by the attacks camera I was the one I was talking about earlier yeah that's Alera but they didn't really get ya know I knew right away I got you got knocked on I did tell my accountant he goes yeah they don't do that you need to contact me with your whereabouts right now like who's who's hearing that goal what I gotta contact you hold on it the hell I'm in Walmart right now let me get to my car hello I'm calling you back about the tax thing oh we are so lucky that you have contacted me at this moment for dangers in the air sir did you fake type run did you see Chris chill he echidna war with those Logan guys I only know about because young Jaime young Jaime informed me that it might have been one of the most epic battles Chris so funny man yeah he owned them so hard to the point where I thought whatever the guys name is is like oh he's making fun of a young kid or something like he calls himself like young or he calls him an old man like that's old man making fun of a young whippersnappers yeah young people always like to point that out yeah you're older yeah I think it's hilarious as if because they're so terrified of getting old yeah like everybody is so like there's this thing or someone will make fun of you you broke look you bro you're fucking 36 years old does it mean it's almost over bro 659 thousand likes he said at least when my career dies you can film it and put it on YouTube remember suicide before why is Logan Paul he's responding to his oh I'm laughing cuz now I know why your comedy career took a dive oh Jesus he get owned and so then Chris says to him that yeah at least my career dies you could film it put it on YouTube that six hundred and fifty eight thousand likes more than Trump in any tweet Trump's ever had it gets a strong men is now strong that that that response is that's like the strongest response I've ever seen but this this is Logan response to that say but not gonna lie this single tweet is funny than your entire Netflix special thanks how does it feel to have your name finally attach to something funny oh my god oh my god I don't know what's worse being the shunned vlogger or being the 38 year old comedian arguing with the shunned vlogger on Twitter ask your fans to have their mom's read this tweet out loud see what they think oh my god oh my god he's the wrong guy to fuck with he'll do this all day old people roasting me greatest thing on earth how about this you're my son tag your fucking daddy damn powerful Chris D'Elia fucking love it hard in the paint [Laughter] Chris the funny dude man his Instagram stories are some of my favorites anything Chris does is pretty fucking funny Wow so far you've called me daddy and admitted to watching my entire comedy special are you trying to burn me or fuck me ok I get it hilarious don't know why you would try to fight a professional comedian on Twitter he's a comedian a guy like Chris who loves that kind of shit he loves that kind of stuff who doesn't yeah well he's like an artist with that kind of stuff like perfectly like not aggressive you know it's like everything about it it's like it's very smooth it's very good yeah it's like the old days you know that was a very good one you know people are so weird they really are I'm just wondering what's gonna be the next thing to people you know like Instagram seems to be like a that's a platform people like they're like pictures and text behind the pictures but like what is gonna be the next thing is it gonna be some sort of augmented thing some virtual thing or some goggles thing or it's gonna be something it's gonna be something in another space other than just your phone I really think that there's gonna come a time where the same amount of time that people spend on social media they're gonna spend some sort of an augmented state like you'll be able to wear these things for work because they help you pull things up so people just accept I have to have my goggles like everybody wears goggles at a certain point time because it's just so much cooler it adjusts for vision gives you perfect vision that black mirror episode about the human of the DVR where everyone can record yes that's I mean so many other black mirror things have sort of been coming true that seems like the most realistic one that might happen I think recording memories yeah probably someday I think they're close I saw an article recently they're close to being able to either record your dreams and play them back for you or reinterpret them after you're awake but I think it's record them as you're sleeping and you kind of find out what you were maybe re-watch it or something I hope not what if the shit's in high def what if you're like falling off buildings and high-def demons are barking at you no I do you ever out of nowhere just have a dream you're like embarrassed that you even thought that now you had no control it's a lot of them theoretically recording dreams is possible scientists are trying of course it is they're just gonna figure out how to get into the door with it eventually if people survive they're going to have with every generation a greater greater understanding of how to manipulate things around them it's just that's what people strive for strive for manipulating the environment manipulating you know electrical currents manipulating its concrete moving things around shaping things they just keep getting better and better and better at it of course we're gonna keep getting better and better at it technologically they're gonna have some crazy shit man and we're gonna wonder why we did it we're gonna all be stuck in some strange weird matrix-like environment we're already are it seems like it easily could be happening not necessarily like right now but on the way to that like what's the logical conclusion meters here does anybody believe that people at this point are gonna back up that they're gonna go hey you know what this technology is just getting too much into our lives we went to a restaurant last night dad was on his phone this kid's got a 12 inch iPad propped up in front of them the other kid in the other side of table has a 12 inch iPad prompt up in front of him and they're just watching three different things and no one's talking to each other and they're they're at a sushi joint Wow and you're like wow this is what people do they get together they they put a show on in front of the kid here you go and they just the entire time not even like the parents are done they want to talk and can I use your phone you're here go ahead and use my phone play a game the kids playing the game somebody's talking to somebody no nobody's talking to anybody everybody's looking at an electronic device you go to a public place and they sit down and they're not interacting with each other it is super normal man if you look around it's super normal super normal weird we're gonna wonder about that in a few years we're gonna wonder like how did they let that in how did they let this like I was watching these little kids I was like okay I don't want to be a parent but I'm just looking at it like a human how much less time are they spending talking to people now how many less awkward moments at the dinner table we had a workout just controlling your temper or controlling your emotions or controlling the way you're interact with people or try to be nicer about some of the ways you say things and learning to get the only way people learn about that stuff is at a dinner table right talking to each other that's part of like how people learn to communicate with each other sitting down at dinner right all of a sudden everybody's like watching a screen how much less time are we spending talking like how much shittier are people going to be if they continue doing that at talking to real people and is that an issue I think it is I think it people don't have as strong as compassion with each other like it like that as much compassion and like value human life that's why there's more school shooters and you know the the realness of it it's kind of getting faded you know death is way more in your eyes nowadays as a kid than it was when we were young we were just you know you know playing with frogs and playing cops and robbers we we didn't have internet to see death we didn't have TV wasn't about death at the time you know video and video games is all death I mean you have lives and video games when was the you have lives when you're a kid you know only cats had that that's a good appointment I mean especially how much you could see on the Internet the the amount of horrible shit that people see on a daily basis on the Internet like people tell me hey you want to see this video I'm like no I've seen enough I know what people are capable of I'm good some people not throw some people all day watching fucked up shit with cable though do you remember how I started with cable and when we weren't all that I wasn't old enough but did sorta but it really started with video tape okay like faces of death and shit like that you started seeing yeah that face of death I remember that video a friend of mine sent me was a girl walking towards a train she's not attention and she gets nailed by the train yeah and it's fucking horrific man she just gets torn apart you watch it you're like oh my god oh my god it's hard to watch I used to always talk about this but what was it was definitely phases of death and it was definitely UFC one two and three you know like the early days of UFC seeing mix-matched like people go at it and just the brutal Kos you know and there was no rules back then it was just like death yeah there wasn't very many rules like II couldn't I go you could punch in the nuts right and you never saw that before it was boxing on TV it was never like oh my god these guys are fighting night dirty yep dirty fighting and pulling hair and nut punching shit yeah yeah I think that's probably true - I think our appetite for stimulation is increasing that's what I think for real I think that's why people like so many thrilling things I think we're developing a stronger and stronger appetite for stimulation that's what I think it is good and and I think the internet and you know just so many different things you could see like how how was it the weekend like instantaneously pull up video of a volcano eating a car I mean what like how many people are supposed to see that like you're not supposed to see that shit all day from all over the world it's supposed to see all these different volcano eruptions and different shootings and cars running over people in Times Square and all that crazy shit if you lived in Kansas lava shouldn't really be yeah you got a small amount of things to think about in front of you you you could look forever at each direction everything's flat you shouldn't be worried about lava so you wish it you should have some fucking lava to mix things up that's got to be a weird place to be man when you're watching that earth crack open and you realize how thin the crust is between you and the most insane shit ever rivers of hot molten rock right under the surface of the ground you're walking on like what how much is down there why did we camp out here I get paranoid it's still at earthquakes I was in it bowie room at the Comedy Store the other day act right and if it was just like the big earthquake then we would all be dead it was too many people there would be no escape displacement because you know what I mean but I got that in my head I'm like okay I gotta get out of here it's a terrible thing to think of if you had a building and it starts collapsing or any parking garage and living here in LA we go to old parking garages downtown you're like oh yeah there I'm gonna be a sandwich something yeah man I I came to LA right after the first earthquake not my first one obviously but the big one the last big one and then there was some small ones after that there was a I think that one of the biggest ones was San Francisco I think San Francisco was during the World Series it was a really big one right how big was that one was it going on during a game yeah in the middle of the game the world started the end would that be cool footage San Francisco gets a lot of them Sixpoint there's a 6.9 is the same as the one Hawaii Wow what's the coincidence of that huh wow that's some powerful shit just though to me the it's a it's a thing that we all know to be true but you don't think about it until it happens we all know that the Earth's mantle shifts and moves we know that it happens we know that earthquakes happen we know the volcanoes happen but even so it's still so when is the earthquake Wow it's like a scene in a movie what that fuck holy shit Wow that's just one of those things you know we think of it like yeah yeah the earthquakes are real but until it actually happens that's scary that's kind of scary you felt a good one right you felt a little bit of a tremor yeah it's used to be way more when I first moved here like I you almost feel one like once a month it for a while I haven't felt one in a long time what is feeling oh yeah this is one hosted I felt an earth this is probably the biggest one I remember here yes it's a desk wants to do this happened to me before recently - there goes I started thinking about YouTube's fault yeah on my computer oh is it oh is it the machine yeah the TriCaster thing oh yeah that that freaked me up because the with the studio at the ice house and I kept on thinking about the ceiling just caving him because that's like a old building yeah and I freaked the fuck out that was scary I think they did something to make it earthquake compliant though do you know if I hope I'm right about this are you right do you know how you walked through the that courtyard area there's like bolts yeah they put all that stuff apparently to reinforce it from earthquakes yeah I mean that the walls are something it might fix but not the ceiling fall right I mean it leaks that's already half that buildings from like what 1950 something probably set earlier than that I mean that think it's crazy old right like it's I think it's been in operation as a nightclub since the 60s I think it started out as an actual ice house like way earlier than opened in 1960 1960 it opened the ice house what was it before in that building yeah I'm pretty sure in that building and it was an actual ice house which is why they decided to call it the ice house you know Sean doesn't work there anymore yeah I know it sucks 20 years he's an awesome guy the place is so sweet well where'd he go I'm not sure I'm talking about in there massage therapist now hey first feels weird cuz you know yeah the air we blows it in there oh I don't think that's that's not MPA approved could you imagine if this was is that a rub Maps still a thing uh it when Backpage that's so funny I know this when Backpage went down rub maps kind of freaked out for like a week and said okay you know we're we're not opening right now nothing's working you won't be charged this month and but then like a couple weeks later that it dates back and it was always working to like it they just had this weird notice before it well I wonder how people feel you know that are in that business I have those back page companies and all those those companies that are you know those those uh some it's like classifieds right right like so they have to pay to be in the class funds that work yeah so they lose all that business all of it it's like a non-viable business anymore well rub maps was good because it was like Yelp you know for massage parts and and so you if you wanted to go I use it for the opposite reason now where like the other day I wanted a real massage and I checked to make sure that that wasn't a rub-and-tug place right because they're all rubbing tub places here in Los Angeles like it's hard to find one that's not now and sometimes you just don't want that you want a real massage I guess what I said doesn't make sense though because it's illegal activity so as long as it's illegal activity of course they have to take it down now don't they not really what are these freedom estate agents shit like you're allowed to talk about cocaine you're not gonna get like your website taken down and that's crazy that's not what not even what I mean I mean I I don't think that I feel like if you're a person who is making this decision in like 2018 you saying you know what we got a crackdown on prostitution we got to figure out a waited we got to figure out a way to put a stop to this like what are you wasting your time doing that for like don't we have other really big issues that we have a hard time finding enough people to tackle the biggest problem is sex trafficking that's the exact real reason like there's too much traffic yeah that that's a big one um just when everything's unregulated right anything that's unregulated you're always gonna find someone who fills that gap was a criminal anything that's illegal that people want you know whether it's drugs anything it's really hard to tell people what they can and can't do it's really hard it doesn't seem to make any sense you shouldn't be able to as long as no one's getting hurt you know like what if someone decides hey man we looked at this furry thing and you guys were just too weird you can't do this anymore you can't just dress up like mascots and have sex with each other and eat dog food bowls you can't do that anymore that's you these people ever they're having a party as furries what if someone came comes along and says you can't do that anymore it's too weird I've right then fine I mean well I just think it's weird where people just can decide what other people can and can't do especially when it comes to something as ridiculous as sex touching is that thing that makes no sense Oh like handjob should not be illegal no that's not you're allowed to touch my arm but you can't touch my dick it's gonna be real weird when robots are fuckable like really weird when they're really fuckable like they're hot you know they're hot it feels good what if someone raped a robot is it gonna have rice oh Jesus Christ it's gonna kill you bro they don't need to sleep there's new stuff that chicks gonna wait to your sleep and then she's gonna fucking elbow your eye sockets right through I got arrested for like fucking a car recently or something like yeah I didn't hear about that I think it's a matter of time before they develop an AI in a physical body that so closely resembles a human body that you could turn the lights down light a candle those news might be like the hottest girl in the world you've seen the new ones right sorry sex robots the ones I think they're make it they make them in San Diego I think it's the same guy that made the real doll but he has that new AI and the new bodies and it's it you could order it now I think he pre-order it now really it's they had a video of it in the eye it's pretty legit and it's not bad it talks to you it remembers you you can pick the face you can design what you want it to look like dude it's a matter of time I know it's a matter of time I know what comedian you know fleshlight remember flashlight hmm I guess they make these motorized flashlights well now like we like kind of just strokes you why you fucking so my friend here comedian we know I won't say who it is but he injured his dick hold from it like if it went too hard it went too hard and he had to go to the doctor and terrible story yeah Jesus Christ dude that's a terrible story I kind of flush like the other day I haven't used one in a while do you still use yours Brian just hit the wall it's uh I always felt so much more shame using it than I did using my hand but it does feel better it's way better it does that's legit this travel weather nice we shoot through so you don't even have to like clean it up anymore you just shoot through it what is this I made a homemade dick soccer Jesus Christ this looks terrible is that metal PVC pipe the pipe is cut at 45 degrees first light PVC pipe the fuck out of here he's got a it's got like a little kids toy train it's gonna chew chew right onto his dick look at nylon nuts bolts washers aluminum fine wood plywood 12 volt power supply 50,000 oh my god that is hilarious so it's gonna slowly but he can control the pace that it blows them proof of concept yeah whatever bro tighten the flesh one motorized that's this one well listen I think I think we wrap this up and safely missed these are strange days I think we learned a lot today I did not know that you could make a fucking phone call with an artificial intelligence thing that could say um and would make appointments for you and shit we all that scared the shit out of me I didn't know about these choo-choo train fake vagina contraptions these kids are hacking these wacky kids I learned that I'm I am very confused when it comes to the future very this stuff is I think this is all happening in front of us I think it's insanely crazy and insanely transformative and it's happening and we don't have a fucking clue as to where it's going and there's nothing we can do about it so we're all like well hey that's what it is I think it's nuts I think we are we're 20 years from the fucking matrix and we're seeing it happen we're seeing it happen right now in front of us we're seeing a little baby steps like nah we're so far off yeah I went to that whole thing the other day it was nothing I went to the conference no nothing impressed me would you rather find out that we're about to be in it or that we've been in it the whole time which would make you more comfortable that's a very good question damn that's a good question what do you think I think we're already in it sock to that one well gun to the head I think the reality itself is obviously some sort of weird thing because you're looking at it you're looking at it through your eyes your eyes are determining the positions that things are in and what they look like and where things are and there's all these things that are going around you all the time they have no control of and they're everywhere all over the planet people living lives and you interface with those lives occasionally you're just accustomed to the manner in which you do it so it seems normal but every night you close your eyes and you go unconscious and who knows what the fuck happens to your brain and then you wake up in the morning you have to pee and you're struggling to try to figure out what happened yesterday and then while this has happened your ex-girlfriends fucking your best friend from high school and they got together and you know it's like can't believe Jamie left I mean who said it was gonna stay forever and then next thing you know like this is these all these lives intersect with each other all over the world it is kind of a hologram it's kind of a crazy reality if the real life wasn't real it would be super interesting you'd be like look if the way life works look at the way they breathe in air and breathe out carbon dioxide and the trees breathe in the carbon dioxide and breathe out air but they keep chopping down the trees they keep chopping down the trees they don't care like who cares I want paper I want to wipe my ass with a tree I just wipe their ass with trees literally they grind millions of trees down every year and turn it to pulp so they can make paper to wipe their ass they literally wipe their ass with nature what why don't they just use soap and water no no I want a treat I want some pulverized tree to wipe my ass with tissue paper its tissue paper it's fucking trees it's tissue paper really made out of trees yeah hey it's percent yeah so we have synthetic tissue paper that's made out of like dolphin tears something even worse but I think what's like synthetic toilet paper is that real I mean look they have tofu chicken right you don't think they have like some sort of an organic that can make plastic out of it I think do they make hemp toilet paper and would it be too rough they'd be the best thing every free bathroom tissue hemp 23 someone's doing it someone's putting it together paper is it a startup said Figo dude I was late I was reading all the people that invested hundreds of millions of dollars into that scam blood test company that blood test company story is crazy theranos there was this woman and they were calling her like the next Steve Jobs but the steel I guess the female Steve Jobs she even dressed like him she wore black turtlenecks really yeah and she she had become this self-made person jerk I think from college started this company and then by the time she was like 40 whatever she was when they they busted her she was worth thirty four billion dollars because this blood testing thing that she had developed and then as time went on they realized that it didn't really work and that all these people had invested like Betsey Davos I think it was and Warren Buffett had Warren Buffett invested over a hundred million dollars nine twenty five yeah in this company that it was it was bullshit so these they put these people's health at risk because they gave them these tests and the test didn't work and they're showing that they kind of knew the test didn't work but this is how this woman dressed all the time it's um it's really interesting man it's a really interesting story because when you see the amount of money that people invested into it and then they're just shit out of luck she went from being worth I think she was worth something crazy like the richest woman ever are the richest self-made woman ever something along those lines I think she was worth like thirty four billion dollars at one point she's a Twitter yeah and then she's recently been charged with massive fraud I don't know I mean I don't know shit about that business so I don't know if the blood test did or didn't work or if she's got a store that needs to be told and I don't know we just just read what you read and what you read is that they they fib about results and they they did some shit that they shouldn't have done and all these people got tests and they thought they were you know if you get a blood test you think you're getting the accurate results from a reputable company and it wasn't it was a micro click like they would take like a micro prick of blood and they would take that blood and they would measure it and that's how they would find whether yeah yeah he said that one all the richest self-made woman worth four and a half billion okay so what I say 34 that's not even real who has that much like three guys okay so she's worth four billion that's still nothing this needs that I got two bedroom apartment remembered and four I see a four is it your father who is it who's hit in the past so this this this thing the story when it came out that all these people had invested hundreds of millions of dollars into it it made me think like do you imagine how long it takes to make a hundred million dollars to have a hundred million dollars to invest in something that's bullshit if you imagine like what it must feel to find out that that shit didn't work look what like yeah you invested in a scam it's all bullshit what yeah this is they're being charged with massive fraud no no yeah you're a hundred million dollars is gone what what the fuck did you just say you're hundred million dollars is gone they
