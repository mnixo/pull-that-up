that's what's scary not scary but to me interesting to see what happens with John Jones because now they suspend for a year right and he's been out even longer and then before that so they're stripping his style and Dana obviously you know he never sticks to what he says sometimes he does but he does he'll never be a main event again like we can't book him as the main event because we can't trust him anymore Wow I know right so for John grandi he's doing that that flow grappling event against fuck out of here that flow grappling you've been fighting for the UFC heavyweight title oh no I'm just saying lessee doing something active like at least he's not Muhammad Ali yeah I guess he's lost millions of dollars but at least he's doing something in combat sports well he's only suspended for a year retroactively least July yep in July yeah so he has to get I think still a while before I did that huge left for you see 200 so when he comes back to me interested to see what we get out of I know and then he came back and he fought ovince st. Preux and you know look kind of tentative and then you saw Jimmy Manawa run through ovince st. Preux all these guys are getting better they're getting better they're rising up and you know Rumble rumbles fighting DC for the title again that's gonna be a real interesting fight super interesting whose remember Rumble did land that huge RDC and lanthanum yeah who knows in this fight he's got neon blance in his corner now he's had him for a few years now he's worked with a lot on his grappling he guarantees concentrated a lot more as wrestling there's a lot of videos of him running wrestling drills wrestling non-stop yeah so he's preparing preparing to get up his program for takedown defense fun fight man it's the toss up for me toss up and then Jon Jones has all this laughs comes back and it's a rumble for a reason wins he's like what's up man yeah let's do it well why do you think he's gonna get a straight shot at the title I don't even know if he would get a straight shot at the title and pawn coming back you know that's why everyone wants to see though in it maybe that's why fans didn't there might be something going on by then by the time this time rolls around next year or July rolls around so he's gonna he's free in July whether that means see I don't know how suspensions work but what I would have been explained to me his performance-enhancing drug suspensions don't even allow you to train with other fighters around the roster really yes when your suspension is up then you train with them I don't think you're even supposed to be sparring with them what once they hand down a suspension have that regulation do they know about that man damn right I look that up Jamie I don't think that's gonna wrap this up soon yeah I don't think that's true I hope it's not because it's crazy because you could help your teammates even if you're suspended you could still train and help your team and also sharpen your sword a little bit that's like telling a guy was an accountant you're suspended for a year you can't even touch your calculator well why he's touching calculators Texas Instrument challenege no these make up remember those now your phones like you later ti-83 was like a fucking elongated Gameboy you like to calculate a businessman they took a hit they're no longer a reco who's buying calculus they're like blockbuster there's none of them left meds or anything Jamie see anything I don't think so but the other thing to your point where you don't think you who says we get a title shot the lightweight the light heavyweight division is just l dinosaurs besides the top view guys they're so old Jon's like I'm not fucking fighting Shogun again I don't know how dare you fight again but Jimmy manna was a very dangerous fight for anybody right now he's a dangerous fight for Jon - you are not you are REME animal it up ovince st. Preux you see what happen when you fight Guster he he got cracked yeah do you see what happened when she fell Rumble he got cracked he got dealt with that's plenty fun up wrestling yeah I'm dealt with right it's part of the game well ovince st. Preux just went fuckin the full distance with John Jones in a tough fight with a sleepy Jon Jones and I had a broken arm yeah got his arm broken that Shawn broke that arm by throwing kicks right yeah but my point is he went the distance and st. Preux took him out pretty quick I think he's dating or I think not saying pre rather Jimmy Manawa took him out pretty quick I think man was a super dangerous very things very stranger's first round for Jonah's comeback fight I think taking him down and beating him up on the ground beat John's best on honover settings they trip him throwing the ground in cementum also John's differed the name yells in his length and his abilities it doesn't get had really and his wrestling so fucking good he just sells not scared just not scared to go to the ground anybody but you look at light light heavyweight division is hurting the most out of anyone I think you could go down the rostra God dog we need some new blood in this bitch yeah you might be right the the main event in Brazil is Ryan Bader a vicious little dog and little nods like yeah I'll fuckin do it y'all do I've been fighting for 35 years you know when his little move like a goddamn tortoise but if you want to pay me I'll still do it he hasn't taken a same amount of punishment that his brother has but he's taking some big knockouts yeah hope so could you knock him out with a wrist oh my god he like clothesline dumb yeah yeah and then the rumble one was just horrendous just shoot I told you I was in the back to lock him warming up Pat Cummings I'm a fucker warmed up by basically doing like arm stretches couldn't hit mitt to you so stiff I was like who's he fighting like rumbles like ah you can't go out there I looked at his coaching like no no I can't speak Spanish but no bueno mmm or Portuguese sorry yeah there's no Kimmy I'm like he can't go out there man I wanted to grab his leg like a three-year-old not let him walk out this early octagon I think Brazil is such a huge hotbed for MMA right now it's so gigantic that they need Brazilian stars and you know for the main event in particular they like just don't have a whole lot of options in the light heavyweight division so its own fucking wake up a little knock out of his slumber because he's recuperating little lager Big Nog little nog cuz they're waking up out of slumber cuz little big nogs done right he's little nog they woke his ass up and he's like alpha beta I mean yeah I mean he's probably asking for another fight but outside of him what other good light heavyweights from Brazil that are in the UFC that you could like celimene of n are glowing there but they already fought right but Glover just got cracked too and he should probably take quite a while off after that knockout that was a kind of knockout that you need to like not do nothing yeah lay low yeah he got flatlined I mean so you got that light hit you got Shogun which I don't know what's going Shogun's got to be done if he's not done he's probably real close to being this one saying like hit light-heavyweight bro go through yeah in Brazilian though even more so as far as like Brazilian fighters as far as Fame Michiko Machida gathers she's suspended and suspended for a long fucking time doesn't he doesn't have a two-year I'm not sure it's not good I don't know if they've decided or not but I felt like he got suspended for two years I mean you just look at the Brazilian fighters especially you're right light heavyweight and Machida was going 85 anyway we can float between 205 I'm just thinking 25 guys he could line up with in Brazil not a lot not a whole lot I mean Bader already fought Leo toe you could sell that as a rematch because remember the odel knocked him out in LA yeah bad yeah but he's suspended you're right though all the especially there's not a lot of new blood in Brazil
