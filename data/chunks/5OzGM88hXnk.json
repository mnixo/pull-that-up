the Joe Rogan experience we're bananas it's crazy and then you know what it is though here's the the real victims of ending the drug war would be all those prisons that would no longer be full of young black men you say this but what if your business is run prisons right what if your business is prison guards I mean that's not someone someone think of the prison the prison industrial complex yeah prison guards lobby against drug legalization they do it because they want to stay in office they want to keep their jobs and how many lives has to be ruined in the process fucking crazy no it's a vampire system it's a horrible vampire system and it's a system that's brought out of its it's based on these reverberations or these vibrations from the past it's all like this scramble when a people retarded when they came over on boats and this is just how they did things they demand that Clank throw in a jail you know fucking scoundrel you were smoking marijuana or whatever the rule that you broke is that they realize that they can do it so they do do it and they throw you in some fucking cage in 2014 the fact that's still going on and that people are actually profiting from it this is these are more things that the internet has a huge fuckin problem with because the Internet is guys like you as young fellas that are very smart and unconventional and seeing the system and being like you know what I don't buy it I think there's a shit that people I knew growing up that were adults I knew there were fucking idiots and then getting made bad choices and now I'm looking at the the repercussions of this everywhere I'm looking at it I'm saying no dudes is dumb this is so this is one of the things especially talking to college students that I love bringing up which is that and I'm the first to admit it like I have no fucking clue what I'm doing 99% of the time especially when I got started I still don't know and I've come to realize like and I've got I've got lucky enough to meet some pretty like successful impressive people but like you think on the surface we're all just hacking it like we're all just for your expertise experience those things I'll help but like every one of us is a fallible human all the conventions and rules and status quo we know were created by other fallible humans yeah and there's no reason not to look at that and go huh does it have to be that way or why is it that way and if the reason why is little it's the way it is well that's a terrible reason you know and and when you see the world as being that hackable so to speak like you start to realize all right well let's just let's actually question stuff and and for you know I remember I was a freshman at UVA when 9/11 happened for this generation of Millennials coming up we we moat nearly all of us one of our first really vivid memories of the world was 9/11 this awful tragedy and then we get into these two wars and then think of all the authority figures we've had in our life since that moment they've all at one point uh they're either mislead us this sort of deceived us you've got the financial crisis you've got the housing bubble all these conventions Oh trust us we know we're doing this is the thing the American Dream is buying a home go to college take on that student loan debt don't worry there's a job waiting for you every single all these conventions from from all these people in power have not held up and so I think in particular Milanoo Millennials look at that very skeptically because we're like alright you know it so the conventional stuff didn't work out for anything like we have no choice but to realize you know what we're all just hacking it so let's let's really let's dive into the passion let's let's figure out a better way to do something not settle for it's the way to always been I think you're completely right and I think first of all I'm slightly annoyed by this new statement and I'm first to absorb Millennials I know it's a terrible phrase I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not buying we can rebrand this I think we should I really believe this is I think there's a divisive Nisour there's a separation that comes when you start labeling people by like what era they were born in fair enough it's a it's a state of mind more than anything else yeah I think so but I think it's horseshit fuck up it's just humans like this is this idea of putting things in a labeled generalization the human race is evolving watch father knows best and then watch Game of Thrones okay different now we don't have to come up with names for the generations and your generation why and there was fuckin Jamie from the Laugh Factory tried to tell my friend Todd Parker Todd Parker's a stand-up comic that I started out with Jamie was like buddy you have to be Generation X guy this is what you do you go on stage and everything my generation Generation X think that's going to be your hook and I remember him trying to explain it to change when I'm in the background going what he told Tony to do what he told you you must always wear cowboy hat just look like Woody from Toy Story is you needed a hat
