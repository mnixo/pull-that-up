how long is it gonna take me to get to LAX and what time should I be there if you leave at 2:00 you have no problems at all ok no problem if you leave it - you're just gonna coast in are we live we're trying to figure out LA traffic ladies and gentlemen you got a plan for that shit like you do man like a natural disaster in many ways very similar when I moved to Colorado for just a few months then came back here was instantaneous like the recognition of like what effect it has on me like there's so many people you're driving it's like yeah when you go somewhere with is very few people you have there's a real feeling of relaxation I guess legitimate it's real yes yeah it's almost like if you could buy that like yeah man I'm I'm taking this gum that puts you in like small town feel like woodsy Colorado feel going through evergreen look at it but you can't you can buy that you just have to get out of out of California you know for sure but I was just thinking if you had a pill a pill that did that that would be a really expensive pill or a patch or some gum you know like nicotine gum some some you know peace and quiet gum transports you to the wilderness how much food people pay for that right like think about the people that buy xanax and shit and just anything just take a little bit of the edge off take this edge off I don't know I would buy it and smoke it yeah it smoke the shit out right but then would you'd be happy like living in downtown LA and some graffiti kind of building horns go off I love the weather here I do I think that's why I have to come out for work or anything else I never mind because every day it's perfect except I've been here for like four days and it's raining most of the time so it's my luck but uh at least Raffy will eat just basically I think you just sort of accept that you're gonna live in your car right you gonna mean your car lock your door so everybody has a nice cars that's what everybody drives nice cars no way it's also cuz we're all really really shallow oh we want to show everybody like look what I got bitch you know there's a lot of that I like cars how you - it's okay I think about your song when I Drive my Bronco you got a you got a really nice prompt I unfortunately no longer have a Bronco you need a Bronco in your life man yeah but then I'd have a second car it took me five years just to buy my first car so yeah you're one of the minimalist type characters doesn't want to admit they're successful I understand no I probably mitinet I just thought you know I look like I've always I think it's from living out of a bag most of my adult life right and you start you know I got I had one guitar for the first two or three years I was on the road one day you wake up and you have five guitars now do you have a thing where you try to leave you don't really need all these guitars you only need that one maybe two guitars is good so I feel like guitar makers who must want to get you a guitar alright does that happen with musicians yeah actually I got one Martin made for me and that's that's kind of an honor obviously that's amazing yeah old really old historic legacy company um but then yeah you buddies build them and that kind of most I've always made my own out of porters at least Telecasters and stuff you can buy parts and assemble them just as good as anything coming out of like what like a Custom Shop might be for a fraction of the cost wow that I didn't know that was a baby even build an instrument that is you know more comfortable to play because you're building to the exact specifics that maybe somebody doesn't mass-manufactured well I guess if you know guitars as well as you know them and you've been around them your whole life that totally makes sense like what it's wood in parts right Telecasters basically this table bolted to a baseball bat cut in half you know what I mean it's hard to walk that up the rest of its just electronics and the pickups have a lot and anything outside that's just your fingers and who's actually holding the thing but like to build one it's not that complicated Wow Les Paul or a Martin acoustic guitar that's that's literally like a hand shaped piece of work that has to be made from start to finish whereas you know the guitars I'm talking about building you're just assembling there's like parts that are yeah widely accessible have a buddy that's a classical guitarist as an art yeah he's he always had his nails grow long what he'd do jujitsu Dmitri shout out to my friend Dmitri to chenko he had to tape over fingernails like when he did jujitsu cause he had claw claw bitches on motherfuckers I mean I've had he had ridiculous long nails and powerful nails too because he strummed with his nails like that's what he did like he did everything he did with its fingers he's amazing at it I mean just freaky amazing you'd watch a play and you'd be like holy shit yeah you know some play live a bunch times and he would do like people would hire them to do like parties and shit but it's like it's an art form that for whatever reason I don't think it's the kind of respect that it deserves no flamenco in classical guitar players that's that's a highly complex musicianship yeah and so he would always explain to me like you'd of guitars like how they were constructed and it's amazing to me that there is that's Dimitri that dude was the heavyweight on the Taekwondo team that I was on when I was like a lightweight I was like 155 pounds and he was fighting heavy weight that dude used to fuck people up he's got those crazy Ukrainian jeans he's just got his chicken picking that's like oh he's a bad motherfucker now I don't know shit about guitar I know it sounds awesome and I know that sounds awesome but to you as a person who plays guitar and that's country guitar that's like he's chicken what we call chicken picking what he's doing on that class guitar is pretty cool he might as well be on lower Broadway right now it's a bad motherfucker motherfucker for sure yeah and was a Massachusetts state Taekwondo heavyweight also doesn't make silly faces I like that he went on to compete after I stopped competing he competed a really high level nationally like fun so the 1 equals like guitar down he's still a bad mother he's a bad that's a legit bad motherfucker he's a big boy too like he's a natural to 20 like the big Ukrainian rock people they're just thicker people they're rock people they could pick rocks up and shit then on top of that unbelievable guitarists crazy how do you how do you know him we used to do Taekwondo together over kids kids okay we started out together I was like I think he's a year younger than me so I think I was like 15 or 16 we met and he was like what was he like either at a San Jose function discipline mare I don't know if it's discipline so much is it I think everybody that that plays music and that really gets into it that heavy there's like there's like it's a it's an OCD you have to have a level of spectrum or to sit and just do the same thing over and over repetitively 810 hours a day especially as a kid when you're really learning you like when it gets you and you hook into it it's like you just did this the other thing that nobody else can be a part of you know what I mean I get it as an outsider I get it it's like you can do something and once you start doing it and must feel amazing be doing it well yeah yeah I think well I mean I played soccer and stuff when I was a kid but it was always like I've never was one of those guys that the team thing yeah I was just like introverted and didn't and so when I found really found guitar and got into it as like oh this is something I can it's not a competition it's not you know other than what you what you're pushing yourself to learn I guess yeah you don't have to rely on other people's personalities or well that's what bands are for yeah that's what I always thought about bands like that's got to be the hardest part is everybody just being cool typically they're easy artists well yeah you especially I mean that's really all about the hang more than anything I'm uh I'm down I got me and three other guys in my band now cuz it's like everybody's a great hang dad's awesome everybody gets along and we're like actually friends and you go out every night we're just like you know yeah if you could pull that off and it makes a road better like when I go on the road I bring like Ian Edwards or Tony inch cliff or any my other friends that that can do it if it's all like weather that they're free that weekend that's usually how they're gonna be around these people for weeks man oh man we have the best time I don't do weeks I do stew a couple days at a time I never go on the road for more than a Thursday Friday Saturday more I just don't get in warrior yeah really and I only do it twice a week is that because of you the kids and yep be home yeah I like being home and also because Travel miss you old well it's just not good for you it's just not good for you it's so it's all those things it's I like being around my family I like being at home like being around my friends and also I just don't think it's a healthy thing I think travel on occasion is okay but I think once you start getting into like every weekend flying I've heard of people doing that and I'm like you're beating your body up yeah there's no there's no if ands or buts about it yeah well it's it's one of the the best things about certainly my job and your job do you get to go out and perform entertainment I've all since since things sort of took off for me I realized very early on I'm I get paid to travel yeah the shows were free like that's fun you know what I mean like that's we're out there doing what we love to do but it's all the in-between and the beat down your body takes and being out of any kind of routine away from your family that's that's the really the thing that you come off for like four or five weeks straight of that and you know I'm a pretty healthy 39 year old dude and it takes me four or five days just to get off the fucking couch yeah after a month-long run and my wife she finally started to understand like it's because you're the travel you know it's a different kind of exhaustion you can't really articulate anything there's a travel there's the sleeping because usually you got to get out if you're doing everyday - are you busting it or even flying we're on buses mostly unless it's like the logistics it's just crazy but you still got to be there so you might bust part of it and then one night you're flying everybody or a red light radar the next morning and do that thing and then get back to the bus or meet up with the bus what helps me is cardio like when I whenever I go to a place if I just I don't want to feel like shit like a fucking tired right but if I could just force myself to get to the gym and just do like 45 minutes on an elliptical machine just have 45 minutes out of the day just that that's what I'm doing period nothing else put that headphones on listen to a podcast listener and just get that your twenty five minutes of cardio and then I'm good then I'm straight then everything levels out but if I don't do that if I don't do that every couple of days at least I just feel worn out I think it's also an endorphin and my buddy Bobby that plays organ but he works out like a madman I mean like it's kind of insane you guys would get along I mean I think a lot of that is to balance out you know just energy because every night when you go out and do we got two hours of cardio right on stage and just massive adrenaline blast especially when it really locks in and there's all this energy just slamming you in the face and then you walk offstage and it takes like four or five hours to come down from that every night yeah and then so you know the next day now your shit has to be off balance naturally you know what I mean just like you just had this massive blast of all these chemicals that your brains pumping out endorphins and now the next day you're just like waking up trying to figure out where to take a shit and get a cup of coffee and is there a shower today yeah and it gets weird when you do a bunch of them in a row right like how often you wake up and stare at the ceiling not exactly remember in what town you're in um not well that never happens I will never happen is that like I'm always staying a week or two is the adventure the journey so to speak but uh I do wake up sometimes and just sort of well honestly it's bittersweet because the longer you're out the more you're playing and the better the music gets so you know by the last show there's always this really like man you know I'm exhausted I really want to go home but I can't believe this we got to take a break now because everything just got super greasy you know right it's different every night with you just the chemistry and everything and you lock in and you kind of get in that head yeah I could imagine that it's a comedy is very similar it's cut very similar look when you're doing like a long stretch I only did it once with Charlie Murphy and John Heffron we did this little tour together the only time I've done like 30 days where I did like 22 dates where I was just constantly out I was only home for a day or two and then let's back out again but you get grew you getting that groove you just get we just relaxed yeah I've been doing a lot you feel it you get on this non-existent Clark it's it's a it's a it's a routine of no routine is how I describe it every day is the same but completely different but I don't mind it man like a lot of times it feels like I'm just back in the Navy because we're still sleeping bunks on the bus yeah you know we go out to sea for like 90 days and shit that was that's probably way better for you psychologically when you go on stage then if you're stayin some giant suite when you're walking around the suite and that's on up I can't do the hotel room man I get it you know when he started out you meet all you start going on you play like festivals or shows with your heroes and they're on buses before you are you go on and you talk to these guys and you realize like they live in this thing they're institutionalize in the back of this bus and they never get off the bus you're like I don't get it and then it happens to you and you realize that that's like this little safe space like a hotel room overnight for me I'll go I'll go crazy waiting for a show you're like caged up in this little box you know with cable TV and nobody to talk to and I got soured on buses when they pulled over Willie and arrested him for weed on his bus I guess should have been demoted for sure got Willie on a pots are good for you Sherlock how dare you whoever you are there's things you just gotta let slide I was in Texas too right yep Texas doesn't play when it comes to weed unfortunately it's really silly if it did it would change Texas it'd make it better I could relax some of those fucking Cowboys settle down and why are you saying it shouldn't be legal stupid that's crazy the fact that that's still an argument in 2018 you know they said here's a funny one one of the most recent arguments that I've read was that more pedestrians walking out into traffic because of legal weed and dying so like there's been uptick everywhere I shouldn't laugh at that that's rude that could be me right it could be me why my life almost me this morning yeah I'm an asshole I'm sorry I apologized but I thought it was pretty funny this idea that there's an uptick and people just walking out into cars getting hit by cars because they're just spacing out because they're high I think it should be legal just because I'm from Kentucky and if they gave all those farmers and and you know X colon distri employees and into ooh that would really thrive since it grows extremely well in Kentucky you know instead of soybeans in tobacco those guys could actually generate an income what do you think's holding a black family community politics actually that's not true Mitch McConnell art there somebody some like really staunch right-wing guy in Kentucky came out and was even pushing for a legislation towards at least the hemp industry which would be incredible yeah the hemp industry is a no brainer the him conditions attacks indoors alone yeah well you know we buy hemp for on it and for the longest time we'd had to buy it in Canada because you couldn't get it in the United States cuz until recently it wasn't legal to grow and so to get like the best stuff that is the highest protein content we'd have to fucking ship it in from Canada you can't even grow it here now you can but when did we start on it it's not that long ago once it like seven years ago something like that so we does like one of the first things that we did is make a really good help hemp protein powder and when we were looking into it look I can't even believe that you can't grow this like doesn't do anything to your consciousness zero it doesn't affect you at all because it's related to pot it's illegal the National hemp museum is in Versailles Kentucky isn't really where I graduated high school do because its Woodford County Kentucky was at one point the largest him producing Counting the entire nation whoa I just I don't know something about the limestone this whole conditions the humidity sunlight shot and hemp rose really really well Wow the first legal 508 or acre hemp farm in Kentucky unveiled so now it's legal in October oh wow so now they can grow it excellent beautiful I don't live there anymore so I'm out of touch but hey that's great news that's fantastic news that's amazing well we're just talking about something that I was gonna bring up oh shit I can't remember something about something about new mr. Nelson something new stuff that had to do with with legalization marijuana in Kentucky yeah yeah it's just it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a hemp museum and have it be illegal for so long with no argument there's like there's no science it doesn't pollute anything it doesn't do anything the environment the nation makes amazingly built on it yeah everything was made of that shit do you ever see the first Henry Ford Model T where he made the fenders out of hemp he's hitting it with a hammer not no though dude you had to watch this we'll play this for you it's the craziest shit ever Henry Ford's very first car that he made he made the fenders out of hemp and you're watching him hit this fucking fender with a hammer and a hammer is just bouncing off the fender check this out and this is crazy I mean I don't know when was this what did it say Jamie was the time it said their 1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was illegal so it was made and it was made illegal right around the time where alcohol prohibition had ended and they needed something to go after so then they started using the same guys to go after weed and this was pre that look at this he's hitting this fucking thing with a the back of an axe it's just bouncing off it was also a great way to discriminate against Mexican immigrants it was and black people too the whole name marijuana came from a Mexican slang for a wild tobacco didn't have anything to do with marijuana they just created this thing like when they made it illegal the the people that were they didn't even understand they're making hemp illegal they had all that explain it to everybody and they were they that liked tax stamps that you had about DuPont understood that finish to the fuck out of it so that William Randolph Hearst that guy was the craziest the guy who Citizen Kane was based on that guy was the craziest so here is this guy's hitting this hemp fender with a fucking hammer Henry Rollins testing it Henry Rollins goddamn it look you barely smudged the thing I mean they're so superior to metal and it's easy it's a renewable resource like we're we've fucked this up so bad it's so obvious it's one of the biggest exam and people said why are you drone on about pot all the time it's because these things like that are one of the biggest examples of just how egregious making Italy Liz it is a it's one of the most amazing plants we've ever discovered you can make your house out of it you can fucking eat at you can get high with it you can make your clothes with it it has all the amino acids you could use for heating oil you could what treat cancer patients treat cancer patients with this here first I mean somebody put here come on come on come on right it helps reduce tumor size it's crazy helps a host of different diseases I know a lot of people that have like serious inflammation problems they smoke some weed and they're alright just lightens everything up and it's illegal and you can grow it you grow your own you could grow a shit ton of it in your backyard anybody could do you have a sprinkler okay you got some good dirt all right you got some weed good that weeds just good to go that's a fuckin hardy ass plant you have my grandmother she just had some some some health stuff and it's like you know how do I you know she's pretty old-school like well I'm knowing there's this thing out there that that isn't anything that these doctors are gonna offer it's just gonna make her feel awful yeah and and you know ever have to go through all of those someone just give you comfort and it reason Allah or make you want to eat food or those kind of things like why wouldn't you want someone you love and care about to have that but then at the same time you know you want to be the person trying to feed pot to your grandmother yeah it's a hard sell it's a hard sell yeah it's just stunning how well propaganda from 1933 carried all the way the fuck to 2018 it's stunning is it I mean but it's almost 100 years yeah with what we like the amount of information that you can get on a subject now like say if your bet the medical benefits of cannabis just Google that and you'll just start reading all the shit like if it seems to me that enough people would go wait what are we doing like why is it illegal nobody's died from it like no one more people die of aspirin every year because zero died from pot so it's really the number zero it doesn't mean that people are going to get high and walk at at traffic some some are gonna but I think part of that is because we're not to teaching people how to get high properly someone gets high for the first time you little ponder how many of those people that are getting hit by cars are actually looking at their phones could be a lot they were high and looking at their phones you don't see that here like you're doing in Nashville a drive around and that's like if I can't hate that and you look every time driving on a town everybody's texting everybody's looking down you can always spot on the interstate yep we've and home but you don't see that in California guys you guys have like really heavy loss saw today yeah today some lady had drifted completely in my lane and I looked over at her and I saw the the back of her head like I was I was on the driver side I was on that side looking over at her and all I saw was the back of it she literally wasn't looking at my car and she was just looking at her phone and working her thumb and occasionally like looking up at the screen or looking up at the windchill it's like whoa you crazy lady you think just cuz you're going 40 miles an hour that's okay cuz you're on a side street like you're not even looking where you're going you driving a car what if you hit a kid Jesus Christ fuck what if you slam into some old lady you know what if you rear-end a bike you're not even looking you didn't notice the bike was there boom you run over some guy's leg what in the fuck lady or dude maybe I was misgendering I don't know I don't know what her status is you gotta be real careful today Sturgill amazed it like that Nashville's every like super I don't know bro I don't leave the house I really don't have any idea I just I think that's a good move yeah you know I like my kids I mean I'm somewhat aware of everything going on it's surprising that none of that's really hit the music business mmm as hard as it is but there's just yeah I try to just do my thing yeah there's a weird weird world were living in today I would like I would like us to figure this out better I would like us to do just a little bit better job being nice to each other getting our shit together so weird weird time it's real where are you strangest times on in my lifetime which isn't that long but that I can recall it I'll never remember things ever being like whatever this is mmm you know yeah no no I mean that in any generalized middle-of-the-road just lets go always like crazy shit with superpowers talking about nuclear bombs all the time every day now and it's just like how did we get back there right you know yeah how do we get back to Putin telling us that he has a new nuclear missile that you know did you see that shit yeah 1500 meter tsunami wave of apocalyptic death that thing could bomb out is yeah why the fuck man and we don't have a defense system that can deal with it so he's basically saying I could kill you I have a gun pointed at your head I kill you anytime welcome to 2018 oh yeah Donald Trump's president I did that too by the way yeah yeah I don't know man it's terrifying yes it's definitely cause for concern all this what pots illegal pots illegal but it's legal to have a guy who was the host of The Apprentice run the nuclear armament hey or armory you'd say armory right I you know I got in some trouble a few months ago because I did this had nothing to do one night and I went down it was all the whole thing is just a protest kind of based on like answering questions and I was just like the promise I made this buddy of mine had a video taped it and he had a press pass they couldn't so let's turn the camera off and somebody asked me what do you think about Trump and I answered it but so what they didn't has what do you think of all politicians you know what I mean right so like I have to me like nothing ever really changes like right left this or that it's all just sort of a different version of the people you never really see we can't have an alpha chimp yeah it's a stupid position we shouldn't have it anymore we shouldn't had it a long time ago we should have figured out a long time ago you can't have one person run the whole show it's insane it doesn't work it's crazy for them to it's not good for anybody sorry we can't pretend anymore that one person is special above other people like royalty doesn't work anymore it doesn't work we're all just people it doesn't work and you can't get voted in to the number one person on the world that's fucking ridiculous apparently you can you can but you shouldn't be able to it's not it's it's too old it's too antiquated and there's way better options there's just way better options you can't have all of us like you kind of like some arbitrary date the president has a 19 episode of the voice is a voice now man that's yeah that's just how it works you know or American Idol or something like that yeah there's a big contest you mean given the trophy when you when you vote there's a buzzer the buzzers over you can't vote anymore right right the votes are in that's it and the drumroll please I mean it's showbiz it doesn't make any sense that you I mean I guess it does because then people could arbitrarily decide to remove a leader and put a leader back in and like you would just be able to vote and change your mind with the tide like constantly but that's one more reason why we shouldn't have one person it's stupid should have first of all we got a we got to overhaul the way we teach kids we got to have more informed people then once you have more informed people you let them in on what the fuck we should do we all decide as a group like the way they do it now right the way they do it now is just it's it's bullshit it's fake like you're pretending that you have a choice you do have a choice you have a choice between this guy or that guy neither one you like so pick it but both of them are embedded in all the special interest groups and all the lobby is supposed to be a republic it was always supposed to be about the people yeah it's been co-opted by money it's real simple big foreign companies I don't know well the amount of people that are allowed to spend millions and millions of dollars to prop up politicians it's like why would we let that happen both sides both both sides why would we let that happen that seems crazy that seems like any other job where you were in a position of influence over someone else's job you wouldn't be able to take money from that person to make sure that you did the right thing that would be called bribery right I don't know I mean it is like bribery they do it right they do do it but they didn't be like here's one that they get in real big trouble for here's one that I think is interesting they Trump recently did something about Steele about bringing steel back to United States and steel manufacturing back in the Unites States but before he did it one of his homies bought a shitload of stock it's steel like one of his like super rich dudes and so then the question is like hey should he have been allowed to do that isn't that insider trading right and you're like wait a minute you can't just no shit if I know shit what am I supposed to do I'm not supposed to buy stock like well then if you do know shit and you buy stock is that fair that doesn't seem fair what's the answer there the answer is the system sucks you got a wacky ass fucking crazy sisters and all your money's based on what people could just buy and say sell parts of companies yeah we're all the Chinese pretty much bought all the steel companies rights a while back they were smart enough to say oh you don't want that okay nobody's ever gonna go back though once you can make money off the stock market fucked out I'm making money off moving numbers around on my computer fuck you I'm staying do you play it no it's just terrifying terrifying no way no get the fuck outta here with that I've gained and lost before I was a victim of a pump and dump I cannot get nervous at the wheel of fortune' Dollar slots man in Vegas you know I mean much less shit okay they lure you in I'm down 19 I gotta get the fuck out here I was a victim of a pump and dump scheme umm this dude told me to buy this stock he's like dude I'm telling this talks about the blow up the guy was coke dealer so I knew he was honest trustworthy easy to listen to right I didn't know he's a coke dealer at the time I just thought he was a comic and so he would tell me about the stock and we bought into it I don't think I bought that much but it was like a few thousand dollars which is not that big of a deal if you're you know looking at the greater spectrum of how much money people lose right in the stock market that's a I lost nothing I mean people lose their all their whole life savings their fortune their their what they've inherited people can lose it like that in a stock market so we bought in me and my business manager and it went out for a little while it went up because more people were telling more people to buy and then it just crashed and when I mean it crashed it just went through the floor like it didn't exist anymore it was like it went from I forget what the number was but it was like in the many dollars down to like a fraction of a cent percent or three cent or something like that it went down to virtually worthless and we're like oh we got pump and dumped like that's what they do they pump they pump it up they get a bunch of people to join and then once beach bunch of people are buying this stock they're like abandon ship and I got fucked I remember sugar going on about years ago of all about the Bitcoin shit man yeah yeah hung up on the Bitcoin for a minute oh she loves it wish I'd listened he loves that shit he's uh he's a Bitcoin believer yeah I'm a Bitcoin hmm hmm this is me hmm I'm like I don't understand that and I probably never will so I'm gonna stay over here yeah it's good move I just every like a little pyramid scheme II does it I don't know I mean it's it's nervous it makes us nervous at this point in my life I just assume everything is a pyramid scheme it's always like a trickle of you know yeah if it could be proven to be as stable or more stable than money I think we just go for it that's what I think I think why fuck around why why use all these old crazy rich banker dudes money when you could just do nerd money just digital nerd money it all would take is people having to agree to it right that's all it would take if everybody just agreed to just use Bitcoin mm-hmm or if everybody agreed to an implant that had all your info on it and all your your money don't you do that story cool walk into your movie man you know that's coming yeah someone's gonna give you the benefits of it if you just put this in your dick well well they just have it inserted it yeah but we all have one you know yeah they haven't turned it on yet it's in your pocket not your wrist yeah well some people it's on the wrist too I was I was texting one night with the guys in the band this was what really scared the SH out of me like I got off social media while back completely again I tried Twitter again I told Jason Isabel give it a second shot but I realized my kids are way more interesting and like I'm trying you know I just rather be writing a song or doing something else right now but one night all we were all had a group checks going on and somebody said something made a joke there's a lot of 80s film buffs on our band and somebody made a John Claude Van Damme reference and do you live in five minutes later I'm not in any way exaggerating this all my wife and I are sitting and watching TV surfing Netflix and instantly is like my entire channel is full of jean-claude van damme selections and obviously what the fuck is going on I've never watched a shark life and Damned film ever on Netflix and now there's all this that's like somehow that got crossed marketed to my television set just cuz I'm on my telephone talking about this fucking guy freaked me out and I was like no more I'm dumping everything dude I've heard people tell me that they were having conversations on the phone with someone and then what they were talking about showed up in their Google ads on their on their laptop how's that work how does that work I have no idea are they listening constantly some TV says yes yeah Edward Snowden says yes but that but the fact that it shows up in your Google ads isn't that a little fucking obvious I mean that hasn't happened to me do you think that's real 100 percent 100 percent a me just look at Lee he looks like you should have a Guy Fawkes mask on right now slip on one of them fucking anarchists masks look at him he's smiling over there 100% they're listening to us god dammit Gmail's free for a reason you know what's a good read it definitely yeah they're reading everything Wow it all makes sense intense now I'm freaking out Jamie thanks thanks buddy is that okay you know who signed off on that how many people have ever read those terms of agreement I don't have you ever thing that's what I think yours when you buy the Alexa yes like yes okay you're buying yet those people are crazy having those things in your house that you talk to and it listens to everything fuck all that that just seems like to hackable it's all weird man it's getting and by the way this is just the first drops of water that's going through before our roof collapses because it's it's coming or you know all cars now automotive bills it's all you know electronic systems and GPS yeah I'm not a techie guy so that excuse me this is a really ignorant question but like what's the stop somebody from hacking into your car and crashing you into a fucking wall well that was always the case against Michael or the death of against the devil yeah well they don't know if the CIA or who you know but he wrote a story for Rolling Stone he was embedded in Iraq or Afghanistan I forget and he wrote a story about this general it was very unflattering and what happened was he got stuck there with them and he lived with these people for a long time and they let their guard down and you know they said a bunch it they would say around each other they made a movie about it do they I don't know did they I don't know I don't know about that maybe they might have but this general apparently got fired he was one of the best generals that you know it was like very highly ranked and very really respected by the troops and people were really really pissed this guy and he was starting to say that he was in danger that his life was in danger and I think even said something about if if if for whatever reason he commits suicide that he didn't do it mmm and he was driving his car and he drove straight into a tree over a hundred miles an hour I think it was on Sunset his car exploded engine flew from the car like crazy horrific shit and then afterwards they talked to these computer experts and they say well is it possible to take a modern automobile with all sorts there's all sorts of devices inside modern cars right that make them hit the brakes if you're getting too close to something or literally move out of a lane some of them have automatic pilot so you could just fucking press the destination and it just navigates there I mean that's all those and Pittsburgher goes there some weeks back Tesla's are crazy of the self driving uber is out there and they're getting better and better and better at that mm-hmm well that's I don't know I mean they where do you go next thing next thing they'll be trying to shoot humans through pneumatic tubes or something yeah but you think it's people who kill people literally for a profession I mean professional soldiers especially the ones that this guy mean embedded in combat I don't think it's outside the realm possibility that they would light that guy up for getting that general booted out right I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility at all they would think that guys the enemy and they said that he had an feta means in his system and for a while I was like oh yeah amphetamines maybe he's going crazy then I realized that almost all journalists are taking fucking adderall they're all taking amphetamines you'll find it amphetamines and meth like substances and all of them not all of them don't get mad if you're straight you're like dude all I drink is coffee don't be a dick but a lot of them I have many friends that are writers or journalists I can think of two journalists that are friends of mine that both take a lot out of oh I love that shit good buddy of mine who's a doctor was just telling me that when he was in college and he was going through all of examinations his friends started taking adderall and he recognized this giant jump in their performance he was like what the fuck he was they were smoking me in the grades and I realized all these guys are on peds I never I never did it I've never tried it want to try right now no I kind of like to be down here you know what I mean I don't know I've never understood that I guess it just never appealed to my disposition I don't think I would function if you wanted to build a log cabin right now right now it might be the way to go right well they said when Jack Kerouac rode on the road they were a lot of Benzedrine or like this yeah inhalant things east to bottom and he'll sat down and wrote the whole thing in like three days Jesus Christ maybe a day I can't remember the I don't you know I'm not a beat aficionado but I know that he was hopped out of his mind on speed and wrote the whole damn thing like in a scroll on a roof in Mexico while Ginsberg was probably downstairs molesting a little kid or some shit I don't that's a dark picture right there what used to be what do you got there Jamie how a generation of beat writers burnt out on speed Wow there was a big pool scene everybody was back then yeah that's what I was gonna say that's pool players that was the the thing with pool players back then is that they would take speed and Gamble people when people first found out about speed it must have been the most amazing thing ever before they realized like how it could wreck you I mean think about there's no speed and then all sudden ten 20 years later everyone's on speed mm-hmm they happen out of nowhere there wasn't a bunch of speed burnouts that everybody could like look back on and go oh look at that guy over there learn from him like especially like adderall like there's no there's no burnouts so everybody's had just been taking it for a few years he's been around 20 years as long as he'll anything at all has been around Jamie yeah probably after Ritalin probably right so yeah 15 15 max 20 years it was invented the same sounds gluten Kerouac took so much amphetamine and feta mean when he first discovered the inhaler high that he'd lost most of his hair and his legs swelled up with what does that were thrombophlebitis thrombophlebitis that's it seems like you went overboard say anyway he went deep you know do you know how that beardyman guy is he does a electronic music like was it what do they call those e/m artists would it call him helium he diem he's got a beard but he Greg Fitzsimmons and I were going over Hunter as Thompson's routine before he would write and he would just start off like early morning drunk the whole laundry list yeah leading up to start work at midnight yeah midnight hunter his Thompson is ready to write it like holy shit and butt him same thing right his body just gave out man his body was just falling apart by the time he's dying he just burnt that fucking thing to a crisp well they didn't know what we know now down you know they were those guys were riding the lightning and they never thought they're yeah but I think with Hunter it didn't matter whether or not he knew he would done this exact same thing anyway like he was of a mindset that he's like he's not here for a long time he's here for a good time right and that's what he did and this I mean that's why people love that guy it's one of the main not just because of his brilliant writing but because that motherfucker went for it and then when it was all over he said yes ain't funny anymore you take care put a gun to his head and that's a wrap told everybody was gonna do it too said hey want to get to a point where I don't like this anymore I got fake hips now I can't move you're always in pain that's a wrap take care boom the second you can't walk up or down a few flights of stairs by yourself that's kind of when it's over you know for a lot of people you know a lot of people managed to still find some reason to keep going and enjoy themselves and and you know and they're fine but it's like when you're a guy that's just still hitting it hard every day he never got he never sobered up there was no sobering up it was at what point though is that sad yeah when is it mean it was obvious it was a pretty inherent level of self-medication going on to to get through the day so you don't wake up and blow your brains out right you know yeah I maybe was just me I don't know um I think with a guy like him his his path was probably pretty clearly carved from the time he was very young he doesn't he what I mean the thing that's so interesting about him is that he was so genuinely thought full like you really did think about it so the greatest writers of our time no question I'm Anna and a Kentuckian so yes there you go it's gotta be all right yeah I read a lot of it but I read it way too early because you know when you're I was one of those kids got just at older cousins you get exposed to all that shit yeah and it was too soon you know probably high school when I read the campaign trail thing the Nixon book mmm yeah yeah that was a great one his uh his documentary you ever say that gonzo the line sometimes too fucking amazing yeah you want to just do something with your life after you watch that yeah not I don't know I don't have any friends that like wave 44 magnums around in their living room though good you're right 100% he definitely no let's go to that party don't get me wrong I go that part too but you want a shot I wouldn't move in no no no you go to the party JEP moved in for like what six weeks he moves in yeah all the way they went they sort of had to though what if he cooked Johnny Depp's brain I wonder if that's when giant Depp started going wacky holy shit it probably is I'm gonna spread a conspiracy theory JEP was reasonable and calm and polite and had his shit completely together until he did too much acid with hunter arrest Thompson and that's why he's wacky now what do you think it's not outside the realm pop he's really been tucky too so I'm not gonna say it's a full Kentucky house did you ever read the Kentucky Derby is decadent and depraved yeah absolutely and it's and it still holds true oh it's an amazing book an amazing article rather well that was where he sort of really found the style that piece in particular was were yes like I'm gonna go over here and do this yeah there was definitely that and then that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas think to where that started out he was being paid to cover a motorcycle race it became this just fucking crazy screed about drugs and partying and we're outside of Barstow and the drugs begin to take hold let's fucking bats in the air and shit they're driving a convertible Cadillac across the country headed to Vegas I mean it's a fucking amazing amazing piece of work and it started out as a Sports Illustrated story they wanted him to cover a race and also a very you know fitting and beautiful eulogy to the whole sixties flowerpower yeah that just caved on itself yeah there's that one line to Joe fucking quitters man well what do you think happened with them I think they took away their pot I think away the acid and they arrested a bunch of people and they'd want to clamp down and then you know you have a few college student massacres and and you know the the sensationalization of the Manson murders probably didn't help Brown sure became like a big narrative hippies LSD Martinson yeah it was all all tied in but you know the musically since you know I should stick to talking about things I know about which is music I think that that was probably just the best shit that ever happened and ever will happen like that 65 to 270 there was you know it just sort of exploded in all different directions and a lot of things happen that maybe they couldn't happen now or even two decades ago they couldn't have happened as a musician what do you think was the catalyst like what made them go from the 50 sound to the 60s just experimentation and and mind whatever you know looking for different ways of life right philosophically speaking maybe I think what they were all writing about but I mean and then some guys were just pushing the sonic limitations of the studio like Hendrix didn't really do that much drugs you know what I mean the guy was all about like I mean yeah he partied but he wasn't like a druggie you know he probably ate acid on stage a couple times and both of those I think he was spiked really yeah and he's just a serious blues head and they wanted to stretch out and really push what the limitations of the gear at that time in the studio you know well I don't only want to have eight channels what if we had 16 I love some experimentation and things that guys like him a Pink Floyd and later bands you know alo just really pushing the parameters of what you could do with the traditional style of music in terms of arrangement and how you frame that I always assumed that because he got arrested in Toronto with heroin that he did drugs I feel like if you have heroin on you you got drugs did you get bus if I thought it was barbiturates or it's a good question I'm pretty sure it was heroin I don't think you were like I could be wrong man it might be right you might be right what's this hideous as a small amount of heroin and hashish huh let's chasing the dragon yeah see so when I read that I'm like mmm how much do we know about what Jimi Hendrix did during his day like know so know how high I'm getting I know you how would they how would they know I mean if they see us get high on this show yeah you know how high I got today right but they don't even because I could get high before I go running I might get high when I'm sitting home - right I have people tell me they that I'm high when I'm not even high yeah but you probably are a little still he's a really sleepy like hound dog guys so I'll always look higher you mustn't but whatever it doesn't matter um Jimmy Jimmy liked he wasn't a some weird shit it's kind of I know he had this thing about video like filming women walking away from the hotel hmm they said they found this big collection of like home movies of him hanging out off hotel room balconies legs as he walked away walk as they walked away was some kind of weird interesting fetish what is that he was not guilty on the charges they don't know that they might have been planted on them Oh interesting they're not sure if they were interesting interesting it said he had no drug partner Familia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms no he smoked poverty yeah oh they might have fucking framed damn that dude that dude was too creative and and prolific just in the amount of time he was alive to have been a junkie you know what I mean like yeah you got a but no you gotta make a junkie get up and do shit that's true but they say that about pot heads too but I know a lot of pretty prolific pot heads I don't buy that I don't either smoking pot gets me off the couch yeah right it makes you a little paranoid totally yeah I get some shit well you know like maybe not working hard enough it makes me feel like that like I could be getting more shit done yeah they said linen actually you know when he was on heroin for a while but that motherfucker laid in bed with like 18 cats you know and it didn't do anything and then they said Paul would be like oh I got some songs we got to make a record and he was like god damn it wake up have to write five songs in a week oh really cuz he just really just lay around like like a sloth butt-naked until all the maids to pretend like he wasn't there when he walked through the kitchen but naked Wow that's milk you couldn't do that anymore they take your house yeah that maze be fired you couldn't even make it like an arrangement well you can't make it a range of the other way though there's like a topless maid service to come over your house and they take their top off see that just seems weird it's definitely weird I don't know I would be like yeah imagine the people that those poor ladies have to deal with on a daily fuck yeah that ain't a good time but you could have a topless maid service but you couldn't have a you come over and wash the house while I'm naked deal because if it's your house and you're naked and they're walking around you're out then you're forcing them to look at you naked mm-hmm right I would think that that's yeah people are losing on her career over there right now yeah you can't really not supposed to do that yeah but in the old days like a king who didn't give a fuck he would just stroll around and let all everyone look at his cock and walk right through the fucking building wouldn't leave his shit have your head cut off half if you didn't have sex with him not want to live in those times I've been watching a lot of Vikings I haven't seen it man I feel like four people tell me to watch that shit I don't have time I didn't believe them I didn't believe them I'm like there's no way it's on regular TV is it that good it's fucking good really it's a good show yeah you have to get through the first couple episodes first couple episodes you're a little like when yeah what my ferns all about they have to set things up that's the problem with shows you're not you a little skeptical until you get to know everybody and then you get the feeling of the characters and you get sucked in that's why I been watching it so awesome it is watching is great for if you're especially if you're a touring musician all those all right you know I can never get into shows when they come out because I'll see a couple episodes and then we go on tour for two months and you're like what the fuck happened but now I can come home and just you know watch a season of something in a day while I'm recuperating yeah my wife's pretty she knows what like the good shows the programs and shit like I wouldn't I wouldn't know what to watch but I found a lot of things have you seen stranger things I saw the first season or no I did see yeah we saw those what about Ozark I saw that far like I liked Bateman that's how good I like that sardonic shit there's a new one coming out with Jared Leto but the occurs at a movie it's a movie it's a movie on Netflix yeah he joins the jacuzzi most handsomest white-looking Yakuza guy ever perfect features right cuz that happens all the time it's happening in this movie bro how about to spend a little disbelief for Jared I was walkin around Shinjuku looking for white dudes it's a fucking run shop you know do you think he's learned how to speak Japanese I hope so it's gonna be pretty weird if he doesn't it's beautiful he's prettier than most women oh he's prettier than a lot of women man if you put him in like a long haired wig type situation it's beautiful he goes he's supposed to be half Japanese I think he misses the show I better not be cuz he's got his hair do that anymore that shit his cultural appropriation you're not allowed to anymore but how else is the white dude gonna get in Yakuza he's gotta be he's got to be like a catch there I think here's a soldier that was friends with a guy I know stayed over there to help them gods like if you have a movie today and you have a Chinese character in the movie but you have a Japanese guy play the Chinese character you're fucked mm-hmm right people will get angry you can't do it anymore no more pretending you're someone else like can you like if you lose you're Robert Downey jr. yeah he could get away with it but not anymore he got away with it in that one movie but like if you were an Asian guy though I firmly believe no one would have a problem if they took an Asian guy and gave him some sort of facial prosthetics that turned him into a European looking guy and then gave him lead roles in a movie where he plays a European guy people would have to shut the fuck up they would be they would want to say something within ago it's amazing how far we watch our movies on the bus sometimes and I walk if I'm at home and my and I'm by myself like I watched weird shit I like old films and a lot of old westerns and stuff you know I watched the same movies I've I've seen a hundred times over and over as opposed to watching a lot of the newer shit we do watch a lot of these old westerns from the 50s and it's like it's all white dudes painted up like Native American Indians yeah with the headdress and it just looks so cheesy and they have these these have affected a horrible accents and usually how the fuck did that ever happen but then you get to the 80s and you watch something like 48 hours now and it's the most sexist racist misogynistic shit like and they were just pumping those things out of studios yeah two three decades ago you know we're there any female characters in those films like you're either hooker one or secretary at precinct who everybody dismisses you know what I mean like those were the only roles yeah that just happened that's when we're kids yeah when we were kids yeah we were on that movie I just call off specific we watched it on the bus one night we were all like this would never fucking get made no way so much we'd never get made it's weird I mean is that is that cultural evolution so I thought my hope so there's a little bit of it but it's happening it's a it's all not just like catchphrases and shit I hope it's actually doing something I have weird ideas about this I I really feel like if we weren't completely embedded in it that we would look at this is like a system that's pulling us into its web and and forcing us to be more and more entangled and this system is the the system of electronics it's like almost like it's it's preparing for us to give birth to artificial life and so in the meantime it's completely sucking us in and making us be completely embedded phones in your pocket constant Alexa listening to everything you do it's all just as deep as it can in the biological systems were world until it gives birth that we're gonna force it out of exist force it into existence just by being completely fascinated with electronics where are we yeah is it the universe forcing it into exist to I think it's a natural thing I've always described that is like it's figured out a way to interconnect itself yeah yeah it has ADA yeah and force progress like think about what they were saying about Putin like if Putin really does have it sooner or later so fucking Skynet man you know it sure is yeah there you go but if someone has that kind of power right if it really is something that a person can think up that didn't exist 200 years ago 200 years ago there wasn't even the thought of it so in 200 years to small amounts of measurement of time and relationships of the entire age of the universe they could figure out a way to kill every person on the planet like that literally wreck the planet where no life would be it wouldn't be possible to have life there's enough nuclear bombs to do that what is it going to be like in 200 years from now it's gonna be way way way way way more accelerated it's almost gonna get to the point where the universe is going to be a like a place where you could visit like people can go places if it's not people things can go places as long as I'm holding a lightsaber before I die you'll get one of those it's all fucking worth it but the problem the lightsaber is I was always like well why is it end there why doesn't just go on for infinity like a lease oh yeah right was it only three and a half feet long yeah was it doing unless it was a rod and that the laser went around the raw but it knew to stop at the top that would make sense but the fact that laser only extends three feet or whatever it does yeah George Lucas was a big curse our fan was he yeah all that shit's based on samurai films that's right and Leone films and all those guys just like it's like generations of dudes paying homage and ripping each other off the lead to the new thing it's the same as music Wow well Quentin Tarantino has always been pretty open about that right he makes unapologetic like cinematic homages right down to framing shots and scores like he's a yeah does it masterfully though like it isn't it what are you doing when you're remaking King Kong making money yeah you making money you're making a lot of money but if you do it right you're making art I don't think anybody's done King Kong what is Donkey Kong you might not be able to do King Khan right maybe it's a bad example but the Hulk the CGI shit just cut from me man it really took the magic out of everything that with HD cuz you watch Harry and the Hendersons with your kids now or something then that looks better then a lot of the stuff coming out it's just I don't know there's a suspension of disbelief isn't there HDTV just fucking ruin movies for me I'm like give me some VHS you know it's better blur the lines a little bit yeah yeah like digital music same thing here all that separation and air and sterilization I guess is the best way to yeah I think it definitely works that way for physical things like it's one of the reasons why the original alien movie was so terrifying it was a physical thing that was a you knew or the first Halloween yeah there's no blood in that film it's just tension and read and rely on real people yeah that's some crazy fuck yeah William Shatner masks even American Werewolf in London don't you sell quick scenes also from Kentucky was he really yep damn Kentucky's and Muhammad are we yeah we don't for Louisville yeah my RAM Lincoln Daniel Boone damn uh Hairston Harry Dean Stanton what imagine of Daniel Boone days imagine being brother I don't have to imagine where I live now is like Daniel Boone days I walk out it's like yeah there's uh they found this some there's some caves down we moved to the Smokies or they just give land away down there really and uh yeah like fucking my own woods now for less than what a town house in Nashville would cost and uh but they the people bought it from they found a cave on the back back of the property down like um we kind of back up to the National Forest and there's a bunch of like three thousand-year-old Indian cave paintings in there like Native America pencils a University of Chicago came down and studied at all so now I'm gonna spend the rest of my life trying to figure out how to keep my fucking kids from going in there and doing something you know right and dick was yeah we're drawing a big cock and balls Indians but here's the thing that cotton ball would be revered by people who finally steal thousand years from now right why do we say yeah I mean if you went to a cave 2,000 years from now they uncovered some cave and was a bunch of anus life comes raw and choking off yeah people be excited they better like 3,000 years later how it happened yeah well if you look at like some of the ancient artwork right like how about some of the Roman statues or dudes grabbing each other's dicks and wrestling yeah yeah yeah they were wrestling and in the process of wrestling one dudes grabbing the other guy's junk which they did do they crush your balls and shit that was a move back then and so well let's be honest like in a real fight yeah that's a move it's a way to go it's definitely crush a man's taters or take away his ability to breathe the fights pretty much over there was actually a MMA fight where they took place back when there was no rules there's a guy named the Pedro and he was fighting a guy named Big Daddy Goodrich and Big Daddy reached into his pants and grabbed the hose cock and balls and crushed it in his hand see this guy look it's just grabbing dicks man the guy in the bottom is grabbing dick he's holding that guy's hog it's rude but that's how they wrestled back then they didn't give a fuck the the dick was something you could also hold on to you can hold on to the foot why not why can't you hold on to the dick so they were yanking on decks and pulling people along well they really turned it up back then do they they had to how long were they living you know I mean you if you were one of these bad motherfucker wrestler dudes how much time did you have to be that guy go grab that dick rolled around in the dirt and then I'm gonna eat some grape that guys didn't watch a lion eat my friend later on today that's a day look at the apple on the end of that guy's dick she's right hog if that was real he's hard this is sex then is it this is not fight for the death that guy's getting off on that or if he doesn't if if he's not getting hard and that's just how big his dick is went soft this is not at all where I thought we would I didn't but it has to be said last time wasn't we talk about Bigfoot yeah no new opinions on that oh I got a Bigfoot story huh really no I think already told it I made it I think did I well I was going out when I lease to live out west a long time ago I'm a buddy mile driving up to this little town called Leavenworth Washington to go check out was like this weird little Aspen Swedish ski town in fucking northern Washington we go get you potato soup that's another story though and we stopped at one of these roadside coffee stands which are every 300 feet in Washington State but this one was on like this sort of timber road going up through the forest and you pull over speaking of hairy and Hendersons wow it's all serendipitous but uh we get out of the car and the wooden statue from the from the beginning of that movie is like in the driveway and well it was this old sasquatch statute that's where I remembered it for most like that looks just like this thing from where yeah yep and no that's not that's badass though steer a lot of Bigfoot sightings out there well funny you should mention that we were stopping and we're getting coffee er from this lady and I'm like you know whatever trying to talk about the statue from the movie she's like yeah they stopped the film here and then she pulls out these she had these old photo books like family photo albums like huge photo albums two or three of them at least full of Polaroids of Sasquatch that her family had taken in this house supposedly its greatest idea to sell coffee ever Polaroid's like photographs like fucking old of a real sound photos of scat say how bad look that's what she really wanted us to think right yeah there's just so many of them I remember thinking like god she really went to some trouble here me there's like giant photo albums of Sasquatch and they were all sasquatch photos they'd taken off their back porch or out the windows of the house and they lived like right off the the road it was just fuckin wilderness you know that's my Sasquatch story was there any other one that made you go hmmm not a damn one I don't believe in Bigfoot so it definitely used to be a real thing I think that's what I think you think at one time it definitely exists it exists there's an animal called the Gigantopithecus right you know about that one right that was a real thing so that was basically a Bigfoot there's an 8 foot tall gigantic bipedal ape so they know that that was real so if that was real it's entirely possible that one of them made it across the bering land mass with human beings entirely possible because they were from asia and they were from asia a right around yeti yeah Yeti yeah Yeti neanderthal I mean Sasquatch there's like a bunch of different names for them but it was a real animal that lived I think they found bones that were as recent as a hundred thousand years so anatomically modern humans definitely lived in the presence so what do you attribute all the sightings to in the last bull yes her players hurt bears right bears hurt their paw they Wacka Wacka hind feet they do it all the time I think most of its bullshit the reason I say that is because there's no real compelling evidence other than like a couple of footprints that you think someone could have actually had you didn't you got a show for a while you wanted to talk to all these crazy oh yeah yeah yeah were you ever at any time like this guy might have saw something one lady had things saw something I don't think she was lying but I think she probably saw wounded bear and she saw it very briefly and the problem the real problem with people's memory especially in some situations that freaks you out like you think you might have saw Sasquatch your brain starts fucking with you and it starts filling in the blanks with a bunch of shit and then you start repeating that shit as if it's manageable yeah but I would imagine if you're if you you've I'm sure you've been you you lived in Seattle for a while right for a little while so you know what it's like when you go up into those mountains it's like so thick it's beautiful I mean well if I was gonna go fuck off and get lost somewhere that would be dude that Spencer's from that's some real wilderness of Mount Rainier right yeah god it's gorgeous um but the wilderness is so dense I was described as trying to look through a box of q-tips it's like a petri dish yeah they just it's in the ground is so soft and smushy from all the pine needles so my point is this lady saw something in the distance she saw elk running right and then she saw something standing up and she looked at its face and she realized it was an ape she's like oh my god I see an ape well how is there an ape and then she she said to herself oh it's Bigfoot that's Bigfoot and then it went over through this patch of timber cuz everything's super super dense you know ten twenty yards further and you can't see it anymore and she lost it completely but it makes sense that a bear was chasing elk that's what they do they do it all the time they're probably chasing elf there's probably a fawn that's probably trying to get it and there might have been heard that shit yeah and the bear might have been hurt in which case which happens all the time and when bears are hurt they walk on two legs so if you're looking at this thing bears can grow 9 feet long right that's real black bears can be 9 feet long a really big black bear so if you're looking at this thing in the Pacific it's probably rare but they could be seven feet all day you can find a bunch of seven-foot black bears those are those are legitimate so this black bears walking around seven feet tall standing up on its hind legs and you're seeing it through the trees 30 yards away you look oh my god I see Bigfoot so in her head I don't think she was lying I think she definitely believed she saw elk running and Suge she saw a big-ass animal in pursuit but it easily could have been a bear and she could have filled in the blanks in her mind with all these false memories right that her a tribulus or its face it looked at me and made a noise and all that stuff like people get wacky but you think you saw something and you didn't there's no bodies that's the problem there's nothing like no one's found shit no one's found anything well not a single fucking bone I mean they found this Gigantopithecus bone and an apothecary shop in China then they did a dig they went back to the spot these anthropologist said where the fuck did you get this there this giant primate tooth there wasn't a gorilla it wasn't a human being that like where'd you get this and they take them to the spot where they got it and they find bones they find jaw bones that indicate that it was bipedal kind of controversial apparently but apparently by the way that jaws designed they knew that this thing stood upright that's huge I don't know I met some dudes from Stornoway Scotland once which they look like they were from another planet they're like the biggest fucking people I've ever seen in my life there was four or five these guys at this little music festival in Kilkenny Ireland and they'd all come down for the festival and these are men I'm not shitting man they were the biggest people I've ever seen and they were all of them they were just like fucking mountain mountainous blocked on the light when they walked through the door and he's like long gray hair and beards and shit like this come up and play in Stornoway fuck it takes it only it takes eight fucking ferries to get there you know I would actually love to go up I think of those dudes whenever I think of those Atlas stones do you know what atlas stones are like the most manly way to work out ever basically picking up these enormous balls of stone and these dudes lift them and they get them on the chest they hoist them onto these blocks they have contest to see who can like when they do the strongman contest they picked those out with stones up and put it on progressively higher and higher shelves giant giant people stone yeah balls giant stone balls those people I mean those are the ancestors of the Vikings for sure right I'll never serve that's where the Vikings turned around I think yeah they shot loads into everybody it got wintertime and then they bailed let's fuck this place it's always raining let's get out of here they took off to depressing I got I got some really good buddies now in Glasgow all musicians you meet over the years tour and a couple guys particularly that if I go over sometimes I'll do a little pickup being with my with these guys and they're both like hard glass regions and my friend Lloyd won't tell last Mo's over there he took me up on a properly car trip up to the Highlands and back down and one day I think we got as far as like Oban or anyway but yeah there's parts of that stuff it's it just it looks like you're on another planet man I even described a look at got out of the car in a couple of places and you try to wrap your head around how ancient that shit is and everything that took place there and and and how you know how one we're just standing outside a car on the side of the road and I'm like I'm fucking freezing to death you know in the middle of August it's just a raining literally upside down and it's not even raining you're just like this it's some harsh brutal shit always cold always cold always wet even when it's not somehow I don't understand it it would be like sunny and a mile and a half later there's like a blizzard and was just like fucking a mental man but it looked like another planet I was alive I felt like it's could've gonna see us setting out of Star Wars or something have you think about it when you think about Scottish people you always think of Hardy right oh you're hearty tough people let's go to you instantly comes tomorrow well you know that another weird thing about it is you always appear Americans especially like where you're from your ancestry and this and that and I was groping in Eastern Kentucky in the mood to Central Kentucky but like most of the the early settlers in the Appalachian region was like predominantly scotch-irish and some German so the first time I went to Scotland to play music I had jet lag in the first morning I woke up like really early you know and it's like fuck Lyme I was gonna walk around and check things out and get out of the city and everything's kind of coming to life and people are going to work and I'm looking around at the faces man and it realizes like yep this I might as well be in hazard Kentucky right now it's the same stoic very guarded you know disposition but then like once you get to know them and especially much become friends or just like they would do anything for you it's very regal stoic working-class City there's something really special magical by Belasco they just kind of hit me like this is definitely where my fucking people came from you know like that might as well be my Uncle Bobby right there damn the people that lived there today man like they get to go buy castles and shit there's castles near there you drive by every day and hold those castles like what's the oldest Castle in Scotland I'm not sure the oldest one I mean there's like it was an old one thousand years old I think the one in Edinboro is probably twelve hundred years old Wow got been a penicillin imagine imagine yeah twelve fourteen sixteen hundred years we played a was somewhere in Ireland this little town and across the street in the hotel was this guard tower that had been there for thirteen hundred fucking years and there was like Viking boats they had on display around I'm just thinking yeah somebody a thousand years goes up in that window with a bow and arrow like you know that's all they had that's all they had shooting arrows down invading people and it gives you perspective though when you especially Europe in terms of old world isn't that old when you think about China a lot of Southeast Asian cultures you know you talk about 10,000 yeah Europe is a good example for me every time I go he gives me perspective because you think about everything happening in our country and everybody's like oh it's it's fucking going to hell and you know we're such a baby yeah you know there's there's churches over there that are five times older than the United States and it's still working somehow yeah the oldest shit was like when I was living in Boston there was a cemetery that you can go to we could see tombstones from like the 1700s and you barely read it you can know they're all weather didn't know now because that shit with yeah in the 1700s and you could just go over and touch it it's right there but people had you too much because it's got the numbers were all fucking worn off and shit look at that one right there which this one is from that's like cathedral built in 1471 oldest building in Glasgow I think 1471 the coolest gig I ever played was in London at it's called st. Pancras it's this old church building which I think you know monks at one time it was they built it acoustically and designed it out of stone for choirs like chamber bars and they didn't even have a PA was just mean that acoustic guitar remember sitting there thinking like it was the the most insanely beautiful natural reverb I'd ever heard my life and it's a really it's in it's like right around Kings Cross you know kind of a busy intersection but I think is that it right there st. Pancras no that's the train station ah the old look at st. Pancras old church it was really special to I remember walking every soundcheck and I was like I don't give a fuck if anybody comes tonight I just get to sit there and play my guitar and it's rude yeah this is it right here that's it yeah it's like a little pude building and so in so the way they'd built the whole place it reverberates all that rounded edges and everything actually that's the side hole and then there was a that's that's either one third from the right the darker one yeah that's whoa wow that's beautiful man that was really special so if somebody wanted to look at this Jamie what is the the image if someone's listening to this st. Pancras PA and c-raf Pancras PA ins yuria how beautiful is that construction it's the oldest standing house of worship my I don't want to hope I'm not misquoting this but I think it's like the oldest church in the United Kingdom and it's an innocent eroded Wow so they designed it so that people could play acoustic it was built to sing in does the thing the old keyboard effects just have built-in just that like bloom on everything when I was a kid I lived down the street from this place called echo bridge and echo bridge is this so it's a near-instant newton Upper Falls and it's this place where we'd all go hang out and drink but if you get underneath the bridge it gave you this crazy echo just like ridiculous and that's shit geeks like me walk around constantly listening for yeah every kid in my high school thought he was Billy Squier when you go down there you be screaming it like a fucking dork remember we knew how to do the van Halen thing on a notebook the VA first concert yeah man that freaked me out van Halen they were amazing I had a buddy I used to work in grocery store in Nashville when I was out kicking it around and this guy was he's really cool he's older he's in his 50s and he was a local grew up in Nashville and like a big music guy you know and so he saw like every show that ever came through town in the 70s and 80s we kind of grew up in that and he was he'd always like tell me about the shows you know the memories he saw a van Halen at the little Coliseum in Nashville like down on the north side of town back in they think he said 77 so it was before the first album come out and they were opening for Black Sabbath and you know but this time deep purple and all these like riff rock bands were just sort of the thing Wow he said these guys come out and he said it was like a bomb exploded in that fucking place man you look at he's like doing backflips off his aunt where all that crazy shit nobody ever heard that stuff you know Wow he said then Sabbath came out and everybody basically walked out after the third song because like they realized they had just seen what was next man I saw a kiss when I was like 10 10 or 11 years old I saw him live were you into immerses just totally and yeah yeah I was really into him and my uncle worked for their advertising company that designed their ever the album covers Howard Marks advertising company they're the ones that did he's a genius Howard marketing well it was my uncle Vinny and his friend Dennis were the artists they would make the album covers that's crazy yeah so I get to meet AIT's freely without his makeup I was like 11 Ace Frehley is actually the first guy who ever did the harmonic tapping on tape really that Eddy later got all the clay he took it ran with it but I think the first time that was ever recorded was on a kiss song somebody using that technique he was fucking phenomenal man when he really a really nice guy too right ace I don't know I never met him I know that he didn't get along with some of the other guys gene Simmons and because they're all pricks I think the a something's supposed to be like the sweet maybe maybe a Paul Stanley was nice he was a nice guy gene Simmons has been nice to me right you know obviously everybody knows it's part of their thing man I get it yeah I mean they were just they were rock star they've been rock stars for so long we think about that they were rock stars in the 70s they were rock stars when when it meant something yeah it's a difference I'm not sure what if it even is necessary do we really need like whatever that is rock stars yeah here's the problem we know too much about them all the mystery is gone you know it used to be like Robert Plant would come down and fucking magic carpet we didn't know where he's coming from you know at the time thought he was on one yeah just talk about Robert Plant in his prime right who the fuck ever saw anything like that before they were taking Elvis off the Ed Sullivan Show because he was shaking his hips Robert Plant has got a piece on him and it's pressed up against his pants his pants are tight as a glove he's got no shirt his like his shirt is completely open right he's completely bare chested long hair and a voice that you never heard before he never heard someone sing like whole lot of love I mean it's just he's doing something different he's got some new thing going on and you don't know shit about him there's no fucking podcast that he does he doesn't have a Twitter page where he says stupid shit about Trump let's see they they actually did they never did any interviews for a kid and he rated and released singles yeah I actually pull out people didn't know you hear all these classic songs on the radio now but they'd never put single they refused to do singles they didn't do press dude you wanted to see Led Zeppelin you had to go to the show yeah look at his cock look look at it look at his car he wants you up against his pants of course he does I don't know if you had a sock there but I want to believe well I want to believe that he was just out there slinging dick I do was like 17 when that first record you know imagine he wasn't even the first choice they went through a few people Jimmy Page knew when he put the band together one of my favorite singers of all time I love Robert Plant would always felt like if Stephen mariette always wanted to hear what that would sound like his heat into the guy from humble pie fucking incredible voice what's he supposed to be I'm not I want to say maybe page one on him but he couldn't do it I know they talked to maybe Rod Stewart well as those it faces at the time or earlier they were there a what I know Robert Plant wasn't choice number one soon they had to talk Bonham into taking the gig page and John Paul Jones had known each other through session work in the mid-60s and and when the yardbirds broke up Jimmy somehow thought he had rights the name and he wanted to put together like a super ban of all his the favorite his favorite musicians he played with and Bonham was recommended by the bass player John Paul Jones but they had to go and like talk him into it because he was playing when bands at the time I paid him a lot more money Wow I'm Jimmy's I got to explain what they were trying to accomplish and sell him on the idea that was that was sort of a like ever talk like vans that are put together by labels it wasn't Jimmy Page was a genius and a very you know visionary kind of guy so he knew he needed to build this band to take over the world that's what he did Wow a great producer too - fucking phenomenal guitarist right probably one of the most inventive guitar players ever a lot of people say sometimes specially later when he's on morphine some sometimes it can be a little sloppy but I like that I like I hate perfect mmm oh ain't nothing more boring than perfect so is that is the sound of a guitar similar to like a voice like sometimes to do to have a raspy crazy fucked up voice and it just makes it right I mean yeah any real artists player with an instrument it doesn't matter what the guitar is with amp or anything like anybody that has their thing they can pick up anything and within like three notes you just know it's that person you know what do you think of that how do you say his name ray lamontagne is that how you say it yeah he's like a songwriter yeah do you know that song Joleen I do that song yeah he's got a really cool voice but ham my buddy Dan did a record with him and I've never met him but now he's a really cool dude dude his voice I think he's kind of like he was sort of if I'm not mistaken one really what worldly came into it later like I did you had like jobs and shit before and then just started doing it and that makes sense found success later on I think that makes sense with a lot of people no I just think people like Justin Bieber like he's kind of a harder Road it's a way harder road to try to figure out like All Things Considered he's probably handling it okay he's handling it he's a nominal fee you think about he was what fucking eight twenty four years only four holy shit he just told us already having just turned twenty four and he's rolling around on a g7 that's his day-to-day you know he does whatever the fuck he wants all the time yeah you know you don't pay attention to things I'm not like I'm not glued into pop culture but somehow like you just can't not know what Justin Bieber's up to once a month just walking around in the world any more of it I would say that kid for most people to be handed that type of existence and all of that scrutiny and all the shit that comes along with that like that does things to people you know it definitely does especially if your personalities not even formed yet yeah I came to Matt like I'm so grateful I got into this business at 35 yeah and not 21 cuz I was talking to my friend John this weekend about this and I was saying that it's almost like if he made an epoxy right you know if you have epoxy just put a couple ingredients in like there's one thing and you mix it with another thing then it hardens but if you had some shit in that that's not supposed to be there and it's fully developed right you're not gonna take that shit out like if you added oil you just threw some oil in the epoxy like I know you fucked that whole thing up that's kind of what you're doing to a person when you raise a person famous if you take some reality star from the time they're 5 and then they're gonna sitcom in a movie and then you've gone through your whole oh no I said reality star but you've gone through your whole life if you're that person if you're Justin Bieber you've gone through your whole life under that under the eye and it's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more people paying attention but you never had a moment like you did where you're working for the railroad tracks right or like you know I did going on the road for years or some of the jobs that I had for it was ever a comedian they don't have any of those they don't don't have the wondering if you could pay your bill feeling they don't know that feeling they don't have the let's see I still feel like that mm-hmm you know that's what's fucked up my wife I'm just like I'm still like I just I'll never not feel like that you know yeah from never it really had money or anything like that or any aspirations to own a house or those kind of things so it's just I'm you know especially with kids now like I just don't it's there's no flamboyance yeah but now he he lives a different life for people like Rihanna these they're like literally citizens of the world and any day of the week they could be in some five-star hotel and God knows where you know yeah god knows where no it's a crazy way to live very bizarre jet-setting Flatman I couldn't do it man because it there's no way I don't know I don't ever want to wake up and have that kind of career because it takes so many people around you there you're on a daily basis just to maintain and keep see it's something a machine that large rolling logistically speaking that you become enslaved to the job you know to me because you have all these there's like there's always this name like when you have super star X you know you put this head right here and then everything below that just to make that thing go around you know then it just turns into this it's like a corporation really like with 20 semi trucks and all this shit you know and you got to go out and make that happen because now all these people depend on you for their livelihoods and careers and so then that's gonna affect the artistic decisions you make because you have to stay relevant culturally speaking and if you want to do something different next time well now this massive fan base isn't really gonna fuck and deal with that very well you know like when Beastie Boys put out Paul's Boutique exactly people on what the fuck they're what the fuck but now it's it's you know that's when the class most greatest records ever made but people back then didn't know what to handle they didn't know what to do with that they didn't they have the the Beastie Boys classified in the artists box right they had them in the pop music box so this is silly you gotta fight for your right to party we get it you know you guys are partiers cool and then also you know Paul's Boutique is like whoa what is this mm-hmm I think David Bowie went from Ziggy Stardust to doing a solo album in like nine months with Luther Vandross and yeah those are huge classic amazing records now but like you realize those guys were playing theaters when all that shit happened whoa and he's just like I'm done with this I'm gonna go do this now you literally can't see anymore because I fucking killed it on stage yeah that's over you know do you think Rod Stewart gets enough credit I don't I don't either I think especially man faces and even those really sore little records those are some amazing albums his voice is incredible you know what happened to him what the hits got too much pussy do you think about that brain once he hit that everybody's like check please he's like no that's all I got to do because remember go back to Maggie Mae you know wake up like that song was that was there was something in that song right there was a guy trying to figure his life out hanging out with some chick yeah Rod Stewart's a bad fit oh man what is that song is he called Maggie Mae yeah Elton John all those guys like that's yeah he was Abby's a different level but they started wearing like leopard tight pants shit because he could I mean look at that shit it ain't like it's not working he actually was I think he almost played professional soccer for Celtic or somebody wow he's like a really great soccer player when he was a kid but he was too small so he had just and he's another one right that like basically that you're never gonna see one of those again no I don't think so you're never gonna see a lot of things again just cuz it there's just no nobody that's actually that's not necessarily true you might see more things now because that's true too right no I was just ahead of myself like at you know for all the times I shouldn't be here right you sure that it wasn't an industry creation right so Nellie anything really is possible yeah that's a good point you just have to fight and sift through so much shit most of it mediocrity to get to something that really hits you or that you connect with well I think that you're also saying this out of your own personal experiences where you realize you could you could have not been you like easily you could have not turned out into being you oh if I just sat down in a room with a bunch of people who know what's best I wouldn't have been me yeah you and most people that are successful you know my first record we did shop to a few labels in town but you know it was I was a little bit ahead ahead of the whole neo trad curve that sort of kicked off in the last few years I made this really traditional country record and but it was it was like hard country it was very like an album I'd always wanted to make and we shopped it to a few people and they just didn't really know it wasn't the right time so nothing came of it so we self released it so then when I did the second one meta Modern and now I've got this whole record about like you know mine the journey of the soul or a mind or whatever talking about turtles and fucking tripping and shit right I was like I knew nobody is going to get this like I can waste time trying to find somebody release or we can just put the damn thing out and I'm so glad we did it that way just because it I know what happened was a result of people hearing it and sharing that with their friends a hundred percent that's how I found out about it I found out about it for people online and I got to tell you the cover of it threw me off at first the cover of it wasn't me being a smartass because I was like there's all this like you know you go to these festivals and still only a grown-ass man you know I mean we're fucking stupid jobs like now I was in this all of a sudden in this position of going out playing all these festivals and looking at these kids and stuff doing it and all and it's just great make a lot of friends but there's there's a lot in any industry there's a lot of people like for the wrong reasons you know what I mean like chasing something right I want to see themselves in as opposed to something they see within themselves right right and so we started doing these festivals and there's a lot like what they call like the younger hipster kids and stuff these tintype photos that were really popular a few years ago and I was like well how can I out hipster the histories so I'll do a painting of a tintype photo and surround it by like the tackiest outer space my buddy that I did the thing with we were actually trying to make the worst album cover of the year we ended up making a top 10 list on Rolling Stone we didn't get the cherry but this just makes the tackiest fucking thing we possibly can like those cheesy fonts and it's kind of crazy the music was to me was so heavy and personal and real I was like God I mean I don't want to be the kind of wanted to make fun of like the dude levitating in the fucking cave before before people turn you into that you know I mean because that's not at all a lot of shit was just stuff I've been reading about or yeah you know you're in character yeah but it was psychedelic country music it was like well which is a lot I love a lot of 60s rock and some of my favorite country records ever made were made in the late 60s some of the like gene Clark and some the early burn gods and brothers type stuff there was this level of psyckadeli in the production that made was so beautiful I got to get a list of shit that I'll throw you some shit man but then I'm talented guys and I was kind of a taskmaster so such such a young band because they wanted to play loud and you got to pull things back or like you can only have this cymbal that kind of thing get it down to the structure of the songs and we spent like three months on the road just carving those songs out in the arrangements I had it pretty much you know duct pussy tight which is waterproofs and then we you know we came off the road and went right into the studio the next day for four days and just banged it out and in the groove yeah basically just plug up like five mics don't move anything and just lay it all down and then Dave and I are with the mixing and then he had some great ideas and post-production like getting the sounds around but then you come back and we had all these separated recordings so to me I've realized the real fun is putting everything in sequence and making these cycle to maximize I guess the emotive nosov the records right in terms of a rollercoaster of emotions if you know instead of just one so like every time we do it now it's always different I don't like the record I did after that was recorded that one a totally different way still going fast but you know I always wanted to make a big kind of lush orchestral Sol record you know what I've learned is that I don't want to be in the music business because I'm just going to be in the Sturgill business because there's no this like the mechanical timeline of it all by the time we go in and make that record you're so you've been processing and thinking about it so much for four months and you get in and you have that release and it's it's like I equate it to driving in a really heavy downpour rainstorm for like an extended period of time which is there's a mental exhaustion that comes forward but you have to just kind of like keep going and but by the time it's finished and mixed you've heard this thing like a thousand times you don't ever want to hear it again but now you got to go out and play it on the road every night for a year and a half so we were constantly trying to reinvent every now how to keep that fresh and exciting while while holding the pause button on going over here and recording what creatively you may already be on - Wow so I'm I realized this year I'm going to take the reins I'm gonna do like I'm gonna play thirty festivals because those things are always so fun just go out get all the energy in your face and then we're gonna do probably a double album and another record and just record it all so that when I do turn around and want to go do like a really big long two-year tour we have all this new material and the old stuff to pull from I like how you you're approaching it so like you're approaching like a plan it is a plan you have to look at it like a plan do you think everybody does that oh there's all kinds of different plans I just know what works for me I've learned more importantly what works for my family and my sanity I don't need to go play 300 shows a year yeah I don't you know I'd rather go play 30 or 60 shows and know that every one of those was 110 percent as opposed to you know you got the Tuesday and Wednesday shows to get you to this weekend market where everybody's counting her checks already and shit and you're exhausted and in the show suffer and these people pay money or maybe they don't realize it like you can't hear anything for 40 minutes because you don't ever want to project negativity from the stage if you can help it there's you know the bad nights I just want every night to be great and then but most importantly right now for me the fun is is the studio and the process of trying to push it you get to what's next yeah you do totally different albums every time you put an album out it's a completely I'm a music listener and lover first informant probably musicologist more than a musician at this that word yeah we know I guess that's my field of study is ecologists yeah if I had to like say that I have obsessed over one subject enough to where somebody should probably give me a fucking piece of paper that says I know what I'm talking about it's probably music did you when did it start like did you have this your whole life early early our whole life Wow probably honestly first time from Michael Jackson maybe I was like you know what's kind of fucked up about this what you wouldn't have been you if you didn't come into this so late no he'll be your hole but then your hard life right your whole life you loved music yeah you could have easily just been on a path from the time you were in high school who always played right but I'm glad I never like recorded anything right until yeah I couldn't you're younger you know like Eric Clapton I love our Clapton huge influence never met the guy but there's a great documentary schema but you can look back at his career he was so young and passionate and talented there was one particular record he did was a guy named John Mayall was like kind of the birth of like rock and roll guitar town is the first time I've already plugged a Les Paul into a Marshall and is crank the fucking thing and that record that sound everybody's like whoa like that was a thing that happened but you can look at his career and he was such a chameleon going through all these phases and a lot of it was emulation or reinterpretation because he you know got into substance abuse but you can see how much his career shaped him more so than and all the people he'd been around and was as friends with an exposed to and him rubbing off on them and vice versa Wow anybody in their 20s is still anybody I know in their twenties is definitely still figuring out who they are as a person much less an artist yeah I'm almost 40 and I'm still figuring out who I am as an artist you know cuz every year you know you're gonna feel different every fuckin day much less two years from now it's time to make a record yeah and you're gonna change it up as you see fit you're gonna go with what what's going on in your mind right now right that's a beautiful thing right you don't have a I mean even though you have like a whole sort of entity behind you in terms of like people carrying your stuff and all the jazz that's going on all the equipment that's involved in doing one of your shows yeah very few people how many people you got myself three members of the band we have a tour manager we have our side monitor sound guy the front sound guy and my merch girl see guys there's nothing blind P not leave us with with the driver so I know always being one bus we got one truck to haul the gear and all that shit that's pretty minimal compared to some bounds in a respect like what you do your kind of shows you do that's how that is pretty minimal it's uh I would like I want to keep it there as long as possible no matter what happens hmm um just because you know I've never been like a big lights guy or any that stuff is just putting those guys on my banner all pretty amazing players we try to go out and put a show on if you were doing something else though like say if you were part of a band that band was being promoted very heavily by some record company that had put the band together you know some you know they do like those manufactured bands or something that you'd be in a situation where you're basically required to do commercially successful and viable music you couldn't just free ball like you're doing and doing whatever you want to do um I honestly I don't know me and I all I know is that what's happened to me and most of the people most of my friends are people that just kind of do their thing but there definitely is that element but there's you know I've only I never thought I'd ever sign with a record label really yeah I've never had any interest in it whatsoever and the animal you know all of them things kind of took off we met all of them came knocking but it was working fine by ourselves just sort of subcontractor my team and the one thing I the only reason any artist should ever sign with the record is for larger recording budgets you know a larger toolbox was right within which to use to make your product let's call you know relaxed their term so they they have like serious places where you can go to you can get to ridiculous studios and then or not I'm a still I still record in the you know my favorite studio national is nothing fancy about it it's just money for players and gear you might not have or just and then mixing and then that more time to spend in the studio it really I don't you know we we did we did remember modern in three or four days because we had to mmm doesn't necessarily you know dark style moon was made like nine months yes I don't know that was definitely like to separate extended sessions you know you don't just for me is that that's the fun is sitting in that room and figuring out how to break shit and make sounds I haven't heard before and you need time to do that you need you know money but you can you can make great records for a very little money too so what's the benefit of having a record company they pay for the gear well they pay from the benefit of having a record company is simply somebody else pockets or you it all comes back on you and you know we don't want to pull the curtain back too much here but you're basically I looked at it as like going into business with a bank for at least two records take out a loan that I'm pretty sure I'll never pay back because it the recoup you know it's in there but I feel like I'm more of like it all comes down as a bean counters eventually like I you know my record sell to 300,000 copies and at some point they'll have to decide whether that's fiscally viable to them anymore because they don't they don't make any money off me unless I sell records you know what I mean like they don't it was a very friendly structured deal like touring and all that publishing shit's completely separate there's nothing to do I just make records and they you have to sell them right and I get to make the records that I may be cutting or would make on my own I don't know but outside of that a record company or provides more or reach or push or even sadly in the music business there's probably less bullshit in politics there may even be less politics in politics you know I probably would not have been up for album of the year at the Grammys last year had I've been on thirty Tigers as opposed to Atlantic Records you know what I mean right now I think it was a great record I know I deserve to be there but it wouldn't have happened if you didn't have that kind of wait at the table that's very honest and that can make you feel like jaded against it all or you can be like okay well you know Wiz Khalifa they probably spend more money marketing one single for Wiz Khalifa than the my entire project costs so because they make all those records and Bruno Mars or whoever sells 18 gazillion records guys like me get to make records and that's how it works to trickle down right and it's all based on the money that they made from a long time ago really and then maintaining some sort of they're still making money man the streaming thing you know they're all in bed now with the streaming service yeah we've talked about you seeing profits steadily climb for them but not really for literally artists crazy-eyed have nothing against Spotify I know people are like fuck that shit but look at it like this man the people that are streaming music they're not buying records anyway but they're still finding your music they're still telling their friends about it they're still coming to your show which is how we get paid playing shows yeah they're still your fan so you have to either embrace it or go fucking do something else yeah yeah no it's good point but now when when Sparta 5 starts kicking songwriters 12 points then yeah I'll do commercials for them until then you know but they are doing whether you realize it or not and you see it does count up but it counts up but it is a weird thing when it's very sweet at all is based on you selling art and you don't pay for it specifically even even with I feel more like Atlantic one into business with me I feel and many ways still feel like a very independent-minded artist like no I don't go to meetings nobody's telling me what to do right I don't have a manager or even technically a publicist at this point I'm just sort of floating and making writing songs and making records and then we go play shows and that's if you could just keep that yeah doesn't just wear out yeah I've in the last figure five years figured out where I want to be right and and what parts of it mean and something to me and I know I'm getting and giving back with the fans well I think it's also when if you can stick into that groove you stay in that groove right there you can maintain who you are you can you can still explore new ideas you can you know you're not you're not being pushed too much you know if you were if you were like being pushed to constantly produce new stuff and they could I could imagine that wears on artists well I just spent so much more early life working for other people I just made a point one day when I'm before I moved to Nashville I'm not gonna do that ever again I don't want to work for anybody else unless it's something somebody I really admire or is a really exciting creative thing that like I feel like I could benefit from or learn from being involved with I understand that thousand percent what's interesting is when I talk about on the podcast sometimes people who don't do that they do work for someone they have a job they get upset right they feel like it sounds like you're talking down on jobs but the reality is you're working there for money we've all done it everybody's worked for my everybody's worth some of my jobs I love the railroad yeah if this law came up tomorrow I actually could be just fine I go back to railroad and be totally happy going throw switches 12 hours a day having my four days off make a good salary you know whistle while I work all that shit man yeah like but a plant it doesn't hurt to have a plan B but no working for other people was never something I enjoyed but I think anybody that even hears to say that the reality is if someone gave them the option you don't have to work ever again they'd go okay what would you do though you'd do whatever you want what I would do I would I would fill my day up with learning shit you're one of the busiest fucking people I know though you don't have a job but you use you're very proactive human being you know you do whatever you want all day long it doesn't mean you're not working you're not benefit I do whatever I want but I earn it like I do shit I earn it I feel like I have to have to work my the thing with my job is it doesn't feel like work right there are parts that did feel like work that I identified that really have nothing to do with what I want to wake up in Darius no I just don't do those things right and now it's like you know the travel sometimes feels like work the things that I do or don't feel like work this just definitely never feels like work Podcast don't feel like work standing up doesn't feel like work working for the UFC doesn't feel like work those things don't feel like work but the stuff in between those things to make sure those things work well that's the work sure like right you do that do you handle the day-to-day admin or hundred-percent yeah I don't have anybody I don't my take is always if you need an assistant you just do less shit you don't want someone that you have to constantly check in on and make sure they've got their shit together and I've had some friends that had assistants and then your life becomes their life and your problems come their problems their problems become your problems as well anybody you invite into your life you're inviting their problems into your life it's just it's also I don't necessarily think in my case it's necessary maybe other people are more busy and they need assistance a nine I don't have a lot of friends who have assistants a lot you know but I just said I don't function that way I I want to when I wake up I set my I have a bunch of shit I'm gonna do today I set my alarm clock and I have a schedule but that schedules mine I made yours yeah what I went running to change it whenever you whatever the fuck I want yeah managers like this the sweetest most empathetic human being I've ever met and you know he's not just he's not just responsible for me he's like the babysitter and the the mother of the whole family but like sometimes if we've been on the bus for a while or rolling most more than anything to give everybody else a break and do him a favor I'll go off on my own and like stay at a different hotel or I'll go to a different city for two days and he's always like you know Woody's from New Zealand he's like so sweet he's like fucking gigantic and I got it man it's like are you sure he's almost like I almost feel like I'm hurting his feelings I won't let him like take care of my day it's like motherfucker I got Priceline you know I can do this you know people don't expect you to be doing that right that's what's interesting right they want they want to be able to handle it so you'd have to do the mundane things a normal person is you got eight other people too take care of right now I'm grown-ass man yeah I would never want to do what you were saying John Lennon did just lay around walk around naked and I can't do it I don't think he liked to work yeah I mean he was a true artist yeah I get it I mean I get it but I for me it's almost like I know what makes me feel like shit and I know what makes me feel good right what makes me feel good is when I get shit done what makes me feel like shit is when I'm lazy then I get anxiety depression I don't feel good I don't feel like I'm getting anything done and people think that oh because I work hard and I'm constantly doing something that I never feel like that no I definitely will feel like that just so I see them recently they prove that task completion your brain releases a chemical that makes you fucking feel great oh yeah man I did this I did something purpose when you finish your album when you're done it's amazing oh it's also terrifying I've become shorter like god I gotta like release that yeah people gonna hear that shit yeah but yeah it does feel like yeah release is the best way to put it yeah I think everybody should experience that even in a small I think little kids get that when they earn their fucking karate blow up belts and you see a little kid get a yellow bell and they tie it on their Beeman that's face oh you can't believe it I did I did it I give my oldest a high-five for anything and it's like you see them light up yeah just like that of a formation you know getting something done they did it it didn't I mean think about especially when you're talking about like little children like my seven year old loves to draw she's a really in the art and like she takes a piece of paper and this is not a big deal to us as grown men she takes a piece of paper and that paper is blank and in her little brain she decides it's gonna be on that paper she's saying I'm gonna draw a dog and then boom it's a dog and I'm gonna draw a dog that has a wing and it also has a tail and has a tail that grows out of his forehead it just makes wacky shit up and she thinks it's fucking hilarious like look he's got a tail on his head ha but in her little mind she's learning that she can do whatever the fuck she wants with that time there's nobody there saying you shouldn't do that no one's saying anything and little kids gravitate toward that man when little kids start drawing they gravitate towards this expansion of the creative aspects of your mind like whatever it is in your mind that causes you to have these ideas whatever in your mind that causes you to think of a story that you want to write down or a drawing that you want to try to accomplish and try to put down those little things to a kid are magical because they didn't have any of that before I mean they're they they just learn how to talk she's seven there's only been talking for five and a half years you know all that other stuff before was gibberish and all sudden she's sitting in front of the pad and no one tells her what to do little seven-year-old like hmm I think I'm gonna paint today and she gets out the paint and just puts a little of that you're flexing those little muscles you know just as if you were doing push-ups you're flexing those creative feels you know and to encourage that with kids that's what we all love we all love doing something and people say well I'm not very creative I just like working with wood that is fucking creative like carpenters a goddamn creative you built a house motherfucker do you understand I can't do that I can't do that I mean oh I mean all of that amazing I grew up around construction it's fucking hard to do you build a badass house that shit is hard to do or people literally highly mechanically inclined can can just take a car completely put it back together in the garage guys you build cars that's art that's art mechanics there's an art to even being a mechanic just to learn it all perfect putting it together using your mind thinking out how to do maybe get bore out this and put that in and swap this out and what's the issue with the vehicle and there's like there's like there's a creative aspect to anything that's really satisfying and I think that you know we kind of pound that out of kids man yeah I think that's very true we pound it out of every weld it has no it doesn't serve capitalism yeah the the saying earlier I had this just train job and the first year as they're just like out on the ground like throwing the switches and disconnecting the trains and hooking them back up and that kind of thing and that yeah I got I got promoted so what they call like a yard master like with your boss and you're in the truck and you're sort of in charge of the inbound and outbound manifest and everything that comes in and how what gets blocked apart and switched over to this track and you're building other trains and you got to get them out on time and like as soon as they put me in that job there's like the greatest job over here because I was playing Tetris you know I mean it's just like fucking Baron von Munchausen and my little fucking truck with my 8,000 radios like tearing trains apart and just watching it all like happen and get it out the gate on time and it became like a high you know wow because this high-pressure very dangerous yeah there's only three guys out there making all this shit having got the guy driving an engineer to do breaking apart and then whoever's on the back like sort of playing the chessboard whoo yeah I was like this is fucking awesome I got a big old thermos all that shit there's some good jobs for sure but if somebody came up to you in the middle of that good job and said you don't have to do this ever again you do whatever the fuck you want you would leave it's a good job I did yeah it's a good job for a job well I fucked up took a management position after that oh no in these offices totally out of my element it's pretty mellow conference call when some other asshole didn't get the train out on time he's that crazy because you went from having this cool high-pressure job that makes you feel good to making more money but you'd only get that juice anymore yes like man this is way too stable I better be a songwriter no I burn out I hit vapor lock I'm gonna fucking golf I can't imagine shit with other dudes pretend to be this guy like what am I thinking those are the guys that I think of when I that Thoreau quote most men live lives of silent desperation yeah those are the men I think of those nuts men that have fallen into some salary position where they're not happy and they want to get out and they don't know how well they have they have the the downfall of being highly efficient individuals and other CEOs recognized that and Billy I can put you on salary and work you 90 hours a week and you're going to get done because you won't let yourself fail but you'll probably fucking drink five pots of coffee a day and listen Sturgill you know if you keep going you've got a good position in this company I'm telling you you've got a bright future you can make it happen 401k 51 nine a-m I'm making those numbers up all that shit it's crazy it's most people you know people get tired of people hearing this because they don't know what to do and so I didn't know what to do yeah forever I mean I just weren't you know but then you do well you know always played music but never thought it was something you could even do for a job we would have not known where to go or how to do that until married somebody lost more to me when I was like man I'm really unhappy and she's like it's because you're supposed to be playing music dumbass and so like oh that's probably true so but if you did it earlier you wouldn't be you it's the craziest thing ever it's like you had to go through all that bullshit to get the sound that you have now to get the the soul behind it that you have now that's the sound of a man who suffered oh yeah it's a sound of a man who understands the woes is me that's real yeah that's a real that's there's a real emotions you know like that Jolene song that we're talking about yeah it's you're all lost oh man if it happen when I was younger it have been way more interesting to watch ever fucks it up so hard right problem ya know I mean that's props to Justin Bieber we're at man I'm keeping it together it's hard to uh it's hard to complain yeah it should be we got a great great great band family's healthy dude you're in the groove you're I'm doing my thing as far as I want to you're in what my friend Vinnie Sherman calls hakalau it's when you he's a hypnotherapist trains it does a lot of mind work with fighters like a mind coach and he's like there's this state do you get in where everything just follows everything's flows and that's what you've well you figured out how to do so brilliantly in your life was after you've been through a bunch of bullshit you figured out it get to a place of success and then you're able to just do your thing that's that's your flow look you found your thing yeah and I had to learn that even in the last few years you know because you it's so easy when I've always so used a metaphor when you're on the train it's hard to tell how fast it's going and more importantly where it's going because a lot of times you don't really have any control or even say so in that matter in some regards you don't want to know yeah how the sausage gets made but then it I'm at a point now where as as as far as I ever want to go because I am I have all the freedom to do what I want right and it might not sell as good or as as great as the last one did but like I'm having fun and it's gonna be okay you know I don't think you're gonna have any problems I think the real issues have always been in the past about distribution in terms of like radio play album sales so we don't like you yeah and a guy like you you're so locked in you're in you came along at the right time man you came along you locked in the zeitgeist but you came along at the right time of the Internet we're like look and right time I mean definitely not all luck but there was definitely like I'm just glad nobody else wrote a song about turtles that year very different outcome it would have been like that year that they had the two meteor movies oh yeah yeah right exactly yeah can't have a fucking can't never - I wrote a book this year with the same title that's long I mean he's getting all conscious shit on Lizzie and her nose like I didn't fucking come up with it like don't send this to me yeah Turtles all the way down people don't wanna look into things I didn't know what it meant until you explained it I don't still don't know what it means I just thought you know yeah that's cool no I know what it means but in a very dumbed down to make this a standalone podcast explain to people what turtle oh well it's a jocular expression more of a funny way to put what is originally a concept as far as I know that was first described in detail by a Jesuit priest named Pierre de Chardin all about how about the omega point in the universe and how all consciousness emits from this one central point of origin where the whole thing banged out from and it's all just expanding and reciprocating back to itself and like absorbing everything going on but it's this is one point where all things spiritual scientific metaphysical all matter in the universe all fucking knowledge emits from and he got blackballed from the Vatican for preaching that whoa because he was like you don't necessarily need to stand in a building to talk to God because God is everywhere and all around you and inside you all the time whatever you want God to be or you know so the the I got it from a Stephen Hawking book where and he's weird you can go around the world there's all these ancient civilizations whether it be some Native American tribes or parts of far eastern Asia where they find like these adherence to turtles and elephants and older culture and Hindu mythology there's even a Hindu illustration representing the sort of a similar figure or myth that it all set on the back of this great turtle like flying around in space because they they held those animals in such regard as old and wise creatures actually turtles are the oldest living species on the planet in the predate crocodiles Wow and the symmetry of their shell designs no matter what species it's always 13 pieces which a lot of the old tribes thought had something to do with the lunar phases of the Sun and how it was all tied in together with you know whoa anyway long strong way of saying that that song was Merson as a result of a lot of fucking reading no not necessarily taking drugs you know wasn't that the original one of the more original calendars was there only 13 lunar cycle calendar yeah was it Mayan yeah I think that is what it is I think it is a Mayan calendar but it's all these things I sort of found or the sim vehicles were connected I was reading at the time and it just and I was about to have my first child it was just like man I want to make a country record about all this shit or like you know write a song about the book of the Dead and but as a traditional country record and then incorporate some classic rock psychedelic so that was all that was that's how I found you you know people online like yo they dude this guy making psychedelic country music I have money part in like then everywhere you go people make it like handy like hand bone glass third eyes and shit you know you get some real interesting characters man get a little too many to throw it out there like that there's too many bongs out there right people still rock the bong those got to respect that you know it's like driving a manual car I never was a bong guy it's too heavy man I got shit to do man I can't oh that just peeled down or the dab thing that I got friends in Colorado California now the first time I ever did wet shit this is pretty embarrassing story but my my buddy you know they were all at California Colorado guys they roll pretty hard I'm not really a heavy smoker man to be honest on the road it keeps me occupied from time to time but from writing maybe but at home you know there's no need so it the first time I did that shit I didn't know what it was you know I just pulled it like it was a big old bong rip and I got very special oh you know I need you instantly no you just did something you shouldn't have oh no and lay off fuck man so I sat down and after a couple minutes I just started getting really cold and clammy I was like yep I'm gonna puke so when I was like I fucked this guy so I puked right in his sink I was like dude I got to go home I feel like dog shit now and I'm pretty sure I'm dying so this apartment I was like he went out the door and turned the corner to go down the hallway to mine and it was full-on vertigo like the hall every time I took a step the hall we got twice as long this is fucked up my wife is out of the country I work at the time I was like I remember I was sitting down in the hallway just like trying to get my shit together man because I thought I was having a fucking heart attack it was just like Pat like sweating and I remember this voice saying get up you stupid junkie fuck before somebody comes out here and sees you you know sitting in the hallway like a dumbass and I managed to like pop out of it and as soon as I got back to my place and sat down on the couch everything was fine but it was just so initial and the rush I was like I don't nobody needs to be that stone you know that fast I'm sorry is what kind of milligrams are you getting you think they just had like that nail head torch thing yeah three thousand dollar glass piece I was like you guys are taking this shit way too seriously yeah there you could be cure and fucking cancer somewhere right now I'm pretty sure if they put the effort energy and mind power and have you seen the laser balls now some I got a video since from the daily sky like a pressure activated laser bong who like shoots a beam and ignites the flower of Jesus like that wise what's fuck's that guys come on man the thing is they might be curing case colony is that somebody's going to need to build you know how many cancer patients are taking dabs that might be the key out here probably a lot get him on it if I if I had if I was dying of terminal cancer that's when you want to be that high look at this thing do that again Jamie yeah oh that's it look at this thing of course yeah fuck it's the light listen this is fucking insane now how do you not go blind staring at this so he's heating it up it's cooking it's a good question then he takes a big hit Wow yeah anyway the medical strength stuff I totally understand that seems like you go blind like you were standing at a welder yeah you know you have to wear a welding mask that's my very very close to my life in my life recently that went went was dealing with that vertigo no like heavy medical issues health issues and we got him some edibles and he's like it's the only thing that made it okay yeah that discomfort and so when I had to have a sinus surgery we talked about this when we played the Grammys out here last year I was sick as fuck man like I was getting all year for like the last year and a half on Rose get these horrible sinus infections all the time well I just assumed it was allergies Tennessee is really bad about that and when we go to Texas or Atlanta places in October when always crazy dog woods are kicking off and I would lose my voice and you know by no fault of my own it became very frustrating from a touring standpoint because I felt like I was always sick you know because I was so we flew out and did the Grammys I was all plugged up and couldn't sing obviously biggest gig of my life kind of stressing it so the label guys sent me to this doctor who looked up in there and realized and I probably had my nose broken at some point or just a really deviated septum when I was younger so I like a broken air filter but then when they did the scan lay all the cavities were just completely caked with residual bacteria and infection he's like he's like if you get on a plane and fly home you're probably gonna get meningitis well so we had to play the Grammys he put like nuked me with all this shit on you know what he did it opened it up for like a day that's where I was able to sing so the next day the whole band they flew home I had to stay out here for like nine days I think and go in every morning twice a day for IVs for him to clean that shit out so I could fly home so then we came back and did this surgery to correct it all and like went in there and scrape and cleaned them all out and shit and along with the the septum they fixed the septum so I had a single issue since all that happened I haven't been sick one time which has changed my life but while I was recuperating long story short I didn't want to take any of the opioid or the fucking pills that they gave me to deal with the pain is like I'm not taking that shit I'm you know you're gonna give me this for four weeks like no no way and so I just got a bunch of medical strength edibles and my wife and the kids they had to come my way to run a house so I had to be here to like recover and shit and man just laying in bed listening to headphones stoned out of my mind for like a week recovering and that's it's kind of awesome because you feel like when you're actually in pain or when you need that type of that heavy type of alleviation what what it is actually doing and offering you in terms of relief and it gave me a whole new understanding and respect for like the medical side of that shit here we are back on pot again but yeah and then my buddy who dealt some pretty serious cancer said it was literally the only thing that made him feel better so what did it do for you like so you're you're terrible agony yeah those all fucks all plugged up I had like all this girls and shit and I could feel where they'd been in there like right but scraping I could you know so it immediately all that was gone and you just sort of get really docile and euphoric and relaxed so fucking high but like it didn't affect me in a overdosing nauseous sort of way like a grind too many edibles cuz your body actually needs it needs it yeah I laid there listening two headphones and came up with the record I'm working on that it's great for me because it was like that's what I want to do next you know yeah it's a it's a crazy ride those edibles but if you can take that ride you get something out of it and sometimes people take the ride and the feeling is just to to self-examine Ettore to the paranoia inducing sometimes people just can't hang on a mass legality issue I mean if anything I know it's just gonna fuck part of you know but from a medical student reason why we're still even talking about this yeah you know no it doesn't make sense we're being fucked over by giant pharmaceutical companies and they're making billions of dollars and they would realize how much more money they would be losing every year if marijuana becomes fully legal they've already lost money for sure I guarantee you there's people that are buying edible marijuana right now that would have bought pain pills they know it all so insurance companies yep you know on-the-job accident so we had weed in a system we're not gonna pay this so I got my life insurance now i man this is crazy I did like one of the first interviews ever did I think I talked about like the first time I moved to Nashville and how like I didn't really know anybody and it was just like 2005 and it was a different town then so like I basically and I said I spent most of my time listening and playing bluegrass and drinking which is pretty much what everybody does the first year they moved to Nashville but they're nice and I said like after that well I moved out to Utah got this job and you know got sober was working on time so somebody put on my Wikipedia page that I've talked about my struggles with alcohol and those people read that shit man when I had to get a life insurance policy like they showed they'd read all the interviews and like while you've been really open about this and that and I was like yeah and like so you do the whole medical test and of course that tests positive for THC wasn't on the road at all time and I was like but I don't I don't smoke it you know I vape for edibles like I don't actually not a smoker and never smoke cigarettes but they list you as a smoker and now I have like a criminally fucking insane yearly life insurance policy because of course like you know the thing musicians who this guy's gonna die we can't fuck yeah the exact same thing yeah it's insane like I don't know I don't even smoke but I'm listed as a smoker and it's like literally $9,000 some crazy fucking premium just to make sure my family is okay if I die on a business trip yeah they they tested me and they said well you tested positive for pot oh yeah that's cuz I smoke pot you already know that like what are you doing trying to pretend if I ever died from smoking pot no it's stupid it's a dumb thing unless you think that I'm gonna do dumb shit cuz I'm high all the time if that's what you think but that doesn't make any sense you need to test how healthy I am guess what I'm fucking healthy right yeah I work out all the time super healthy eat good I know what I'm doing like you don't know what you're doing the problem is you don't know what you're doing you're the insurance guy you don't know what you're doing if you knew what you were doing you would look at each individual and go this guy is fine this guy's healthy this guy's concentrating on his health this guy who doesn't smoke pot and just eat sugar all day this guy's kind of fucked though oh that guy's really fucked that guy's fuck this guy who's on adderall because he's got a prescription for a DD and you have a problem with that that guy's fucked all these other people there's a lot of people that are fucked out there and these insurance companies that think that a guy who smokes pot is more likely to die there's no statistics to back that up there's no statistics that say the people who smoke pot are more likely to get diseases or die of some sort of a fucking debilitating syndrome that came about because of overuse of THC it doesn't exist but they don't even testing you for alcohol then maybe tell they tell you ask you how much drank without testing you like we can't test you son you're just him anymore it's really strange because uh and in the Navy and it's real roads were very stringent obviously highly stringent drug policies but drinking your ass off every night is completely fun completely fine you know don't don't smoke a joint at 5:00 p.m. but kill that six pack come in here and build this train the next morning you know those were always the guys that made me nervous not only that there's like a culture of honor behind it like how much you can handle you're drunk how much can you handle your drinking Bobby had 17 fucking beers I swear to god bro you would think he had zero he's right there good for Bobby Bobby's an animal yeah Bobby puts him down like there's like a badge of honor that goes to that you Bobby's meanwhile he's taking something that's completely hindering his thought process as his stability his these emotions are all out of whack like he's fucking drunk his shit he doesn't know what he's doing he's wrestling his brain is wrestling with alcohol right now which is one of the weirdest depressants you know awful one of the weirdest drugs it's a you spend a lot of time on road traveling constantly one you can't really drink especially at our age it just does things if you look at our rooms full of people every night that are hammering I was really drunk or like if you work with people yeah I don't I refuse to I don't I don't like really let people drink am i banned on the road and that's cost me players because they'd rather drink than be in your band and it just would you say you don't drink can they have a glass of wine with dinner well there's there's yeah well that's like you know a beer or two - you know that's right there's not getting as soon as people that shouldn't drink rye you know what I mean yeah like the guy that has one drink and instantly turns into a different motherfucker altogether yeah and then by the time he's only a third one everybody's like yeah there's a lot of guys out there - a lot of people I didn't know that existed till I'm the first time I met one one where the switch goes off and they get gerbil on Jekyll and Hyde drunk yeah they gerbil eyes like herbal eyes Wow that's a good way no it's we owe and they're moving around like they're a normal person hashtag woke yeah there's a weird contradiction we have in this society we were constantly drinking drugs in the form of caffeine constantly getting drugs in the form of whatever your doctor prescribes you for depression or anxiety or ADHD or whatever that is constantly going out and having drinks taking drugs the drugs being alcohol taking taking a whiskey drug and a vodka drug and Noah no one thinks anything of it they're like well I don't do drugs drugs all day all day there's so few people who don't do any drugs some drugs are super beneficial like think about that those weed edibles that made you write this album that's a beneficial what didn't make you right yeah but you were he wrote it he was a little credit I was listening to some old records early love was like yeah you could feel music better when you're high Britney Spears sounds good you can I enough man you kidding me turn that shit up like yeah Britney god bless her I like Miley Cyrus's music well I'm high I'm gonna admit it right now it's on Malibu it's good fucking song man it's a good song don't laugh at me Jamie it mocks me as if you heard a young cute girl can't be a real artist son of a bitch like the first thing you played in the studio here in the it was right it's super loud yeah yeah of course filled with speakers good for you I went to uh my name drop real quick cuz yesterday was probably one of those one of those days were like yeah this is why I do this I end up going up to Malibu it's a Rick Rubin's house and was playing him some of the some of those record I'm working on just to get some feedback and as well as moments when you like you realize you're sitting like Rick Rubin's like all Indians thought on his couch had banging like a fucking caveman and and he had literally the best sounding stereo system I've ever heard in my life could only imagine I mean better than any top grade studio monitors I've ever sat in front of it was just like yep yeah you know that's really Rick Rubin - that's the other the coolest part that was the only thing that was in the fucking room was the couch he was like literally like the Tiki a guy sitting in the chair further that's how you know it's like just the stereo on the floor in this fucking empty room and but I don't know what it was or what the speakers even were never seen anything like it but it I bet it's like what Mason says Henry Ron says he speakers we were talking about the other day they're like quarter million dollars is that what they were quarter million dollar speakers in his living room these these towers these two towers and then just I mean I've never I've never experienced it so I don't know what it's like but I gotta assume they spent a quarter million dollars for some speakers I thought it's I thought I'd heard some pretty impressive speakers in my time but this was like like some really holy shit sexists kind of moment right right it makes sense it doesn't even have to be that loud right it's just that the sound is so powerful right yeah - only thing I don't want a car I want I want a samurai sword and Rick Rubin's home stereo that's what I'm aspiring to now at a Bronco give him a lightsaber give them a Bronco a lifesaver yeah I gave I had a bronc got a badass Bronco my second one we move we moved to Nashville and Bronco my wife was my wife's it died and you know scoring a sweet one this redneck and like Livingston Tennessee or somewhere I borrowed off from him is 92 and he'd like Matt blacked it out my buddy Bobby took it for like a month while I was on tour in Europe and stripped all the interior out with rhino hide the entire liner took all the all the plastic everything was just like a fucking Mad Max deathtrap we had these bucket Colbert leather racing seats we bolted in oh and then I had two kids Martin I was like I'm gonna die driving in this thing but it had a 400 Windsor rebuild with like Kansas headers the whole goddamn thing like my neighbors hated it and i gave it to my drummer when his truck died and he he actually like unlike most kids of the Millenial area really put time and money and effort and work into it was like fixing up making it his and then he's getting married so he's getting a tree got a real truck so now that Bronco is gone I feel like it's probably time to find a sweet Bronco yeah that's a good era to the OJ's Bronco here is a more understated Bronco the locking hubs yeah the move is to get one of those and keep it plain Jane on the outside but on the inside just put a pad so that's what that's what I really want to do is uh cuz I don't I'd like to have so yeah it's very unassuming and then on the inside just look like a rocket ship with all the accoutrements that look done yeah easily yeah and very modernized user-friendly but what you're gonna pay to do that man you could fucking go by 1970 CUDA or something oh you could buy a house right yeah you could buy a house where you live for real yeah buy a fat piece of land actually Nashville the real estate has gotten pretty I don't live in Nashville anymore but I don't know it much like Austin I mean five years from now there may not be any music in Nashville because I don't know how many musicians are gonna Ford to live there yes so fast like an explosion an explosion logistically in the infrastructure the traffic it's like a miniature version la now when did it start hard to say I mean I are the first time I lived there was in 2005 and it was a different city then none of this had happened a lot of the hip bars now like where there could have been eight people in there on a Friday night I'm not really sure I moved there 2011 and I think it was like in the last two or three years though all the JIT refer keishon started around there and they were building these you know what used to be the blown out dilapidated parts of town the high-rises started going up and and and shopping centers and that sort of thing and and there's still very much the old Nashville it's almost like two or three different cities in some cases in terms of personality but the influx and all this change is sort of changed what it what it is but like Austin used to be a thriving music scene but now it's like well the tech industry moved in the cost of living and properties just insane hmm like struggling service industry job day-to-day as we say artists people are trying to make it can't they're all having to live like an hour outside of Thailand and commute in for the gigs wow that's crazy and what do you think was the catalyst like what what caused the launch just became a cool place to be yeah I mean there was there was I'm not sure what terms of well it's always been a publishing hub right no it's not I mean it's a music town but there's and there's all kinds of music there not just country music well but when did that TV show come out there was a big Nashville TV show that would have been about four or five years ago do you think that fucked it up all those dorks they go oh go to live there well there's definitely tours from that TV show of a mason jar it's such a soap opera version that isn't really that far enough away from how that world probably works I never saw it I didn't either I watched my wife watched it one night and I just like no I've been there a bunch of times playing Zanies done okay now that little Street where you're talking about that corner on eighth Avenue there's a knees you got Douglas corner then there's like some there's a lot of shops that I go to on like Sundays they're the auctioneers they like deal these old estate sales like really cool furniture but that little pocket that intersection is probably one of the few remaining bastions of funk left in Nashville like that's probably my favorite little corner in Nashville because I can just stand there and it still feels like relatively similar to what it probably felt like thirty years ago you know what I mean right yeah but a lot of other things change around things that don't does it make sense it does make sense yeah those are cool little pockets then right yeah I think I got a good friend Billy Wayne Davis I've met him at Zanies one night back when I was on Twitter he was he's reached out like a plane here tonight free tickets so my wife and I want we like comedy and got to know him and they ended up opening a tour for me that place is one of those places where you know it's good and old based on the number of dead people in the wall right Sears walking around you like Oh Richard you can walk in and taste cocaine yeah you know well I mean the photos of the headshots are all the dead comedians there's so many of them you know that place has been around forever aren't you coming to Nashville yeah like a couple of weeks what day I probably know I'm doing the Ryman on the 30th yeah the 30th on the Ryman with the golden pony Tony inch cliff then we're in Charlotte the next night that's what I like little short weekends bing bang four shows two shots Friday to church Saturday have you see have you done the round one before yeah couple times yeah yeah I love it it's fucking awesome I'll be out of town and I'm bones yeah wagon I'm always coming through I come through like once every year it'd be year and a half at most I love it I might come through again and do Zanies after this when I write my new hour just fuck around stretch it out cuz you really want to stretch it out at a comedy club you don't want to stretch it out in front of 3,000 people it's not it's not good it's not a good development ground it's not the room to know things out the big rooms in the room would that's when you're done you got it you got the set you know what you're doing you fuck around while you're up there but you basically have a structure for your act you have a structure for each bit and occasionally y'all deviate but what I don't want to do I don't want to work out brand new material in front of 3,000 people fuck that one night well I think I came to watch your show at the store yeah and this was like a year ago and you had to jet right after the set and go to Pasadena for another set yeah my buddy that I brought with me we just we're gonna hang here see who comes out and like Jeff Ross if somebody comes out he's doing his bit and right in the fucking middle of it the back curtain opens and Chappelle walks out and just kind of like taps Ross on the corner on the shoulder like fuck off I got this you know and just jacks the Mike and pretty much everybody else is set who was supposed to perform that night and it stands there for like three hours man well shit there I was like dude this will probably never happen again in your lifetime so I'm not fucking leaving and we just said through the whole time he sat there rocking tequila bombs and getting drunk and just really talking there were times where it was the funniest thing I've ever seen literally and there were times where like it kind of got dark and you're like where's what the fuck's happening where's this going and he was working things out and then later on those Netflix specials land and I realized I've already heard like 90% of these jokes and cuz the guy was just say I'm gonna go hijack the main room work my shit out cuz I got it like that I'm Dave Chappelle you know it was fucking amazing yeah he does that a lot where he'll just drop into place and just do a set and that's that's how he kind of works his material out you know he just kind of drops in and keeps tweaking it and it's it's if he has a structure right like if he has a few ideas that he's talking about he can just riff and especially he's drinking just go onstage and then it's written and then he's always got dudes behind him that are taking down notes letting him know like all you talked about this day and I'm sure they record it to they'll go over it and eventually boil it down to like what that Netflix special was the two netflix specials that shows you how prolific that do it is to put out a sniffling special and then a year later put out to Netflix passion right and then Netflix is like we'll take it what do you got and you say hey I wrote this one this month and I'd like to put it down for all eternity you cool with that those people like you write something and it's a good solid year before you even consider putting it as special you know some guys were doing like a special year but too much of it was like half cooked it's like if you just waited six more months this thing would be like an all-time great special but instead you're banging them out one a year you never get the essence of the thing well his thing to he part of his thing I think is making it look like it's so easy less because the night at the Comedy Store to just like it did feel like he was just sort of making this shit up on the spot and then you see the Netflix specials and it sort of feels the same way mm-hmm like he's just being Dave and like he would these little subtle things I noticed like probably ten times throughout the night at really awkward moments he would call the waitress to get him another drink but he would he would only say Bar whore and every time you say it I get a little a little more awkward like a little less appropriate each and every fucking time and we're probably good eventually everybody in the room was like that's not really the last thing says like I'm really sorry I called you bar hoorah just don't have any fucking jokes yeah that's how Dave writes it's one of the ways he writes but he's he's got it down you know he's got it down to a science and the other thing he does is he just travels to towns just decides to travel to a town them go onstage show up show up every night to film world yeah but I mean he doesn't even he'll do that but that's booked he books that you have to have to build that shit another months right it's like but if he works somewhere else he just shows up like he'll work at a comedy club and just show up sure you know it's like I was in Denver once and he just showed up I came in the green room after the show it was after the Late Show Friday night I went backstage and Dave's in the green room I go what are you doing man and and he goes hey Joe just in town fucking around you want to go on stage he's like should I go fuck yeah I grab him bring the people back in people already getting up and leaving I said ladies gentlemen get back Dave Chappelle's here anyone of course he wants to go on stage what else is he there that's what he does that's the thing you know but it's just weird to say like oh like this guy's so free he could just fly into a town where he knows his friends gonna be he doesn't even have to call you in advance you know he just flew in and I see him like oh yeah get up there like he's he's as free as a bird he does like whatever he wants and then he does he's Netflix special they pay my ass load of money and then he just does shows whenever he wants to but his creative process is like almost like engineered around being loose like keep doing whatever he wants going where he wants to go doing what every once and then writing you know and then figure it out on stage then riff in it and just fucking around it's fascinating fascinating to watch it's like jazz almost oh it's very much like yeah I mean he's um he's also got being Dave Chappelle down to a science like you were saying that you were in the Sturgill Simpson business he's in the Dave Chappelle business yeah yeah it does what Dave Chappelle wants to do that's the key I think I think that's the key if we could all be in the business of whoever the fuck you are whatever you do well is I like to write songs and make records and pretty much they know everything I think that's a good life Dave seems to be on a much grander scale you ain't like yourself I mean is there any point of the day where you ever do anything you don't want to do no not anymore no I mean I do things that I know I have to do that I'm not looking forward to but that's mostly like exercise shit right you know like sometimes I'm just not looking forward to it I have to force myself to do it or writing I love writing but sometimes I have to force myself to sit down in front of the computer but other than that like I know it on a computer yeah really yeah I can't write I write by hand too but when I write by hand it's really just rehashing things right when I write on a computer I get there's no way I can write is with my hands as quickly as I could type I could type pretty quick so if I'm if I have an idea and I don't want to hear my voice so I don't want to say it into a microphone yeah I want to just figure out what the beats are of things interesting yeah well as was that I always right by hand because usually the meter or the phrasing there's a way it makes me think about it it goes down right the first time or as opposed I'm just like writing poetry on a computer screen or whatever you know you don't necessarily have the sense of the beat whereas like I want things to flow a certain way and land on on hits in that and I usually just like throw all the consonants away hmm you know Bill Clinton wrote his entire memoir on like legal paper doesn't surprise me he wrote it on like she think about what you're writing yeah I think he wrote it on like a regular notebook like maybe one of those black and white ones that you should get when you're with the splatter covers yeah I still write jokes in those when I write I when I write on a piece of paper I'm really just reminding myself most of the time occasionally I have an idea that I have to like circle when I put X next to it and it's all slow but if you read my notebook you think I was a crazy person there's something to that too in terms of memory like if I learned a long time ago there's a song I want to learn you got to remember all the words I'm never gonna remember them until I just sit down and write that song get down on paper like one time once I write it on paper and see it it's like it's there yep you know yep like whether it's mine or somebody I only forget the words to the shit I write weirdly that's kind of like in shows yeah never fails if I like get lost or forget something that's always a song I wrote never really 8000 old country and bluegrass songs like I'll just pull out of my ass on a dime and remember all that shit but it's always the ones I wrote I wonder why I don't know man that's interesting that makes sense Dalek right because the other ones that you remember they just had an impact on you like they mean something to you or it's the one you wrote like it like comes out of nowhere it goes through you to your pad right it's like it's almost hard to recapture that state and then you're like a normal person trying to remember what you thought of when you were in that zone whereas if it was a song that somebody else made yeah like I love the song I know I don't know if it's like because you're reacting it's stronger or more strongly I mean well this is I think there's a thing of creativity that involves the no self right there's that state that you get when you row there's a lot of shit that I write where I go back over it like Mike I write that Ben out then I go back and read and also remember any of this right half of it I don't remember - that's the whole different that's the hardest part those getting to that lack of self yeah I mean even I think that with any art when you're not thinking about it or self-aware or have any preconceived notions about where it wants to go yeah you know do you smoke weed and write I don't ever like do one way or another specifically I'm just whatever yeah I have written while I'm high written when I'm not right what about performing generally I don't and it depends I can't I don't I don't really like to smoke weed anymore it's something about the way it hits me when I inhale it high it becomes more heady and internalizing like any anxiety the paranoia people talk about it's only time I've ever experienced that is when I smoked weed mm-hmm but my problem is I don't like going on stage stone anymore because you're so ultra sensitive my ear becomes like I already struggled it enough I'm hearing everything happening and dissecting it all like hyper critical in real time and you can't do that and perform and let go so you kind of have to like it's two different brains hmm but if I'm up there singing and looking at an audience if I'm stoned I know enough about myself to know alike I'll get internalized and just only start listening to the band and the music and you sort of forget that like there's all these people there you have to give a show too and I guess maybe that is the show when we get lost on the music and then I've also played some of the best gigs I've ever played my life on edibles because you know sort of like an anti-anxiety and just like very free and yeah feel everything much more delicately in and in terms of response mmm but it's not something I were like oh we got to get high score on time play a gig you do or you don't I don't honestly no no that's really what I mean is you do or you don't whatever you you don't yeah there's no if you are is just this is tonight right right you know tomorrow's two moons not like you have a ritual right you know I like a drink right before I go onstage a shot that mrs. long alcohol misses with my voice I get that you stay away from it I just like oh just a little just that little feeling that you get with one shot like oh oh I like that well no I did what about food uh-huh that else out man it depends I don't like eating close to a show especially certain it's just not good yeah um I try to L eat a big lunch and then just fast and then I'll eat after the gig most time because I'm I jump around a lot and get into shit yeah me too and then one time we did this like radio thing or some shit and I was all I couldn't fucking sing anyway my voice was gone as freebie throwaway thing for serious and we've been in there setting up and rehearsing in the studio all day and then I realize like oh we haven't eaten I'm fucking starving I play gigs so he had some phuddle ever and I ate it like 10 minutes before you said it correctly most people don't you know what fuck it and uh folk it just gotta bond me dude like your worst nightmare you're out there like trying to really push and sing on a microphone and not shit your pants I've learned my lesson I hit the wall the other day in my house I don't know what the hell I ate but I literally had to put my hand on a railing so I could squeeze my butt cheeks together harder so I couldn't shit myself she's it broke through some weird barrier where I thought I knew I had to take a shit but I was thinking maybe I could let a fart out first when I'm on my way to the bathroom I don't know what I was thinking oh that's the gambler but took a step I took a step and all of a sudden it's like like if I had a water bag inside my body and it just broke and then I'm holding it all together with my asshole and squeezing my ass cheeks and the fucking abdominal pain is like whoa I'm literate it's I feel like you know when your kid used to put your thumb over the garden hose I just ride a really clear fucking thing down and like you got to a place where you stopped all the water from coming out of the garden hose but barely I mean fucking barely that was my asshole the other day holding onto the railing just squeezing and I did these little baby steps like this towards the toilet where I was no I wasn't even picking up my legs I was just sliding my legs over barely barely got my pants off and it was like a broken fire hydrant came out of my asshole just oh I was like where was this where'd this come from like five minutes ago there was nothing wrong with me I felt a hundred percent normal I wouldn't have imagined that this could happen right and then all sudden it's fly Anatomy that's terrifying to think it happened anytime you could be on a plane yeah stuck in your seat and you just shit all over your socks and your pants and look just runs up your back and down your legs it can happen to anybody have you ever had full-blown like absolutely horrible food poisoning both ends and you don't really think I might die yeah yeah I had a real bad once well I've had real bad twice but that Barracuda that I used to have this cool 1970 Barracuda was named the sick fish the reason why I named it the sick fish is I got food poisoning ain't linguine with clams in Illinois there's no fucking clams anywhere near elimination those things got me hard man I couldn't even make a fist the next day I was walking around like a zombie I was dead I spent the whole night throwing up and shitting myself and then the next day I was just dead I drank like five or six cups of coffee because we had to film this thing where we're they were putting the engine in the car and they were going over the design I was like barely able to stay awake while I was doing that I was so wrecked it's all I had at one time from this Chinese buffet and there's a you know that it hit me at hours later so yeah all of a sudden it was just was in this bathroom for you know four or five hours those things like it was the worst shape I've ever been in but in the back of your mind you know you're like it's okay you know I know I know this is food poisoning but like it's good it's okay it's gonna hit it's gonna go to a point and then and then it just throughout the night it just kept getting worse and I kept asking where is this point gonna be or do I need to go to the hospital because that was very uncommon you know Abdallah abdominal tremors and shit from puking so hard your muscles are just spasming and though you can die from it I mean people have died from ecoli poisoning there is a unseen in food Inc where they talked about this little kid that got food poisoning from I think it was a jack-in-the-box and he wound up dying was right yeah it's horrible it's a terrible way to die I mean you're ingesting some sort of a poison it just takes over your system just kills your cells your body can't process it quickly enough can't get it out enough you're shitting yourself and throwing up and doing everything you can to get whatever the fuck is inside you out right yes on food food on the road you play it pretty safe yeah I'll skip meals a lot of times I'll not eat if the only alternative is something like really shitty yeah just because not because like Oh a health nut but it's just not worth it you don't know I bring a lot of protein bars okay I bring a ton of protein bar so if I'm stuck and they just I need eat something I just down like a we have a bunch of on it protein bars I like those I like those quest bars and let me sugar in them I like muscle Pharm has some good bars just I don't live off of them but it's way better than that I'm not getting a burger do you eat sugar very little very little very little I'll give him like last night I had a piece of Apple rhubarb now strawberry rhubarb pie though with whipped cream what went deep that's rare I did a thing a while back kind of got pressure I tried to see you see how long well as long as I could without any sugar and how long as you go I was like twelve days well this is hard because everything has fucking sugar in it and you just but and then but after even just abstaining that short amount of time when I did eat it again at first it was like everything tasted so sweet you could really understand how much we're getting drugged with food but my thing is coffee I drink coffee in the morning not a breakfast guy but I just can't drink it straight because it takes like a bucketful asshole I gotta cut it with something if I get cut on coffee my life I could probably cut out sugar oh you say you cut it with some sort of shrink cream and sugar see I just use cream man or I drink these did you like this caveman's I get a bunch of bad have lunch sent to you how do you get the mud butt down I mean I don't get my butt from this I don't know what I ate that made me get mud butt but whatever it was it turned out to not be anything like I had that one terrible shit and then the rest of the day was golden there was no problems it's like something got in there with micro bacteria I eat a lot of probiotics I don't know if that helps right I'm hoping that that's that helps and that when I eat something funky all the good stuff that I like kimchi almost every day right I drink love steak but I hate ass cancer so I don't eat steak very often I don't think Steve's cancer I like your like raw or like really you know rare rare a little raw so I just know that the the the rare occasion when I have a steak I'm gonna get the chaws it's just worth it but it makes me eat red meat very little now Louis last time you had wild game oh man like real wild gale wild um probably when I when I was out in Utah worked for this kid who was a big hunter and he would bring in elk like filet medallions or like hamburger and he would he lived in Wyoming so he could pull like two or three extra tags here much like 18 deep freezers full of every possible cut of meat you can think of made from elk meat and he would bring it in sometimes when we were working and cooked that shit and the first time I ever tasted it I was like I don't ever wanna eat beef again that was the most delicious meat I've ever tasted yeah I basically eat it almost every day elk yeah almost every day cuz I shoot an elk I try to shoot an elk a year you don't always get one or obviously this year got lucky i got to i scheduled two elk hunts and i figured i was gonna strike out if not both of them definitely one of them and i just i got real lucky on both yeah well again it is there's there's definitely having really good guides that good guides you know cuz i human be with me yourself and your family a year one year off a year yeah yeah and i learned a lot of it to my friends i give a lot I give Gary Clark some some elk honey honey they took some elk yeah I wish you around man I'd give you some elk deal if you live around here well we're living now I'm probably gonna ice it on my back force long enough it'll probably be pretty easy well Kentucky actually has a new elk population over the last like 40 or 50 years I think they've reestablished it to the point where it's a hunting destination now they opened it up you know talking about it used to be flooded with it back you know 1800 a hunted them out and they yeah they repopulated I want to say in the 90s maybe were early 2000s and now there's so many that they're opening it up again yeah shout out to the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation that's what they do they they establish habitat for these animals down we're down in sort of the southeast corner around the Smokies man it's it's really weird a lot of wild turkey and deer supposed to be amazing there I saw armadillo in the woods at my eyes I was like no fucking way like that can't insure shit like they've migrated that far over and up Wow so the really far MIDI they don't really do much good do you have any elk near you there's got to be more than that we're you ever hear it I don't hear him how long you been this new spot well we really haven't even been in I stayed there off and on a couple times been dealing with contractors they just they just really got finished and out of there perfect I can go back to work but well you won't really know until September right September you're starting here just so many turkey and deer it's kind of a gonna be an issue I kind of walk outside like kick the fucking turkey out turkeys a crazy man you get aggressive with you too yeah I don't
