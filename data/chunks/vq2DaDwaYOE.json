hello freak bitches and and interestingly after that the way I dealt with coming out was I would tell someone and then i would get this little burst of feeling better i would suddenly because you I was like constricting my heart and when I would tell someone it would it would open up a little and I'd feel better and I could be I really could feel like I could breathe better like really felt better and then I would wait until that pressure would start building again sometimes I would wait months and then I would tell someone and then I would do this over the course of like two years and then eventually I realized I was like you know every time I tell somebody this thing that I think is horrible and they're pretty much okay and I feel better I was like I gotta end this it's time to end this now and that's that's basically when I told the remaining people and and that was it it's a weird secret because the people that do care that don't like it they're not worth knowing and nobody literally nobody nobody that I told you know my dad struggled for a little bit or you know whatever this and that my a lot of the thing that mostly people got was that nobody believed I was gay that was like my mate would you play basketball you know you play bad girl like you know like that so nobody could believe like they just you don't seem gay like I don't like to dance I don't you know kays dancing yeah Larry I learned my dancing from Cosby like that's my move you know honey so all of that like it so that was the main thing everyone was just sideswiped so a lot of times people say to me you know you're you act straight or you're straight acting sangwich in the gay community is thought of it's like this great thing you know they're if you're straight acting your masculine it's really great but I don't I don't take it that way because every time someone says it to me it makes me feel like a freak you know anything like why am i yeah because I am Who I am this is it you know you mean like like I had gay sex last night after i had that grass fed beef you know and so i'm gay i'm married to a guy that sounds like a gay person but that's a pretty gay married to a guy would say you're gay that's pretty gay that's what I realized I was like I'm marrying this dude like I guess I yeah but you know I did you realize I was like holy shit like I guess well you don't turn it back now yeah um it was a phase I was a gentleman ting yeah this is a long face I'm really like you know it's dragging out this phase thing but I realized that if I felt better when I told people that that there had to be some value in that in a way that I couldn't understand things but to the today straight acting like so I don't it means nothing to me when I meet guys that are completely flaming or if I meet guys that are that you'd have no idea like I like people based on their values and their sense of humor and like shit like that I never asked to all people that matter as yeah and you know what that's sort of a great way to bring this all around because that gets away from judging people on what you're supposed to think about them and all that social justice warrior and regressive bullshit versus judging people on the content of their character it was the highlight of my training as a person it was a training George first two weeks and the first three days that I was with him it was so mind-blowing that how famous he was people coming up morning taking photos where we're eating and then after the third day forth a then you realize this thing this the machine doesn't turn off and then he can't go to the chemists to buy shampoo he can chemist I let's the three years call grocery store pharmacy Oh call the cameras you got like we're a fucking you getting your champagne yeah he might go he might go into the toilets passed all your people waiting I decide the computer to wait to get a photo with him so he's up and then we got it every time we went somewhere it always have to be through the VIP entrance he couldn't walk through the front door especially in Montreal right so one time we went to a nightclub and then we've got in through the VIP and then we're walking to our our table and then we're about maybe 15 feet from our table and someone said Jose bird dress blue and we'll add a word of a lie the whole dance floor stop dancing everyone's looked at us turn and the whole club's walk towards that table and without losing a beat we've turned straight back around and walk straight back out of my club because it was like a tsunami of fans that had just come in there and he knew it was gonna real sit down yeah I said I will come back here in a couple of hours later when that when they distracted I can't come in right now because it's like this every day is this doesn't it this is this is normal and he has he's a good friends that his body guards that stand around in the whole time because I people said can I get a photo and the body guys will step in and say oh no flash as soon as the flash goes off then the whole club is going to come and then George or say yes and then the border guys are sorry I / George so just look my you don't understand if the camera goes and we got a problem everybody's gonna want to follow yeah and even a red light we're driving the car me and George got the radio hey pull over bitch are we stopping we stopped at a red light anyway here is cheers boo GSP and in four T's credit champion easy always looks wave smiles and then slowly just just for just a fraction just so he's had a I side of the fans but it's a but that's every well every singles he'd rather from your car park even he catch a taxi from the front gate to the back gate because if I'm walking a hundred feet would be a half an hour with photos and handshakes and highfives and I was doing this uh this film project thing in Alaska and I tracked down this guy that killed a Kodiak bear with a knife buck knife why yeah it was crazy story old older guy to name was Jean mo there's been a ton of articles written about it and like outdoor life and if this was back wasn't that long ago but I can't did he put the knife in a musket know so I mean you're like these bear stories and I was like I'm tracking down some of these barrister this barrister car and so he's on Kodiak Island Kodiak brown bears are the biggest bears in the world but they don't there's not that many attacks surprisingly for the size of the bearing the many there are but there's probably there's also not Kodiak Island isn't like Yellowstone Park I mean you have that many people there really so he's getting out a deer turns around the Bears just on him all he has is the knife so he's like trying to fight it off stabbing the thing and the bear like tear toward peace out of his arm out his leg picks him up shaking him around then the bear goes off and at one point he's just like thought he was done he's like yelling at the bear bear comes back malls him another time he stabbed and fighting it off and then I guess he stabbed it enough times he kept like trying to feed at his arm loss just like he said he was out of strength I think the bear went off star like laid down bleeding out he might have crawled to his rifle at that point I think he I Karen or the bear was dead or not but he shot it after the beverages like laying there and then hikes you know three four miles back to the beach oh he's like I can't remember old he was he had I'm or 60 something yeah remember the story now yeah he's in sixties yeah he was and then he says so then his son they meet his son they take him to this there's one cabin there where there's year-round residents and it was actually on I think raspberry Island there and they bring him into this cabin there's a german couple that lives there and like he said they they brought him in the cabin and for some reason i cannot remember exactly why but the dude that owned the cab and ended up taking a chainsaw and cutting out the wall so the rescuers could come in and get a stretcher and like stabilize him because he's just dying on the table they take him to Kodiak hospital do all the surgeries skin graft everything saved his life ended up get keeping like end up buying the bear back at an auction and they made like a rug thankful uh-huh I mean that's why the Romans I mean when they were feeding lions or Christians right that's what that was all about it's like to see how long that guy can last in there just to cross out your Lisa tears check this out this is a nasty story that I did not know about so what load up it was after they would have the Beast either fight each other they would have the lie on seat Christians or something then a typical thing is that after the end of the day when a whole bunch of these animals have been killed in one fight or another the Roman emperors to kind of look cool and popular with the crowds would then distribute the meat to all the poor people of Rome so the animals killed Indian I would then be eaten by all the poorest people in Rome as a freebie because you're a poor person and you're more likely than not a lot of people in Rome or pretty close to starving a lot of the times nothing that can be thrown away you eat anything right the whole animal whatever they give you you eat it so what does that mean that means that among other things that would end up as weird exotic dish in on the owner Roman table sometime you get also the interiors of animals that I've just been eating people so through via secondhand you're also eating people since you're eating stomach contents of lie on the Jews were killed in the arena and Ally on just finished feeding on a Christian so you're having a lie on Christian burger for yourself
