doot-doot-doot 4 3 2 1 and we're live Candace hi guys hi oh my god what were you saying about hereditary that's supposed to be a terrifying movie right that's what they said that's what they say meaning the media and like Huffington Post I think I saw that's why I went cuz I I'm not scared by anything like in the movies so I'm constantly in pursuit of a actual scary movie so I wasn't thinking oh this might be the one it was not damn you're that hard that no movies get you I can't remember the last time I was scared I think poltergeist when I was a kid and that's why I'm scared of clowns nothing as an adult oh no I'm trying to think of the last time I was really scared well see yeah see they don't make well they're fun I like them that's how I feel I like and I also like thinking that something might get me I like the suspense in that but it never does I always get it's very anticlimactic for me you like thinking that something might get you scared James last time you were scared in a movie said jump scares or that's like cheap cheap scarcest yeah that's not that doesn't count to make now out it doesn't kick that doesn't count I don't go see scary movies at the theater so so you're always at home so you know yeah yeah the strangers that one mothered me a little bit I was just in the weather no I was something to come in I was just sending out my Instagram oh yeah Instagram stuff um but you know the strangers did you see that one no that one was with Liv Tyler masks on yes they're outside trying to kill people mmm-hmm yeah that one rocked me a little a little mmm yeah it's something about the dark right you ever mind fuck yourself and you think that this like someone outside like you think you hear something to open your door and you listening yeah that actually has happened to me I had a peeping tom mmm I had a real guy outside of my window so like home I didn't see him I only heard him oh my window was cracked and he started whispering to me through my window whoa I have a joke about it now because it was only way I could deal with it without you know getting too paranoid about it so I wrote a joke about it but I did I did but every time I tell people they're like that's terrifying and I'm like yeah that is terrifying but at the same time it's like it's kind of flat kind of flattering I went out of his way to you know so but you ever see what the guy looked like I didn't but my neighbors so he came one night and I heard him he started whispering to me he was like I'll just tell you what he said okay it's terrifying I was watching also let me give this set up I was watching Mulholland Drive have you seen are you a David Lynch that's what I had on I'm a David Lynch fan and I had that I was probably like three o'clock in the morning and I sleep with my window open because my place does not have a see what I know what would you live in Montana yes I just drove in for this today fuck how do you live in LA I let that my place is old and I think what happened was is that it was built before a/c was even invented so the windows are even old-school so I can't even put like a portable they crank open and the windows crank open like that so you can't even i'd have to probably like get the manager to replace the window installments before i could even put an air conditioning in so you survived this I don't know I just leave during the day and then at night I have fans no I know it's awful or I just spend the night at a friend's place that's the move that is the move I'm lying and I'll be here now I know the address so chilly it's nice in here right it's got its own thermostat this room does this is amazing hmm I hate you so we're friends there you feel bad don't feel bad for your accomplishments this is no that's just good this is what I want I want that pink Himalayan salt light right there you have that one I could take that we got an extra one random pink Himalayan salt rock we do Rogan you have a stuffed werewolf outside and yeah float tank whatever I don't think it's stuffed it's not that it would have to be like a real thing and then you kill it that is what it is right let's be real no imagine it was just a polar bear scarier than that if anybody were to have a an actual werewolf it would be you tonight can I finish my peeping tom yes please so I heard it was the summer time I think it was probably like July this is like two years ago yeah it wasn't it wasn't awful wasn't like it is like now cuz this is kind of new I don't think la has ever been this hot in like at the beginning of July so that's the end of days so anyway I was in my bed watching Mulholland Drive and I had been like in and out of like falling asleep and then all of a sudden I heard like a outside of my window but I thought at first I thought it was this the movie right so I was like David Lynch is a weird dude like this is like a director's choice they like to creep people out to put like murmuring in the background I did I thought that at first like nor did and then like probably 20 minutes later I was like something's telling my gut was like that's not the movie so I hit mute and all of a sudden I heard so you're on the first floor I'm on the first floor my do problem it is well you know anyone that's on the first floor your upstairs neighbors are problematic because it sounds like they wear horseshoes and their bowling yeah all the time so yeah the whole ya know the whole thing living on the first floor is not a good idea but we have bars unlike most of the windows so that that's not an issue like I wasn't scared he was gonna come in because the window is open but then there's bars in front of it so I wasn't terrified about that but as soon as that happened what was funny was that in Edwards you know Ian Edwards comic working with him tonight at the store no nice house the ice house okay yeah no he was staying with me at the time because he had just sold his place in Reseda which isn't far from here and then he was in our extra room at the apartment so I was like Ian I think there's somebody outside can you like you want to get Ian to go whoo that was all a head what are you saying about Ian you don't think he could protect me he's Jamaican crazy I love Ian he's all money more [Laughter] one anyways 18 pounds weighs less than me yeah I'm careful when I hug him I hug you more firmly than I did I'm trying to get him to eat meat he told me he's on my elk meat no he said he will yeah he said he will I said you don't believe him yeah he's lying yeah I think he's just doing that to appease no no he's asked me several times it's right yeah he wants me to cook elk for him and he'll eat it because he'll know it's a hunted animal you know because he's a vegan he doesn't want to eat anything that was killed like from a factory farm yeah I don't eat meat either like I do occasionally I'll have fish when Ian and I fly every time we fly together I'm gonna take a picture of him five minutes into the flight cuz he's always like this out cold five minutes in the mic dude what the fuck where it's first thing in the morning we're supposed to be like you just woke up how are you going back to sleep he's always so tired and I do I go dude you gotta get blood work done it's your fucking diet I know it is you can do that vegan diet right but you got to be very disciplined you have to yeah you have to take all sorts of different some insane and you have to use algae if take algae and that's not the best source of b12 sun's bioavailable as animal sources you know all the fat soluble vitamins this it's just it's a nightmare you got to really be on the ball yeah he's not no I don't know if he's on the ball he was just on my podcast the other day and he talked that's called the struggle and I struggle the struggle so I said about life in just yes that's an ongoing that in my dating struggle or the ongoing dating and I'm not having air conditioning in you had a nice fellow with you at the comic store the other night he seemed like a good guy he has since parted yes it was very brief yeah well you see a nice fella I thought so too it's not that he's not nice he just had lives a lifestyle that I just can't that we're not we're not compatible we'll still be friends I think I think we can get to the point where we friends because we were friends first so I think we can maintain that mmm if I can't you know the struggle and everything the struggle is real it struggle is real evidence that's why I have people on then we just talk about stuff that everyone everyone's struggling with something and multiple things usually well I find this is just a rash generalization but I'm good at those I find that women when they're in their the prime of their life as a like not not like 20 but like as an actual grown woman with a career and and if they're smart and independent they have a really hard time finding the right man absolutely yeah it's like if you're a doing that if you're a dingbat and you'll you know you'll morph into whatever lifestyle your new boyfriend chooses then you can be okay yeah because you don't know who you are but it's hard for a girl to find first of all it's hard for a girl who's strong and smart to find a guy who's not intimidated by that Preet Rogan priest this is my life I know and I saw I know so many women who are in my situation so many who are just like women know what they want independent have money and just like don't need a man but just want one right but the dudes can't handle it well well it's hard it's hard both ways it's hard finding quality human beings to spend time salutely in LA friends girlfriends boyfriends whoever it is it's it's hard it's hard finding the right I mean yeah especially in LA especially in our line of work you know we're in the attention business you know we get attention professionally right and make people laugh that's the business fucking tricky business I don't know what you're talking about but listen you have you have one of the healthiest attitudes like you really do I always say this about you whenever we're at the store like you always have these you have the grind spots you get those grind spots yeah the store you get those twelve O'Clock spots 11 thirties those are the grind spots that shows been on for three and a half hours you get on you know that's rough but you're always you always have a positive attitude you know always happy always smiling everybody's always happy to see you people never like oh can this [Music] some people do but those are the haters I don't know who they are I don't associate with those people yeah but all my friends are always happy to see you you're very happy I am very happy it's my parents love me ah ah there it is well that's yeah you're fucked then you're never gonna make it this time that's what I talk about I talk about that all the time I say if my parents have been just a little bit more abusive yeah five stick comes by now my dad had just pulled a Joe Jackson at least once or twice yeah all right Pete Joe Jackson he just passed away well alright pay Joe Jackson we were just reading about him people have been sending me these things that dr. Conrad Murray says that no Jackson was chemically castrated oh yeah I heard about that yeah I had I said that a long time ago that I thought he was a castrato is that the word for being castrated a castrato is something that they used to do to young boys to get them to sing opera better you ever heard this before I wonder if Aaron Neville has yeah I don't think so I think he's just doing a falsetto yes when you hear him talk he talks like this dogs are good man Michael Jackson also talked about was fake Oh who's fake did you hear I speak it all this Conrad Murray he took his voice was like this Conrad Murray has a recording on his phone that he just played I just there was some documentary I just watched and it was Michael Jackson's like last words like on his deathbed here's his deep voice [Music] see see get the fuck out here that sounds like a girl yes it does doesn't a girl want some dick see that was his real boy still we have that that is not deep no one said it was deep but it's not not this okay listen when that is his deep voice that sounds like he's got a cold that's like my eight-year-old she has a cold no one said it was deep but it's it's not that this is what this is and why do all of them why does Jana talk like this and Latoya they all got beaten by their dad but what does that mean stay low-key so they have to talk like chipmunks if you won you read the stories the chemical Castroville yeah this play her a sound of a real castrato because there's only one recording from the early 1900's it was like some of the last of the castrato scuzz they don't do that anymore it's not but they used to do it it was very common people would give their children to the Opera awful will they get us kicked off YouTube James gotta do some finagling we get kicked off YouTube all the time shit yeah we play things that are other people's copyright yeah here this is a boy this is a boy yeah this is what that's what he used to look like I mean you know he was castrated so he had no hormones his body did not produce testosterone and so this is a grown adult male hanging like this why would they just let the women sing it no because it's a different thing it's a different sound like the women sound beautiful and they sound like women but there's a sound that a castrato has and that's a Michael Jackson sound the sound is a extremely feminine non look look it's real look if you think you see Tito and all the other Jason's they don't sound nothing too vain not no one looks or sounds anything like no he was definitely the standout but so you think they did this to him when he was a kid this is what Conrad Murray says and look it makes sense if you look at his body if you look at like he didn't have any mouth toan he was very slender he looked like he had no testosterone you sound like a girl he sang like a girl yeah tell them that it's human nature why it actually it's not bad think about that think about that voice who the fuck sings like that's a man no you're right I always thought he I I never pictured him like four took him for a sexual person at all like when people were like they said he was touching little boys I never believed that I always felt he was asexual I didn't get any type of sexual any chemistry or any type of tension at all from him did you check him out with like a detector yeah you know the gate [Laughter] yeah I think um it's entirely possible that that's true cuz i yeah I thought about that we we talked about that for years I was like dude I'm telling you I heard those castrato I know about that I guarantee you Joe Jackson knew about that too I bet they did that to that kid that's authorized out they did they used chemical castration I heard that it happened but I always thought it was like for some reason I thought it was when he was an adult I thought it was like a personal choice that he made whoa whoa no I think the idea was his dad was trying to preserve his voice I didn't I didn't know that so wait a chemical castration is that it because that means but with what lights good question is it something that you take that little I travel up your balls but like something that just makes you in like in like you don't have the ability to produce testosterone anymore well let's find out here it says allegations are Joe had Michael received hormone Jackson when he was 12 years old in an effort to cure his acne and prevent his voice from deepening an allegation Mervis Murray previously made in his 2016 self-published book this is it the secret life of dr. Conrad Murray and Michael Jackson hmm yeah he said Joe was physically abusive to him and his siblings were growing up but never mentioned undergoing any sort of hormonal treatments but this is what Conrad Murray says I just I don't know I mean who sound like the reason why I believe it is because of the way sounded right just makes sense and his dad was just a ruthless prick known as being a horrible person yeah but why why would why would he only do that to one of his sons because he was the only one that was young enough to do it too if you look at the Jackson 5 when they were taken off like oh right he was 5 6 years old everybody else was grown there was too late yeah they were all deep they were already they're already grown men and this was I guess this was the voice I mean he was the voice ABC I mean he was so fucking cute too they try to keep that going forever hmm that's why I think that's unfortunate it's scary well he's he's a cautionary tale you know and I think there's a level of Fame that you get to where you just fucked up yeah you got to fucking famous yeah but isn't it isn't it also like that a certain type of person only wants that level of Fame right like have you ever thought about like people who get to like for example like Donald Trump level it because it doesn't just apply to like the entertainment industry but like CEOs who these multibillion-dollar own these multibillion-dollar corporations like it takes a certain type of person to even want that type of clout you know right and I don't know I think that there's something in that as well I don't know I think there's a pursuit involved in all these things where you start off just chasing money and you start out and then you get involved in a game and it's all about numbers it's all about putting scores up you know and I think as those scores continue to pile on you continue to get more excited about your progress and you want to keep going further if someone makes a million dollars a year they don't go that's good that's good enough no they go I want two million yeah they make two million I want to mention they get a mansion I want a jet they get a jet I want a fucking island I have always wondered like when is it enough for people cause like I I I'm the type of person I don't think I would be like that like if I had twenty five million dollars and somebody was like you have to do this to get another twenty five million dollars depending upon what it is if it was something that I didn't believe in or something that wasn't aligned with my morals I wouldn't I'd be like I heard you have twenty five million dollars yeah I don't need it that bad well yeah I mean that's different though you're saying like if something was not aligned with your morals but if you had twenty five million dollar an opportunity to make 30 if it was yeah but they're just work a couple extra hours a week Candice no it takes yeah maybe just a few oh that's nice five extra hours a week an extra hour a day and we could ramp you up to thirty million dollars a year well I would do that yeah listen Candice we can get you really close to 75 million dollars a year but you're gonna have to work 12 hours a day sorry I can't I can't and as I know what you're saying I know you think it's hard but listen we got some adderall and we got some massage therapists that'll be on staff and if we do this for a few years you retire comfortably for the rest of your life you live in Ibiza you fucking chill out in a hammock I don't know it never happens that's the thing that Abby's a thing never happens the hammock never you just keep making but see for me it would come the only reason I'm working is so I can stop working oh really yes what's gonna hit what number I would be fine with I'm gonna I'm gonna go with 200 million maintenance Jesus Christ how much is a divine island uh depends on where it is if it's where hurricanes hit all time but you get it I get it for 75 somebody Richard Branson bought one last year and right after he bought it it got destroyed literally to the point where there are no living humans for the first time in 300 years on this island he didn't do research well it just got unlucky he just bought it and right after he bought it it literally the epicenter of the hurricane washed over it it was flattened the entire island I don't mean if you're listening to this Richard Branson I'm not I don't mean to laugh at you pull up that story it's talked about it it's Necker Island the one that he's owned for a while is gonna be reopened in a couple months oh so they redid it yeah it's like those Necker I don't like the way that it looks like niggardly people are saying don't use that word anymore because it sounds too much like that other way it does but it's not the same word I know it's knob but it's tricky it is tricky you have to every letter yeah Gerda Lina gergely yeah yeah yeah it's a problem you know it's weird when words are okay sometimes like pussycat yeah another yeah you sit right nothing is the game that is weird though right you can say pussycat yeah but if you say pussy one two three cat yeah that's like hey I don't like what you did there unless you named your cat pussy woo yeah I guess Octopussy remember that that was a big deal everybody's like oh yeah is this no I remember seeing that uh this is what I think with when we lived in New York it was a movie right yes yeah yeah seeing it like I was a kid and I remember seeing it like and I was like that's a bad word doing that was like oh they got a loophole in there yeah yeah some words that are like that well how about a dude named dick yeah I don't know what Jamie everyone deserves that name like I don't I don't know anyone I don't think I think that's like one of those older school ones like I feel like no one goes by if your name is Richard you go by Richard or rich now I don't think anybody's like yeah call me dick the way you know the weirdest one is Jack like if you're John your nicknames Jack wait no one's name is just Jack yeah my nephews name's Jack well who but John if you use John just call me Jack the nickname is Jack I never knew John like John Kennedy these calm Jack cannon oh yeah I did know that bad yeah his name was John that's so weird it's the same amount of letters stupid it doesn't make any sense are there any ones like that for girls well there's uh no no not that I can think of I can't think of one right there's no just name him Jack it's a completely different name it's a totally different name yeah it sounds different yeah yeah can we talk about since we're Tommen on the nickname thing so for you know we're not allowed to say tranny anymore right you just said it I know cuz I don't I personally don't find anything wrong with the word and now someone could very well say well you're not transgender Candace you're not bothered by it you know yes it doesn't affect you but I I don't know anyone that really used it in a derogatory way you know I you know it was just a word that we said to refer to this type of person but to me it sounds adorable like to me it's just the nickname for transgender just say tranny so like Jennifer you call somebody Jenny well there's a lot of policing of language as of late and it's ramped up because the Internet is people could complain more yeah but I think the problem is that it's not you're not putting any respect on that name is that what it is no one Birdman with the visit Charlemagne put some respect to my name it's respect respect respect my name apparently Charlemagne had been talking some shit about Birdman so bird may kill me with a giant crew was the whole conversation and Charlie was going okay [Laughter] yeah it's good stars over his head look crazy look that guy's guy maybe with my name I'm respected miss next I'm playing with my fucking name Audrey y'all stop playing with my name put some respect on my name I love beets man it was were you following the Drake and Pusha T I tried to not I tried to avoid it cuz Jamie brings these up he comes in - did you hear about chopping with Drake this turns out Drake has a kid with a porn star yeah yeah I get it all from Jamie Jamie's the gossip news he's the TMZ of this uh this studio it gives me so much life why do you love that just because I love I love her feelings man I love I do I knew when it's like celebrities oh I'm sorry of course them they can fuck them because all they're doing is bragging and talk about the money they have what if they're not braggy really what rapper is not bragging rapper yeah that's all yeah yeah that's what I'm talking right beeps yeah so if there's a beep between like Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansson would you like that I mean that also would be entertaining I would like to see one of them cry why do you like her feelings because we're all human we all get our feelings hurt okay and it's nice to bring you know humble people sometimes why go do you think if you're happier in your own life you wouldn't like hurt feelings as much we just you just talked about me being a very happy person happier I'm not saying you're totally a hundred percent fulfilled you were saying earlier that you can't find a good man yeah it doesn't mean I'm not fulfilled my vagina but the rest of me spiritually you're happy even without so you're so happy I've been single most of my life I believe it mean are you happy I've always said you're happy we just got done you how many years have I known you but nothing but friendly I mean what's to be mad about yeah I'm just a grateful person I wake up every morning and I'm like I'm just happy to be living this life it's a great life not living as stand-up comedian yeah it's about as good as it gets it well yeah that's what you want but even people who you know who don't do stand-up want to kind of be stand-ups they want to do I think so a lot of people do a lot of DJ's do radio DJs they're all secretly want to be comics they think they're hilarious there's a lot of them to do it secretly absolutely that you come in and do morning radio and like moon it's like the closest thing to it I think right yeah because what I'm trying to think of another profession which is like stand-up comedy where you can like tell jokes and people listen to you in the mass in the masses you know but I think yeah probably a radio DJ the closest thing to that some radio DJs that are dicks you know some of them they get kind of ego II I think that's what it really what it is they also want to keep you on your heels because they know that you could do their job but they can't do your job like you could just be a radio DJ that's a hard yeah we're kind of doing it now yeah we are doing you hosts a podcast yeah you know how to do it yeah you can easily take over some fucking radio show yeah tell that dude the ones it breaks in there tell that dude to go on yours 11:45 in the fucking ORF Joey Diaz pitch good luck good fucking luck yeah that's the I I find like with dudes just in general cuz it is mostly dudes I don't find women like competing with me to be funny most of the time that aren't comics but like even dudes who aren't comedians like if I go on a date with them or we're dating it's like they always try to like one-up me they tried to one-up you even though they know your comic yeah cuz dude you know dudes they always want to just be but you know the funny ones even if they're not comics they want to be the the funny one hmm and it's like you don't have to be in and if you're dating me like it doesn't that doesn't I don't need that it's always good to have a dude that can make me laugh but I don't expect that but could you deal with the dude that's not funny at all no no like no no he doesn't know I don't wanna do who has no sense of humor no no dude no humor at all but I would like a dude who could like who can riff with me but also not intimidated by me and doesn't feel like it'd be funnier then that's gonna be your problem forever what that well then I guess I'll just be single forever forever get a robot talking about making robot girls I'm gonna get a sex robot robot boyfriend yeah misses house I'll be good the fucking Hulk answers the door every time his eyes move fuck Candace what are you up to well he had couldn't save me the Hulk will he fucks me then he stays outside looks out for penny Tom stands guard outside my window oh I want to have women are gonna get that because I know guys gonna get that a hundred percent did you see ex machina I loved it loved it my favorite movies ever you know I watch it every every minute I can yeah I watched that movie at least three times yeah but that scene like when that guy like had those girls there were his girlfriends you know like the Japanese lady was dancing but that was my favorite scene yeah that is a hundred percent gonna happen that there's no way that's not gonna happen of course it's gonna happen hundred percent y'all don't want to talk to women why do you bite lump me in with all those other dudes not you not you I mean you're look at you you talking to a woman right now yep I'm that I just realized I'm saw because you know I be watching the podcast and so you had a another black Candice on not too long Oh Candice Owens yeah I'm the one that's not in the sunken place sunk in place what's the sunken haven't seen that yet yet what are you waiting for is not in theaters anymore most movies I don't watch on the theaters most movies oh yeah you're a celebrity you can't go to the movies do you yes then why'd you say you just can't you said you can't go to the movie I can't go to all of them that was a really good one you should have gone if I go to one movie a month it's a lot so I miss a lot of movies okay I go to little kids movies I have kids no I go to see The Incredibles do you see The Incredibles not yet it's really good I heard it's really good ice better than the first one is it yeah it's really good I wanted to see that the other night but I got talked into going to see I call it black purge it's called the first purge you saw did you see the original / yes well now there's a there's a black one through it and it's supposed to be the first purge then it tells the origin of how the purge system started in America and it's with black people hmm didn't enjoy it I enjoy it I enjoy it for many reasons there was acting problems I felt it there was acting problems I don't know the names of the people that I felt the acting bothered me but I didn't enjoy that the story I just felt like it's one of those ones which like the premise is really good but it's just not executed well like the idea but like oh shit I want to see that then you go see it it was a very it was a letdown so Candice Owens is in the dark place place so you mean how so she's a black chick who's like taping for Trump yeah what is caping like rooting for on his I've never heard that term supporting yeah yeah so I can't I mean by nature I don't understand that and she's a woman she's a black woman you don't understand it no I don't what is there to understand like someone you're a womanizer who has been also accused of rape on numerous occasions also been you know has a history of racism from his family like his father his father you said in his apartments used to deny renting apartments to brown and black people so like that he was raised with that so like and you know calling Mexicans rapists like I can't there's no explanation for a supporting yeah I think that's a wrong woman she found the niche she did I think that's exactly what it is I think that I don't even think necessarily she believes what she says like I think that she was like oh this is a way for me to get famous because they're how many black she's you know she is she's like the brand-new Omarosa she's like she's like new Omarosa I had Omarosa was on fear factor back in the day she was she's crazy she kills me being drunk yeah I was talking to her well she didn't make any sense and so as I said I don't understand what you're saying she was Joey you drunk and I go no she'll I smell liquor on your breath ago no you don't I'm not drunk I was high as fuck but I wasn't drunk that's so bizarre you know I think she just was like all morose is out of the picture I'm a step up you think so she could be honestly have we ever seen Tommy Lehren and her in the same room because I think she could be Tommy wearing in blackface Wow that's how I feels rough I mean I think she needs more than blackface I mean you need to change your nose a little bit there's more there's a couple of those girls that are like interchangeable like there's Lauren southern and Tommy Lehren I always get them confused oh yeah yeah you're right I don't even honestly don't even know Lauren looks like they look similar though blonde hair they're both cute blonde conservatives there's a market for that of course there is cuz that's not the norm anything that's outside the no one's gonna stick out and gonna be like oh this is trendy now like this is what are this is what our party now is represented by which is you know that and they're expecting that they're gonna attract like that young younger demographic the Millennials and it is I mean it is working somewhat well it's definitely getting there some attention I know it's hard to tell what someone really believes and what they want you to right hard to tell like global warming doesn't exist Wow that one see what that is to me when she said that that's indicative of someone who's trying to follow a line like there's a line that you're supposed to follow if you are a hardcore Republican supporter and it's like industry is good big business is good regulation is bad right you know and then the big one is the global warming's of hopes for at least global warming is something that's greatly exaggerated by these environmentalists in order to fund Al Gore's blah blah blah blah you know go down these lines where everybody on the Left please one thing and everybody know there's like certain things where you have to believe you're on the right absolutely you have to believe here on the left even if it makes you sound batshit crazy like denying facts there's a few of those like if you're right-wing you have to be pro-life pretty much very few right-wing people that are pro-abortion which is why isn't that what's right isn't that what happened with Tommy Lehren though died didn't she lose she lost some contracts she had him even with Fox I don't remember but because she came out of saying she was pro-choice yeah so yeah that was the and she suffered it's interesting when it happens like you're not allowed to have varying opinions or you know you know it's like an almost cult-like it's very cold like it's it's definitely a tribe I mean that's that's what happens I haven't watched that my wife's obsessed it's there's a new episode that comes out today I got to watch it but now it's one episode I was like this is just too fucked up it's too real in hell it's too real you see the parallels like though the kids getting separated from their moms and it's just like this is literally happening right now it's terrifying yeah that to me is one of the darker moments of this this era this the knowledge that thousands of kids get separated from their parents as they cross the border like what what the fuck are we doing like what and I know there's no excuses a lot of people I I mean there's a video that I made was just a rant on the podcast about it with my friend Duncan you know Duncan Trussell we've met only a couple times but I don't know him very well but everyone loves him so we did this rant or I just ran about it and it got made into a video and then all these people are like you know you don't understand the real issue on the border and if the real issue on the border separating parents when they're kids that's not the real issue idiot right supposed to be keeping criminals out you think that lady and her baby are criminals and it's just you imagine I mean people can't imagine what it'd be like to live in Mexico right next to United States right it's right right there you just walk over there and get a job you're right there Mia over here you're for a better life right over here your cousin got killed by the cartel for looking at somebody wrong at a taco stand you know and then you just and nobody nobody ever goes to jail for it do you know how many fuckin politicians they killed in Mexico this year you know that number somebody was just telling me yeah it's more it's more than 100 this year politicians murdered in Mexico that's the go-to place if you're gonna murder somebody right like it's right there and it's and they never investigate anything don't you oh fuck yeah here what's the number Jim 132 politicians killed this year 132 how do we know this Mexico goes to the polls this weekend 132 politicians have been killed since campaigning began fuck that is crazy record violence that's all because of us this is all because of the drug war if we just made drugs legal there would be none of this going on yeah this is worse than like when Pablo Escobar was out well Pablo Escobar it's a very similar situation yeah it's all fueled by drug money yeah all this is drug money I mean when you make drugs illegal only criminals are selling drugs and there's massive amounts of money because people love that cocaine have you ever tried cocaine never never mean II am ever I've tried you know I won't that's one I won't try like I prefer like I've done shrooms and weed and that's it how often did the shrooms not often how often you do weed I don't even like the only weed that I have is given to me like you know when I'll do like when I'll judge rows battle they pay you and weed they're like here the bag of weed and then it takes me like years to go through it that's how that's how infrequently like I'll smoke when I'm with like friends but I'm not I don't drink by myself and I don't like when I go home like I've had of liquor a vodka that's been in my freezer over a year now as you're healthy I'm very healthy to you I'm very healthy when you smoke weed you ever get paranoid this one time I didn't edible I ate too much so you know Jamar neighbors sure very twenty comic he gave me an edible one time and this was before like anybody could just walk into a dispensary like us now you just have to show your ID and you can get anything from the dispensary this is when you had have a card so he went in and got it for me and it was this lemon bar that said award-winning on it and me being the weed novice I was like oh this is gonna be award-winning because of the taste right it's like probably I was like a Paula Deen recipe and so I ate like half of it and I was by myself and I woke up I was laying down and I was in my bed and I sat up and I said am I talking to myself I'm not talking to myself oh my god I am talking to myself I'm not talking to myself I and I was saying this out loud I went on my phone to get on Twitter to see the make sure the world was still happening cuz I was like I felt like I was in some weird Twilight Zone yeah it was awful so I got on there and then I made my I forced myself to go to sleep because I was like I can't be awake like this so I forced myself to go to sleep I woke up the next morning I was still high for like five more hours [Laughter] [Music] yeah I gave my friend an edible and he called me up a day later said I'm still high a day if you don't know what you're doing with it because I had a conversation with someone else the other day they were like I ate they I ate for rice krispie treats and I was like why would you eat four of them he had he called the cops and then checked himself went to a hospital because he thought he was dying do you ever see the one where as a 911 call the cops took weed from these people they pulled them over and then the cops used the weed to make pop brownies and then they ate the pot brownies no when they called 911 on themselves they called for an ambulance they said they were dying please send help times moving very slowly but what's hilarious is it's a fucking 9-1-1 call from a cop from a cop and the cop is calling to get an ambulance can you say the time is moving slowly and they stole the weed for these fucking kids they pulled over the whole thing is just it's brilliant it's so funny oh it's Brad's man it's one of my all-time favorite 9-1-1 calls because it's just so you can you can you please send help times moving very slowly gonna play it article about it the cop had dirt he resigned before he got in trouble for he resigned taking the weed and be using it so he quit yeah that's probably good you're kind of at that point you kind of have to yeah he called 911 were talking about in a podcast years later everybody's heard that yeah I did it you never that fucking I guarantee the video has probably been played a million times easily more than a million do you have a Jamie yeah I just found a shorter version okay listen this poor fucked just think about this to save I think we're dying see pot is something that even when you're having an overdose people laugh at you because nobody knows know whatever dies and she's on the news those are the stiffest fucking people on the planet you ever made a real newscaster in real life um once they walk around like this once you walk around like robe like robots yeah they're like hello how are you oh that's great that's wonderful didn't they're always scared to say something wrong it's interesting like cuz it's we're all kind of in the you know that's considered entertainment you know they're on television they're you know not camera they're not entertainers they're just readers is that what it is like people who don't have enough personality they have zero personality that's the whole thing if you have any personality they kick you off the air yeah the only thing you can have is you could be one of those weather girls with a big ass I didn't know I didn't notice they got fat boobs too it's not just that several I noticed that that was the first thing I moved out to LA that was one of the first thing I think I noticed with the LA weather people or the weather women I was like they are hot hottest back in Cincinnati yeah yeah high heels in short skirts yeah talking about tornadoes and shit taking their ass out point to weather patterns yeah this one I think it's South America there's one famous lady she's like a famous weather cast she's like one of the hottest women on the planet tiny little waist giant ass big tits she wears a waist trainer yeah because I hate waist trainers Bobby Lee bought me one by your waist training you know he takes me on the road with him sometimes and when one time we were in like a CBS and I jokingly picked it up and I was like Bobby buy me this and he did and it was like no but no there I still have it I never tried it but they're terrifying they like their corsets they're you know I've read articles that you see and I supposed to wear these things cuz it binds it's bad for your organs it moves or your organs around the Kardashians wear them but yeah yes so that's what I'm like I'm not gonna be happy and promote that for women hurting ourselves so that's good yes what's weird they have a thick waist then have a kidney in my neck like a farmworker waist yeah well calm down hey I do have I haven't I'm like an athletic build so I don't have a tiny waist so bother you no it doesn't bother me I like my body you should it looks great you look great thanks Jesus the conversation I never get into it guys I like my body why dude you look good you tell me you like my body job row I look good broke down am i ok I got kind of a thick waist oh don't do I broke I'm allowed to say have a thick waist you're not drunk enough thick thighs thick ass but even so like women we can say that and we know that men some men or a lot of men like it but being called thick does inept never makes us feel good about her selves even if even if we know that men like it it still makes it the back of our head we're like does he mean I'm fat what's all this we shit there's guaranteed this girl's nothing like being thick yeah of course being called Turk of course of course are you saying we but a lot of women conversations with other women that have been like oh look I used to be when I was in high school I was probably 20 25 pounds heavier than what I am right now lots of carbs lots of carbs lot I didn't know how to eat properly because so there was a whole loaf at craze you remember this yes when snack wells was popping remember that and they they were like no no fat high fat is bad so they started doing low fat everything but then they replaced that with sugar so it would taste palatable you know because if you take the fat out the flavors going so like how we get the flavor back so they put a bunch of sugar and stuff so you're eating like thinking oh it's a little fat I would come home and eat like a bag of like low-fat pretzels things like a bag of those Snyder's of Hanover that's a bag of those big ones and be like why am i gaining weight because I didn't know I thought low fat man oh I would it's low-fat no-fat there's so much of that there's so many of those low fat items is way worse for you yeah I don't even mean are people I don't even think that's a thing now it's gluten-free gluten-free is what's what's popular gluten-free and what's the other thing I can't think there's another thing that's kind of trending right now but it's not it's not just gluten ketogenic diets is that were you talking about no I don't know what I'm thinking about I literally had a brain fart but there is something else maybe a trio a new trendy thing yeah but it's all like nobody knows what the repercussions of any of these things are like paleo might be good for temporary but in the long term we don't know the damage is gonna be doing well paleo is real simple it's not gonna do any damage paleo is just real food paleo just means no grain and no rice that's all means there's just no preservatives no artificial flavors no artificial colors just meat chicken fish vegetables meat chicken fish vegetables there's nothing wrong with that there's not you don't have to worry about that right trend right like this is gonna be able to go like the low-fat trend the normal thing for people to eat you said fruits too they can do fruits yeah okay yeah any fruits look there's people that eat carnivore diet this is the more most recent one where they only eat meat that's it no no no that's not good how do you know that's not good I have a friend with pretty severe autoimmune disease yeah and it's gone because of eating only carnivore diet his daughter had her hip replaced and her ankle replaced she has terrible arthritis with carnivore diet gone some people have really adverse reaction to carbohydrates no fruits and vegetables nope nope he's not eating anything and he's been doing he's a professor mmm yeah brilliant guy what's his cholesterol look like that's the thing see you people say things like that I think you just said that that's not where cholesterol comes from dietary cholesterol doesn't have any impact on blood lipids it doesn't have any impact on your blood cholesterol this is where cholesterol is bad when you have cholesterol and high carbohydrates because when your body is burning a lot of carbohydrates your body is in fat storing mode so if you eat a bunch of fat and carbohydrates you asking my fat as fuck right but if you do just that but if you eat just the fat fat then your body loses weight believe it or not you actually get slim yeah now I know about that part but I didn't know the cholesterol part yeah you're not if you are this is one of the important thing for people if you are on a high fat low carb diet you cannot eat large amounts of carbohydrates because if you do it's just gonna go right to fat because your your body just is not your buddies what's gonna burn the carbohydrates and it's gonna take all the fat you take in and just store it so you're just gonna get fat as fuck well with all this body positivity that's how do you know that's not what I want that you don't want to get fat do you think so I can be body positive body positive is that what that is it's just embracing the fatness it's literally just being like if you're fat love your body and that's fine like you can be fat and love your body but it's also promoting you know unhealthy behaviors I think also and we need to distinguish between the two well we want to give people a free pass by saying be body positive don't don't don't fat shame right like leave people be I have a black belt in fat shaming are you gonna [Music] you know you do Taekwondo yeah I do bad shape no go to a dojo fat stinky armpits it used to be easy to fat shame now people are super upset about it yeah no I know I'm not sure he's right you know II not well it's not right but all I mean you should make fun of somebody for the way they look you know I don't think that's you shouldn't write but but we shouldn't be promoting an unhealthy lifestyle that too and also like Tom Segura said that like people making fun of his weight is the reason why he lost weight he's like fat shaming was very effective on me yeah he lost the weight because people were fat shaming him yeah a lot of behaviors a lot of behaviors are because you felt shame and we're NASA site there's no shame anymore with anything I know I know people that are like proud of their alcoholism yeah I've heard people bragging about DUIs what I'm not kidding hanging around the wrong people I they're not my friends okay I guess I've heard it so do you think that's an escape clause like they're just like they're giving themselves an out like I love being an alcoholic fuck it yeah I think to them it's because of we're accepting everything now that it's just like it's it's a it's just fun behavior like I'm fun when I'm drunk and it's just and that's fine you can be fun but also you know there's oberst take a lift why are you driving that's the problem yeah especially today there's no excuse for that especially in Hollywood I mean that fucking comedy store parking lot you can't get out of it because it's always jammed up the lifts and ubers yep which is great but also is annoying it's annoying it's a night but it's great that people take to have somebody drive them around right still the whole thing about ubers is like how much background check are they doing on those freaks yeah no I'm positive I've gotten in a lyft driver who's over driver cuz I don't i don't i used to do Luber and then but they suck so i started you doing lifts but yeah I'm sure I got an uber at one point where somebody was drunker than a quest maybe let me get this yeah they're not checking them right no not at all not at all I just I don't know I feel like being cuz you don't drink at all do you okay you do okay I just feel like I have such a non-addictive personality and I feel that most people are addicted to things mmm and that's why it's also tough for me like dating also it's because I know I'd see I know that a lot of people that I have you know been on dates with or whatever's like oh this lifestyle is not conducive to what I'm trying to do so we just don't click on that way because you find you go on dates with guys are getting fucked up a lot yeah a lot a lot a lot so weekend nights yeah weeknights yeah why am I not drunk yet right yeah so yeah I actually the last app that I got on was like a it's a it's called meet mindful because I wanted to like find people who were yeah somebody who is just more present and maybe likes themself a little bit more so then I did get drunk all the time to be with themselves yeah how'd that work out well they were like you got to pay $30 a month I'm looking for love right now I paid I paid before for like eHarmony that's what I paid for that one I paid him with $200 for that one how would that work out terribly and that's why I'm hesitant to pay again cuz I got nothing i got literally nothing from that so i'm like any sense I thought harmony like instantly find the love of your dreams then you sit down with him on the couch they do a video with you Joe I knew that as soon as I met Candice she was the one I was on there for over a year what I called customer service and complained what'd you say where's my deck you promised me dick by month 3 well I get a refund you know I called and I said I would like a refund she was like why and I said these dudes are like fours like all of them and below they were just all of them were like the worst looking people I had ever seen and she was like me have so many messages that you haven't responded to I said did you not hear my first complaint like I'm not gonna respond to any of these dudes they were terrible looking and not just it's not just like physically but just like the photos like terrifying looking like serial killers like don't know it's like just a foreheads picture properly the dating app world's got to be fucking weird I'm so lucky I know several people that are in the dating app world if so tell me about it they're swiping right all the time swipe and laptop oh it's awful which one you swipe right if you like them which one do you say swipe white right mother how dare you where I was swiping white it didn't work out no I've only I've dated a couple of white dudes in my life barely barely yeah I'm just one of them I think was gay and I think so out of your study group white people are gay and pathological liars yes there's nothing else not me to exclusive you could be gay and a pathological liar yeah I'm sure it's possible yeah you have that combination Joe set me up with one of your friends okay I'll try to find somebody for you serious yeah I'll try to find somebody yeah yeah why we saying it not another like mmm a person oh you don't want to welcome I don't think I could handle that well it's a lot of muscles you know like muscles not that much okay like what do you want you want to do the work so like once a week twice maybe twice twice but doesn't go crazy crazy yeah no one who gets up in the morning and runs early I'll be meditating while he's running running running so that's fine that'll work out yeah yeah but I don't want someone who like might be on steroids Oh might be might be might be okay I'll keep it in mind it's got to be hard like when you fill out one of them er many things what do you have to write you write what your occupation is what you're looking for what do you write what you looking for do you ever write I'm just looking for dick no do you write I'm looking for a meaningful relationship with the person of my dreams women already have to swat the dicks away without writing I'm looking for dick SWAT Dixie walk outside hey six No so yeah no you can't write that and if we wanted that I'd be on tinder you know I was tended to move you would just want some dick you're so lucky you don't know about any of this tinder is the dick app that's it so if you just want some dick yeah times way to go and even bumble is kind of turning into that do you think that I don't know bumble is a new one it not new anymore a newer one is coffee meets bagel I was on that one for a minute I was reading this thing that said that there's a spray this was it made me angry it said is tinder and Grindr are they responsible in any way for the spread of STDs from their apps of course no they don't stick in their dicks neat absolutely like they're not they're not they shouldn't be sued like that's ridiculous but they're saying actually should they take responsibility take responsibility no but I guarantee that more people are hooking up because of this things right these these apps right it's ten doing it unsafely so what it's not any skin off their back no no no I know I'm just it's a weird time we're like people getting in trouble for things that other people are doing yeah absolutely you want people to be response no one's taking personal responsibility for their own mistakes well yeah put a condom on what are you talking when you yeah yeah I've heard stories about like hey dudes man they're so trifling look my friend a gay dude was telling me about what the behavior and gay and gay Jim's how like they have in the shower there's a signal so that if you if you want somebody to come up in there and just Ram you and at home yeah you leave the curtain partially open and that's kind of like a signal to be like okay if you want to come up in here and get some you can and I was like what if you didn't know that rule and you accidentally leave the curtain open just because you didn't close it properly and all of a sudden some dude well every time I've been in gyms around gay people or get I used to belong to Gold's Gym on call it's in you know in West Hollywood and that's where we used to film Newsradio right down the street oh yeah so that was the gym that I worked out it's a gay disco that Jim is a goddamn gay disco and when I would go there nothing anything wrong with that but when I would go there it was you'd get that feeling that a girl gets all the time terrified well yeah all these eyes on me I'm gonna try to fuck you I'm safe right now yeah it's a different feel like girls hitting on you is like if you want you can come over here guys had no use like if you want to come over there it's a different feeling sounded like Michael Jackson right there today Michael Jackson when he's not using this falsetto boys but it's an uncomfortable feeling knowing that guys want to fuck you like I couldn't man being a girl just trying to navigate my way through dudes it's terrifying swatting dicks away swattin platinum ya know crack Kevin peeping toms at your windows it's a scary world out there so your neighbor when they found that guy was he hot oh no I don't know what he's hot he said I'm sorry you gonna be at my window hey girl I'm sorry I came home from the club I was a little drunk I've always had this thing for you I can't believe I was whisperin hate your pussy it's disrespectful I apologize you like me to take you out to a drip for drinks and just we'll make up to you I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry well you know you put it like that Who am I to turn down here's my eHarmony profile I don't know the terrifying part is that I don't know who it was and it could have been it could be someone I know and even the way my neighbors described him was that it actually the way they described him did describe someone that I know and consider a friend oh but then when I showed my neighbor the picture of the person I was talking about they were like no I don't think that's him but still now in the back of my head I'm like what if it was so now my friendship with this person has been a little strained because of XM I'll trust you whoa I know it's weird that is word that's the life of a girl women have to worry about shit the guys don't have to worry about I know so many things yeah there are no girls outside your window whispering good well they are but it's because you dated them before and you wronged them and you cheated on them or did something and now she's stalking you or you found out they're crazy and then yeah you live now yeah I love I'm very interested in all of like like relationship behavior and like crimes of passion I like all of it I'm very into it like those Andy shows yeah you're like snapped on oxygen and you're seeing that it's able snap yes mostly women it's mostly women sometimes this is a man's oxygen it is that's the that's the women channel absolutely yeah lifetime why is oxygen a woman's channel oxygens like air yeah everybody needs that I don't know but yeah we were I was watching a snaps I watched it not so much anymore but it's been on for a long time but every episode is like a different couple and the woman is just like can't put up with the the shit anymore like her dudes cheating on her or like taking her money or abusing her whatever and then she snaps and she kills him well you always is always a spoiler alert what for every show yeah you know where it's gonna be you know she just couldn't take it any loss in the title do you wonder what she's gonna snap that's my only thing I don't want to be a victim of a crime of passion mmm just don't you you know just break up with me you don't have to kill me yeah I hear you that's a reasonable request what's the craziest thing what's the craziest thing a girlfriend has ever done to you um have you gotten your car keyed before No No I've been pretty good at navigating those waters I've got it got pretty good crazy radar oh yeah the problem is when they're really hot and they're really hot they're all so crazy like damn this might be worth the rest that's usually what I guess I don't know if you've seen this it was on e it was a YouTube clip and the guy drew a chart and it was like a chart of crazy to hotness yeah and it's it's like all the hot chicks are always crazy and says you have to in basically tells you in what range you have to find the normal woman my friend my friend Tony Zahra has it best he's got he said that there's like erotic and neurotic and they cross over like a Venn diagram to hit this they had this cross over there they're like they're two interchangeable things yeah completely closely related psychotic neurotic and erotic altogether and if you get the really erotic women they're almost always psychotic or neurotic or crazy this is something wrong yeah yeah red flag the really fun ones yeah just the ones that really want to rock your world they're yeah they're crazy I've heard that and so if you're wondering about I'm very normal again my parents love me which means I don't do anal good point that is a weird thing right if your parents love you too much you might not be as ambitious I mean that is true like I wish I told her like I think I'm definitely ambitious like I'm definitely you know I've been doing this for like like 10 years now and it's like I have come so far so it's like ya know I definitely have goals and I'm cheating them but it's also I'm also not like we talked about earlier like the the CEOs of these corporations like I don't have that kind of drive like I just want to do what I love and make good money doing it for 10 years mhm yeah where'd you start here at the store not store but like in LA I started the first place I got up you know doing open mics and stuff but I did want to go to the store at first cuz I was like I don't want to go there if I'm not funny yet right then who knows gonna see me and they're like oh she's not funny when'd you get past the store like December of 2014 so almost 2015 no so that was right when I came back yes it was right when you came back because that was right I was the first me and Earl Skakel were the first people to Adam past when he got promoted to that position Wow yeah cuz yeah I don't know if Tommy was ever gonna pass me I don't know I know Sal so when yeah when I came back that I got to see like the whole new crop there was a whole new crop of people in the seven years and I was gone was it seven years yeah I was gone for seven years I thought I'd be gone forever if Adam vomiting it fired and as their wedding over I was still been which is that was the dumbest thing well miss decision for me it was a good decision it was good it was healthy to get away from the store for a little bit yeah sort of changed my comedy made a little less evil the energy has changed since taking over it's a completely different place it's a different place without Tommy it's a different place just because of the vibe of the Comedy Store is now also fortified by the internet it's like people who love the place because this is iconic historical landmark it's like the mecca of comedy yeah it really is the master club in the country now it's the real Mecca yeah when I was a kid when I was first starting now I had heard about The Comedy Store you know because Sam Kinison started out there Richard Pryor was always there and I like that was the place I needed to go to the Comedy Store yeah when I came out here I was already on a sitcom and I didn't get passed at the store I was a non-paid regular so I was out able to go on at the end of the shows when I first got here look when I got passed as a paid regular it was like the happiest moment of my life I was like holy shit I'm a paid regular at The Comedy Store like that to me was bigger than being on a television show no I know I'm here but back then The Comedy Store was a ghost town yeah it was deserted there was no one there you'd go on a Friday to be 30 people in the audience it was just gross and there was a lot of boat act still floating around yeah yeah it's like something happened between in the Kinison age right Kennison age was like 84 to 87 88 and in that time that guy was just running rampant and destroying and he was a maniac I mean he was the top of the world and then he dropped off and then he died and then when he died that place was a ghost town so when I came along right after he died I came along in 94 and that there was no one there so went from being this jam-packed Auto is here like all these celebrities come to see Kinison do spots late at night it'd be like whoa that must been nuts yeah John Belushi be there and Jack Nicholson and all these different people and then you go there I don't know if it's John Belushi you're probably dead by then when the John Belushi died he died in 880 - yeah he died earlier than that yeah I'm shipping said John Belushi I might have made that up but I know Jack Nicholson a bunch of other celebrities OC Kinnison and I remember thinking man nobody famous comes here now yes please a shithole yes like there's nobody there but it's different now no it's amazing now no it's every show sold out every show every show it's nuts last time was crazy yeah no I was thinking about the other day was like I'm like what a time firts for me to be like a regular at the store like it just happened at the perfect time like it just cuz I know so many people that like weird or guys back when like and I've heard stories like Bobby would tell me stories from when he used to work there and like Freddie Lockhart when they were like door guys and I'm like wow that sounds so shitty and like they were getting paid they're getting paid like $25 for the day awful yeah I met Bobby was a door guy at the La Jolla store yeah yeah yeah when I met Bobby he's like 1984 some chili we went to a strip club and he almost got killed what yeah I mean that sounds about right he was hitting on some girl and apparently she was she was the money selling Mexican gangbanger this guy who had long black hair and tattoos on his face and the 90s in the 90s he had tattoos on his face wasn't even popular band then I the guy he was looking over at me and they're talking to his friends like oh we are

manifesting how can you just please get someone in your life that you need in your life every time I think of your name I think of Tyrone [Laughter] rocks I think that was my first why me I knew you from Fear Factor but I also that was a huge you know for me before I even knew I'd be doing stand-up I'm watching this Chappelle show and I just remember I it makes me laugh so much my feet are strong how's a great character I like have tried to do crack impressions like crack head impressions for jokes before and I can't because every time I try to do a crate and a no crackhead impressions like just from my own you know inspiration and from watching like other like real crackheads I can't do it I because the default crackhead is now Tyrone Biggums and it just and I'm like I can't do it because I can't do Tyrone Biggums oh there's certain people that create characters that forever they're iconic yeah that would that that's the crackhead for the rest of for the rest of time yeah that show was only two seasons that's what's up and that it was 15 years ago and even more amazing than he just said fuck it and left and left yeah sorry gotta go yeah I mean I get it though I get it I get it I was on it I was on Comedy Central at the time and I saw like the management and how was working there it was chaos and whenever you tell people that aren't funny that are executives tell them to manage funny I don't know what the fuck they're doing they have no idea let Dave Chappelle be Dave hey pal trust me he's gonna make the most funny and let him and Neal Brennan go figure out what they're doing and just get out of the way get out of the way and put ads on it yeah and you saw the success of what had happened with what they did with that control yeah you know they try to do a bunch of shit with him they tried first of all they try to get him to change his language stop using the n-word they want him to stop using because they would get more ads yeah it was all about people not comfortable with advertising with certain kind of sketches so they wanted to maximize their profits but so toned down the show a little maximize their profits and Dave was like I see where this is going yeah ya know lose complete control he just quit yeah imagine the executives when they found that he was really quitting he says he's just joshing just bluffing yeah he's right he doesn't like the way you guys are shaping the show so he's gonna quit and he's in Africa now by clique but we were just gonna make 180 million dollars but we were just gonna make honored now Dave you guys blew it you know people don't remember but for a while Dave was doing shows and he wasn't getting paid he wouldn't do shows where he got paid he would show up in the park he showed up in Seattle it was like a big deal he put up a speaker he put up his own PA system and started doing stand-up in the park and a crowd gathered around of course and that's what he would do he would just show up places to start doing stand-up that's crazy that's what he did you know when I met Dave I met David he's like I was 21 he was like 18 something like that or maybe maybe I was a little older you know I was like 24 and he was 18 and he was he would do like he would do shows outside like we would do a gig we did a gig of Montreal and then after we did the gig of Montreal we came downstairs outside of club soda and he just started doing stand-up on the street he goes ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen gather round I got some shit to tell you and then he would start doing stand-up on the street and he learned it from Charlie Burnett Charlie Barnet who was uh he was like an old school New York character who did a lot of street comedy didn't we have a video of Charlie Barnet as there's one on line he would do it yeah like this would he would do Charlie Barnet would do comedy like this like he got these giant crowds and would walk around like a park and get everybody gather round and he was such a showman that people would just sit and wait and they'd let you stand down here it is in Washington Square Park it's insane I mean look we got we got white folks we got black folks we got porter Regan's porter Regan's porter Regan we got a lot of fucking Puerto Ricans but I'm not gonna fuck with your trinkets man cause y'all born with knives he would do this this is how he would do Stan anyway yell it out in the park I got a chance to see him a couple he died of AIDS Oh like somewhere I think it was in the early nineties he died but I got to see him that's when people were dying of AIDS yeah back back when AIDS would kill you ya know it's like the flu yeah everybody yeah don't worry I've got AIDS leukemia yeah there's even a medication for that bro but Charlie Barnet influenced Dave and Dave would do that kind of stand-up you know Dave would just do stand-up in front of a club he would just just get and people just gather around and watch them and I remember thinking like wow not really me I could never do that but man that kind of detachment to be able to just just be free in front of a crowd like that yeah it's powerful and you know we've performed in all different types of really terrible places you know when you're coming up and you're just doing open mics and bars and like coffee shops or whatever and I still to this day roll my eyes when someone it's an outdoor venue because it's just like you know there's nothing to interrupt right so like the the laughs just get lost yeah they just disappear into the ether arenas too and you do stand-up in an arena so my vision board though is what's on your vision board it's weird besides dick that's weird you got anything crazy in your vision board you got a private jet on your vision board is that crazy do you have one it's actually not on my vision board but I do visualize it do you I do visualize visualize do you visualize meditate do you visualize you strolling with a tiny bag with a dog in it and you got a cigarette holder glasses just like like on arrest no skirt like oh oh where's my seat where's my seat I want it to be bitch this is my plane my dog shit on the floor motherfucker no my private jet is gonna be much more basic than that you know I just want a plain work like I I can like fart freely and not have to worry about other people one time I held a fart from Cincinnati to Los Angeles that's very polite of you I know thank you especially on a plane a lot of people are sneaky on fly no but I was like I can't do this to anybody and I for you thank you very considerate person but if it was your plane let him loose what if it was your plane and you had a stewardess still let it loose its flight attendants Oh what's the difference cuz you can't they change it to fight attending because they have male flight attendants because you can't call a male stewardess do they really have malfoy the time they're more feminine than me but yes there's still man I went to the dentist today and I had a figure fill out oh em gee were so alike I had a fill out this form and in the form it said sex it said male or female I was like where's the other yeah where's other bitch whereas where's kins where's other Kansans other kids yeah you don't know about other candies people to think they're a fox they identify with foxes like I'm like an elf can now people think they're fairies what I'm a wood elf hmm no other can people think that there's something there's supposed to be something else there like a person but really they're an animal that's trapped in a person's body no that is crazy are they here we go this lady when people ask me how does it feel to be a cat I'm like how does it feel to be a human oh that's rational whoever you or your dad is hey dude who's her dad fuck you look at you did the world you asshole you let this girl loose and think she's a cat yeah no that's that's when you have a that's a that's definitely a mental mm-hmm uh-huh for sure like Rachel Dolezal yeah oh I'm obsessed was born I wanted to why I'm so glad she's going crazy she owes money she's in debt and she's got kids I feel bad for the kids yeah but who was this dude that she's with who was it dude that she just had a baby not that long ago sometime works pussy see yeah I'll just get on my nerves yes we all the same because you just have sex with anything well it's it's or nothing that dude could have got it from somewhere else really if you fucked her could he have really did you ever pick of the litter dudes who are unattractive poor sleeping on someone else's couch and they're still getting vagina so yes well they must be good talker yeah women are don't have standards anymore you do I do you know what my parents loved me the name of my first special book this book will not be that good because my parents love me funny because my parents loved me let's finish everything with my paper because my parents love me but you are very funny so that didn't work we know what you're not you know you're not you're not crazy like ambitious to the point where you're willing to step walk on people's back cut people because my parents loved me that's what that that's where that comes from you know that narcissistic personality disorder sociopathy comes from some type of neglect or abuse in childhood yes so and we do in this industry attracts a lot of that you know people attention starved and they just want Fame so you have the people who there's two types of people in industry you got the people who really just love the craft of it they really are great actors or great comics writers and then you have the kind that just want to be famous who don't give a crap about you know what it takes actually you know I'll hone that skill and become the best at that they just and some of them pretend to be the other thing absolutely yeah absolutely yeah we're just weird I mean it's crazy people everywhere yeah you some of them like pretend to be comics like they pretend to be interested in the craft of comedy I know and you know what when it gets really weird when they become famous and then you see it happens you see that they don't this is an actor they were acting like you're a comedian yeah that's not they're not really yeah but then we let them get stage time yeah no I know but it's frustrating so why did you get into it I have I believe my pain when I was a kid was just feeling like I didn't fit in like out there when you were telling me you're not black like that was my pain because I am black and so I grew up feeling like I didn't fit in anywhere well you are at you are a certain percentage African my parents are black and so someone was white well yeah but there's mixes there's black Native American and there's white but yeah if you saw my family you'd be like there's no white people in this family if you saw my family be like somebody somewhere a long long black a chimp a chimp somebody fucked a chimp when they shouldn't know you know I think this is what I think about my family you see allottee in your just Italians in general I feel like you know people evolved from apes I don't believe that you don't believe that I think somewhere along the line somebody went back when they shouldn't know she wasn't talking back to me she never burned me mmm she was warm to cuddle with in the winter months yeah well everyone's African yes a single human if you trace them all the way back that's really that 23andme shit I just did it you know what they say I don't know I'm waiting have to wait a couple more weeks very excited it sounds scared oh now what could it be I'm mostly I'm supposed to be mostly Italian and I have 1/4 Irish in me that's what it's supposed to be right let's see if anybody was sneaking around [Music] maybe a German got in the mix or an African Moroccan or who knows you know those who got in the mix back in the day hilarious you know I'm - I don't think I'm gonna do one of those I don't want one I don't want to know if I find out I'm whiter than I am I'll just walk into traffic well you're pretty you're your skin's lighter than mine no I know but so what like okay defensive it's crazy because like you have like me and my sister we were from the same parents but she had a completely different childhood than me cuz no one ever questioned she never got her hair pulled by like darker skin black girls whereas I did why why did she not get her hair she's darker than me and her hair is kinkier so just she just came out different she came out Brown mmm so yeah so we had to complete so that's where that's where my pain came from is like I felt like I didn't fit in right you know so I felt like so your comedy is sort of like you had like a personality that was kind of compensating for not fitting in yeah I started being funny because I felt like that could distract people from like I want them to like me and accept me so the one thing that everyone can you know agree on is that we like jokes something like laughing so I became like a class clown and just would I was like oh people like me now and I don't have to worry about them wondering what I am and trying to put me in a box is like I'm the funny one that's all that matter yeah interesting mm-hmm pain is not like a you know there's mild pain it's a mile past that's exactly how I described because a lot of comics are like oh molested by my father somebody and it's like oh that's awful I'm sorry to hear that but that makes sense well yeah people always come to me and they're like you don't have you're not addicted to anything like you know any vices and you weren't like touched by an uncle so like why are you funny and I was like well that's that was that's why I got funny she was mild you when you first got on stage were you working what we doing for a living yes I first got on stage I did have a day job at that time I was working oh my god I had I've had a few jobs at one point I was working at Sylvan Learning Center and at one point I was working at you're doing tutoring I was a center director for at Sylvan Learning Center at one point so I was in charge of the that facility just been there for like where I was in Glendale and I was also in Santa Clarita yeah but I wasn't I was an assistant at the assistant director at the Glendale and I was a full-on center director at Santa Clarita but then after that I also worked at a nail salon I worked at a Vietnamese nail salon fortunately at the front desk yeah I worked in Toluca Lake Lake at a place called Oasis nail spa shout-out to my on my Vietnamese nail technicians who still work there they were very nice it's right next to Bob's Big Boy I used to work there I actually met a lot of people working there because it's by the studio so like George Lopez would come in there George Lopez did his whole Walt when he was still married him and his wife and his daughter would come in yeah so this middle part had done George would drop them off I think that's what it was yeah but you know who did come in and gays nails on david alan grier with his his wife at the time they have since split as well it's a bad luck salon huh I can't when it comes in there is very good divorce showbiz I don't think that's do the salon or restaurant it's just it's the hardest it's being a relationship you manage to make it work it works you can make it work you can I think it just takes like but also depends on the type of people you are - yeah 100% are your parents still together my stepfather and my mother are still together been together since I was a little kid oh wow okay yeah so it's a successful relationship yeah but it's one that started when I was five that's commitment but it works yeah they're they're very friendly I mean they're very happy with each other very friendly to each other so I grew up around that yes things dude they had a healthy relation I saw a terrible relationship with my mother and my father terribly briefly violent oh wow dangerous not good then left that and then when we moved in with my my mother's parents we lived there for a while and then we got an apartment after my mom and you know escape for my dad and then when my mom met my stepdad it was a totally different nation ship he's a hippie and he was like this really nice skaar he's into crystals and stuff no just he was just he was you know he's an architect and he was just uh different kind of guys yeah hot had long hair yeah just different kind of person do you ever wonder about like how you would have like what your person I would be like now if your mom had stayed with your dad like longer oh yeah yeah that wouldn't have been good I would have been a dangerous person yeah yeah for sure I I care you know I have a I mean I have a tendency towards violence because I'm not a violent person in terms of like actually my actual actions but I understand it right like it's there it's always there I just don't let it out of the box and that's why I got into fighting and that's why so that she could martial arts yeah oh my god I changed my life like having that thing for every boy especially every boy that grew up I mean obviously situations could have been way worse than mine mine wasn't the worst I nobody beat me it wasn't terrible in terms of like I didn't get abused but I saw it and I saw a lot of I saw plenty of violence so it's like I knew it was a thing and if I grew up around it it would eventually started to affect me and I would have been a part of it right for sure and the problem is you mirror that you know like the guys who grow up with dads who beat their mom are way more likely to beat their wives or their girlfriends or you know or maybe the opposite maybe just hate it so much because you've seen it that you would never allow it right but I think for young men like having some sort of event something martial arts especially because you could actually get out the violence where you purge it from your system you don't have to think about it anymore that's giant is it really cuz I have no idea what it's like to be a man you know I I don't I I think I do have a decent amount of testosterone for a woman cuz I was a tomboy when I was a little girl mm-hmm and I was never until like dresses and like stuff like that when I was younger I never like envisioned like getting married and having this huge wedding those weren't my fantasies when I was a kid you know and whenever it was Halloween I would dress up as a boy I would be like Count Dracula my sister would be a princess I'd be like the Hulk so I've always been kind of like I've always gravitated towards a more masculine even doing stand-up is a very masculine thing to do and maybe that's why I tried gay dudes too but anyway that's neither here nor they so is it like hard like are you guys constantly fighting the urge to be violent well I don't know no not constantly this is how I look at it this is kind of a weird way of looking at it but this is the way I look at it I think that every man every man who has a functional endocrine system who has testosterone has been involved in sports who is fairly athletic there's violence in your head and so if your head was a house okay there's a room there's a violence room okay and you can open up that door if that door gets opened crazy shit can happen most of the time that door is closed but the more fucked up things that happen in your life the more your house gets rocked the more your foundation gets fucked up the more your joy start to creak and move left and right and things are off center and off plumb then that door opens way easier that door is leaking that door is like there's gaps like you know you're the framing is not so good is right yeah the hinges are loose right and so for someone who's been around a lot of violence like people who grew up in terrible neighborhoods been involved in gang violence that kind of shit that door is always ready to pop open it's just always ready to open whereas someone who grew up like my friend Todd likes one of the nicest guys super-sweet I couldn't imagine him beating anybody up cuz he just was loved like maybe even too much like it's all love so his doors locked up tight he would need to get the key from his mom he's gonna get in there fucking if you brush up against that network too much yeah like Joey Diaz Joey Diaz if you if you knock on that door fuck there's violence ready to go it's and he doesn't do much but if if it happens if the wrong thing happens that door comes swinging open right you know we don't teach don't teach kids how to deal with their emotions properly and and I just did you see that the mr. Rogers documentary no there's only so many things you could see well you could take your kids to see this I'm in the middle watching that wild wild country oh I have already seen that oh good cults yeah no it's our old cult sects cults of course what the fuck's the point never calls if you don't get some pussy I don't think my cult would be a sex cult cuz you're a girl yeah no I know what would you call be what was last time a girl ran a cult by the way it might be the first well that no well the chick who was she was kind of running that the Rodney's Purim honor on that bitch is lost okay yeah I guess so yes but she was running stuff while she was there cuz that dude never left his room yeah Sheila was only in power because of homeboy wasn't him Oh show how do you say that's what he called that's what he was called after yeah yeah lame is that would it without him and is he he had to look you gotta have that look you gotta love the look of the holy man that Lee's Rolls Royces and that's what is crazy Rolls Royce these cars these luxurious cars Dini yeah why do you need 22 the same that's like you have piss-poor choices yeah no I don't understand that at all hi Mercedes what do you say try Mercedes yeah Rolls Royce yeah and my question is like do these people want yet when they're going into a cult do they know it's a cult or do they think it's literally like a legit religious organization that they're just doing they think it's legit movement you know like what is a cult right because Christianity is often by scholars referred to as a cult yeah you know like there's certain documentaries on Christianity that refer to as the cult of Christianity like what a cult is is a group of people that follow an ideology they follow a certain way and pattern of being so these people are doing that exact same things until someone from like the fucking FBI starts calling it a cult like you don't you don't really aware of what it is I thought a red flag would be is if like cuz you know though as if your leader is fuckin you know like Matt to me is a red flag because if you look if you look at religious organizations in general like the one thing that's frowned upon and like all of them is like too much sex or any sex really any type of like promiscuity so like and that's a cry thing across the board with religions just in general none of them are like this is good they're like you should have sex to procreate and like that's it yeah with the person that you're married to but with that they were they're like this group sex like I think I think we might be like oh you know that's like a huge red flag yeah as soon as the dude starts fucking everybody's why you're like wait a second how come he gets to fuck my wife he's got a direct line to Jesus bro okay alright yeah I wouldn't trust that that is the thing though but that's the thing with men like men when they get into power anytime a man runs a giant organization has all these followers and he gets to stand on to a stage out and you know and there's a grassy field filled with people with bowing to him yeah that guy's gonna get his dick sucked absolutely he's like there he's got beads on yeah it's like oh sure yeah yes come come for a ride he's at him you can drive rolls-royce number 17 come on so do you trust like Joel Osteen Osteen trust him how do you think he's like a man $1,000 you tell me he's not trust money that guy's riches fuck right this was this he had a Kickstarter well he is absolutely because he's on TV he's a he's a shyster they're all shysters just that's what they are yeah dress is real nice he talks about Jesus and he gets people excited and they give him them their money yeah they give him their money that's what he wants and he's got fucking million he's getting panties thrown at him didn't you just get divorced daddy do you get divorced Google that he's probably getting some serious God loving person oh yeah Jesus said Jesus tell me what job said I'll tell you what job said baby get over yeah is that blasphemous no it's like he's a leader you know I mean that hears if it's long as it's obvious like is a con bad if it's real obvious to his followers he's not a con mo to us it's like yeah yeah but like if you're talking about with the cults when you're in it it's like I don't think they can see it but like Jim Baker like people have followed back yeah he's still around selling fears people that scared the world's gonna end he sells buckets of food but Tammy Faye died right she does she died was a long-suffering Terry fact she died from die coke diet coke did her in are you serious that's what they think she drank too much straight it all day addictive there's something there they're they've been studies and proven that there's that whatever that artificial sweetener is that they put in there yeah they it's a it causes you yeah you know Jesus Jesus and Jim beggars dick both those things are addictive it's Jim Baker was like a perfect example though you're so fucking stupid you buy into that guy's shit yeah I don't lose all of it I don't remember I remembered them I remember growing up and watching like sketches on like MADtv or whatever where they would be making fun of yes yeah I want to remember Robert Tilton he's together his hair slicked back he's another late-night guy he would talk in tongues he'd be on TV oh the lordís moving me to speech he would speak in tongues this is one thing he said I was listening to I started fucking crying laughs and he said every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye you know every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye that shit should totally be legal if you're so stupid you like old lease ain't nice mightly and you pull out your checkbook i smite you Satan knew or fiction you get a shiner there he is look at him he's got speaking tongues here I don't remember this guy the devil I should have said they're hilarious he's hilarious now the devil a shit mr. Satan gave me this mess Satan saliva dental I should have said that oh yeah this is him he he speaks in like tongues and when he is he really old look now was that him there times such a cruel bitch even Robert Tilton went down with all his money he's still alive huh probably but what do you whooping he's old as far to know oh jesus that woody look that's him I can't be the same not him it is him what happened the 90s from when that video boy all that whiskey and pussy and coke look at him he looks doing coke for Jesus no no no like we done we wrapped we're jumps in a private jet 15 hookers in there waiting for him so he touches down to shoot the hookers you know too much stop it do they remix it yeah it's a remix of him screaming why are they remix and stuff anymore I know right remember I met that guy came to UFC shut up right did he get paid they made some money yeah he made some money and Dana White brought him to a UFC is this because he was gay right and then men went to church and said he wasn't gay anymore yeah he was ashamed being gay it was very sad cuz he was saying that you know he was ashamed of being gay in that you know the church was gonna they were gonna pray the gay away it's one of them deals so that's that to me makes me so sad it does it's this there's nothing wrong with being gay now and this this idea that you could change someone from being gay so fuckin stupid it's like just be gay be gay you're gay it's alright it's okay you just need better people around you they tell you were okay they tell you that they love ya yeah and just find other gay people in you like oh you're like me we're good yeah you're good you're fine you guys are gonna be fine yeah all you need to do is move to Atlanta or anywhere else for this LA and live you know find a gay still be in the closet out here too there's a lot of people and I don't get it there's people in show business that I know they're in the closet man that goddamn closet you have a new fan base and then when you meet guys like Todd glass who didn't have a closet it was so much happier now he's like it's just a giant burden relieved relieved off my back like yeah just be yourself man and you know plus it's the stigma is so it's it's bad for everybody it's bad for gay people it's bad for straight people because it's even bad for people or homophobes because they don't realize how many people are really gay right and if they did they would probably be like maybe this is normal yeah like it is normal yes yeah it's the beginning of times no different than having blue eyes or black hair or whatever the fuck you are gay yes trust me my dogs gays fuck really yeah he licks my other dog's dick every time my poor Marshall every I'm throwing him under the bus maybe do you don't know well Johnny Cash my Mastiff when he take a leak Marshall come over and lick his dick right after it takes away from his dick man stop doing that dude so depressing gets right up in there instantly how many dies yet three three I two of them are on death's door though very very old ready to go do you recommend getting a dog I love dogs I love them too I just never know that dogs just a lot of work I know I've had dogs since I had enough money to have dogs the moment when I moved to LA yeah the sitcom I'm like okay I'm getting my rent I'm getting a dog yeah I love dogs I just want to make sure that I'd be able to have like I don't want have to burden somebody when I go out of town without sitter places yes we can go that are really good right take care of they'll even train your dog why you want to have them some are so bad get a dog girl I want one you think you'd have a dog you told me I had first of all when I came here you said I look like I have a kid no I start you had a kid no I said it I think somebody brought it up somebody said Candace has a child I think someone said is probably some girl hated on you dog cage that's why I don't know but you have you'd be very good at taking care of a dog now what kind of dog would you get I like really small or really big like and but my place that I have I have a nice sized place but I still would like to have property when I have if I have a big dog so I would probably want a smaller one just for the sake of you know rain I don't it's limited so I really um I really do like pugs are you friends with Whitney Cummings I'm not friends with her we've met but I can't say we're friends and talk to her about dogs she's got a shitload of him that bitch has a horse what yeah she's got a horse wait what do you mean she has like that Jones like no oh I get the horse part but you said she has a dog like she knows no she talked look she's I go to her she she's very smart and I yeah I go to her talk to her dog questions she sang like how to deal with dogs like you know what she said she goes she was first of all it she talks to you like this just first of all yeah I'm in charge of my house she goes I don't walk around my dogs I walk through them she was like I'm the alpha she was they they don't get to get on top of me and they don't climb on top of me they don't kiss my face she goes what yeah dogs in my bed yeah yeah you know
