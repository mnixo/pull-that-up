the gyro can experience all he's doing is playing some really crazy game that was around before he was ever born he just got into it and got really good at it the gaff the game itself bananas just the stock market itself just the idea that the wealth of a person can vary day by day because of confidence you know confidence computer consumer confidence in a product and like shift and change with recall and then you watching these numbers go up and down like what the fuck are you even talking about most of the explanations you see you know I watched these business sites and the market will go down and they say Oh market down because of such and such as London and then it's like by the time that piece comes out that markets actually back up and they're already constructing their you know let's time market going back up to another random feature you know it's like the the explanations after the fact I've so little to do you know with whatever some algorithm decided it was gonna suddenly ultra-fast trade something and and throw the stock up you know it's like at this point it's it truly is that's the best place to see humans combating machines yeah it's on the market where it's like there's human traders competing with these programmed algorithms and the algorithms are certainly winning the war and if you look at their screens while they're while they're doing it it is almost like code like the average person it doesn't understand it doesn't know what the fuck the stock market's saying the symbols and the sa oh and this natin of ones and the zeros you look at all that you have no idea what that is I mean how is that really different than a computer code that you're reading me that's essentially I go away that people are you happy into our system I mean it was one time the sort of the price of something had to do with some things right it's like there's a factory oh it's the factory went slower today in the rain the market will go down on that side it was like right wheel you know and it's gotten certainly further and further from whatever is going on in that company or their earnings or the things you know it's it's absolutely abstracted to the point now where people don't even invest in companies right right you invest in something like when Facebook went public people bought it at like 9:00 in the morning and like nine ten they're all pissed off that it hasn't gone up it's like wait a minute I was supposed to you know simple my well jump on my wealth it's like now you don't you don't make money on the trade you're supposed to make money on when you've when you've done it but you know now we've got you know derivatives and derivatives of derivatives and derivatives of derivatives of derivatives on there which is just a way of kind of shrinking the explain therefore people don't know what they own so if you buy a stock I mean you know you buy stock hope it goes up and then you sell it in the future if you'd rather make up that time right now I can sell it in the future right now right I can basically sell that future sale because I think that sales going to be a good one now right I can say what if I did that trade I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have it now but one of my trading Ben I'm trading I'm trading on on an abstraction from what something's gonna be worth it someone will in the future so it's like I'm trading on the stock over time and then someone else will say well I'm gonna trade on the abstraction of that I'm gonna trade on whether or not people think the stock in the future is gonna be worth more next minute than this minute it's like well what's that so basically what you're doing is you're buying the stock over time over time over time over time you're creating these things these derivatives of whatever the original investment was which is kind of just a derivative of the thing I guess the porkbelly this derivative the porkbelly derivatives are the derivatives derivatives of the derivatives of the derivatives of the derivatives all all ever tighter ways of saying what is pork-belly gonna be worth you know on February 3rd why is that legal well it's legal because what it because the economy requires it right we have a kind of money right that has a clock in it it's lent into existence and has to be paid back more than got lent out so our economy needs to expand by hook or by crook somehow it has to grow in order for it to survive that's just the way central currency works they need to find more surface area for the money more ways for people to buy stuff so instead of just having there's not enough of a company to buy so now we can bet on how that company is going to do in some future that we can bet on that or we can bet on that right but what we're really doing is trying to kind of compress all of this time right onto like the head of a pin so we can bet on that so have to sit in wait you know 3,000 years for Facebook to be worth something I can't radars future worth now but the whole joke of that is people who are trading that way they're these computers that are trading faster than them so I put in one of my superfast crazy you know derivative trade goldman sachs sees that order coming in on the computer they're so close to the exchange they can execute an order before my order even goes through based on having seen that I was gonna do what I'm gonna do so they can literally trade in my future right I am in their past no that's that's digital time shift that's that sounds like is cheating that's like someone like running a quick server and they're local and then you have like 150 ping exactly that's bullshit I think so with the sort of bullshit the irony of it is it's gotten so big right derivative trading is bigger than regular trading yeah so that the New York Stock Exchange actually just got bought the exchange itself got bought by its derivative exchange so it's almost just like the proofs in the pudding it's like the derivative owns the market at this point but that's how that how could the government even ever deny how incompetent they are man they allowed that like that alone to like someone should just like have a broadcast on national television a you know one of those townhall sort of events where you sit down with the the main people that run the country and go how the fuck are you allowing this how few not fix this why would you ever try to do anything else before you fix this when they made the decision they genuinely thought it would be good for business I will never understand you at all close this business people promised them they figured out before it got really bad oh my god we figured it out before it got really bad how much bigger is the derivative economy I don't know exactly I mean it seemed I was looking trying to find out what that what the sort of trading was it seemed from what I could tell like that 94% of trades are now derivative because they're because they're because there's such bigger volumes oh my god that's insane no one's gonna you're not gonna buy you know 10,000 shares of Honeywell today because that's you know you know whatever $60,000 or something but you could buy like 10 thousand futures on Honeywell because they're really gee god that is so crazy 4 percent of the stuff trades are bitch and I'm scared how many more is I think it's ultra fast 2 is a whole other they're sort of two different two different realms but yeah it's huge they must all be crazy everyone involved in that must know that they're bringing on the matrix they must know that they they're the first steps before the digital machine takes over they must know they must know that there's no Humanity in that stock market shit that's kayo the thing is and and again I don't want digital technology to get blamed for this right because the real operating system they're promoting is not the digital operating system it's the economic operating system underneath it it's this 13th century central currency Anders Behring debt based economy and none of the guys who I thought would get us out you know EV Williams with Twitter Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook the kids from Google right they're good each of them had a real shot even Bill Gates at breaking the central economy and and flipping things the other way how do you know I'm going do that going public not be good not doing it with venture capital saying if I can if Google can hack web search if Facebook can hack social if Twitter can hack everybody why can't they you know if they're so busy disintermediating all these different things why doesn't any one of them yet want to disintermediate central banking and say no mr. chase we don't actually need you we're gonna do our whole thing through Kickstarter say like one of your didn't want any things yeah yeah that's an interesting point of view I think they probably would never want to take that stand because they would be killed I would imagine there's a lot of money and in in them not being successful with that quest you know to make sure that their remaining control point at which you know you're doing PayPal okay we're gonna let we'll do individual transactions that was their their original model and they were gonna make money on the float and then the banks came to them and said uh you know I do that you're not a bank PayPal kids you got to be you know can register as a bank or you're gonna have to be connected to one of us and that's when you know PayPal kinda becomes part of eBay rather than whatever these crazy guys might have done and I suppose there's this point you know where you know innocently these companies that get bigger and bigger bigger hoping to do the right things and then it's like we're gonna gonna let you do this if you don't if you don't play by our rules but I also feel like there's companies that if you if you're willing to go smaller if you're willing to let it grow a little bit slower that you can scale up you can become a big ethical corporation yeah it is already what the fuck son
