dude oh hello Mike Baker hello good see you buddy thank you very much thanks for having me back on my pleasure so tell me what's up are we in trouble what's going on man it's World War 3 haven't you heard is it yeah no that's not no I'm no I'm here to burst that bubble I think not that anyone's gonna say okay I'm writing this down Mike said no World War three but it was it was amazing how how fast the OP was that closer there it was amazing how fast the narrative came out yeah I mean we'd barely smoked sulemani and suddenly the current president's gonna get us into this this conflict and I was nervous well I think everybody step back because it was such a shock to the system right yeah I mean was the last time we dealt with Iran in this fashion I mean as opposed to like a harshly worded de Marsh or a note or maybe an extra sanction here or there but that it was such a strange development that I think it did and the natural reaction was to say oh my god here we go you know and certainly everybody's exhausted from you know 19 years out there so but you know I was shocked that Trump could make that call because they had a bunch of different options they had like or we could kill him he's like let's kill him I was like whoa I didn't know you could do that well you know what he's he's been a target before sulemani is I mean it's there's I guess I should first say where I stand on on this which is I'm not mourning his passing right I mean I think he deserved it I think it's justice that should have been served up some time ago he's responsible not just not just for as people have talked about the hundreds of US servicemen but thousands and thousands of people this guy was a completely bloodthirsty douchebag I mean there's no way about it and what it was and we're talking about the second most structure-wise the second most important person within the Iranian regime next to the Ayatollah so but the idea that somehow we took out a foreign leader right or a military general like he was some sort of like you know Eisenhower yeah is insane the guy was a mob boss it was it was the head terrorist for a state that is the number one sponsor of terrorism around the world and so but he's been on on target lists for a long time you go back to 2008 there was an operation to take out a guy named agnya who himself was also a bloodthirsty psychopath and he was running hezbollah operations so the Israelis had been tracking him as had we and at one point they had an opportunity to take out Nia and also sulemani and they backed off at the time essentially because the US wouldn't you know get behind the idea that we're gonna take out super money that was you know at that point that was a step too far so they eventually we got magneta but sulemani is just I mean I don't know where to start with the amount of blood that he he's responsible for people talk about again okay he authorized operations and activities in Iraq against US soldiers and against Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi civilians but it goes back to the beginning of that I mean you could go back to 2003 and sulemani was he was the architect he dreamt up this idea as the US was going into Iraq that he was gonna what he did was insane he basically authorized I mean he's in charge right so he authorizes the release of a bunch of Sunnis that they've been holding on to Iran being Shiite arch-rivals being the Sunnis essentially and the Saudis are are their archenemy a Sunni nation and but he released all these Sunni extremists that Iran had been holding on to essentially ever since we had gone into Afghanistan right after 9/11 and he released them into Iraq and including against our cow who became the head of al-qaeda in Iraq and within a few months of our getting out to Iraq the these Sunnis under basically under sulemani tutelage had a series of bombings and started bombing everything from Shiite mosques to UN facilities Jordanian embassy a variety of targets killing thousands of Shiites now he's a Shiite so this is how bad this guy is he goes into Iraq with this plan that I'm gonna push the Shiite in Iraq to Iran I'm gonna make them come to us for protection for coverage essentially we can ride in there because he what does he want he wants to exert their influence within Iraq he doesn't want a strong Iraq he doesn't want the US and they're building a strong stable Iraq I mean you go back to the iran-iraq war where sulemani started his military career and you know he's not there's no way he's a true believer there's no way he's ever gonna let it rock become stable again and he's insane enough that he kills thousands of Shia his own people right in order to push the Shiite population in Iraq to Iran I know if I'm like being false flag operations who's he blaming the Sunni since the Sunnis are doing it yeah but but he's authorized and he's pushed them into Iraq to do this under and so he's he was always very unusually capable at walking a fine line between his own Shiite believes population of things and at times being able to be sort of a puppet master for Sunni extremists when it suited his cause and it's it mean it's it's anyway it's it's fascinating stuff whether it was dealing with Hezbollah the you know Palestinian Islamic Jihad or whomever he again I keep going back to the same thing he deserved what he got no doubt in my mind and I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner maybe not from us but from others they just back in October the Iranians you know claimed they foiled a an assassination attempt against sulemani by Israel and some unnamed Arab agents so it's not as if we just plucked his name out you know he'd spent two decades you know engaged in death and mayhem now the take on him dying has not been like to take on back daddy and back daddy one of the most disturbing things that I saw was the Washington Post called him in a store religious scholar did you see that yeah when that guy died they called him honest or religious scholar and people that I talk to that understand who he was and what was going on there were fucking fuming they were like what is this not who the fuck wrote this right you're talking about a goddamn terrorist a real legitimate murderous terrorist and you called him in a store religious scholar right you're giving him this credibility that I don't understand that either I saw that and I'd I talked a handful of people who you know kind of leaned in that direction and and and and also you get the same thing with sulemani now suitum only I can understand he's wrapped in the cloak of a military uniform and you know people saw him sitting next to the Ayatollah okay but I look at it the same way his this is not assassinating a foreign leader this is not assassinating a revered scholar this is that these are taking out terrorists bloodthirsty terrorists who have a long track record of killing people and and what and it's not he was he was not you know he was not choosy right which was so ammonia we're talking about again Iraqis Yemenis you know Syrians his own people you know they they talk about maybe some 1500 or so protesters you know being killed in Iran in the past few months as a result of the protests against the Iranian regime primarily because a corruption you know that the fact that they've driven that economy into a toilet at the expense of the Iranian people lack of rights of any sort and sulemani again as a head of the hoods force you know the number two person there he's responsible so I I don't understand anybody who doesn't just say yeah I'm yeah and I think the left had a hard time with it the hard left you saw them spinning a little bit saying okay we don't say he shouldn't have gotten it we don't say he didn't deserve it but and then they had to try to figure out some way to because it's all got to be about politics now so they bring it back to the current president the Trump whenever Trump does anything even if what he does is fantastic they can't get behind it they almost have to get a go against things that are great like if the economy is great they've got to find a reason why it's bad the economy is great yeah if it's his decisions to something positive you they can't accept it yeah that's unfortunate well we've lost our ability to I think to look at things just in an objective fashion in any sense of the word objective or certainly we don't have civil conversations anymore but but the idea that we can look at and and separate the politics from it look I know again I don't care whether people like Trump or not I don't you know I didn't vote for him I don't mean necessarily care for the individual but that doesn't mean I can't like policies right and whether you're talking about what's going on with Iran were they talking about you know the way that we've been dealing with China lately other issues I you know hey I liked I liked President Obama didn't like his policies you know I don't necessarily like Trump I liked his policies I don't see any conflict there yeah anyway no I don't see any conflict there a billion people are complicated and I just I just didn't know that Trump could make the call guy that goes take him out like when when when I thought that was like there was probably a panel of military leaders and like really important people that understand the ramifications not a fucking game show yeah like in America's Got Talent or people buzzer I felt like that would be like something that they would discuss Trump and be like yeah option three welcome well but they talk about and there is a great deal of conversation that goes I'm not necessarily with the president you know I have no idea how he processes his information but there's a great deal of the conversation a discussion that goes on in the Pentagon within the Intel community and National Security Council you know what happens once they lay out these options in front of the president you know I don't have a clue but he does have that authority he's got that ability in President Obama had that authority President Obama took out remember you know US citizens you know who would yes over season in the Middle East and you know there was a hue and cry over sort of the the legality of it but you didn't see a lot of people saying you know and in part okay I admit because it wasn't again this you know sulemani is wrapped in a cloak of his military uniform it's also people are very concerned about this possibility of what's going on war with Iran and they think that this might have like started that off yeah yeah I think what changed the calculus here is Iran is you know the regime is brutal and and on an awful they're not crazy and the one thing they want more than anything else is to retain power that's it and I think they looked at the idea of a military conflict a direct military conflict with the US and this is not to say that their proxies won't you know strike out it at some place around the world at some point but the regime looked at that thought net you know what we're not going to do this in in part because you know the killing of sulemani is is important on a much bigger level than just taking out you know a a terrorist of his stature it's important for deterrence purposes and so you know I again I think they looked and felt like the calculus and dealing with the US has shifted now and they don't understand it they're not comfortable with it and also they can't afford it look what if we got in the military conflict over this the idea that you know somehow we were gonna get in World War three it would be over in an evening literally it would be over in one night we have the ability to take out their entire energy infrastructure there are missile bases there are key military facilities and I don't want to oversimplify this but after that first night's activity that's it they're done so the idea that somehow there's going to be now does that mean that you know we should do that of course not nobody wants a military conflict but you know and again there would be knock-on repercussions excetera so hopefully we can sort this thing out through now that we're doing the military deterrence and they understand that we're serious we've got the economic pressures we've got diplomatic pressure primarily to keep them isolated I think you know I think we're on the right track with with Iran I think want to see a different reaction from them well I was a little bit relieved when they attacked back and just sort of like launched missiles on the outside of bases nobody died I was like okay so it seems like this is almost like they're they're making a signal like they're attacking but they're not really doing anything yeah I think there was an optic to it I think you're right absolutely that they felt like they had to do something yeah the ayatollahs gathered I don't know what they call it saving face or not but you know and then we had a warning we had warning ahead of time and didn't they print in their paper didn't they say that they killed a bunch of people they did yeah so talk yeah they claimed about eighty or so I think keep saying it right exactly just whatever it takes but didn't I mean you know and to put a look at the reaction that we've had they'd you know of course the Ukrainian commercial passenger jet went down yeah and that was them right oh that was that was definitely them when do you think that they shot it down because they thought it was a US military plan yeah it was an it look this is it this it's not unprecedented I mean we shut down an Iranian passenger jet years and years ago right the Russians shot down they still won't admit to it but they shot down a passenger jet over Ukraine what just a handful of years ago at which they still won't admit to its it's human error and it's human error in a conflict zone and in a situation where there's there's a lot of moving parts and it's never gonna be a zero risk game so if the Iranians had done this as tragic as it is and come out and said oh my god we you know did this okay well this you know it would have been horrific but they you know they did this to themselves they did because they just couldn't bring themselves to be truthful they've got a long track record of not and so they they engaged in this and and shot it down I there's when you find missile debris in a in a in a field where you're doing an investigation of a plane crash that's pretty good indication and then there's the video on top of that well there is a video the missile hitting the plane they have two missiles oh Jesus Christ thirty second support roughly thirty seconds apart so two missiles to bring down a plane yeah hit the first one the first one hit and then about thirty seconds later not quite 30 things later a second missile hits there's another fireball and the plane stays up in the air for you know a period of time just because it's just it's not devastated but it's it it was some twenty miles from the airport it actually kind of made up as if it was turning back to the airport probably right after that first missile hit but here's the thing I mean that was so that's a tragic disaster right there right but the idea that you know somehow nobody nobody's actually saying they did it on purpose they didn't do it on purpose they did it it was an accident they mistook it for either an incoming missile or a hostile aircraft you know coming in for bombing run after they launched their ballistic missile strike so nobody's saying it was done on purpose but it's it's it again it's it's indicative of the Revolutionary Guard Force and the regime itself that they spent several days denying it and saying it was mechanical failure and pressuring the Ukrainians to come out and say it was mechanical failure which they then reversed course on that once it became obvious yeah so it's a tragic situation but now the protests out in the streets of Iran which are a continuation of the past several months right which were targeted at a corrupt regime have picked up strength in light of that because the people are just we're tired of this you know so and who knows where it's going to go I suspect unfortunately I'm fairly cynical about all this we've been hoping the Iranian population would kind of rise up for decades and it doesn't happen because it's a pretty brutal regime we don't understand that we don't understand how how how difficult they are right and how serious minded they are about holding on to power so every now and then we think okay how come the protest it's gonna topple the regime and it doesn't happen so maybe it's different this time I'd you know I don't think so mm-hmm now were you concerned at all and this is one of the things when you say that we could go in there and level them in a day the the real issue is they're allies right the real issue is China and Russia yeah but they're not gonna do anything China and Russia aren't got do anything it's not in their best interest and they they if they're consistent about one thing both those countries it's that they act in their own best interests and they would look at that and go yeah yeah I'm sorry I mean look so what are we dealing with and in that immediate area Iran's closest ally is Syria right Soleimani so the money spent you know billions of you know Iranian dollars or money that they couldn't afford to and this should have been spent on its population arming training equipping and dealing with the Syrian war and keeping his pal Assad in power so Iran and the Sutton and Syria are tied together but is Syria in a position to somehow rise up and you know engage this is not gonna be this wouldn't have been a conflict as we imagine it right it wouldn't be a conflict of occupying space and ground although it nobody wants that nobody needs it's not it's not good for anybody I'm not saying that I'm just saying that in the scheme of things we would have overwhelming superior support superiority yeah and and yeah I I can't imagine a scenario where Russia you know would come in and in fact we would probably as you know as anybody would we would say okay look the Russian military is in Syria we're gonna lay eyes were they gonna advise you you know shits coming down and because we the last thing we wanna do is drag them into it by hitting some of their facilities or personnel or whatever so there would be that level of coordination which there always is no matter who the parties are there's always some element of coordination but anyway yeah I don't see that happening I think we've averted that I hope we've averted sort of further military you know conflict I think again I think the Iranian regime understands it's a new day perhaps that they'll come to the table eventually that's what this whole maximum pressure campaigns about is to again create sufficient economic pressure ensure that they understand the idea of deterrence which I think they do after this strike on sulemani and that that goes back a ways this wasn't just like something that just you know they thought up after an American contractor was killed the Iranian regime had been ratcheting up their aggressiveness and their attacks and their various operations in that region for a quite a while and we had been talking to them about it or getting the signal to them that you've got to stop this and back in December they were told look if you continue this path we are going to take serious action and we did how difficult is it to get intelligence on what they're up to and and what what they're planning with their response before like when when you're here in America I mean how do we do it like yeah who's over there like how do they do that how do they find out exactly what these guys were up to well a lot of its old-school human human intelligence right so through sources and a lot of that sourcing comes from our allies so whether it's the Israelis or the Jordanians or the Saudis are whomever so they know someone who's on the inside or like how does it work they've got a source they've got some recruited asset you know Iran's always been a tough target for us just like North Korea's a tough target and so we rely heavily on our liaison partners and but oftentimes no matter how good your signals intelligence is right no matter how good you are at a gathering SIGINT or photo interpretation of overhead imagery it's still to this day no matter how good technology gets you can't beat having an asset having a human who's sitting in a meeting somewhere and then for whatever their motivation is whatever their you know reason for doing it they're cooperating with you or our liaison partners and they're saying well here's what happened or here's how that person looked right I mean maybe you get signals intelligence because you're you're picking up you know communications and then what do you got you got something on piece of paper and you're reading a transcript of a meeting but if you've got somebody who's in that meeting and you can tell you what people looked like or what the actual atmosphere was or the mood or the way that I mean that's invaluable right and so we rely a great deal on that but you're basically your Hoover up everything you can from all the various different types of intelligence capabilities but it's it's a it's a tough target I mean there's no doubt about it I mean that's why this whole nuclear weapons program with Iran has always been so difficult I mean and you talk to people they go well they've got about a I got about a 12-month breakout time before they'd have a nuclear weapon and then other people say well I think they got about a three-month breakout time well when you're talking about how long it's gonna take them to have a nuclear weapon you'd like to get that there those parameters a little closer together right so that you're not having a complete guess but it's tough and you know we we spend a lot of time working on that but I I would would say that we have tremendous allies in that region and you know I know the people it's fashionable nowadays to say well the Trump administration we've been you know pushing away our allies and they don't want to work with us and that you know what they do in part because again it's the same old story it's in their best interest all right so is there any benefit to having someone like Trump who's very difficult to to read because he's what you know he's he's the kind of guy like when when back daddy was killed he said he died like a dog like he says crazy shit and he and he talks about like with Iran that he was that they might respond back with disproportionate results or with a disproportionate response in comparison to the the initial attack yeah yeah the fifty two cultural sites but that was so crazy like to to represent the fifty two people that were kidnapped in the fucking Carter Administration yeah well yeah we don't really need to go with the symbolism fellas we could just just pick some targets but let's not pick the cultural sites yeah that's you know oh yeah those are historic yeah well you know what that's that's where I say look I understand why people you know oh my god you know and yeah yeah but at the same time that doesn't mean you can't like you know policies that are in place so I always put that out there oh I see yeah I get it that's that's ridiculous right and it's a self-inflicted wound and you could argue that you know that most of the problems they deal with out of this White House our self-inflicted wounds because there's a lack of discipline and so it'd be nice if the president was more buttoned up of course that's not gonna be the way it works he he he I think I do I know but he firmly believes I think that this is why he got elected I think that thing it is why you're gonna elected really yeah I think a lot of why he got elected is cuz he's wild and people like it they like it they're like something different they're tired of these people that sound like politicians you know you hear you know pick a person Elizabeth Warren you hear them talk and you feel the bullshit coming out of their mouth while they're talking you know that they're playing a role you know that they're with Trump he might be arrogant he might be crazy he might be ridiculous but that's him that's that guy I bet if you around him all day long he's like that I mean that's the that's the thing that people one of the things people like about him he's like that all the time that's that's who he is yeah like he's not bought he doesn't need to bullshit he's Donald Trump he's a fucking multi billionaire who is now the president of the United States so it's like he doesn't feel the need to put on an act for anybody so when he comes out and says he died like a dog like that's that's how he would talk yeah yeah no I think the consistency I think you're right there is there's an element of look I'm tired I am tired of the bullshit I mean I see what you're saying but I guess what I think then is I mean what are the chances that you get the twenty twelve more in 2020 look at that but we get down to November to the election and people are just exhausted by it so they wanted something different now they've had it are they gonna get to this point in November and get ready to vote and think I can't take another four years of it even though it's entertaining I'm exhausted people don't like change they get scared of change and if things are going well economically and if you know if if it turns out that this thing with Iran doesn't turn into anything disastrous by the time November rolls around I think he's gonna win in a landslide I really I don't see unless Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard get together and then everybody goes you know what that would work like this is this is a real combination of people that I could I could get behind unless it's something like that where there's like some overwhelming candidate but I don't see that idaite then they seem to be pushing for Elizabeth Warren I don't see that yeah she was a Republican most of her career and then she became a Democrat like when she was in her late 40s if I find maybe it's just me but but you know I don't see a consistent policy message there I don't see I don't see that happening for for her this go-around maybe maybe it'll change maybe you need I don't know but problem is I feel like these people just want to be President I feel like it's a self aggrandizement thing they just want to be President I think you could argue that about anybody in politics so you could you can say that I mean you know you've met that person right it was in politics now who started out by being ahead of the Republican or Democratic Club in high school that's all they want to do it in their a state senator and then they say Oh am I gonna run for Congress and you think what's up what the fuck I mean how it's gotta be something you know yeah the wirings off a little bit that's the problem right anybody that wants to be President you wouldn't want to be President well I mean I think if you if you look at if you look at who they've got on the other side all right I mean I I thought for a while that well maybe the Republicans are gonna primary trump right and then I realized that's a crazy-ass idea no one said we're gonna do that no one's gonna get in there and go again stir it up with him for a primary yeah it's the who hello there's no one that stands out like you would need someone that already stands out I mean here we are in January you would need someone that already stands out we're talking about doing 10 months from now you need someone that's already in the public eye you can't just jump to the head of the line like that no but especially from the Republican side if he if you say he wins he get in 2020 got four years I tell you one person I would I would love to see jump in I don't think she'd ever do it but would be Condoleezza Rice and just super smart good person you know terrific I don't know but again I don't think that's gonna I don't think it's gonna happen I don't know that we've do you think she would run for president I mean I would like to think so I doubted it she hasn't shown any interest in I think she's enjoying private life too much yeah and all the shit she's smart yeah Iraq war never these public can't take that and stick it up your ass I'm gonna hang out in my ranch or whatever the fuck she's got Republican administration has got to have a ramjet a ranch somewhere and you lay low Oh Cheney he's got a ranch he's got we definitely got a ranch guy Bush's got around you'd be better aim but he's got a ranch I think he was a little that was one of my favorite times he shot his friend in his face and his friend apologized yeah that's how gangster Dick Cheney is yeah so I got my face the way sir I'm sorry I look like a quail sir I got my my oldest boy for Christmas 12 years old and great and great great kids scooter I get him a airsoft a Glock replica and I didn't know much about airsoft right I mean who doesn't mean I've got it I've got a walk-in safe full of weapons but none of them are airsoft weapons I don't you know but he really wanted one his buddies have him they they go out shooting and you know they do the old-school thing right they put on a couple of layers of clothes and some eye protection they go shoot each other so how could I say no so we we go to the store to this combat supply shop that specializes in airsoft and I was I was really impressed I mean the machining on these things is fantastic right first of all and I was expecting some you know the old-school pellet guns and BB guns the Crossman's things like that you know that a plastic for the most part in everything this is a solid piece of work and anyway so yeah on this thing he's turned out I know where I was going with us - OH shooting in the shot he's actually I suspect he's a better shot than Cheney as it turns out and he's got his hunting TIFF get and he's been through that education program and you know he's in the scouts and to go out shooting every now and then and but it took him almost no time at all right in terms of practice - to develop I I'm I'm boasting about my 12 year olds target shooting ability I realized that's not why most viewers tuned in sometimes they want to know yeah yeah yeah maybe so anyway so that stay but yeah I think I think I think you're right nobody's going to primary this president and I think we're left with this this field of potential candidates on the demo and I I tend to agree I think it's going to be a landslide unless there's some if the market tanks for whatever reason because there's some international crisis somewhere and it sends things down through the floor maybe but if the economy stays the way it is and the Dems seem to wander into their you know primary season this unorganized as they seem to be yeah I could see a mourning again big well I think people want to look at him as being all bad but if if what he's done in the moves that he's made are great for the economy and and think and things appear to be very good right ya know I think again you can't but the problems they can't separate that right you can't yeah you can't find that progressive who's gonna stop and go well you know the economy is good or they say it it always followed by a but you know it's not good for everybody well it's never good for everybody it's true - yeah it isn't no yeah I mean they want the economy to be the way it is but they want Bernie Sanders economic policies you know and it's it's interesting because I think that someone who supports big business the way Trump does he encourages people to to move business forward I mean it encourages the market encourages people to spend money it encourages people to take risks if the the more he makes it easier for these big businesses also the more people get outraged but then the economy picks up it's like boy there's a I don't know what the correct way to do this is but there even though I'm not a Trump fan there are definite benefits to the way he has been running the country yeah when you talk about the just sort of the some of the basic metrics you look at the unemployment rate I mean and and I would just I just finished a conversation the other day I mean Idaho not to bring in Idaho but Idaho's got the second strongest state economy in the nation right the unemployment rate is is it's almost negligible it's crazy how strong it is at this point cuz there's solid people of solid people we all have ranches exactly there's something to that though there's solid people yeah I mean Idaho is a fucking there's real people up there go up there it's fucking cold as shit there's wolves and bears those are real goddamn people I've got to come back coming back up definitely come back yeah I would definitely come back I'll schedule something yeah that would be great but I think that I think the the point with the the economy is that that it does and again I get it not everybody's in the stock market of course not everybody's in the stock market but as it improves or we're tax cuts you know that old it was only for the rich it you can't tell me that people haven't been benefitting from it and yes you're gonna be at you gonna be segments it takes longer or you gotta work harder or whatever it is to feel that improvement but it's there and and again I don't see unless unless there's something that sends it heading south and I think the the Democrats are in a difficult position they can't talk it down Michael Bloomberg's trying he's not democratic so I know what he is but he's not what is it was the Republican here Democrats Tom Steyer yeah yeah I keep want to say steyr and away tired it makes me sound clever but Tom Steyer yeah but I think the Bloomberg is trying to say look this you know the economy needs to be adjusted needs to be fixed I don't think anybody buys it right because it just there's no supporting data for that and so they have a hard time battling against the economy which is why I think they try to avoid it for the most part I mean that that debate last night did you watch it and no yeah I don't watch them I pushed Tulsi Gabbard out I stopped watching how much you guys are out of your fucking mind she's the most interesting candidate out there yeah next to Marion Williams that bitch is crazy I'm crazy no I say the term of endearment but isn't she like a crystal healer or some shit yes she was trying to come on the podcast to she's doing a tour yeah that is that's a boat with a lot of holes in it and they're gonna make it across the harbor it was like talking to it's like talking to what are your aunt's right we need crazy aunts yeah comes over for the holidays you know and so what do you don't want I'm a day you a dreamcatcher anything like that Thank You catcher I think Bernie Sanders has some interesting thoughts and talking to him in person in real life I like him a lot and he's not like what he comes off in those goddamn debates because those debates are ridiculous you get five people in front of the camera the ask him a question they have 30 seconds to answer it everybody else is jumping and yelling things out they're all trying to get a soundbite that's all it is it's not it's not actually a debate I mean remember you don't debate club I mean yes and it's not it's not that it's it's exactly yeah it's exactly what you said it sound bites a series of sound bites they're all looking to have a moment yeah you don't want to screw up so they want to have a kind of a safe moment right and they go through I agree with you I like I like Bernie because he's been consistent you can go back to the 80s yeah say in the same shit that you say and now yeah and and I think there is something to that now I don't I don't buy his his arguments you know I don't I don't but I like the guy and I like the fact that he's consistent and he means what he says and so I you know I again I I can separate out liking him from liking his policy yeah I I don't see a problem there but I don't think they're gonna let Bernie there was there was a moment I'll tell you about last night that won this debate thing where I think it was the CNN moderator she asked Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren had come out the other day and said that she had a private conversation with Bernie and during the conversation yeah Bernie said do your woman's ever gonna win that's my woman's never gonna win can't win being president I he was more eloquent than that but the voice sounded just like it and and so he's denied it so the moderator last night during this debate asked Bernie Sanders let me just be clear she said are you saying that you've never said this to Elizabeth Warren and Brody said absolutely not very next words out of the moderate mouth was she turned or was born said so senator Warren when Bernie said to you that he never or no when Bernie said to you that a woman couldn't be President how did you feel Jesus Christ that was it that and so I think that they're not even trying now to hide the fact that they want to marginalize Sanders yeah so why did they want to marginalize him because I think they feel I can't there's no way you can win know what it is yeah I think on a national level I think the devil is above Warren can win after lying about being Native American for our whole life yeah yeah that's a fucking big one to me oh by the way by the way I was one of my boys was home sick the other day from school the middle boy Sluggo and so we were sitting on the sofa I said you know yeah you're not feeling well I watch a movie now god bless him he's ten years old he considers himself a baller all he wants to do is play basketball that's all he wants to do with his life he knows he's gonna get recruited by Turk he knows he's gonna end up in the NBA and but we're sitting there and it was really kind of sweet cuz he's you know he's got all this hard side to him and I'm just playing ball and then he says well yeah let's watch it Disney movie so we kind of dial up Disney Plus because we like where were sheep and we bought the Disney Plus thing and and Peter Pan and the original Peter Pan right the original Disney Peter Pan so we turned it on and I'd forgotten what that movie was like in terms of its treatment of Native Americans oh it's horrible okay so well watch did we get to that part where you know they're they're singing that song and that boys lost boys are tied up with Wendy and Michael and all and that the chief comes in and he wants to find Tigerlily you're the princess you know because you know hook is the viewers are like what the hell's going on so anyway I'm sitting there and and even Sluggo looks at me and he goes well this is kind of racist well that's we had a conversation I said yeah you know what you yeah pretty much what I told him but anyway well particularly about Native Americans I mean they just they were able to get away with it nobody nobody protested it I've been I'm reading this book now I'm listening to it on tape called Black Elk speaks it's about this Iguala Sioux medicine man who was while he was still alive in the 1930s they wrote this book we told the story of Custer and he was there he was a young boy when Custer was killed and he told the story of like life on the plains and Crazy Horse and it's fucking fascinating what was it written it's written in 1930s okay let's go black Elk speaks yeah I've read I've listened to on tape this is like the fourth or fifth one that I've listened to on Native Americans over the last couple of months but this is the best one this is the best one because not that the other ones weren't great they were great but what's interesting about this is the actual words of a man who lived that life it's not just a historical a book about the time and describes the events the time this is a guy describing what he saw and he was talking particular about war about the way it was when you know they killed Custer and you know he was there when they killed Custer and just the battles between the American soldiers and the Native Americans it's like it's crazy it's crazy to think that it happened just a short time ago you know and it's also crazy to think that if no one came to America if like if the world just stayed in Europe and Asia and then the way it had been before Columbus and before the pilgrims and all that shit these people would probably still be living like that because that's not that long ago well is it mean you think about it it's what was it it was a warring tribal culture yeah well I mean we all still we have this I'm probably gonna make a watch at this point but yeah warring tribal cultures in the Middle East right I mean it's it's a it's it's it's it's a difficult environment right in which to say okay we're gonna have some sort of federal system we're gonna come together we're gonna wear the greater good you know and but I mean I think it's I will say this I the most depressing scenes I've ever seen have been on Native American Indian reservations in this country and I've never been oh my god I've never been other than casinos it's just you go and you and I'd like I'd spent most of my adult life overseas right and some pretty grim places and I am the first time I was on a reservation here in the u.s. how can this how can this possibly be here I know that's a naive thought and people think well how could you not know that it was here but it's you know a it's not a good history but be it's it's not a good follow-up either I mean right we haven't we just to this day we don't do a very good job at all and the reservation systems not not all and of course it's night it's like every year you know not every urban center is you know crime rate I mean a that's ridiculous but I'm just saying in general you know some of the most difficult places I've ever seen have been right here in our borders on Indian reservations and good god yeah I want to get someone who's in someone to come in here who's a Native American who's a historian who really understands the history of of their tribe someone who could come in here and talk to me about it because I just had this sort of a peripheral understanding of it up until about five or six months ago I really you know I I had seen movies and I had read books and I'd kind of understood but I didn't really really get into it and so I started reading these books and it's just it's just incredible to think that there was millions and millions of tribes are millions and millions of members of different tribes living in this country like basically like Stone Age people 150 years ago and oftentimes you know in constant conflict with each other yes oh that's a bad thing that I didn't really understand yeah the horrific things they did to each other kidnapped each other tortured each other then we came along they're like the fuckin like not privates he's we brought him a whole new level well soon as we figured out repeating guns as soon as they figured out revolvers with more than one bullet this because they were fighting the Comanches originally they were fighting him with muskets and the Comanches could shoot like six arrows in ten seconds so they were just lighting these fucking soldiers up because they couldn't reload right so they wait for the initial volley and then they'd charge in and they also could there were such great horsemen they could actually shoot underneath the horse's neck so they'd hold on to the reins somehow where they were under the horse's neck and they were protected and they were shooting at the soldiers now and they were shooting from horses nobody knew how to do that before everybody got off the horse to shoot yeah and they was covering horse but he's covering concealment how the Comanches apparently dominated is that they had so many horses they were rich in horses they are the ones that figured out how to master the horse the best they also used small horses they didn't use like these big horses that the Americans used right there were small people Comanches were fairly small people ya know it's it is it is a absolutely it's a fascinating history I've spent more time reading sort of the military aspects of of the Indian Wars right um you know the US military side of things and occasionally it'll a book will stray into sort of okay well let's look you know from a perspective of you know the whichever tribe they were in battle with but not usually very good so I'll pick up this book cuz it it is it's an amazing history and you're right it's not that long ago there's another great book well there's quite a few from a blood and thunder it's yes hit Carson read that yeah yeah that dude get him on the show yeah he it was tremendous right huh and from nothing I can try nothing well and was a small guy wasn't you know had a soft voice and yeah there was a show men who made America I think or it was a follow on from that but they they had a handful of episodes about Kit Carson but they kind of went through they picked out some of the sort of the the individuals you would imagine right I mean Daniel Boone and and some of the others characters as the frontier I think a minute who built a frontier I think it's what's called as a follow-on to that seer that they did but the men who built America okay which seems misogynistic but women probably helped they they you know behind every great Titan of industry there was a woman and several of his mistresses but I think that this this thing about building the frontiers was interesting they tried they tried to provide a perspective from the Native American Indians point of view I don't think they necessarily did a very good job because I think they just had so much room to cover but it was still worth watching so mmm it was it was a good series yeah I think most of us are pretty ignorant to what goes on on the reservations today and me included you know you hear these horrible stories of alcoholism and poverty and you know it's just they're they live in these nations inside of a nation that's what it's what's very strange and the only thing that really you know those natural resources that can help them but really gambling gambling becomes a big revenue source for a lot of them and then and then people are trying to get in the system no pun intended but people gaming the system and saying I'm gonna create this non-existent tribe right that in Washington DC is get swing a dead cat without hitting some lobbyist who's trying to push for designation of some obscure element as a tribe right so that they can simply apply for it caming license yeah yeah yeah I I don't know I'm not sure how you how you turn that around there's the the Native American Indian Museum in DC that opened several years back it's very good it's a little tough to follow I will say this much in terms of just the way they've laid the museum out right and but it's it's just absolutely full to the ceiling of incredible stories and artifacts and history bits but it's definitely worth people going to DC if they if they're saying okay I'm gonna go to the Smithsonian's they should put that one on the list because it's it's really fascinating it's really good anyway but what else oh I know what I went to do I was gonna bring up because I can't come on the show without talking about Huawei only in on the periphery today the Trump administration signed this first portion of a deal with China and so it's a trade pact right there's been this trade battle obviously and I just I just thought I was flying out here and I was thinking about it it's interesting dynamic right because you know people talk about this current administration is not having any strategy and sometimes it does seem frankly that way what I was seeing the other day that it is there is actually this an interesting split in terms of how they're dealing with China so on the one hand we've got this softening of the trade war you know they're gonna as a result of signing what they signed today with China is sort of the first stage trade agreement it's mostly involves you know increased purchases by China of us goods there's some talk about them scaling back their theft of intellectual property feeling bad scaling back yeah okay you know we're not gonna stop stealing but but there's there's that element to it but at the same time as they're doing this and as a result of that we're gonna have we're gonna cut in half our tariffs on quite a bit of a large amount of goods and I think we're gonna drop the idea of imposing more tariffs on some other goods but even while we're doing that so that's happening right but as we're doing that we're also ratcheting up pressure and some sanctions and some legislation against the technology side of things so we're still coming down on Huawei Congress is trying to push through something that's going to make it even more difficult for US companies to do business with them overseas but I think it's interesting right because we're you know there's there's some people I think in Washington go well we can't do both what Coit you can do both right you can talk to the Chinese in in real terms and say yeah let's let's you know let's focus on the trade what we're gonna do this we're gonna make a little bit easier let's let's create a trade environment where it's good for both of us at the same time you know what you're still you know stealing our shit and while we still a national security threat so we're still going to focus on this and I you know this is not saying I'm singing praises of this current ministration I'm just saying that any administration should be able operate on different levels right when it comes to the same band but we don't we haven't seemed to do that it's like with Iran you know well okay we're you know and then in the past if they just gave some indication that they were gonna play ball with us we'd ease up on the sanctions even though they hadn't done anything about their their pursuit of terrorism and and other things that they were doing because we felt like in Washington I think sometimes DC is like oh you can't do two things at one time that seemed to be conflicting well the real world says I think that you can so I think China gets it now I don't think they're gonna stop stealing it seems to be how they operated yeah yeah especially when you consider the fact that the government is so inexorably connected to hallway like you when you were explaining how big business and the government are hand-in-hand they're not two separate entities they work completely together and so with Huawei since they have been busted having third party access to data and stealing packets and stuff with routers because they have done that you got to think well that's probably a part of the way they do business well it's it is it's it's it's it's in their system I mean they made a decision decades ago right this is how we're going to achieve superiority in the world we're going to get to the top of the food chain by skipping all the cost and and and pain of research and development we're just gonna Hoover up everything we can from not just the US but everybody so you know part of this all this this pushback against China has been specifically trying to say look you got to stop that we understand it we're calling you out on it we're doing now we've tried doing that a handful of times in the past and half-hearted manner this time you know I think the Chinese understand we're more serious about it and we are trying to implement certain measures that will prevent some of that theft but at the same time I think it as you said it's part of how they do business right we're not going to so I think we have to be pragmatic in all of this and think yeah we're it's good that we're pushing them on it's good that we're telling them it's good that we're trying to rebalance the trade environment that were calling out hallway that we're talking to our allies about not doing business with them because all they all they really want is they want an access point right so if they do business with the UK suddenly in this seamless world of communications now they've got a entry point into the u.s. so it's you know we're working to try to get our allies to stay onboard with us about that but yeah the Chinese they subsidized Huawei and the government does in a big way and it's we just have to be realistic right we're not gonna change their their behavior in a in a major way they're just gonna become more sophisticated or more obtuse about how they do it well the best evidence to me that there's really something going on is that Google's even stepped in right Google the goulds even say we won't even give you our access to Google store anymore if you want to have a huawei phone even if you buy it from overseas it will not work on the Google ecosystem yeah so what always done is they've started their own little weird App Store and they've started creating their own apps they're essentially frozen out of the ecosystem that Google provides in the Google Play Store provides but you can side load some apps by going to the website like you can side load you can download some of them and put them on a phone but they're they're essentially relegated to these weird Chinese versions of a lot of the popular applications and it's a very limited selection and when it comes to high-end cell phones like what is the new Huawei phone I think it's called the mate 30 pro they meant another one there this is the other chest now yeah right son of a bitch son of it so they their phones they come out with new ones all the time like an iPhone which is the top of the food chain in America right they come out once a year yeah once a year they bang out a new phone Huawei is cranking these fucking bad boys out every couple of months in every couple months they have a giant leap and improvement more megapixels better night vision more storage more battery life more this more that a higher pixel density in the screens so their phones literally are the top of the food chain phones it's really kind of fascinating because a lot of American phones like look at that bad boy p40 design gets leaked showing triple like a camera yeah so they're using like these fucking incredible cameras yeah sort of yeah and so it's sort of similar to the iPhone it's more interesting yeah yeah we copy them a lot yeah now that's true I mean that's a design element of it yeah and but I think I mean look at look at wha wait you know we hear we've been banging on about them for for some time Congress has been trying to take actions and at the end of this past year end of what 2019 Huawei reported you know some 20% increase in their revenues yeah of course so we're talking about them well I know a lot of people did before this sort of makes you doing I'm actually I'm actually yeah you know I got a contract with Huawei so that's why I keep banging on the Google thing really fucked them up because before that a lot of the tech guys in America were buying them from Amazon or buying them from websites and then just putting their SIM cards in it and using it even though 18t won't sell them and Verizon won't sell them but now that won't even work anymore because now you don't have access to the Google Play Store if they could figure out a way to sweet-talk their way back in the Google Play Store there would be the biggest fucking cell phone company in the world they offer developer 26 million dollars to build apps for his flagship phones after being banned from using Google's App Store yeah but the thing is like building the apps is not good enough you have to have apps that everybody is using right right you make your own Instagram nobody gives a fuck you're not on Instagram are you on Instagram it says there are major apps available through hallways app Gow such as Amazon snapchat tic toc and fortnight but most popular apps are still missing that's interesting Amazon's like fuck you we want some money yeah oh yeah is it his new life now or just his girl I think this girl she used to be married to the former owner of the UFC or the one of the she used to be married to one of the current owners of the UFC oh all right so she's she like stepped up man the owner of the UFC is a very wealthy man too but these not Bezos wealthy no yes he's on next level wealthy that's like if you get divorced for sure you're getting a billion yeah he's got a hundred and fifty he can give you a billion just to shut you up just like just give her up Billy let's get this over with yeah let's get this over with Marty it's sign the paperwork but I could see he's a handsome man I could see him attracting it really hot I don't think right hey you know look at that face Wow he looks like a guy in a movie he looks a little like Paul Shaffer in that picture you remember the old David Letterman's old bandleader look at this yeah you're right it does yes Dave yeah Jeff Bezos reportedly threw a star-studded birthday bash for his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez look at her she's like such a WoW she should have someone should Photoshop dollar bills on her glasses like but she is not a cop it's not a really good picture her she doesn't look she's kind of she's got a weird she's hot as fuck really yeah but she's you know she's hot as fuck in almost 50 okay 50th birthday yeah okay I wonder what he got today buyer whatever the fuck she wants yeah Jeff Bezos I guess sorry at 50 they keep it together it's a different 50 yeah when I was a kid when a lady was 50 that was a dead lady she's barely alive but now 50 elves they're in the gym doing squats there yeah it's just it's different they exercise people now imagine you like cruising gyms looking for girls doing squat no I'm just saying I've seen 50 year old that aren't very good like who's that what's that girl Elizabeth Hurley oh yeah oh she's a fucking movie star her Instagram is all pictures of her and her underwear you know why because she's likes good three anywhere yes and she's 54 she's 54 and she's she knows the fucking sand is thin on that hourglass there ain't a lot at the top the top chamber Dana lot left yeah so she's like she's showing them goods she was she was with others she is your aunt Hugh Grant that's right look at hot chiz yeah 54 like if you saw her give me another one of those Jamie when would he got there do another one of them bikini there's a bunch of bikini pictures that they're like if you saw her somewhere you would go that's not 35 year old woman for it's different these days yeah well there's a lot of I will say this though there are a lot of filters out there now that's true I know I could look 12 but look at that one in the middle that doesn't look filtered the one that was my party picture yeah that looks like her part yes she definitely looks oh yeah she's right like she just came off the set from Austin Powers yeah she's fucking hot man she's still hot like legitimately hot like people go yeah but she's 54 you go shut the fuck up what do you hate what's wrong with you man yeah look at that one that with the right with their boobs whoa what was that taken though last week that was just on mono ruined trees my right your fuck yeah just putting in the work yeah that metal picture I'm not sure about the middle picture with the two soldiers say I'm not sure whether it was that taken in Liechtenstein every soldiers I'm from what's up with their fake mustache do they are painted on mustache got a whole army of guys like that that they come out on the battlefield dressed like the London Coliseum do they make them put rosy cheeks on no those are those are natural yes that's the British weather did cold and damp gives you cheeks weird yeah is that they have fake mustaches all right the ballet The Nutcracker make that picture bigger and cut those dummies out she looks hot and look at the one right next to it good to go to the one picture right next to that one Jamie that one yeah whoa she's hot okay she's hot as fuck it's quite the piece of jewelry she's just there yeah between those oh yeah it's just amazing that this is a that women can do this now like you didn't you couldn't do it like you couldn't do that before it's like you hit a wall and that's welcome to the wall but you know here's what I would say they would they would argue I think those same hot women would argue that for dudes it's different you can be a schlub at 54 right you can't walk guys you don't give a shit you just kind of like oh joy whatever yeah like Jack Nicholson's a thousand years old and still banging twice yeah yeah he does that sidelines at a Lakers game you think oh my god no I know what it is it's like most women find him repulsive but you don't want most women yeah you want the women that don't find you repulsive and when you're really famous that's a considerable number that's what's crazy yeah no that's true so like there's 300 million plus people in this country that's probably of dating age let's just let's just say there's 70 million women that are that could be dating Jack Nicholson look at them they're probably probably off but let's say so 70 million that he could choose from let's get crazy let's say it's a hundred million that's quite the picture 100 million 90 million of them would think he's disgusting what the fuck out of those 10 million and those 10 million that are left five million ability he's not that bad and then 1 million would be like I'd fuck them right now that's what you want right now 1 million I live here North Dakota they just want to come to LA Jack's gonna make me famous he blew up my Instagram yeah yeah I can see that I can see getting in in your in your Kia and driving across County to fuck yeah there's glasses man just look everything about cheeseburger fries doesn't give a fuck go there he's back in his heyday is young that dude man like shit back then look at that college that was that was back when a collar meant something yeah yeah it is amazing yeah and you know he keeps on rocking in the faroe ya know yeah but that's that's that's what women would say is it so how come we have to have new you hear that all the time right how come you know society requires us to you know do 1,000 squats a week and and you know their right to smoke over here he doesn't have to do anything and he's still pulling thought but the response to that would be you don't even have to be rich hmm if you're hot and you're a woman you just have to be nice yes a guy who's hot good luck what are you gonna get out of that you ain't getting shit out of that stupid goddamn job ya know you got it you'd I think that's I read some study somewhere and I've put it out of my mind but I do remember there was an aspect of it that did say well you know what what do women see is an attractive element of a man and to this day it's still the ability to provide Yeah right just like you know it's a smile she has on her face she's not bummed out to be with him now we've been a different story if we were cavemen and we had to rely on Jeff basically provide right that's not happening right but but yeah I mean it's anyway so yeah so Amazon's doing business with with the new door yeah that's kind of yeah tick-tocks a Chinese company already right and no is there some talk I mean they've been making efforts you know to limit the ability for tik-tok to do business you know like I think the US military's is instructed all personnel to stay off a tick-tock you know or not - yeah really yeah again because of the same concern the whole idea is this platform because you know these these companies can argue all they want to that they're independent from the Chinese you know authorities but ultimately the Chinese authorities knock on their door and say we would like access to your database because we want to Hoover up all the information about every US military person you know that's stationed wherever or you know they're gonna do it they're trying to get one of the top tik-tok executives in here really yeah interesting now I don't even understand Tech Talk I mean I I know the kids kids usually kids like it look at this make tic toc videos it's considered a cyber threat lieutenant-colonel Robin and Army spokeswoman told military comm we do not allow it on government phone there you go that a cyber threat an effective tool for reaching young people of generation how old is Generation see they're 12 what is it my daughter is 11 it's fuckin all about tick-tock yeah teaching me tick-tock dances I'm learning my daughter literally she thinks it's hilarious she's teaching me tick-tock dances and we practice for like fucking half an hour but what is it is it just another version of like little videos okay little videos but my 11 year olds really into it Mountains all think it's hilarious I was gonna say I Drive I Drive slow go to his basketball practices and occasionally there's you know two or three other knuckleheads in the car and they're all that's all they're doing is they're talking about comparing tik-tok videos or I think we're yeah yeah I can't I can't I'm too busy I'm not interested YouTube started as just a cat videos and so many videos and now it's whatever it is jump on board James just saying it's not do you think I should jump on you shouldn't not jump on board let me ask you this isn't oneplus isn't that a Chinese company as well find out what that is one plug because oneplus is accepted right I mean oneplus monsters a lot of things they make really high-end phones as well how come they don't get the same kind scrutiny I suspect they they do it just hasn't hit the press and me tick-tock blew up I guess as a app that well kids you know I can so it became but I didn't realize generate how again how old is Generation Z is that a like a twenty I don't even know what that is it's below Millennials it's like the next next thing whatever so it's below Millennials okay that's when we're really fucked with that's when we really get to see the fruits of our labor let's check out the ten year old you know not to disappear our rabbit hole but I agree I think we have no idea we have no idea what technology is how it's going to impact in the long run we don't have enough of a test case yet right and I can look at my kids in there and just within my little microcosm of my three little dudes their sort of their attention span right and their ability to and you can see it impacting it and you can see it impact the way that they study the way they learn the way and I don't think you know again I'm not a Luddite you know but I don't know that we're doing ourselves any favors right and I don't think there are we're doing ourselves favors either and I don't think there's any way of pulling back from him mm-hmm there's no like you could tell your kids to pull back you can maybe get your friends kids to pull back but culturally no one's pulling back from this stuff it's they're getting more and more immersed in their phones more and more immersed in apps and Internet and in this big is the big thing is apps to me they all get on these little social media apps like whether it stick or whatever it is yeah and they're all direct messaging and looking at each of this stuff and it becomes a giant part of your life you know these kids like you look at therefore like my daughter has friends that don't have any restrictions on their phones my daughter is like a time limit on our phones yeah one hour in the whole day right other than that you know you have to do yeah you have to do that but she's got a little friend that doesn't have any time and this little friend like you would think this girl like her fucking skin is growing on to this phone she never goes anywhere without this phone in her hand and she's always looking at it like she can't talk to anybody for five seconds without looking at her phone checking tick-tock checking that but that's what she getting that from her parents and people see I mean I mean how many times have you sat in a restaurant and everybody the table stared at there from yeah right or you get into I got on the car rental bus today and I dropped my bag on the thing and I stood there and I looked down that bus and everybody was there at the phone yeah right I mean at least that's dead time right you just sitting on a bus waiting to get to those let's check my email real quick that makes sense that's not a bad time to use your phone in the old days you'd start up a conversation with the guy next year so you're from Omaha huh and now you wouldn't know where I was going with that you could you see anything suspicious yeah this fucking guy talked to me on the bus yeah I know what that's all about he wanted something he referred to as a conversation that's my favorite if you see anything suspicious call this number everything suspicious yeah see something say something yeah what do you think about this have you seen this latest dispute between Apple and the government what's the latest well you know we had the shooting down at Pensacola and so it was a Saudi soldier who was down there for flight instruction and and killed three people in the classroom they're finally taken out by deputies because we don't allow our soldiers to carry weapons on on a base and anyway point being is that when this happened he had two phones Apple I think one was a five one was a seven and so the FBI got the phones they went to Apple but asked for assistance with the first one hi on which way much fun they were asking for and Apple claims that yeah yeah we provided assistance we gave him access to iCloud data backup and and some transactional records and you know what they were asking for and then they went to Apple I think just a week ago or so with requests for assistance with a second one they subpoenaed Apple a couple days later said you know we need assistance getting into these phones I'm still the same problem that they had you know three or four years ago but the San Bernardino yes and so we had that big you know kerfuffle where they were you know saying like apples not assisting they're not helping us get into this government had to go to as it turns out to an Israeli forensics group spent a lot of money to get cracked into these phones anyway so bill Barr the Attorney General came out just you know yesterday past couple of days and he's been lambasted apples saying you know you're you're hampering this investigation you're not helping us in terms of dealing with this terrorist incident and Apple saying you know what the fuck we are providing some assistance so it's it we're back in that same thing that we were in four years ago where you got this battle over access and and you know pushing an investigation forward and the concern over privacy what did they want that Apple's not willing to provide well they want access to the phones you know the idea was initially they were trying to get backup sorry a a backdoor in that could be used by law enforcement to get into the the iPhone so see in here Trump wants Apple to unlock the Pensacola shooters iPhones here's why it won't what is that well first of all this is CNN which is strychnos it's all phone it says we have always maintained there's no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys backdoors can be exploited by those who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers Apple added today law enforcement has access to more data than ever before in history so Americans do not have to choose between weakening encryption and solving investigations we feel strongly encryption is vital to protecting our country and our users data yeah but I don't understand like what are they looking for that they won't let these guys find it's one thing that like backdoors but I'm not talking about a backdoor I'm talking about like there should be a way that they can get into the phone right there should be a way that you can not just the iCloud backup but you could open up the phone and do it with like the Apple should have like some some skeleton key or something like that well that's and that's what the that's what they're saying they're not gonna provide they're not gonna provide its software solution to allow them access to get into these phones but what else could he have on his phone if it's iCloud backed up like an iCloud backup is essentially your phone but it's in the cloud right but you can also turn that off so if just but have they turned it off has he turned it off yeah I don't know the details of that but I would have suspect so but there's other data that you can access from that phone that would be relevant to this now that you know I tend to in this situation I tend to side with with Apple I understand the Attorney General you know his responsibility is whatever protecting American citizens so that okay that's he's gonna have this position but you know apples basically saying look we're not going to we're not gonna break the terms of our contract with all the people that have iPhones we're we're you know providing them with privacy and they're also I think saying to some degree look yeah we understand that you know criminals can use encryption right I mean they do right they take advantage of the encryption that's available in the lack of access but so to millions of citizens right who use the iPhones just to keep their bank records or whatever they have on there right and and and so it the encryption benefits everybody in a sense obviously of benefits the criminals now you know I think I also kind of side with Apple at this point because frankly I think technology has kind of made some of these arguments mood meaning that you know there's there are ways to get into these phones now so the bureau or the government doesn't have to just go to Apple and say please let us in there was boxes that the police were buying that would allow you to hack in the phones yeah there's several companies that the companies that are allowing or the developing access or ability to access these phones the competition's been increasing and what happens you know people get better at it and so they developed new techniques and the thing the problem is like bad guys can buy them so they can get a hold of your phone steal your phone from you and then I open it up and then use your phone text people or get weird yeah and so then what are you saying we're saying okay well the company that's got that access point like like the Israeli company or some others some several others out there a gray shift and a few others said that provide this so then you're relying on them to control who they're selling to and some of these companies sell only to the government and to you know whoever is DEA or you know and so I guess the point being is it I don't think the old arguments of even a few years ago that says we can't get in so we need apples assistance I think that's kind of going by the wayside and you know the government does have the ability to get in there at this point so I'm not quite sure why they've they're picking a fight again I don't know all the details that you know but I don't know what possibly they can't get in the phone is that possible cuz they're saying backdoors can be exploited well okay but if you give Apple a phone and say hang on the password of this can you get in there yeah you can get in the Apple can they don't want to hand over that that ability of that software because again it's a it's a commercial issue right for them right but shouldn't it be possible if they don't want to handle a a hand over that software that they could just open it for the government the government doesn't have to get the software yeah the government's made that argument to them before doesn't for whatever reason because I think it part is the optic that says okay well apparently Apple's willing to do this I think they just want to hold the line and say absolutely not because I think they're you know they're looking at this from again from almost a pure commercial perspective I kind of understand that but then I kind of say Bill this guy's a fucking terrorist shooter yeah okay I mean I yeah you've you've you've got a contract with all these people that says okay I'll protect your privacy but you think that would be you know your abdicating your ability to hold them to that contract if you go out and shoot a few people as the guys still alive the shooter no okay so what's the fucking problem he doesn't have any privacy today yeah it's just I just find it interesting we're back having that same organ that we had a few years ago right and we haven't and I think like I said I'm not sure why Barr is pushing this argument necessarily the way he is I mean I get I get what his position has to be given his job as Attorney General but I think we're past that point I think there's there's there's hacking solutions that are legitimately available through forensics groups that have been developing these things they can assist the government to do this so it I just found it I found it interesting it is interesting because it's like I gotta understand that Apple does not want to open up too much to the government's demands and if they do look we don't have a tyrannical government but what if we did I mean like what what's going on with China and Huawei it's like very similar if Apple sort of opens up the door the government and they slide right in and start really using Apple's software to in their phones to manipulate people and access data that they really shouldn't have access to people that aren't under investigation and just like it opens up the door to all sorts of other weird possibilities yeah yeah well it's yeah and it's it's it goes back and starts to feed that belief that you know the government's spying on everybody you know the reality is they didn't either have the resources or the interest frankly or the ability to spy on everybody well this is what I would say to people like who's spying on you there's another person so there's one person that just buys on you all day so a magic aside one person 300 million people in this country there's 300 million spy spy you got one one target that's all you do all day long is watch one person one is the thing about them collecting data like the NSA collecting data and and collecting all your phone calls collecting all your text messages what's the big units bigger threat is Amazon or Google or say oh you know what you turn on your Samsung TV you know what it's doing it's watching you don't watch me your TV's got the ability to watch it it's called up smart smart interactivity yeah so it's got a camera and the whole idea was well I will do this so that we can figure out where you're you know what you're watching and what you think of it so now as you're watching but it could listen yeah so you know it's it's it's the commercial site that's collecting information you know not necessary for nefarious purposes they're collecting it for marketing purposes to make more money which is what they're in business to do but they're that they're the ones that are hoovering up data right that that then leaks out because somebody hacks grabs all that information and then they use it for something nefarious well I get nervous when I hear about companies like Facebook they're thinking about starting their own cryptocurrency mm-hmm and I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa you know I'm not a not believer but I don't I'm not like invested in it like something I'm but I had a guy on several times Andreas Antonopoulos who's a big Bitcoin expert is very very bright an interesting guy and I really enjoyed talking to him about it but he's all in like he does all his banking with bitcoins pays his rent with Bitcoin gets paid with Bitcoin everything is Bitcoin with him and you know he's loved by the Bitcoin community and all this different stuff but at the end of the day I just don't totally understand how you can have so many of them like how many crypto currencies are there and then if you don't have so many of them well who's to say when you could stop making them like right right who said I mean who's the arbiter to say no that's legitimate or that is not I don't know I'm not I don't know I I'm I fall in the category of I don't understand at heaven I do be fair I've been taking the time to understand it yeah and think about everything this is my my take on it you can't you don't have enough time to think about everything so I'm letting that one play out all right so I'm gonna just sit back and when it's a hundred percent when it's a hundred percent all and when everybody's like look bitcoin is it's just like money yeah okay but until then and they kind of predicted it was gonna be just like money quite a few years ago and it never really did hit that but you can buy some things a Bitcoin there's some companies that let you buy computers a Bitcoin sure there's a fair amount of transaction that goes on from what I understand but again I don't I don't I don't understand I don't see how it's backed necessarily you know I'm sure I'll probably get all sorts of comments now like you know you're a fucking idiot being heavily involved in Bitcoin but i buy i buy gold bars and golds real playing them out in the back i've been telling people for gold forever exact legit shit yeah yeah that's the way I feel about it gold and catheters I'm stocking up on both those are gonna be really important in the future but gold is a weird one right it's cuz like why are we still so invested in this soft shiny metal like you know and all the shit that people need why gold I don't like it as jewelry I think it's kind of tacky yeah yeah when I met my my wife I was still wearing a gold chain Miami Vice days yes she still doesn't let me forget that yeah it was it was pretty sweet it wasn't like flavor favor anything it wasn't big and chunky but it was it was I thought was understated it was like a herringbone sort of it was like a Greek Keith oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I lived out in that part of the world for a while and you know yeah so anyway as I was explained to me that it wasn't as happy as I thought it was at the time and so I damned I put it away with all my other gold jewelry and my boys will fight over for it when I'm dead yeah we're gonna let you know they're clean yeah hey hey hey you guys stop with that stupid shit I thought that was a I thought I'm lookin fly yeah oh my god yeah I walked out the other day we were getting ready to go to some function and I come walking out steps it was a casual thing right and I thought okay so and I'm not a really I'm not I'm not a naturally social person in the sense that I don't like to go to big gatherings of people I mean I like going out with to a dinner or just to hang out for drinks with you know like small 6/8 people that I know right and I know I'm gonna get this is where we're going I don't walk into a crowd and go from little group to little group having you know some small conversation I'd not good at it so but we're going with it one of these things so I think in my mind I that I just have so hey I come walking down the steps I'm wearing a cardigan you know and my wife is walking up the steps to get something to shoot we got upstairs and she stops in the stairs and she looks and so as I'm coming I see her stop down there and she's staring at me thinking what and now I thought I liked this cardigan I wanted to shop good yeah I thought it had like a Matthew McConaughey vibe to it and and she's staring at me like what the fuck he said what color is all right pull up a picture of a great cardigan please I want to get an image in my mind yeah oh you look like a picture of Matthew McConaughey in a cardigan must have googled that no I think cardigan where's your big cardigan where I did that was of worry because I thought okay I'm being pretty chill here that was my another word I got from my kids and I just thought that it was it was it was presenting the right vibe I'm going to a party I'm casual and relaxed I'm gonna be I don't know what I was thinking anyways she made me go upstairs and change it yeah well yeah I mean I you know I'm this is my second go-around and I've learned yeah that smartest I used to be okay look see that's buyers club anyway you wanted a cardigan I yeah that's what I'm talking about Jesus Christ look at that he's that was when he was like really silly that fucking guy Wow has never looked the same again since he lost all that weight for that movie yeah he looks he's been drawn out since then that was that's got to be so devastating for your system to put yourself through that kind of shit I think it must be worse than gaining weight like oh yeah look at his face man I mean it looks like a dead man god damn me knocked out of the park in that movie that he did it was a great movie I hope we got paid well enough for it do you can't there's not enough money in the world to make you lose that much weight yeah you know the worst one though was the mechanic not the mechanic the machinist yeah with uh with the fuck Christian Bale yeah Christian Bale did he did the most horrific way cut I've never I've never seen anybody that skinny in a movie I mean he was like legitimately days before death oh good yeah look at that look at what he looked that way how's it that's a computer rendering yeah and then he was Batman like six months later and he goes crazy got on the fucking Mexican supplements it's a back and forth is that back and forth it'll do your body and terrible terrible for you if you can maintain a kind of a consistent weight look at that though Jesus Christ that's got to be it's got to be some shopping in that photoshopping hein no no no if you if you see the movie man he was eating an apple and a can of tuna a day that's it that was all he was eating and he what happens then is your body starts eating itself and so look how you looked and Dick Cheney yeah yeah real fat to play Dick Cheney damn that's like Bert Kreischer fat that's that's a lot of fat right there yeah damn well yeah he's dedicated to his craft but here's the thing the movie sucked so it's like you you almost killed yourself for a movie that sucked did you see the Joker yes what you think fantastic yeah yeah yes it's weird it's really drawing out both sides nobody's sort of like agnostic about it yeah that sucks or it's great right that's what I keep getting those same responses it's a great movie but it's disturbing as shit but it's if there's a lot of weird stuff to it right it's like it's almost celebrating the idea that the system is broke we're just gonna fucking shoot everybody who's rich and light everything on fire and these let these fucking mentally ill people not take their medication and just run things and he was a Joaquin Phoenix first of all he's on another level like his his betray he's always been an amazing actor but that movie boy he they created a work of art with that character yeah yeah I mean it's just you bought into it hook line and sinker that he was as crazy fuck and when spoiler alert when when he shoots Robert De Niro like there's their scenes in that movie that make you just go wow I will say this though my favorite Joker has always been Cesar Romero right there yeah the TV show oh yeah hands down oh well yeah I mean I'm fairly old that's terrible you goddamn crazy day anyway you know he pretty good I'm taking it back yeah yeah not bad I eat kind of you know he's sort of that was it you know yeah yeah yeah Heath Ledger was good he was great too Jared Leto can man yeah you can go pound sand but the Joker's got great Oscar nominations right Suicide Squad is Jared Leto one who's like it's just a little too Steven knew when he's in he's mind Morbius is a vampire and Marv ease into Marvel no no give me a picture good every movies a Marvel or DC Comics yeah I wish had a piece of the action but I remember Morbius oh this is Jared Leto playing Morbius Wow it's super powers and so he becomes a vampire yeah yeah he's like a guy who was dying had a blood disease and he goes like one last thing to figure it out and I guess the vampire bats helped him wow this is crazy and comes back jacked yeah and they start to fucking people up woo when does this come out I think this kinda just put the trailer out the other day so I don't remember the exact well no idea the bats had that ability but okay yes you know it's um oh it's a movie oh I can yeah here's this song or Fline I'm in yeah I'm all in Jared I take it back we had bats in our attic believe it or not we had bats in our attic in Idaho really well I'm sitting outside on the porch one day I know again I'm sorry about this but I'm sitting out on the porch I look up and it's it's the Sun setting and the stink flies out from the top of that the real forgetting is for story brick place and and out comes this thing and then another one then another one we had bats flying out because it's getting dark and they're coming out of our attic so I think you got to be kidding me so we went to a a wildlife specialist who came over and he kind of staked out the place a couple of nights figured out what this story was with him and we got eventually got rid of the bats but yeah yeah just get a tennis racquet no no well it's you know it's there's a baby bats you know and the kids the kids didn't want to hurt the baby bats and so we had to wait for the baby bats to grow a little bit and then welcome yeah no that would have been wacom then you shoot him with your airsoft airsoft pistol but the interesting thing about bats they could they fly out they drop down and fly out but if you stop their ability right to go straight back into the the hole they can't get back home so you create a situation because they can't dip down then fly up and then go in they have to come straight in straight at that well this is fascinating bad stuff but if I had known that they could create that sort of superpower ability I would have I would have kept a common ground yeah then you stay alive forever you don't want that huh no no there's a crazy story about a guy who was I don't remember where he was but a bat flew by and hit his hand just hit his hand and apparently the bat had rabies and he died of rabies like two weeks later seriously yeah apparently rabies is one of those things where if you get bit by something that has rabies they got to get you in right away and they've got to get you in right away and it's once it takes hold you're fucking dead it's a 100% lethal but they can get you if you get in right away but he didn't even know anything was wrong I didn't have a visible sign on his hand bat flew into the hand British Columbia man who died of rabies infection uh yeah so this thing it just flew into his hand and left a small cut he was a 21 year old kid on Vancouver Island and good health authorities confirmed that the patient was outdoors in broad daylight when the nocturnal creature struck his hand and flew away he wasn't doing anything risky that would put him in a position that would you encounter bats dr. Boone Bonney Henry of BC's chief provincial health providers incredibly unfortunate strange circumstance for this young man and his family okay so no visible puncture yeah or scratch marks because a family they can be microscopic yeah the cuts so he developed the symptoms of rabies six weeks after the exposure so it's just as well I didn't send the kids up to take care of the bats riving he pulled over the side of the road when a bat flew in him what that's like a horror movie yeah you know really is not a final destination like you got missed right very interesting horror movie but it's it's it's the idea behind it right yeah it would only be interesting if it was like like World War Z type shit yeah just started but that's kind of a great what rabies is to animals rabies turns animals into these sick really aggressive creatures that want to infect you with whatever they're infected what they want to bite you yeah raccoons Yeah right remember as a kid though it was always the rabies thing was always you don't wanna get rabies cuz he got to go in for these series of shots and your stomach always remember that that was always the story you know you're gonna get why the stomach yeah I don't know that was it was like you know don't don't accept apples on Halloween because I'll be a razor blade it was just sort of like this thing that you always heard as a kid you're gonna get these shots in your stomach so stay away from raccoons yeah whatever worldwide only five or six people who survived or rabies infection holy shit those are the people you got to go to when the zombies come right you gotta you gotta find those people and harness their blood BC is home to 17 species of bats but ten species found in Metro Vancouver Wow risk from rabies and bats is everywhere in BC Jesus Christ 13% of bastok tested positive for rabies thirteen percent I was sort of British Columbia is a really nice place to be but that's in the province amongst bats in the wild the rate is about one percent well you got a fucking horrible infestation up there BC get your shit together what are they doing I'm coming up at forty twenty isn't Prince Harry Jamaican aren't they going to Vancouver we should tell them about the bad thing we should it was not going I forgot to post my shows are for sale thank you I did but not today they're for sale right now I'm doing Vancouver on 4/20 I hope I don't get rabies nice you know what you two bring you know your past loves to get to Vancouver you kind of pass through do you well not really not from here now you don't I'm flying I travel in an RV yes which fucking Chevy Chase family vacation at truckster family truckster Burt takes a goddamn tour bus everywhere Berta's a tour bus with his face all over it crazy asshole have you ever driven across the country you know yes when I was a little kid long long long time ago I don't enjoy that kind of waste of time yeah yeah not even with the kids getting an RV and trial they would go crazy my kids beat me to death I I think it would be interesting if you had like an agenda like if you're gonna go to you know Grand Canyon and then you were gonna go to Zion National Park you get a bunch of different things to do night you had months of time and you can make your way across the country but just the drive for fucking five days straight across the country that that can eat a bag of dicks yeah that's boring I think you're right going to a national parks you know and in Yellowstone for example anybody hasn't been the yells don't go to Yellowstone it's credible so don't go into summertime but input go but I've always I've tried to convince my wife that it's a good idea to get an RV Drive you know and spend a couple of weeks with the kids and and she looked at me like a moron cardigan it's that same look I get so well it seems like a good idea but if it was a really good idea I think more people would be doing it I think once you actually start doing it you're like what am I doing here down all day right my back's killing me the kids are on screen when are we gonna be there what are we gonna be there yeah are we there yeah yeah stop touching me stop hitting me yeah dad yeah well if you're watching screens too like that's not good for a kid to be watching screens eight hours a day all day let's just driving across the country where they're playing with their iPads yeah well you got to take that away from going back to that other staring out the window then they want to talk to you yeah I know tik-tok dances you know your head in that direction I know a couple weeks from now I'm gonna I'm gonna somebody's gonna send me a ticket I'll go to you dancing yeah trust trust me okay I don't there's a lot of guys who swear by that tour bus life though they like it like my friend Sturgill Sturgill Simpson he travels with a tour bus he said he would rather spend the whole day in a tour bus than an hour on a plane like if he's gonna go from one place the other he goes it's like a living room like you just sit down and relax and so him and his band they just chilled they just hang out in this tour bus and smoke a little devil's cabbage and sure yeah I'm eating back and relax and it's yeah I can see that I haven't spent most of my life in airports I get I get I get the idea behind it you're right it is a time suck you know getting from point A to point B but this country is pretty amazing and it is there's a lot to see yeah there's so much to see and we tend to overlook that fact and you know the Europeans always want to make fun of us because you know what 90% of America still not passports then I'd you know you point out well have you have you driven across Texas you know have you been out west have you done these things if it said that many don't have passports I think it's it's a high number yes really the percentage of US citizens that do not own a pass or do not have a passport I have a feeling it's coming up soon what's interesting you didn't even use to need one to get to Canada or Mexico you used to be able to just have a driver's license get right across we had a nice friendly agreement with everybody yeah you just jump across the river no my uncle now what is that whole wall thing going up apparently not I don't know where the wall stands well I but the wall is is it's a great little parkour set up for these Mexican dudes who know how to climb them percentage of the Americans with passports oh it's rising okay all right I take it back then I well it's more than 40% hmm Wow okay that's interesting I mean you stand true yeah look at the 1989 it was fucking nobody look in 1989 it's like literally less than 5% maybe that's what I was thinking maybe I'm stuck in 89 yeah that's yeah that's because the music was great back then so maybe that's why I'm reliving my 80s is that the Reagan days 89 I think that's Reagan wasn't Reagan president back then right maybe no one wanted to travel cuz they were worried about the Russians 88 deal was when I was I was 20 so I was 22 was a 76 percent of people in England and Wales have a UK passport okay I've got a UK passport do you yeah citizen so look at you know work well I'm a little upset with Prince Harry and but other than that it really well humanity he left the throne or whatever the fuck he did now I mean you know it doesn't it make sense kind of well it probably makes sense because you know I don't know that he's the sharpest tool in the box and he's probably thinking I can we can make a lot more money if but they're not supposed to make any money off of being a member of the royal family and yet they've trademarked apparently sort of their their brand Duke and Duchess of Sussex and they're not allowed to make any money off of the royal family so they were they're given allotment allowances you know living expenses much it's a significant amount look they've got a house on the grounds of Windsor Castle they're gonna continue to live in so I guess here's my point they can do whatever the fuck they want but it would have been nice if they told their grandmother so that she didn't find out about it on the news I thought that was kind of it the Queen spotted dick move but yeah that is a remarkably accurate she's so she found out on TV but you know they want to be financially independent you know they trademark to Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a variety different ways apparently and and she's gonna go back to doing whatever she did American hostage into a Kardashian that's exactly what's gonna happen yeah well listen there are in so popular all they need to do is start an endorsing fucking makeup lines and sneakers and watches and shit next thing you know Jed's a millionaire yeah well she's got a massive following on Instagram which I suspect she wants to know well how much do you think they make find out how much they make how much they make from the royal family my pop not public I think they're high vision well he got no bare them yes know that I don't think they're hiding it but I think they make a million a year yeah oh yeah more than that I mean if you got I think from from his mother from I think as an inheritance he get some nine million dollars area then she's probably worth about six million on a row for acting career hadn't know what she was acting in but he's off to Vancouver and the guy doesn't even know there's a rabies issue there there's a fuckin 13% bat rabies problem there buddy right right he's gonna go he's gonna go to Vancouver looking to move part-time to Canada they're gonna start a reality show I guarantee you some creepy producer got ahold of them and go guys listen you're wasting your time over here in England it rains too much yeah no look she's you're pissing away the money she's worth yeah he's probably thinking yeah I'm gonna get us and but then he came out and said well we're not gonna move to the States supposedly he came out and said this is also I can't believe we sound like page six or something but he came out and said you know when I'm moving to the States until office thank you for that the Queen gets but if they're her grandchildren's money isn't oh my god she wrote the Queen received fifty eight million dollars free of tax from the sovereign grant in the 2016-2017 fiscal year and what kind of goofy shit is that why give them more the next year 58 million dollar a million dollars 103 million dollars in the next year it's good to be queen to help finance the extensive renovations of Buckingham Palace we need more analysis pretty impressive but imagine being a poor person and you find out that the queen who literally does nothing is making a hundred million dollars in the year yeah I see this is why I I don't think I could ever say anything negative about the Queen I've it's I think I got a tremendous amount I feel like her like she's you know grand lover but I - I've got because you have a dual citizens yeah I'm yeah everybody's like brainwashed over there yeah but she's I mean but she has been a remarkably consistent but she's got a shitshow of a family think about all the public service she does oh god it's incredible this just this alone a lot of money well think about each wave is now apparently a 103 million dollars that's that's a significant amount no I anyway I don't know how we got down this one but Prince Harry they left yeah oh that's right they left to go to thinking rabies town so she is making a hundred million dollars a year he's probably making ten all right it's a significant amount so I it's you know I get it okay they want to go again who cares but making the money off the royal family and I can't make money off the royal family if the royal brand so it's like you know the idea is you're getting paid enough yes what a witty system they just give them money for free yeah to be a row in the British taxpayers are saying like what the fuck we're gonna keep subsidizing them and you're gonna go to Canada and we're gonna keep paying them and they're gonna live part time here they're not gonna do that any any of the representative representational work or whatever it's real I don't know you got to show up at events well how about the other so you gotta go - okay how about the other prints the one that's Epstein's friend Oh Andrew yeah yeah that was that was what first of all how odd is that guy when they're interviewing him and talking to him it's like what the Queen kicked him to the curb very quick yeah well that's very strange yeah dad what is your take on this whole epstein thing first of all can we just agree that so yeah you sure she's 18 you're telling me that yeah sure does not look 18 she looks 16 no you're sure you sure what up what up shit show that it yeah what a shit show so let me let me ask you this right off the bat er well I don't know ask you he didn't kill himself right I don't believe so thank you no no then you owe me I'm not I'm not conspiracy guy right I mean I don't disappear down the rabbit holes very often but no I don't think there's any way in hell he killed himself Michael Shermer who's the the head of skeptics magazine who doesn't believe anything found out that the tapes were missing and then the fucking the cameras didn't work and then the tapes were deleted from the first accidentally deleted from the first time you attempted suicide and schirmer's like oh is it conspiracy like it was enough evidence that were the biggest get a professional skeptic professionals he doesn't believe anything there's no there's no there's just no I did no way I could be convinced that he offed himself no words ow he knew too much and you know it's it's it's astounding put but yeah what uh what uh what is shit show but hey you know nobody's gonna get to the bottom of anything but that's a crazy one like they got him in the jail the guards are somehow or another getting in trouble so who knows what the guards are gonna say they might get suicided my favorite part was the guy they chose for his cellmate do you see the fucking gorilla they chose for sale man yeah reminded me of that Richard Pryor that'll Richard Pryor movie this fucking guy yeah this giant Goomba this huge Italian ex-cop who is a murderer and a drug runner I mean this guy is built like a brick shithouse and this is epstein cellmate that's like what like you can't even make this stuff up cause he never touched him the of course why would I touch him Nicholas started Leone yeah what is he what it's a timeline of events and quadruple homicides I what it says yeah so this fucking guy this giant likes dogs oh yeah he loves dogs they keep him from all the people that he killed they barked when they're coming around you can grab your gun it's a good move it's it's just crazy there's so many pieces to the puzzle that are so ridiculously obvious and then when you find out that Clinton flew with them at least 26 times yeah 26 times yeah I had no idea no I it's it's it's just one of those things and again I don't I'm not a buyer on these sort of things but you look at it you look at the facts around and you think they just know there's no way in hell yeah what a guy must know you what do you would thought that Epstein would have said to myself I said to himself I'm gonna get killed here if I'm not careful well he probably didn't think it was everything to get to the point where they were actually jailing them you know when they asked God because remember you had that deal where he was on work release so he could just do whatever you want fuck off for 16 hours a day then he had a check into the jail at night yeah and who even knows what that means he might have checked in and just went home again it seems like they they had set something up for him to make it very easy for him to be incarcerated for what should be a pretty heinous crime I mean he would think sex with underage girls and and sex trafficking yeah not just him doing yeah the extent to which and so yeah but then you could look at I forget what her name is they sort of the assistant Giselle yes name because just Lane it's as an estimate but I've heard it pronounced with the S or without so ghilane or just lame okay G rocker yeah so G rockers out there hidin in the bushes in Columbia or something right where is she yeah that's what I was gonna say I mean she must be a yeah you would assume they've to post her at this point or she must have something she must have some fucking kill switch where if the shit goes down all the Clinton tapes come piling out onto the fucking floor of somebody must've brought it around to Glenn Greenwald yeah maybe yeah you know what maybe I should convince oh there she is that's when she was in and out reading a book on ex-cia agents who have been murdered that's literally what she was right reading a book on right wasn't it yeah it was about CIA operatives and the murder so the idea was that what they said what people believe in there's many different versions of what people believe but look how many pictures she posed for us so strange but when many people believed was that what he was doing was compromising a lot of these wealthy powerful people by getting videotapes of them hooking up with young girls including Prince Andrew oh yeah yeah yeah and for whatever reason you know have you heard of anything like this before is this something that's been done in the past not that I've heard of I mean I mean I'm sure it's big you know anytime you see some freak show it's never the first time it's happened right so you have to assume it's happened but to the degree that it's got this level of celebrities and big-time names I mean it works so well and I'm gonna tell you something after the show's over time after shows him but just tell me it's just you want me talking if you whisper in my ears in North Koreans really do that sorry but the North Koreans used to that was there that was there phone security is they would get on the phone and they when they had something really classified to talk about they would whisper hilarity you'll never figure that out that's funny yeah that's how they did it yeah yeah well part of it was years ago I I think they just never believed any any Westerner could understand Korean and I think that was kind of part of it was that they we were all too stupid or we were just so complicated that they we'd never be able to figure out what they were saying in their own language it's the price you pay for being so insulated yeah you never you don't really understand what the what's really going on in the outside world because they don't really have the Internet when was the last time we talked about North Korea Wow just push that right front port but but to gets to get back what can you talk about North Korea but to get back to this epstein thing is that a common strategy that intelligence agencies would use where they would try to compromise people in order to get like what would be the if you had like if the Mossad was doing that and they were doing that and using it does that's the the theory right right yeah it's good it's a good point I'd say from an Intel services perspective I mean one thing I will say it's the US and people's men gotta believe this because I'm saying and they'll say all right it's bullshit he just deal but the US the agency doesn't do that we don't use honey traps we don't do that sort of thing because that's sort of leverage always it's always gonna head south on you and so we don't you know try to coerce somebody in that sort of a relationship and then we can take advantage of and yet other services do the Russians being one of them they do that all the time Israelis yeah they've had some very successful efforts to do that and and if you can if you get somebody in that position well it doesn't matter how they're compromising themselves whether you're putting themselves in with like an Epstein situation where suddenly you've got them you know got video of them with a with an underaged person or whether they've provided a document that they shouldn't provide it's all that's the concept is always the same right it doesn't matter what that what that action is you're you're getting them on the hook or you're getting something that's leverageable over them and if if they don't just go forward immediately say and turn around to their boss and say I'm guilty did this sorry then they're compromised and then you've got them as an Intel service you've got them you can start reeling the hook in because now you know you've know that not only did they do something to be prodded you with a document even if it was an unclassified site if I go to somebody if I'm developing a relationship with somebody some target overseas or whatever you're not thinking all right I'm trying now I'm exploring this person's got access they're in an interesting position interesting job and they've got access to information that we want to know that's priority target and then I want to say okay now I want to develop the relationship a little bit maybe I bump into the person at a few parties maybe we're in the same parent-teacher organization whatever the shit is right now kid play on the same soccer team so then I go and I think okay what do I want to do I want to test the waters a little bit I'm gonna say hey listen you know I understand you worked at the foreign ministry here and you know whatever country you happen to be in how about you give me some documents but instead you know maybe it's something different maybe they work the foreign ministry maybe they work at a aerospace business you know that's a target and you say but you've developed a bit of a relationship and then you say yeah my kids doing this school project and you know it's all about whatever hypersonic flight you know and and you know you know that they work at some you know aerospace company and say you know do you have anything just on hypersonics you know and and you're not looking for anything classified you're just looking for a research paper or a study or something you know and if they come back and say yeah you know what here this isn't interesting you know study you know and they they now that act alone they're not giving you something classified but that act alone means something big right it means there were tasks able in a sense right they responded to your request for information they're suckers not suckers necessarily could be an enormous ly smart person but you know and and smart people get yeah they get you think it's suckered into it I guess you could put it that way but yeah it's so any but then you you go from there then you've ratcheted up slowly you know bit by bit if you've got the timeframe to do it maybe sometimes you know you've got a shortened timeframe because there's a requirement to get something and you got to kind of accelerate the whole process anyway so but I point being is it's tall leverageable and Epstein was obviously getting leverage on all these different people for whatever his purpose was what do you think that's what the question was like what could he possibly a lot of more scientists he went with a lot of like celebrities there was a state well he needed money right well what was I mean maybe he maybe he just who knows maybe he got off on sort of being the the kingpin and this whole thing and and I it's a good funded right so I mean there had to be something valuable that they were getting from it I'm guessing I don't know yeah yeah like I've tried to figure out the angle but I mean I get the idea of you would have leverage over these people you haven't been compromising situations and then they would do things for you but what would they do for you yeah like what yeah what is he getting bill cut it's a good question and providing him with access maybe he liked being close to you know the seat of power or maybe you know he liked being close to what he thought was like a royal family member you know maybe who knows because he had Al's like he had all the money he needed right so maybe it was it was that sort of access that that blue is skirt up I don't know but it is yeah it is interesting but I don't think I mean look it's just like been kicked to the curb obviously they're doing the trolley as to some of the great I don't think I don't know what where they say it's gonna happen yeah nothing's gonna happen already swept it under the rug and there's already new stories out that got our attention we forget about things so quickly today the news cycle is so fast when something happens even something as ridiculous as the epstein case where it's so obvious that he was murdered and then Michael Baden goes on 60 minutes and says this is consistent with someone who is strangled I've never in all my years of seeing people hang they've never seen him with these kind of fractures this is fractures are indicative of strangulation and as one serious-minded do to my god yeah tremendous amount of experience and and you know he doesn't he doesn't blow smoke up anybody's ass right he's very measured and and you know now obviously he was there on behalf of Epstein's brother yes but you know I yeah anyway it's just it is it's one of those things where you think maybe I'm gonna put that down as something we should explore I want to go visit that cop in jail see what he's probably got a fur-lined cell Tony yeah science 72 inch TV wire marks at his hands I mean if you're gonna get someone to strangle your cellmate that's the guy to I mean he's fuckin do it in three seconds he's so big yeah you don't want somebody who's got to take their time because Kevin Spacey dude strangler can take forever hold still want some big gorilla dude yeah yeah well I tell you what if if this new series I'm doing gets picked up for a second season well I'm gonna recommend to the producers they they put the Epstein case on there no it's not quite in line with what we do you sent me a let me I'll forward it to James you get it Jamie so let's look at the trailer for this wouldn't it what is it called its called black files Declassified and what is it based on the Science Channel Discovery Science Channel and it's essentially it's it's a series looking at there's something called the black budget right let's play the let's go talk about it let's go to the clip ladies and gentlemen here black files Declassified listen to that a top-secret aviation program they will neither confirm nor deny the existence of records funded by a mysterious money trail there was a lot of thought into how we're going to hide the various pots of money could revolutionize flight do you think that you'll see man hypersonic flight in your lifetime hello yeah and unleash a new lethal technology extremely high speeds Mach five six that would make these cruise missiles almost impossible to defend against every year more than ninety billion dollars is allocated to clandestine government programs collectively called the black budget each individual operation is a black file I'm Mike Baker as a covert CIA operations officer for over a decade and a half I supervised two missions around the globe my security clearances gave me access to many classified projects now I'm following the money trail to the secrets hidden inside the black files damn I'd watch that over and over again well that's that all that kind of shit's fascinating to me that's got into a sonic flight was that does that mean like settles one of our first episodes yeah when you make when you same and hypersonic like they used to have the Concorde that was hypersonic right no it wasn't no no hypersonic is essentially anything over Mach 5 is hypersonic so what is and and so we don't have there's nothing there's no manned hypersonic flight yet so the Concorde was the speed of sound yeah and this is it faster than the speed of sound yeah five times faster I mean you talk about a mile a mile a second or so for a missile a missile traveling so that's what Russia just came out and and and announced the deployment of a new hypersonic missile or a weapon and that's where the the the the war in space or the you know it's going basically isn't a hypersonic mostly unmanned there's some effort to try to figure out can we create a a manned vehicle it's really problematic because you think about traveling that fast you think about what that means for punching through the air and the heat and the in the the the materials that are needed but as far as unmanned glide vehicles or whatever I mean that's where a tremendous amount of resources being put right now by the Russians the Chinese the US and it's it's it's pretty frightening cuz we don't have any way to defend against it like like the one fellow I mentioned in that clip is that if you think about a trip sort of a ballistic missile it's got a trajectory right it goes up and it comes down you know just like the Cold War days we had we had all the defense's set up you know to intercept Russian missiles coming towards us well we knew what the path was going to be and so we were able to deploy a defense system against this the idea with hypersonic weapons is you have no idea right you've got almost no warning and you you'd have no idea what that trajectory is for those doing so it's going so fast and it's in its adjustable right so it's not just depending on you know a missile ballistic missile goes up and it's going to come down and you know exactly what that path is going to so they can adjust it like they can slow it down you can slow it down you can change direction yeah yeah so you think about this it's it's a it's a big deal so one of our I think it may be our first episode it's gonna be focused on hypersonic sand and it's it's but that's a variety of other episodes in this thing but it's all looking at this idea that the black budget exists it does exist and there's you know each project that whether it was is a project to develop hypersonic flight in which the US government had that whether it's you know advanced aviation threat identification program whether it's the space Force which has been actually around for a long time there's budgets that account for these programs and they have to be hidden somewhere I mean the government's got to spend the money right so the idea being what started this thing off was the idea that well what if you just literally just did follow the money and try to figure out from the money trails how they were developing these projects and could you identify the various projects that these pots of money you know go to and it's turned out to be really it's very interesting I'm subjective of course but it's it's it's pretty good and it's we don't have a specific air date yet you know they're being very mom about it but it'll be on Sunday nights coming to a science channel near you soon so with these hypersonic missiles they can like you can't judge from the path that it's gone so far where it's going right because they can steer them in real time yeah yeah the idea being is it not it's not following a a known trajectory it's not following a ballistic trajectory um so it is it you know and it's it is the the development the effort to try to develop manned hypersonic flight has got a really fascinating history I mean and and particularly here in the US but we're not there we're not there yet that's you know may not happen in our lifetimes just because of the difficulty she talked about I mean I interviewed some terrific people during the course of that which is the best part of this serious being out from my perspective you travel around you see all these interesting things you talk to these fantastic folks right I mean some credible people a former pilot for the they will Blackbird program right this guy you know strapped into this thing and get up to altitude you know on the edge of the atmosphere doing these overflights of Russia and you know gathering it or wherever and gathering intelligence and just the dangers involved in these these aircraft these experimental aircraft that we're being designed and the whole goal being eventually trying to work your way towards its hypersonic man flying these people are amazing and you start talking to some of them and and you realize what people are capable of if they can if they can set aside their fear and they you know they have that risk appetite that's a funny way of putting that risk appetite yeah well I mean they just don't think I mean a test pilot doesn't think the way that you are well you know maybe thinks the way you don't want it not the way I do I mean it's awesome folks but yeah but anyway so yes that's what person like the first person who goes up in one of those things to forget about all the testing and all those structural rigidity documents and all the data and they're everything that's showing you this is absolutely safe like it's not it's not no there's nothing safe about it and and like that one fellow that I there was a little bit in the clip where I asked this this old guy looks like somebody's granddad right you know do you believe they'll be man hypersonic flight in your lifetime he says this guy's the story of this guy testing experimental aircraft to try to get to that point and some of the things that he did and it it's astounding you look at him you think you're not you're not normal and I talked to his wife and and she said yeah it's interesting she's been married to him forever but she says you know I want to interesting things you learn about being married to somebody like this a test pilot or somebody else in a position like that is you know they don't process things the same way they don't necessarily have a lot of empathy because they're just they're just focused on this thing right and they're not necessarily thinking well I don't wanna go up there and die because I'd be leaving my family behind and all you know yeah it's not in the thought process anyway but so that's there you have it ladies and gentlemen what do you think about all stuff about I mean the New York Times had articles about it there's Air Force test pilots have come out talking about encountering flying saucers or unidentified flying objects particularly commander flavor who right had that David for everything yeah yeah what do you think about all that yeah we do you know I'm a shameless marketer we do an episode on on that on a tip on the advanced aviation threat identification program and look again I I always say the same thing I'm not a conspiracy guy I tend to I tend to be very cynical about everything but after talking to some of these folks including forever and and a handful of others who were both pilots and also were involved in the a tip program for the US government for the military there's there's things out there that we haven't been able to identify and I'm not jumping on on the I'm not jumping on the alien train necessary but what I'm saying is that there are things that that extremely experienced pilots military pilots with significant amounts of experience couldn't figure out couldn't identify right and so I'm certainly not gonna be smart enough to say okay this is what it was was it a foreign governments experimental aircraft was it something I don't know but what I do know is that the US government took it seriously enough that they developed their own internal program within the Pentagon to try to sort out the wheat from the chaff right and and say okay what do we actually have to worry about in part because it's a national security issue right if there is a aircraft or if there's something up there that it pilot a military pilot sees for instance that I can't identify alright we have an obligation to figure out what that is because if it's a hostile foreign governments efforts in developing you know craft that we don't know about how to or propulsion systems we don't know about then yes we should be working on that issue the problem has always been that once you talk about that then people that me to go up aliens huh area 51 you know and it kind of gets dismissed but there was a much more serious effort than I I knew about before I started working on this and so I don't know I think you know I've got an open mind about that you know it's it's like that old you know thing about how you know how can we really be the only people out here and or or life-forms out here I don't know that seems you know seems a little obscure for me to believe it seems unrealistic yeah yeah so but when I got like braver yeah that's that's the thing when someone who's that rock-solid rhymes out and tells the story and he's not deviating from his story he's not a guy was trying to make money he's just he doesn't have a history of telling fantastic stories and he knew what it meant when he country didn't come forward and talk about this and you've got the gun cameras and you've got the radar operators who also saw the same thing they saw it and they said it was actively jamming their radar yeah which they say what the fuck and then that the way it moved from 60,000 feet down to like 200 feet and like less than a second and no signs of no there's no signs of any propulsion system ya know there was this there's several things about that that ya leave you scratching your head again I'm not I'm not making a case one way or the other you know that the point of this is to again is to kind of use the money trail as a way to get inside some of these programs and then to the degree that you can without you know to the degree that you can talk about things that are Declassified you know not necessarily try to make a case we're not trying to say it is this or it is that you know but I think we're presenting a lot of interesting information that you know again with this situation with favor as an example you know you come away from it you think okay I'm not dismissing anything at this point mmm just it's you know it would be it would be I think foolish to err or anyway so interesting stuff but was that ever anything that came up during your career no no we now I was pretty much straightforward you know pound the ground through some counterinsurgency operations counter-narcotics counterterrorism operations we never did any counter alien things right that must have been it that was a different operation that was a that was on a floor we weren't allowed to go on to its headquarters seems like if we had to admit it was real if it was something that was real and we were being contacted on a regular basis or at least semi regular basis that would change the way everybody feel about everything yes remember when Reagan of that speech made me give it I think was the United Nations you said to imagine how easily we would come together if we were faced with a threat from an alien world right and everybody's like oh my god he knows something aliens he's about to spill the beans yeah well but think about it me think if you know if that did come out which is what part of the Alaura right is the idea that you know the government's been keeping this from us for all these years and and you know you think about what that would mean not just obviously boom oh my god really there's something going on out there but then sort of that breakdown in trust not that it's not happening already in terms of the government and its ability to you know play square but yeah I mean look area 51 area 51 was was scouted out for use as an experimental you know test site for aircraft and you know made perfect sense well then you get all these experimental aircraft being developed out there and flown some successfully some not and you know locals you know see this jet you know locals being a fairly good-sized region because of the the the distance on these and you know it's understandable how you start getting some of these stories but you know having having said that you know I sat down with forever right and we talked about this a lot for this one episode and I talked to several others and yeah again I come away and I'm not sure what to think but again I'm not closing the book on anything at this point see the way I'd looked at it is if these were unique expeditions from another planet like or whatever it is that comes here some alien spacecraft all they'd have to do is come here once or twice get fed up well not an ad but I used to have a bit about how Earth is the Tijuana of outer space they only come down here when they're fucked up and they want to see a show they don't stay they just come down there what they find it like no one's doing a science expeditions to Tijuana I'm not going back there no way not unless I'm drunk again yeah I was just thinking that if they were gonna come down here and examine us I mean they could just do it a couple of times and people of these stories and everybody else dismisses it like where are they worthy I don't see any aliens yeah because you really wouldn't and you probably do if they're capable of moving at the speed that flavor described where it was just impossible to track with the human eye like they're not gonna view us as a threat No yeah they're not gonna think we're just I don't know then I can look at us and say we want to steal their technology it's the most fascinating thing to me at all the weird what-ifs and who could do this and how could that be true the alien one is the most fascinating because if that was real and if we somehow or another one day gets some undeniable proof like the favor filmed the film footage to gunner footage the the the radar footage that's pretty goddamn compelling but man if there was something like it off the charts well and that's right that's the problem always is and people will point to that and say you know even the gun camera footage is you look at this it's not right a little bit it's not clear necessarily what it is I'm looking at and but it's it's it is more compelling than than a lot of the other you know craft has been out there so I think you know it was it was surprising but yeah the hypersonics is is the of all the episodes we did I think the hypersonics is the one that's really makes you stand up and think this is this is pretty fucked up if you know if we get beat to this we you know you don't want to be in an arms race but you essentially are who are we in the biggest race with is it Russia China China yeah this Chinese Russia would say it's theirs it's them they're claiming that they've got you know abilities and and but Putin is always getting out ahead of his skis and and you know they've got the GDP of a small European country right and so particularly when oil is down where it is and so China's got the resources the motivation they view themselves as you know they want to be at the top of the heap they also have technological innovation at a very very very high level some of its stolen yeah did I say that yeah okay fine some of its stolen all right a lot of it still yeah they're kind of clever like hey we didn't figure it out but it's already been figured out let's just steal it and then improve upon it oh no they can reverse-engineer that shit out of anything right and then they and they do learn from that yeah but yeah it's it's China would be the number one look if you've got a Washington the interesting thing about about threats if you look and say okay what are the top threats and and to face the US the top three have never really changed in decades right Russia China Iran and and then what fills out the top two after if you go for the top five a critical infrastructure here in the US which is actually probably at the top I mean if you say to people in DC what worries you the most they'll say attacks on our critical infrastructure but Russia China Iran they may switch places occasionally but they're always up there in that top five you know terrorism ranks somewhere down lower but it's so China is always gonna be an issue and you know they've been very aggressive both in terms of acquiring information economic espionage you know their military build out you know in their desire to kind of take back the Pacific from us and so it yeah it's it's our primary competitor but Russia punches above its weight and you know the narrative about Russia collusion is just you know captured the imagination for three years now it still seems to hold some interest for some Dems in in Washington DC no matter what happens but and then Iran kind of plays that role because of its nuclear pursuits North Korea's up there to some degree but it kind of bounces in and out of the top anyway for what that's worth but yeah if you suddenly we find you know that favors right or that there's an you know this there's this contact know suddenly guess what we have that's that's it that's a top concern at that that's number one right right yeah I mean the hope is always that if we're about to nuke ourselves into another dimension that the aliens have come down domains just like a 1950's movie yeah yeah he's fucking idiots The Day the Earth Stood Still yeah yeah to Barada nikto Wow remember that look at you yeah that's pretty impressive actually daily Earth Stood Still is a great fucking movie it was a great movie it's weird it's like a time capsule right because what they what they thought it would look like and yeah the robot that's just ya know it is it of the movie I tried to get my boys to sit and watch it not too long ago they're like really dad this is what you spend your time watching and it was interesting I was like a normal thing that the family took the alien in their house yeah come on in stay with a strange person in another land why wouldn't you talk to that kid like you don't even it's a little suspicious I think this guy might be a freak what's your favorite movie it's sort of alien space yanma movie well I like the best one is alien the Sigourney Weaver movie I think first one yeah that's most likely what alien life is gonna be like some horrific parasitic fucking creature that eats everything it finds yeah that's that to me seems likely yeah that seems more likely I remember sitting in the theater when that movie came out watching it and when that when it popped out of that guy's chest he was you know I mean the entire theater jumped yeah they were just crazy people it's hard because you you watch that movie today and you're watching it having seen all the other movies that it's affected and all the other science fiction genre movies and special effects movies but that movie was special yeah in 1979 when that movie came out that was a special movie that was a fucking horrific ly scary movie and it was realistic like there was no cut the shit scenes everything seemed legitimate the creature was completely unique Weaver was hot hot as fuck yeah no I mean let's see pictures literally we should be looking at so no ever and now it's a great movie where a woman is the hero and you're not you're not flinching you're not there's no part where you go what what is she doing she's kicking everybody's ass get the fuck out of here that's that's a movie like like that's a real hero yeah that's a real hero who rises to the occasion in this horrific situation where this ship has have been overtaken by an alien I think that there's I think that there's things out there I don't know if I believe I want to believe that we've been visited but I don't know if I believe I think there's things out there yeah I I'm I'm on board with what the second part of that as well I don't know I find it hard to believe it would be such a secret but you know and also knowing the US government look I mean you know you know it's it's harder to find out from the network when they're gonna start this show than this getting secret's out of Washington DC right so I'm thinking yeah we would have known for now if it had happened but I do believe this other shit out there right I just I can't believe we're it no I don't leave I don't you know I don't think we're but maybe we're being hopeful I can't believe for it I mean but you know but I'm also fascinated to think that if they did know that there's something that something was here that they would visit it occasionally you know dropping it on and occasionally and for a scientific expedition just see what the fuck were up to yeah unless you just got so disgusted the last time they just thought that's it we don't get disgusted when we go visit baboons when we study baboons you know people scientists return you know Robert Sapolsky he spent many years going back and forth to Africa studying baboons and baboons are boring as fuck of many people if you weren't a person if you weren't a person if you were for some from some enlightened race a million years advanced us you would be so fast and to come by and look at people yeah although they probably look at us like we're a bunch of shit flinging monkey so thank you probably right yeah I mean if we had a time machine tell me you wouldn't be amazing if there was a time machine but it could only go back five hundred thousand years ago to the beginning of man like the early I you know whatever ancient hominid that was that was a lot back then god damn that would be fascinating be a fly on the wall and watch these primitive humanoids try to figure out fire and try to figure out hunting and and become what we are today yeah yeah there were probably moments right yeah I wouldn't want to sit and watch the whole thing because I think that would be you know boring as shit I mean yeah come on just get on with it you know chip that rock into a circle do something with it come on but but I think that yeah you're right I mean I think if there's if there's higher life-forms out there and let you'd have to assume they are higher life-forms if they're traveling you know these distances and we again looking at this issues of propulsion systems for hypersonic flight excetera you know would they look at this bunch of you know folks down here and think just not interested I don't know and I think at a certain point in time it would be unnecessary to physically visit mm-hmm I feel like maybe watching us through the Samsung TVs yeah I see it all comes and that's the thing about it all comes back around full circle you got to put a tape over that camera you do I think there's probably you do right how much should it should I mean if people should check this this is again Smart TVs you know if you've got one that's a recent vintage check and you'll see this little little hole along the frame that's the camera and there's a microphone set up an audio system yeah I just put a piece of tape over that's that's your whatever your low-cost solution right you can go in there and adjust and turn it off but you know you try figuring that out right that's like trying to program your your VCR right trying to figure out how to get into your TV into the settings to change the Smart interactivity and then do you also want to trust that that's what's going to happen if I turn it off so that way Facebook that if even if you turn off location they're still tracking it yeah yeah yeah yeah that's why I said I'd again going back to that same old thing which is like uh the government's trying to screw us over they're spying on us say you know what they you know unless you're involved in criminal activity or terrorism you know they honestly don't have any interest but they also don't have the resources and the time available commercial side of things though is different because it drives what they're all about which is making money especially when you sign those terms of agreements the the terms of use agreements like most people just accept it you don't look through it right well there's a regulation there's there's a there's a there's a piece of legislation wherever that outlaws you know secretly videoing you know I forget what it was it was years and years ago it was decades ago but you you give up that right by clicking on agree on those user agreements yeah but you know I don't know anybody who's ever read of a User Agreement California this year consumer Privacy Act allows anyone who resides in the state to access and obtain copies of the data the companies on them and the right to delete that data and opt out of companies selling or monetizing their data California leads away again only for residents of California though they live somewhere else oh I'm moving from Idaho to California yeah spots in California yeah it's a good spot just too many people found out about it my worry is more of social media companies now than than anything even in a lot of ways more than the government spying on us I I worry about the power that something like Facebook has the insane amount of influence that they have on people and how through the use of their algorithms they actually instigate arguments and try to get people because that's how people respond and that's what makes people want to click on things and that's that's what generates revenue so their algorithms encourage you know but and it's you know the idea is that they encourage outrage but they don't really but people like outrage so they encourage you to go seek out like Ari Shaffir did an experiment where use YouTube and the only search for puppies that's always searched for it's just puppies on YouTube and that's all YouTube would reckon does that's all they were recommending to him was puppies he's like okay so it's really not nefarious it's based entirely on what your needs are or what your interests are but so many people are interested in things that outraged them that it becomes a very profitable thing for them when their algorithm shows these people what they want but it's the problem is the people itself it's not necessarily the algum it's not like some the algorithm is some nefarious algorithm is designed to instigate the strife no it's it's taking advantage of human nature to some but it's also I mean it you've raised a really important point because coming up on this election people are talking about oh my god they're gonna hack in they're gonna influence the vote they're gonna not part of the danger is in the social engineering and that wave and it's very clever so that's if if you look at like a recent something that just happened it's actually it's really interesting and you know it's still being investigated but a report came out from a group area one which is looking at hackers and and looking at cybersecurity issues and and it's not a particularly well-known group it's not like a spur ski or some of these others that are out there but they just came out with a report a couple days ago basically saying that the Russians a Russian entity likely the former GRU the military intelligence group of the Russian intelligence service hacked into BIR yzma number yzma is that company in the Ukraine that hunter Biden was sat on the board of right and now you think Oh russians hacked into it and so what happens almost immediately when this report comes out saying a Russian Intel operation hacked into Purisima recently as it was sort of becoming an issue and Trump was banging on about it and you know hunter Biden and there was talk about you know holding up Ukrainian aid if you don't investigate the Biden situation so you'd look at this and if you just looked at it on a very simple level you go wow and I've already seen some of that narrative saying well look the Russians are working on behalf of Trump again and see that's what they're doing they're working on behalf of Trump they're there hacking into burry smih and that's you know what he was complaining about if you step back and you think about what are the Russians trying to do right with all of their hacking efforts all their social media engineering they're trying to create the scent so now what have you got now you're ramping up this story again now you know to what degree area one story or report is correct I mean there's some discussion as to whether it's accurate or not but to that degree that you have to look at everything now with a very skeptical eye and you have to say okay what is the purpose of it why is this a timed leak of information right did they intended in other words that the Russian Intel service they don't do anything haphazardly right that they do they do this with the idea that we're gonna leak this out now because now it looks like we're still you know we're pushing this whole thing we're trying to help Trump we're gonna get that narrative going again right because now we're getting into an election cycle it's interesting stuff it's like after we after Somalia was was smoked almost immediately after social media posts you know sort of Pro very subtly but pro Iranian regime Pro you know sulemani again very subtle but in that vein they spiked and over the course of the next 48 hours massive numbers compared to what had been in the past of you know sympathetic enough to turn people's thoughts right to get that narrative going of like well oh my god they assassinated a foreign leader that's all they're looking to do is create that in the Iranian cyber security forces is increasingly sophisticated ten years ago they probably would have been able to orchestrate sort of that sort of social media work I guess my point being is that we look at things very simplistically right we look at because we tend to look at it through this political spectrum saying I'm right I'm left whatever but you have to step back and think you know what what's what are they doing what's what's the purpose of this and maybe it's more complex or layered than just simply accepting what it is that's being said which happens you know that's ID the danger of social media everyone takes it face value shit that they see on Twitter or whatever and rather than stepping back and going I wonder if the stories even accurate but then you know somebody will post some bullshit half the time it's you know it's just it's whether it's for the left or right doesn't matter or whether it's from a foreign entity you know the state-sponsored effort you take it you run with it next thing you know it's got 10,000 likes and people are talking about like it's correct yeah that's a real problem with today's social media is that these agencies like the internet research agency in Russia did before the 2016 election they really can stir up dissent with these thousands and thousands of social media accounts that they have and they can get people thinking in a certain way they don't get people to argue things in a certain way and you you hear those talking points that these BOTS and these you know these companies that are designed just to stir people up you see those talking points repeated so it is a fact oh no absolutely and then look the Russians have been doing this you know years and years ago decades ago they were buying off journalists to write favorable articles or articles that they wanted to get the narrative out there for it right so they would pay off journalists whether it was overseas or here wherever it may be - and that was old-school right but the point of it right that the the the reasoning behind it is still the same right you're trying to effect a narrative you're trying to affect a certain opinion or you're trying to foment dissent you're trying to create some chaos and and you're right here now with a lot of the social media that foreign entities are doing they're trying to take advantage and trying to drive wedges in so you get you get these things that try to drive and and and create a more of a racial divide as an example whatever it is that they can do and sometimes sometimes they're doing it just simply to create the chaos you know sometimes they're doing it for you know a more specific focused reason but we're not sophisticated and I think we're we're more aware of it now because it's been in the news and we've been talking about some degree but as a population we're not very sophisticated and so they're still gonna take advantage of it and it's not just the Russians it's it's any any nation that's got the resource of the ability and somewhat motivation and sees it in their own best interest they're gonna you know be engaged in this will have a cyber unit that's doing this sort of thing so you know Lee I don't know where it's gonna go but you know I'm you worry about sort of the the impact that it has yeah it's not the you know it's not the the idea that they're going in there to voting machines and switching up data I mean frankly we should be going to a paper-based system I would I would you know if I was in charge I would say that's it no more paperless voting systems get that shit out of here we're not gonna rely on the internet you know what they're doing in Iowa for the caucuses it's all gonna be internet-based voting reporting real for the caucuses in Iowa right you think yeah I mean but again you think that you know whether it's independent hackers or state-sponsored from China Russia wherever of course they're targeting this you know and they're putting a great deal of resource into it and they're there and they've already probably mapped out the interference for structure so you know hey get back to the old days you know if you're targeting a terrorist organization and you start having success picking up coms and communications and gathering signals intelligence on them first thing they do is throw their phones away and go back to the old system of look I'm going to handwrite some message I'm going to to my cousin he's gonna hand it to his cousin and that's all that's our communication system from now on so we should dumb down and go back to the old days and just do a paper system you know which takes longer and there's a pain in the ass but ya can't hack it can't hack it yeah anyway that's just me sure well listen went back to my bernie sanders voice there it's always great having you in here man tell people again when your show well you don't you don't have an airdate no the key mom we need to tell me we'll tell everybody that sound let everybody know
