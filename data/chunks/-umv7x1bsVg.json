this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast was one of the episodes that we made while we were filming the Sci Fi showed Joe Rogan questions everything so what we did when we did that show if you've never seen or heard of it we had a podcast on the show and a lot of people thought it was a fake podcast but it was actually a real podcast and thanks to the generosity of the sci-fi channel we are now able to release it as a podcast so thank you to Tim and Wayne from sci-fi and to Michael and Frank from Arthur Smith that produced the show thanks also to Todd who was the director of the show we had a great time doing it and appreciate it very much and appreciate you guys letting me do this like that like the way we did it I think it was it was really fun to do it this way we did it exactly like a regular podcast just me and Duncan and in this episode we went over what's called bio hacking or wood what I call dorks with knives sticking things under their skin fascinating subject

Joe Rogan podcast by night all day you know what's really crazy thank you your mom after that one your stepdads mm-hmm isn't that like an interesting sort of a snap back from that you know like she's probably around this crazy guy with guns is like yeah the fucker give me a gay guy he had taken yeah so my mom did my dad was like a really violent cop and she married a hippie like when she broke up with him my stepfather had long hair until I was like 15 years old hey like a ponytail whose total complete hippie crazy stoner architect you know yeah yeah well he went back you don't want to date Hunter Thompson you want to be here was that your dad Hunter s Houston shooting shit yeah I still is he is these is he still traveled around in a like our RV just see in the world yeah well now he just no now he's like local in Alabama but he like goes hunting deer still and he like I told you the fistfight thing right no my this is the weirdest thing my I was getting a ride this is a quick story I was getting a ride back from college with my friend Sean recording all this yeah my friend Sean is driving back to uh was it was driving to UM mobile where his dad lip and on the way back I'm riding with with this guy and he's like oh dude I forgot to ask I want to ask you this is your dad's name Julian and I'm like yeah Julian trusts Lee's like your dad assaulted my dad in a bar my dad my dad beat up my friend's dad from in college when did this happen this was I don't we the the assault happened yeah I think before me and this guy were in college together but if you look at the probability of getting a ride back from college with a guy who was a mobile the probability of your dad having beaten his dad up it's so slim it's so slim that like my what are the odds that my that we both go to this liberal arts college of five hundred students and the one other guy from Mobile Alabama his father have been assaulted by my father in a bar those are pretty small odds miniscule it's it's pretty funny too that it would be your dad too because you're like the opposite like I could never imagine you just assaulting someone even if somebody got really mad at you you'd be like alright well fuck you man and you just like get out of there like the idea of you assaulting someone is beyond comprehension so the idea of your dad being this fucking hollow tooth bullet carryin savage beating the fuck out of your friend's dad getting arrested Jesus get arrested in the parking lot two cops took him down and he got my dad came home from high school once with a black eye him in is his coworker they were doing a business together and the business started going bad they got the fucking fistfight and he came home I remember looking at him I was like 16 or 17 or something time and a black I was like what the fuck man are you done with this are you still duking it out yeah you know forty whatever the hell he'll old he was back then well it's a classic it's a classic it's a classic man it's weird a classic man fuck like it was like like think of Hemingway that's was just part of being a man is like you would get in at some inevitable fistfight and in those days it seems like you don't get in a fistfight and there's lawsuits and legal stuff it's just like the other guy accepts getting his ass kicked your the victor and that's it or you get your ass kicked and you forget about it that seems like the old way it is now if you get in a fistfight you end up in you know serious legal trouble you get an instant lawsuit but it was it used to just be like when you see elke smashing into each other in the wilderness that's what it used to be being a man you just run into a guy just start punching each other that was it those were the days back in the good old days before writing shit down was what people had a few mistakes started writing shit down they were like oh yeah okay yeah blame it on Hammurabi call him Robbie's fault and that gentleman is his name is sherrod Sharon Sharon Sharon Sheridan Lucas and they're from grindhouse wetware and grindhouse wetware first of all greatest name for a company or what does that mean so it comes from the name grinders that's what get real close to that that's what we are we're grinders grinders are kind of like what happens when you mix open-source hackers and body modification with a - of transhumanism and wet wares is this you know your body so we're literally grinding our biology there's all these interesting little names that you guys have for ice ball grinders we're grinders were transhumanists where there's a lot of self-defining going on there well it's not exactly that we're self-defining we're just guys who we really like technology and we all grew up with like you talked about growing up with Hemingway and classic men and we were all about fighting we grew up we were we were protected and sheltered and grew up with Star Wars and grew up with these stories about robots I could think and people that couldn't live any longer and had to augment themselves and cyborgs and while cyborgs were really cool we thought they were really cool and you know I was in my 20s when we hit the year 2000 first thing that happened New Year's Eve 2000 and the sock of nothing hitting the wall nothing falling out of the sky I turned to my brother inland where is my fucking jetpack and that kind of summed it up I felt that way my buddies felt that way I didn't realize it but there were a lot of people who felt that way and we were all broke and we didn't know much about science and um somewhere along the line like I guess in 2006 there was a kid in Arizona who realized that he could start stimulating his nerves with magnets with magnetic implants he went to a body mod guy and got an implant done in his fingers it started going from him to a guy in Europe and then like 2008 there was a lady Quinn Norton who wrote for Wired and some other other places and she did it she went out and said it was a bad idea don't do it um other people started doing it okay so well let's let's back up first of all explain what you're talking about you're talking about biohacking talking about doing something to your body that enhances it integrating incorporating technology into your body and the first guy was the guy in Phoenix that did the the Arizona weather was it Arizona was a Phoenix Arizona yeah yeah they did the magnets in his fingers yeah as far as we know that's a first pioneer for far as we're talking and what what benefit is there of having magnets in your fingers like what what did it accomplish Framm um besides making it easier to put your hand on a refrigerator easier I think it's annoying but it would be an annoying moment but you're always getting stuck to things yeah doesn't it doesn't exactly work like that these are really tiny magnets so I got magnets and your fingers yeah yeah I got like got one around there one around there Wow so so you implanted magnets in your fingers yeah why did you do that I was drunk no kidding I'm kidding um I found out about this I was really interested in everything we've been talking about I ran into a childhood friend of mine who got it done last year and when he showed me what he was doing with it I had to do it what was he doing with it um it gives you the ability when you implant the magnet in a nerve dense area of your hand when you were around an electromagnetic field that magnet vibrates and so you can feel that now there's property of our brains called neuroplasticity when you provide a stimulus over a course of time like about 6 months your brain starts adapting to it it starts building something new and I was always fascinated even as a child of the idea of having an extra sense not necessarily like ESP but just an extra sense or be able to hear a sound that no one's ever heard before or see a color no one ever seen before all those stories from don't do drug pamphlets that are like I can see the music I can taste sound that sounded amazing to me so when I heard about this extra sense I jumped at this chance to incorporate that in my body but what extra scents the extra sense of using these magnets to detect an electrical field or to vibrate during electrical fields that we were saying yeah yeah how you define an electrical field um it's our station it's an electromagnetic field so anytime that an electron travels in a straight line you have a magnetic field that's coming out kind of in a circle around it okay radiates around it right um if you have a coil a coil of wire and the electrons going through a coil there'll be kind of like a doughnut shaped magnetic field around it so those sort of fields that property of volume and property of frequency they vibrate at a certain certain frequency and they're loud or soft like a transformer like will actual transfer oh yeah building that high absolutely so if you were near that with your fingers having the magnets in them what would happen - um I can feel those sometimes when people would ask me at the beginning what it was like to feel this stuff I would describe it like an effort of effervescent feeling like bubbles it felt like bubbles and it was really interesting - it felt like bubbles yeah like how does that work um what's the weirdest explanation for some of that or description I feel like bubbles yeah I don't even know what you mean it felt like fizz yeah kind of like fizz like my pop-tarts like pop rocks rather sea foam I think is what any phone I don't know um froth like dog frog every person that has the implant uses completely different language yeah it's been really fascinating to run into other people with implants and talk about this stuff because we are describing the same phenomena and it's like you're asking me to describe a color that you've never seen before how am I going to describe squat its squat was that blue no its squat is it purple no it's like tasting an orange oh so it's orange no is is there any negative repercussions to having these magnets installed in your body um well the first time someone actually said something that made sense as far as a negative thing I saw a speech by coin Norton where she said hey don't do this this is a bad idea hers shattered which had her magnetic implant shattered shattered okay so when a magnet receives either a lot of heat or a very strong force it loses its magnetic pole but more importantly these magnets are made of rare earth elements mine's like a cobalt alloy those things aren't really healthy to take inside your body if it shatters so this is perylene coated some people use silicon crazier people use hot glue and so it's essentially it's poison you're dealing with the toxic yeah sorry when if it's not covered when if not when a burst in in her she actually consulted a doctor and the doctor was like well here's the thing we could go through all the trouble of pulling it out but so tiny and it's so little that's really not going to bother you and so they left it in and over the course of time that magnet pulled itself back together she never got the sense back but it pulled itself back together yeah and it didn't Harbor a creepy little creature if you guys are interested moving around inside of her fan she break it what she's stolen slap a cop car something how would you have gee chef she didn't say furious masturbation I have no idea furious yeah possessed eyes rolled back one shoe on screaming like a like a tiger caught in a barbed wire fence hopefully wasn't cranked it could be cooking if I had to guess but that usually doesn't happen with with the magnets massage I don't have a vagina so I wouldn't know how could you know what would happen when a woman's in the middle of a furious masturbation session in early shadows on a thick fucking a half a pound of meth just slamming at home you never know are you asking how can we imagine what happened how does a magnet get shattered that's just a good guess is anything yeah like maybe her orgasm was so strong it admitted a magnetic feel messed up horny as fuck maybe on top of an old truck middle I'm just coming up with a scenario how do you did these are under you these are under your fingers no that's that's a lot larger but if you guys are curious about magnet yeah yeah there you go so I need something for your cock that's that's enough you know just in a cleaner way of expressing this question are there any gentlemen perhaps that have these magnets put in their nether regions I have no idea I don't know I think so it's been spoken about it's been spoken spoken as if baseball can doors have been written on our website somewhere uh it's been spoken about and you close you can get that to your face sorry the better you should look right up to your face usually or move your chair yeah when it comes to stuff like that people talk about it right and then don't do it oh so they saying hey man but thinking about putting magnets to my car just so you start thinking about their cock well is that what they're doing that's what they're doing and then your forest hate me no Mike he's gonna put magnet says cock like why we sitting around talking about Mike Scott it's a lot of shit to talk about the world with Mike tricked us Mike brought up putting magnets in his cock he knows how to reach you guys but okay if you can't just talk about sex that's too easy now he has to talk about what what do you guys like you guys like putting magnets in your body so he starts talking about magnets and Skog but people are in it with Mike absolutely I hated totally serious this is I figured it out I'm Mike Oh Jackie okay but uh people already do that with body modification yeah they do right stuff Pierce I've seen allegedly seen some stuff online of others horrible ideas you know that someone followed through with with horrible like guys splits his car the guy is only one guy that's like saying Bigfoot's only one thing there's a lot of Bigfoot you're saying more than one guy's flame yeah yes we do supercar why do you do that supposed to feel phenomenal Bose doesn't it fall apart when you're having a hot dog that's been sliced and thrown out right here that it's kind of like shooting like a shotgun Oh Daniel says that Christ Wow this crisis I think you guys I think you caught your dick and then you just tell everybody it's awesome you don't want to meet you're an idiot is this like when they told me like we're going to have a clutch yourself in the face contest and I had to start first exactly exactly the preposterous you guys are in a way what you're doing is you are turning yourself into a lab rat with the intention of gaining a kind of low-level superpower like a really really low on the scale of superpowers the ability to feel EMF fields is that what they're called yeah to feel that that's a really low power but it's still you have more superpowers than me I can't do that you're still ahead of the majority of your species but there's a risk to this you're risking your life so that you can feel what it's like to be a refrigerator magnet anything that you put in your body risk getting sepsis from there's a risk of sepsis so yeah there is a risk what exactly is sepsis that sounds like septic how does it mean means some sort of infection yeah and there's a bacterial infections of any sort so I've had a buddy who's a surgeon who's told me hey don't do this is a bad idea right good for you you got that done but don't put anything else in your body because any implant can go septic can go bad yeah I got my nose pierced in Venice Beach when I was 15 and you should have seen that man well up oh my god it was just so nasty ma'am I need my nose got swollen I pushed I remember pushing against it in front of the mirror and just like the amount of pus like where you get proud of the amount of pus coming out you know that can kill people they case staff like that and the ones of eating your whole nose off oh yeah man I got lucky you know you should never get your nose pierced that's a ridiculous thing but and there's no superpower and that you just look like a dumbass what he said I'm with them um so this is a tangible extra sense though this yes abilities to detect a magnetic field I mean yeah you really can do something that Duncan or I can't with your body because of these additions it's it's profound it's something I didn't understand when I got it done um what started out like feeling bubbles um now like I'll go to Home Depot and I'll be feeling stuff because it's oh my god so fun to feel stuff feel the next person he's feeling um mainly magnetic stuff freakin on Home Depot touching all stuff oh my gosh it's um no but they're just hands down by the lawnmowers some magnetic field no hey what's your favorite this means you probably have like people are favorite flavors do you have a favorite machine you like to put your fingers here um Matt I've had situations like I've been around really strong magnets and when I first was around a really strong magnet I felt a feeling in the pit of my stomach like dread and and it made me want to pull away run away from his reward you just clicked no it wasn't a logical thing it wasn't ever getting them wasn't logic well you know the funny thing about that is I'm working out what our sensitivities are there's been a lot of debate among the people who've had these things on how how close we can get to an MRI there are some people who talk about its being dangerous because it can you can move around since this is subdermal it's not anchored in any way like other subdermal body mods are it could move your magnet a bit one way or another someone's gotta test it but there are people who've claimed through the network of people install these there are people who've claimed that they've had MRIs done and felt our magnetic data and that's it whoa but the MRI is a super powerful magnet that starts talking about when tiny ones are like 1.5 1.5 Tesla's but people go into those things with sweater sweatshirts with zippers on oh they do yeah I talked to a guy who operates one in research facility and you that's why I'm like funny you should mention this because okay but that's not standard operational procedure is one poster you're supposed to get down to a robe I just had one on a couple of days ago you take your clothes off that you don't you don't quite you sure they weren't just fucking with you are you sure you don't know anything about MRIs so you get magnets installed in your hand that's crazy man you know going there with the zippers on what kind of a fucking doctor are these people going to it's a research facility it's not a Dahmer's joke okay what you said someone's died from an MRI what is that well I was trying to say is if you have metal in the room when they turn the MRI on a child died recently accidentally because they had an oxygen tank in the room and they weren't aware they had it up in there so when you turn on the MRI the the fucking oxygen tank comes flying into the machine it's a giant super powerful magnet right and it killed them by the time they could shut it off he's already dead I mean it's insane amount of pressure you're dealing with and it's just because someone's dumb enough to have metal in the room so I really find it hard to believe that any doctor would allow someone to go through an MRI with a zipper on that's preposterous oh it's just not what they do so I questioned who you're talking to talking to crazy people lying about putting magnets and their dicks and wearing zippers in two MRIs you're gonna hang it you got to hang out with a higher-quality group of humans a higher quality real humans but but there is there is magnetic shielding because you people that have pacemakers or other implants though they put like something over you yeah stop that what you're a suit or something like that yeah huh that's interesting but you're not doing that with your fingers you just let him tingle if you get in there allegedly don't know and some you really should be careful but but I think I think I think it's it's something that should be tested I think if we've even even if you're not I'm not advocating that someone with this in their finger go in and test it but you know even if you can replicate the consistency of human and put like a human flesh right hang it in and then expose it to something in like 1.5 tesla just to see what happens now you have this which you've already done with the the magnets what is what's the next level thing obviously everything progresses so what it would people considering doing now so we're doing well a lot of people are building devices that interact with the magnets so you can think of it as because it interacts with electricity and magnetism it's kind of like a really low level input you can input anything so if you've got an external device that's measuring say the amount of co2 in the room you could hook that up through a coil around your finger around your magnet finger and have that information transferred into like pulses or how much it vibrates or whatever so you're literally using an external sensor to give you data any data any data you want and have it transfer that to the magnet and after after some training it becomes intuitive so you know some people have done it with mainly sonar and thermal like a like a thermal laser now I know the people have talked about the ultimate the the ultimate future of incorporating technology and human body is the ability to take the mind and download its consciousness somewhere into an artificial creation but somewhere along one is probably to be some steps right just and you guys are kind of taking like one of these steps like by putting magnets in your body when do you think you're going to see someone who puts a cell phone in their body it's not coming is it going to be like a neural interface that allows you to get online with Wi-Fi well we're somewhere towards that that's something else we're working on so our CTO is dream the thing that brought us all together wasn't magnets that was that was ancillary he was love right yeah well of course it was love because we all kind of knew each other we all have this love of the future and we all kind of we're told to sit back and let Motorola take care of it and none of us wanted to deal with that but he wanted to build something that he believed that we have the ability to do this stuff ourselves we don't have to wait for some big company to do it we can do it cheap we can do it ourselves design it ourselves and since we know people who can install magnets under our skin why not an implant why not well the goal was to have something so basically what it does is it's a it's a rose compass that electrically stimulates you it's probably here on your calf and it's always pointing north so that you always have an intuitive sense of where North is now if you've got if you've got the chip talking to some external thing you could hook it up to a map system like Google Maps and be like yo take me home and then you have an intuitive sense of where home is always what's ads wait a minute but hold on wait back that up you have a compass installed in your body and the body how does it run it just runs on the magnetism that's in the compass it's all mechanical is that what Sonic's involved right it can be powered wirelessly so it's got like a wireless coil on it so it's powered yeah an external yeah okay and so you can like hover it over that's that's what the the dream is and what is the method of communication to the mind that explains where North is or how to give so it's in the same way that you're using a really simple system in terms of the magnet you're not using any magic it's just vibrating for this it's just applying a very very small amount of electricity enough that you can there's there's a sensation so it's not like blaring and it's not shocking you but there is a sensation is this completely theoretical the idea of being able to find your way home or is really we we have parts of it parts of it built and actually when we came together and we had that idea we said okay this thing has way too many features so what we're going to do is we're going to build we're going to build an implant that's a kind of a halfway step to there so that we build the ground towards it and that's actually it's actually this thing here and so what this thing does is it actually it's a quantified self health metric and this is a this is just going to take data you can check this out this uh takes medical data and sends it to your phone uh so if you can imagine having maybe six months worth of your medical data and it's your data it's not anyone else's data your data and you can do whatever with it and so we wanted to kind of make do a half way project so that we get familiar with implant technology and then move towards really cool shit the iid I understand the idea of a compass I understand that you could power it somehow but what I don't understand is how the compass is communicating with your mind so it in the in the same way that the nervous system is is communicating with your mind it's not uh it's not sending it wirelessly to your brain right there there are things in your body that's communicating to your nervous system that then goes to your mind right so you're literally uh you're literally making a new mini organ that or another part of your body that interfaces with your nervous system through electricity and then you're just saying it's like a vibration or something it's like a low-level pulse or something yeah it's a low-level pulse yeah I understand that I understand that you would get a sensation but I don't understand how it could be directional I don't see the Meccan well well it's it's a it's a rose compass right so what does a rose compass mean it's uh so it's got a clock yeah it's got north south east west and then like north west oh that's called a rose company yeah okay so it's a compass yeah and yes it's it's a compass okay and so let's say let's say I'm facing north uh-huh the stimulation will be going this way right but if I if I turn it's going to start so start stimulating its directional interact at wherever the north is it gives a signal morning where the arrow goes yeah so the arrow it not just doesn't just act as a beacon it's somehow or another like sends a charge off in that direction yeah and then it becomes intuitive once you start determining what that signal means like it becomes a new thing sort of like sound like you hear sound over here and you know it's coming in that direction yeah so that's crazy it's intuitive in the sense that like I would be working with with some of the guys in a lab and you know they've got two or three implants and they would say leave the soldering iron on and they'd go to reach to grab something and just them feeling this the the intensity of the soldering iron would make them pull back right and so it's not like they're like oh shit that that might kill me let me pull back it's more like it's more like every time you reach over here something screams at you or or something like pokes you it's like people who are allergic to cats if you're around the cat you know like you that's a kind of superpower a person who's allergic to cats can walk into a house and be like you have cats right you have cats they can sense the cat because they start using excessive you're dirtying you know clean your eyes yeah well generally people have cats tell the rows little creatures pretty filthy when you walk into a house and you get that first woof to the cat litter box mixing it with old bananas so nice you have a box of shit in your house yeah nice dirty box of shit and a filthy which animal want peering out at you from the wall ready to smother your baby won't sleep and suck the breath right out are you so gonna do strike ass that's awesome um I think this people like you make me love existing today because the idea that there are human beings at this very moment and I picture you in a basement in in basements with straight razors shaking cutting themselves open and just putting chips inside of their mouths they doctors novelists done man oh fantasy leather strap bite down a twig now guys are both right you're both kind of right see ya you don't all go to a doc what doctor do you go to what doctor do you guys go to I thought your evil dr. evil and I imagine that when before you guys put the magnets and you're snorting oxy cotton or like you're definitely on painkillers right do you land on I got it done with no pain meds and oh my gosh um it was a rush I never had that much bad to do hon dude stand there with a razor blade in the photo says I got a ton without painkillers and oh my gosh what a rush I I don't it was he was it was something else the amount of endorphins you got it's it's trauma it's trauma your body is going through trauma and your body releases all that endorphins all at once you you definitely you don't remember the fact that you just got going to shock I don't wear I don't advocate people doing this uh to I know so I don't advocate in the book opening themselves up at all uh that's not going to stop anybody it's too late right now there's already 700 teens with exacto knives putting their dad's wristwatch bandana in mouth well but eat kids if you're watching slot eriously don't kill it never ends well someone already tried it and they're kind of fucked up because of it who tried what um so one of the people that pioneered this this this uh lady out in Scotland called LEP's and in him she did this talk called cybernetics for the masses um where she advocating you know implants and she did it herself she she sterilized uh what is she she used used vodka she's vodka and hot glue to coat the magnets she uh in her speech she told everyone hey I don't care how hard core you think you are get a spotter yeah and as you know pass out and that that to me that to me also used a vegetable peeler ya know that to me that to me is not is not DIY cybernetics that's irresponsible that's a nice ability I'm gonna tell you that when you told me your name that's like don't leave at home with your keys I've seen that speech weapon and I'm yeah and I emailed her directly after the speech because I wanted to get her on my podcast but she first ought to know she was a she cuz she's androgynous you can't really tell but she looks like she fell out of a philip k dick novel like she is you a really fascinating being like it's a really curious being and she seems kind of nonchalant about what she's doing and it reminds me of you guys a little bit because you guys seem to be brushing off the fact that what you're doing can make it so that in 20 years you are just basically a trembling drink machine somebody could put a cocktail in your hand and mix it up because you have some kind of severe neurological damage from the weird chemicals in your magnets going into your brains it could be true you're right you're right totally right we probably would be dealing with something worse than a Parkinson's like state can't get up on the mic now sorry that's um you're right and there are risks um when left gave that speech she gave it with the intent that people out there would see her process and go oh my god you could do it so much better you could do it so much safer and when people are talking about what grinding is about and why it's called grinding that's part of part of the spirit of being a grinder is being open about your processes because you're hoping that someone will look at your processes and go oh yeah I see what you did I see how you made it better I can make it even better and even more say why grinder um so it originates from a comic book called dr. sleepless and there's a Gary Carter dorks no they're not door it's awesome I want to be a grunt a bad thing but you guys dorks and so there's there's not dorks it's not a bad thing I'm gonna or two these are pioneer dork - how dare you your dork I guess I am a dork is it right yeah you read Walking Dead comic books you're a dork oh man that's and you tell me I have to read a pence dude you gotta read him he's a dork that is nothing wrong with it man this I'm wrong with being a dork don't be scared of being a dork okay well fine I'm a much more - I'd rather be a dork with magnets under my fingers I'm gonna be a dork I'd like to be a dork with a love a to be adore but the fact that you guys call yourself grinders out of a comic book that's clearly pretty dorky yeah yeah it is but it's not bad see you embrace being a dork I think the term dork is a dorky turn no it's an awesome term and that's what we wear when we're out there looking for Bigfoot we were two dorks here ug dorks like a Bigfoot by the way having the time of our lives without doors being a door yeah there's no disrespect intended no disrespect it's it's Lee no you're not taking yourself that seriously and I mean you're your whole group AFRICOM sure it's not wrong yeah a part of a part of what we do is is using we're still using the scientific method we're not just like sure well it were what we're doing is we're putting our method out there for it to be criticized so that it's safe in our community right and we're it's not a you know cut yourself open with vegetable peelers and it's not it's not have it's not have the method be held up by the FDA for 50 years it's about knowing what the risks are as an individual and deciding whether to take it or not now that piece of plastic silicon whatever it is what is that exactly made out of it you showed me earlier the chip oh that's that's what I mean on a regular circuit board there's all sorts of bad shit in there yeah what it was it made out of did you know fiberglass copper metal plastic where would you put that inside a silicon silicon shape there's a bio proofing process like a sheath um like a condom silicone condom sort of thing more like a something to a gear you take a CNC you make a CNC mold reverse so this is an unpopulated board because all of our regular prototypes are being tested on bond who on on for function function ability yeah like slow motion outing it heating it crushing it so so crazy once we're confident that we have like something that can handle the stresses that we think someone who would have something in it we're a year which is our goal like get it inside someone for a year and take it out then we're testing bio proofing bio proofing is doing a pressure injected silicone mold oh wow that just sounds like own hurt do you guys have in your coop that's not inside you you what what I want to know though is like what part of the body would you install this thing well Tim's been talking about the forum and why the forum because it would be cool to look down at your arm and see LEDs lighten up on your skin yeah so that's part of it you guys aren't just pioneers trying to redefine humanity you just want to have shining lights under your skin but want to capture some dork pussy let's be honest we didn't think that we did one or two many different types of this is about that man if you you're a super baller in the grinder community if you walk around with a glowing implant on your arm yeah yeah do you guys have a in your community somebody who you know will put anything under their skin like somebody walks around jangling with metal pieces and lights is there is there a person who's got the most implants oh no I don't I don't think we've reached there yet what's the most incredibly extreme implant that you're aware of maybe rich yeah probably fucking rich suffrage blow it rich so he's got he's got a to magnet implant in his finger and he actually has he has a coil like a huge coil that he uses to uh to be able to like hear radio stations and all sorts of craziness they're basically implanted earphones wait a minute he has magnets as for his years in his ears is easiest magnets yeah yeah so he hangs his fingers in his ears OCHA said yeah he's got um he's got like two in his ears fucking yours man that's scary yeah yeah so you'd operate on your ears easy tense magazine this and so what's the coil the coil is like any coil it's stimulating these magnets make some magnet vibrate so he hooked up this coil to a loan amplifier and that amplifier sending sound through it like your standard speaker right he send sound through a speaker coil makes magnet jump back where it makes a magnet force a coil back and forth yeah you make sound so he's using this sending electromagnetic waves to the magnets in his ears his magnets dance around and they give him sound so he was able to use a Bluetooth connection to his phone to hear his phone through his invisible earphones that's insane yes oh yeah it sounds really crazy and dangerous but I think I think there's we're also trying to establish a precedent that we want like we no matter what organization pops up there's going to be cyborgs in the future and I I think on words I I think that that's what we're that's what we're moving towards and I think that we want to move to a future where people are openly experimenting with themselves instead of having to go to one source you know like company X to get their implants and I think there's there's a sort of liberation that you have by either making your own implant or knowing knowing what it was made of who coded it what the code is and and all sorts of stuff so in our community we share all of the information there's there is no weird outside control because everyone knows how it was built if you don't like how it was built you can change aren't you already a cyborg if you wear glasses is there already incorporation of technology into the human body I try to avoid like the word cyborg because the moment that people start saying cyborg everyone's like you're not a cyborg cyborgs are doesn't that mean the lucky some someone made with the machine these things you have sitting on your face and that's how that's how you see better and without those you wouldn't see so good I think of it I thought a cyborg it means that it's part of you now you can't take it off like it's a permanently in you yeah you versus first steps hearing implants those are first steps yeah yeah yeah during but you know what else is crazy and dangerous learning to build an airplane like think of the Wright brothers way back when when they were telling people we're going to try to make a device that makes us fly like birds frightened terrified people like are you out of your mind you're going to fall you're just going to fall to your death and it's true there's an implicit risk whenever you're trying to create some new invention and if you wait for the FDA if we sit around and wait for Apple or for Microsoft to get this stuff passed it is going to be 50 years a hundred years because we need you guys to turn it a few of you are going to have to turn into the toxic avenger a few of you are it's true man you need it because they've made themselves guinea pigs for the sake of our species it's what I think they did because they're enjoying it well it's worse than a 50 year wait and what's what's bad about it microphone what's bad about it thank you no problem what's bad about it is the fact that there are people who can't afford what an implant would cost and like with cell phones I saw cell phones be a tool of people who had tons of money and I saw that with every other technology and when you're talking about modifying your body in the ways that we're talking about it and it seems like it has so much potential to be a useful tool for people to make that something that's only available to people with large amounts of capital seems like wrong well then we go one listen well don't Chris Wiles already address this and quite accurately when he talks about technology being applied in the cell phone world he's like it in ischl II it was just a privileged view he goes now like 70 plus percent of the population on the planet has cell phones you can go to the jungles of Africa you find people who have cell phones people have cell phones everywhere you look which Oh which starts off like it's really expensive but if it proves to be effective it becomes accessible to almost everyone which which is true but but if you look at if you look at waves of technology right in the evolution of Technology the people that get it first get to dictate how the technologies used and they get to dictate the political landscape right so my also so for gel you'd look at the own users don't get to dictate the political landscape that's the one it's also producers yeah but it's not cell phone producers you're talking about people who buy them you're talking about people who can afford to use them now they're saying that they're saying that when you a cell phone is invented when Verizon builds a cell phone they get into an agreement with the NSA and there's code inside your cell phone that makes it so it's tracking you if imagine imagine imagine that technology applied to to some kind of implant imagine if they came up with some neural prosthetic where you know the neural prosthetic that you can attach to your hippocampus that allows you to record your memories imagine if the government invents that and has some secret code in it they can shut off your brain okay but that's not what they were talking about they were talking about privilege to people who we were talking about this privacy propriety priority yeah owning ownership so like with cell phones you have chips that that are really good at decoding video really really good at it right and they're really tiny and you know they're also kind of cheap but they're not open for everyone to you so when you have something like the Raspberry Pi come along they have to beg what's around berry pie it's a handheld computer 35 bucks does everything regular oh yeah it's crazy like that all I think like on reddit it always pops up with some raspberry it's just a super cheap operating system right it's a super cheap computer oh it's a super cheap computer it it's about the size of a credit card it does everything that computers should do so you can get on the net you can use it to do credit card um its credit card palm size it's palm size it's a screen as well uh no you need a screen keyboard whatever interfaces ICU then we'll deal the box itself Wow credit card size I am man they had to make deals with non-disclosure agreements and make all sorts of deals to obtain the technology for their cell phone parts that they're using in there that's not open to everyone so you know in that same way we believe that people create better when they get the keys to the candy store and they can actually experiment with all the parts that are being used and being developed as much as possible we want to encourage that plain playing that's interesting but what I was concerned with more was not the the people that are going to profit or not profit from creating these things I was talking about people getting access to the technology itself and it seems like that's inevitable it seems like if it's effective for rich people it will eventually trickle down to the rest of population no matter what as long as it's really worthwhile but I think that when you've got a particular group of people always getting first access they can always determine how it's used and by the time the technology's democratized to a point where it you know first advantage doesn't matter then there's something else because they're sitting on the capital from the last thing that came along if not this perpetual cycle of well we're making it first so we always get to dictate the terms of which this this thing the legal and technical terms by which this thing or this type of thing but isn't that what ingenuity is all about isn't that why people spend so much money on companies to try to develop products I is not like sort of their motivation the motivation is to capture the marketplace and to be able to sell this incredible thing that they've created I think you're saying it should be locked down no no I'm saying it shouldn't be locked down but I am saying you I meant locked down as in once something is created basically it's available to everyone it shouldn't be available just to this one person that created it yeah I think so and I think I think that's that's the most ethical way to do it in in this case because when you're talking about augmenting humans you're talking about giving them additional information about the world and this is our most powerful tool wherever and so when you when you're talking about super charging this you're giving individuals and a great advantage over others and with any other technology you know there's abuses if you look at nuclear technology right the Soviet Union and and the United States got to dictate foreign policy for how many years because they had that and other countries didn't and I purse you think that that's the scale of power we're talking about when you're saying like neural implants and and all of these really powerful devices I think that the first people that get it get to dictate how everyone else plays so you're essentially what you're saying is that these new technologies are going to be so powerful that once people get control of them they'll literally be able to enslave great groups of people who don't have them they'll have power over them they'll have advantage over them over them and they'll decide or could decide to use that advantage to control the monopolize the use of these technologies monopolize the use of these human improvements these technological human improvements and they'll just hoard them all themselves yeah I mean not in any less anybody ever done that with anything technologies anybody hoarded technology ever for themselves it seems like if you can sell it people sell it well it never it never lasts long but what I'm talking about are the RAM of the the social ramifications right of people trying to hold on to that or whatever because for example everyone every army today uses guns but we are still reeling from the cultural effects of one group of people having guns and another group of people not having guns right we're still reeling from from you know countries hating each other and an ethnic tension and whatever so it's not it's not so much about the technology it's about this is what happens when you when you try to lock it down eventually it's going to spread but you're causing damage by trying to lock it down right that seems to be I don't know it's it's a funny argument it's an interesting argument it gets into a social engineering or socialism point of view where you got to go well how do you decide to distribute technology then their cousin Esau is it like Adafruit Adafruit sparkfun they're open-source and they still make money well there certainly is I mean that's a if anyplace embraces open sources the internet and technology and you know of course Linux and Union there's always been a whole open source community online but to dictate that that's mandatory that's where things get sketching uh you know I'm saying I want I want I'm now saying that I don't want a future where corporations don't sell this I want people to have options I totally understand what you're saying but it goes against every other way we manage innovation we the way we manage innovations people get copyrights trademarks and you create something and that becomes you and then you own that and then you could sell it or license it out to other people what you're essentially saying is that when it comes to a human benefit now no longer do you have the option now you're going to distribute it freely to everybody and I say like you'reyou're you're regulating like in a way that has never been regulated before and that's a socialist idea and it's interesting it's interesting it's different it's interesting it's debatable but what you're what you're talking about is sort of a mandatory type of a thing well I I don't want it I don't want to say hey Google you have to make this this implant open-source what I'm saying is I want a future where you can either get corporation X or you can go to the open-source community be it isn't that inevitable I mean that's what you have with cell phones I mean you can buy an Android phone or you could buy an Apple phone or you can buy some no-name phone I mean I mean eventually if something is worth something people sell it to the point where you're going to have leaders in the marketplace but once it has but once the public has access those leaders are based on the market itself they're based on what people buy what they like what they enjoy you can't monopolize if someone when if everyone's selling a similar product and one person is better that's the one that succeeds yes that's sort of where we're at because of the fact that we don't just say when something comes along like hey everybody has access to this fuck patents fuck trademarks you know that that's literally against the way innovation has spawned human beings to this point in the first place but it but there's other moat there's I think there's other motivations than capital I think that way that shorter motivation and this kind of technology is so much bigger than money what you're talking about is achieving the ability with technology to produce emotions or to create psychic states that is a an amazing thing and that's an amazingly powerful thing so so is calling people yeah but I don't you know what I'd rather have an orgasm helmet than a cell phone let's look at so not either or what's not either/or what I'm saying is cellphones didn't get socialized and this technology shouldn't either well I don't think they're saying it should or shouldn't be socialized I'm just think they're they're they're trying to make an open-source version of this I don't care but anything Motorola's you want to do that for us yeah I don't think they're one of you that before us knows what they're doing what I'm saying is if you make it you shouldn't be entitled to distribute it to everybody if you want to you but you shouldn't be you shouldn't be forced I decide I want I want a future of options and and and in terms of the technology coming out I want the open source and the closed source to come out at the same time because any any lead time between the closed source and the open source again it starts to produce produce problems so I want a future where people have options as to what they're going to get and I think that we've already seen problems with with technologies being pigeon-holed so that you know we can't have we can't not have a smartphone but we know the fuckery that's going on with smartphones right and so there's what what do you what do you do well there's a lot of problems with smartphones you really want to get to the bottom of it the real problem is they're all based on Conflict Minerals the real problem in smartphones is that you follow every smartphone down to its source and you got a little kid in Africa with a stick knocking rocks out of the dirt and that's real and that they can't fix that yet they really can't they don't know what to do yet so they they need these conflict minerals and they're not available in very very many spots of the world and the places where they can get on the cheapest that's where they get them and that's why you have civil war in the Congo that's why you have people fighting over these resources so you got a real problem besides the innovation you get a real problem the morality of actually owning a cell phone because everyone who owns a cell phones piece of shit if you really get down to the core of it I mean this just there's no way around it I think this is this is an unbelievably fascinating subject and I think it's inevitable that we we have this sort of discussion in this argument and I think what we really need is the idea of capitalism or competition merged with morality and ethics and humanity and instead what we usually have is he who gets to the top of the mountain kicks out really in the face it's trying to get up and instead of like pulling people up with them and humanity benefiting and in sharing something like that in an open-source manner because you think it's the right thing to do instead of mandating it I think it almost should be a part of success itself a success itself sort of generates altruism it generates happiness it generates generosity it should it's like once you have some and you care about others you should give you should help you should boost them up and we don't have that attitude this country unfortunately we have this ultra competitive attitude which has spawned so much innovation because of it but along the way it's also made a bunch of fucking assholes yeah you know a bunch of heartless assholes just caught up in the hunt don't you guys think that the it's eventually going to be impossible to keep anything private and yes that it's that it's like - even - so we're entering into a future where there's really not going to be such a thing as secrets we're entering into a future where everything will eventually be leaked in some way everything will well girl you one better I don't think money's going to be real anymore I think we're going to get to a point where there's not going to be one zero they're not going to cut it as far as you have this and he doesn't have that and I really believe that we're going to get to some weird place where just by nature of the just the progression of Technology itself the dissolving of boundaries the access to information ones and zeros are all you have when it comes to money money is just information it's going to get to a point where the idea the paradigm that we operate under we think it's important I keep my stuff you keep your stuff I pay for this you pay for that it doesn't exist anywhere else in nature we've decided that this is normal we're going to get to a point time where you're not going to be able to lock it down anymore you're not going to be able to hold on to money it's not going to mean anything we're going to have to decide what the fuck to do with all the different shaped houses we're gonna have to decide who gets the food but you're it's not going to be real anymore it's gonna it's going to merge into some next-level shit and that's the future of humanity I hope so too but then I hope people don't get lazy as fuck because of that well one of the reasons why people have done so well which is it's also arguable whether or not doing so well is a good thing but one of the reasons is that we've needed to succeed in order to survive I don't know I think do you think we got out of caves well how do you think we didn't get killed off like Neanderthal how do you think we didn't become food for the prey we're weak and slow which is because we innovated and we pushed forth and we we got the fuck away from all the things that are dangerous we locked up cities we invented guns we did a lot of shit in order to make innovation possible because if you go to places on the earth like the Amazon or like Africa there's no fucking innovation okay you're wearing a piece of skin over your dick and you're looking for something to eat and that's what you do every day you get up in the morning early and you go look for something eat because if you don't you die my favorite my favorite example is the when we started growing crops right before most of our most of humans time was spent looking for food right you don't have time to ask you know mom what is that because you were fucking either hunting something or running away from something that was just about your entire life when you are now growing food you now you now have a wide space in your day where you're not doing anything even entire seasons where you've got food stored up so what do you do you start asking questions you start making art start writing things down because you've got time now I think that when I think technology should be about liberating people to do what they want is well I'm sorry to cut you off but what you're saying this to me is one of the great naive ideas of transhumanism which is the notion that if you remove from human beings this then the need for something in other words because the ultimate goal of transhumanism I think is to take the to shrink down the moment between what you can think you want in the moment of having it to nothing so that you instantaneously have something whether it's by neurologically stimulating your brain in a way that's exactly identical to reality so you can experience any feeling state that you want or whether it's using matter assimilators to build something that you've contemplated and all of humanity has been based on overcoming the obstacle between those two things but in overcoming the obstacle you gain wisdom when you're learning how to like play piano you don't just get to learn how to play piano you to learn the discipline of years and years of working to play piano suddenly we can download into someone's mind how to play piano if we remove that discipline then what Joe's saying how you end up with slugs but I I think that I think no matter how hard a dog tries it can never learn calculus there's just an upper limit you just no matter it can study forever and it just it won't happen and so I think that there are things that we just as humans we just no matter how hard we try there's an upper limit and so when you begin let's say downloading information there are some things you'll get easy but there are other things that no one's ever discovered that you now have to discover new ways to play that have never been even you know thought about ever so I think that that when you when you augment when you make yourself more intelligent more capable now now you don't have to do hard work to do what humans can do but you still have to do hard work to do whatever if I can explain it in layman's terms this is technological version of Mo Money mo problems exactly that's what it yes you don't make your problems far more complex like people thought you know what once human beings have supermarkets and you just go with a credit card you have to bring around a bag of gold then no one's going to be depressed turns out at people more depressed they're sad they're looking for meaning they're not hunting and gathering their food they're missing all those those those rewards are built into the human genome they don't get them anymore so what they do they take Prozac and they drive fast and they watch stupid movies yeah well it can I put a little money mo problems Burning Man terms if you take the Tibetan Book of the Dead one of the Bardot's are one of the hell's in the Tibetan Book of the Dead is called the hell of hungry ghosts and what this hell is is these beings living in this weird place have this infinite appetite and anything they can think of to eat immediately appears in front of them so they have the combination of always being hungry mixed in with being able to instantaneously create any food that they want and that creates a health state where all they're doing is eating and eating to try to quench this endless human appetite now obviously we're really far away that's probably coming though I mean if you wanted to think of something that someone would invent that's without doubt inside the realm of possibility we already have boner pills for old dude entered a hill on their deathbed they chomped down a couple of pills they got a zombie cock we already have that you're telling me they're not going to have something where it just keeps your hunger going you never get satisfied you'll be hungry all the time what's your favorite thing to do isn't it eat mine too would it be great if you were hungry always and you could just be a professional eater all day yeah it's that about somebody design fast food think about what people done to their lips people would do that people blown up their lips putting magnets in their fingers no offense I they would definitely do that I I think that that that's a if that's something uh negative about the human condition if we have that technology at some point then we would also have the technology to change it and that's another discussion whether we should get rid of the hedonic treadmill well I'm not even sure that it's a negative I'm just it's almost like a pattern I mean I think whatever it took to get humans to this point in history whatever it took to get us to what we are now it's an incredible process I mean from whatever we were from multi-celled organisms onto this thing with laptops that process is insane and the idea that that process just changes because we add a chip and you know we it's know it's going to be there's going to be like a growing phase and then it's going to become something new just like it became this yeah if this is unrecognizable to some crazy nano tall 50,000 years ago and it's what we will be fifty thousand years from now it's probably unrecognizable to us yeah and whether it happens slowly or quickly what has happened in our lifetime man that the idea of the internet crept up on us so damn quick that we all just accept it as a fact whereas if you brought any other time in history it's the most insane piece of sorcery and magic the world has ever hear just twenty years ago it would have been insane like conjuring conjuring a dragon the idea that you could have a little little glass box in your pocket answers all your questions amazing you could send messages including video from people to people all around the world it's insane everything about it's incredible and it's just a part of our accepted everyday life slowly happen slowly or quickly whether it's big you know slowly we think of it slowly in the course of human history it's a massive burst of innovation but in our lifetimes it's been 10 20 years and then boom it's all here but the idea that you're going to stop at that you know or that we should even resist the next level it seems pretty silly I just can't resist it you can't stop it it's just it's interesting to sit around and go what the hell is it going to be yeah that's what it's weird yeah and we don't know but no I I don't I don't think that a primitive man could have put a person on the moon if they were still worrying about catching that pig no you're absolutely what I'm saying yeah whatever whatever aspirations we'll have in 10,000 years we won't get to that if if we don't do certain things yeah and and I think that a part of a part of humanity that I think we should keep is our need to explore and understand and I think that if we're still worrying about you know getting cancer at 60 mm-hmm we're not gonna get there right I think it's inevitable that we still keep exploring I really don't I don't that's it's why we're here it's it's a whole part of the whole thing there's no getting around that now you got a video to show us uh well we've got something complete queued up with Tim when when our body our CTO got his magnets installed he could got it on video would you okay yeah low and definitely see that stop that up oh Jesus okay just touch it yeah this is Tim this is Tim oh my god oh it's with the sound yet don't know what's that sound hold on pause that pause that why does it sound like that what kind of soundtrack is on that that's so stupid kill the sound just play that because obviously there's something going on behind it we might even be a movie Wow you think I doing the surgery some asshole he found at Home Depot if they were wound around touching down mowers it's okay I could do that for you he's someone who does does tattoo work and he specializes in doing subdermal stuff Wow you know I got shitty tattoos never trust a tattoo artist with shitty tattoos there's a thing called a laser tattoo removal son look into it never trust a surgeon with shitty tattoos especially on his face tessie surgeons with tattoos on their face boy avoid you're gonna go under in ten nine okay so this guy is cutting and he's inserting this magnet into this dude's fingertip this it's a very very very tiny magnet yeah well how how would you describe it it looks like a BB that's been split into like sixes right that's how small it looks it's about two millimeters wide it's a little Jo that's bigger than I thought maybe maybe a little less than two millimeters because that looks really tiny maybe it's just a perspective of this this video but that looks like well under a millimeter what's the charge for this procedure three that's crazy absolutely 100% for fucks you up stick shit in your fingertips and now again whoo you get that stuff done from but you'd be pretty reasonable would be bargain price anywhere between 75 and 150 just like most subdermal body mods what is when you're talking about the future when you guys sit around and you you bring up what's on the horizon what's like the big theoretical on the horizon doesn't have anything to do with like the kind of technology that we see in Google glass being incorporated and like maybe a neural sort of a thing so there was a there's a paper put out a few months ago about connecting to minds of rodents and so there was one rodent if I'm not mistaken in Virginia and there was another rodent somewhere in Brazil and they put this chip into the into the brains of these two mice and put them through an obstacle course and with a roughly sixty to seventy percent crossover rate the other Mouse actually learned the obstacle course of the other Mouse it was connected to you know that's been done without chips though the Rupert Sheldrake wrote a whole book about it it's called the the morphic field and morphic residence and he wrote a book about dogs knowing when their owners are coming home and people being able to tell when people look at the back of their heads and it's a fascinating sort of a theory but he he showed that I don't know if it's been verified 100% so but I know he wrote that he showed that if you teach a rat in one place a maze that rats somewhere else another part of the world will learn that similar maze or that same maze quicker statistically quicker right they've also shown that chimpanzees once they started inventing things to do with tools chimpanzees we they've demonstrated like gum a Ranga Tang in Africa learned how to spear fish by watching people do it there's a picture of this thing doing it it's all a motherfucker it's the craziest thing ever well other rang things started doing it too they once once they start learning things it's almost like it's in the ether it's very strange yeah this is orangutan separated geographically it's not like they could observe each other I don't know a lot of rain tanks but the the bikes definitely separated yeah yeah that's what's odd about yeah but you know what I think man I don't think it's that they're learning they learn it and then it travels somehow through space I think the evolution sort of grows through us you know what I mean like it's are it's it's something that's growing through humanity is are these new innovations so it's not as though one or anything figured it out and sent out a signal it's as though this was just a new phase that was coming through this form of that's very possible but the orangutan initially I've confused these two stories pretty badly but the the mice learned in separate parts of the world separate parts of they weren't connected whether it's a thousand miles or hundred miles whatever it was but the orangutan we're watching people the orangutan started imitating people say they did directly in between human beings but if you really stop and think about when human beings used to be essentially very similar to orangutan it was probably only like a couple of million years ago right that seems like a long time to us but in the span of the universe that ain't shit so the idea that a chimp could eventually if they kept moving along and slowly innovating and changing and finding magic mushrooms and learning how to make fires with rocks they had eventually become some kind of a human thing I mean we didn't use to be people that's the fact I mean pretty much established it's not like all of a sudden we popped up in this form you know figuring out all these shit we got to get away from leopards no we became this like slowly and steadily it's just the timeframe for us it's so bizarre to wrap our heads around with an 80 plus a year lifespan to try to understand what a 10 million year period of development is we can't really we can't get our head into that we don't we don't know what that means and ten million years from now with this stuff when it gets to that weird exponential technology thing that's going on right now we're going to be unrecognizable a hundred years from now sure well that's what I feel like Lucas is getting at by creating an actual and a pathway between two minds or between many minds that we can control using principles we already understand I don't know intuition the way I know the way an electrons going to travel I know the way an electrons going to travel I don't I don't get intuition that way so if we can create chips where I can have something in the back of my head and I go like this and Lucas is like stop scratching your arm because I feel it yeah like that's like that's an extra potential touching your butt how about that like you sitting around your house also no Lucas stop it no you're on a date you're trying to keep it together oh you could get hacked with that kind of technology somebody get hacking it seems inevitable just like you get does like someone hacked Twitter today and I must have got a foul I'm not bullshitting a thousand fake tweets about diet and exercise oh wow I look so good for summer because I started doing this like those BOTS like yeah but got through and just infected to where I think the benefit of having a bunch of people develop their own technologies you're on tracted together well no if you're developing your own technologies for your own implants there's some sort of there's some sort of level of security like some people use max because hey max don't get viruses the way pcs do because people who want to write viruses are targeting pcs because there's more pcs around I think that is a blinking oasis in the desert we're gonna be able to stop anything from getting hacked now absentee I did it well first of all we've learned about the NSA and spying it's already shown that you can't you can't stop it they've already got algorithms in place already copying all your emails because of because of bottle bottleneck technology mm-hmm because because we can't invent our own internet there's we can only use that internet and that internet goes through certain filters it's also because these fucking corporations have given in to their overlords and given up the information and that's that's really work I don't want to live I don't want to live in a future where I've got artificial organs and all of the information from that is being pumped out to some who the fuck knows I don't I don't feel comfortable with that I want I want that information to belong to me first so that I can do it without what I want you know I don't want any advertisements because my liver is doing whatever or I don't want people to be able to shut off my lip my liver because I'm not being a good citizen wha you imagine ii ethan hawke movie there'd be no snowden yeah wilden's brain would have melted out of his nose by now they just turned him up man I'm sorry you guys I gotta take a leak good go to that coconut water crushes me every goat a legs um where where do you think the end game is when it comes to all this bio hacking stuff what's what's what's the end game like where do you hope that it all winds up do you have like a man I hope by the time I'm X years old I can fly I mean is zero is there something like that I I see an end game as as something way larger than people screwing with their body it's it's it's a whole bunch of different technologies that are happening all at once and the fact that we don't have enough resources on this planet to support the population growth and the amount of people that we do have and those sort of things add together I feel like when you look at a company like SpaceX and what SpaceX is doing and and the fact that all these technologies are leading towards longer lives the guy who's doing Soylent the food substitute guy I love those dudes dudes in New York really awesome stuff yeah isn't it a drag kiddos like when they drink and I think all that adds together and I think that you know when we have so many people and we're living a longer time and we have the ability to print anything we can conceive then maybe it's time for us to start moving out to space maybe it's time that we can handle 20 years over to somewhere where we'll be doing heavy construction work in zero-g so that other people can come there and live and be smarter and move forward from there maybe it's time to start space colonization and space colonization that's where we're going to be we're going to be cyborgs that we're selling here foresee could be like download your consciousness into a robot and send the robot into space I honestly think lasted for that's the the smartest way to do it is to be a cyborg if you're going into space so Robbins every everything in space is is trying to kill a biological organism you can't you know apes in a tin can won't cut it oh I'm sorry and I think being able to withstand all of the crazy space weather space conditions yeah the conditions are insane I mean the temperature is instantly death if you step outside unless you have a pressure suit if you get hit by any sort of a solar flare or asteroid you're done we're too fragile even for this planet that's why we've got like this stuff on us yeah I think motorcycle jackets and shit yeah the idea of colonizing space as this mm-hmm I don't think it's it's too dangerous do you foresee a future where we really do download our consciousness into some sort of an artificial human being I I don't know I don't know enough about the technology to say anything definite I think that it's a cool idea but I've never seen anything compelling compelling so I can't I can't really say it's a mindfuck out and then the idea of like a little you a little Lucas running around made out of rubber and it's you your consciousness is in this thing it's out there touching things and moving stuff around yeah and also that you could duplicate a Lucas like if you could download a Lucas then your Lucas getting up on the on Pirate Bay people could just be downloading you and then sending you pictures of their Lucas that they've put in some kind of Habitrail but that would definitely be another that would be another Lucas so because once you start generating independent memories I think you start having different emotions during thoughts about things yeah that's gonna be really weird and you know unless they all interface somehow or another together which she is yeah which which I mean as possible right I mean if you're dealing with look the idea of sending someone a video or talking to someone through FaceTime or Skype in real time off your phone seems like the dumbest the craziest thing ever like that couldn't be possible that wasn't even on Star Trek oh yeah they never even figured that out on Star Trek but it's real the idea that you and your three clones or whatever they are could be experiencing life simultaneously and that you could multitask and that the mind may evolve to concentrate on one person or the other these two sleep are these two are out you know and you're doing two different things at the same time and aware tuning into either one whatever you choose sort of like touching your leg with your left hand while you're writing something your right hand it's going to be a problem man you're going to have swarms of individuals there's going to be Rogen swarms like like Genghis Khan like you know ginga's Khan's responsible for like something like 5% of the population is DNA because they just you know he went on a party in spring the 1200s and the whole world's never recovered you know imagine if you doing that artificially well when you about stuff that's that powerful all of a sudden it becomes really important who has control of that technology in the initial frappin how do you enforce that how yeah it's a race it's a race hold on what what about he wants to create right he wants to create an army well not an army army but a whole group of people he does um did you pay attention to the global future 2045 conference yeah I know about the 2045 guys what do you guys think about that um I like that uh that they're working towards a solid project because that's kind of rare in the transhumanist community there's just a lot of sci-fi talk really and way too much just way too much that's fine that's just discontent and the transhumanist community they're debating on how to handle this correctly he's gotta know what the fuck he's doing with robots but uh I like I like the fact that they have a goal that they're working towards I just I feared that uh there will be a particular group of people that'll that'll get it and then just fuck us for eternity that's your big fear your big fear is someone else getting a hold of the goods first and not on you I the superchip I fear about the type of people that'll that'll get it first because the the world didn't fare well when a particular people said if people got the gun first that wasn't good for a lot of the human species oh it was good for us though that's how you're here dude that's how you're sitting on the internet with a plastic microphone in front of you sucked out of the earth I would verted from oil I would rather I would rather not have to move forward with that sort of contention and fighting and just pee I don't I don't think is that inevitable I mean it with enlightenment I mean we have it whether or not we've achieved enlightenment we certainly haven't but at the highest levels of humanity I think people are probably more aware and tuned in today than at any other time in history and it's probably way safer today than any other time yes even though there's a lot of crazy shit that goes down on a regular basis if you compared your everyday life to that of someone living in Siberia and the twelve hundreds and the Mongols came storming in yeah we live a lot better yeah it's a pretty pretty goddamn good eye and I think that a big part of that is technology and the access to information the access to information is freer than ever before technology more powerful than ever before hence people are safer and people are more moral I really do believe that and I think the idea of people being moral is more accepted as not just something that has to be enforced in order to keep the peace but that's something that's beneficial and something that you would should strive for it's admirable I think that that really might not have existed on such a mass scale in the past even in the past 20 or 30 years I think we're dealing with like pretty unprecedented times and it sounds like really super you know optimistic but I feel like with one of the byproducts of this technology that we're all experiencing is that we're experiencing a sort of mini enlightenment and on a burst of enlightenment because of this information if that is the case I think that this kind of technology that it sort of dissolves more boundary I don't think it's going to lead to a constriction of the people that utilize it I think it's going to lead to a freedom of the species itself I really do believe that I think that if I look at the trend even though everybody wants to think the sky is falling the trend doesn't indicate that that the sky is falling for some people in some spots and the apocalypse is right now if you live in the Congo if you're in Liberia the apocalypse is today that's Mad Max right that's going on right now so but the trend for us here it's obviously not in that direction it seems like there's always going to be a worst-case scenario on this planet but that worst-case scenario is far better today than it's ever been in history and the best-case scenario was completely non-existent even in science fiction novels what's going in that way can't stop it yeah wait until one of these one of these people invent a swarm of nanobots that goes flying out their basement devouring toddlers I mean the thing is like I like the egg it's a fun word to say that's your thing you always go with a dead baby but-but-but no I think that when you're talking about this kind of stuff you're you're talking about acceleration I think you're talking about a technological acceleration and wherever there's acceleration there's an increased chance of hurting yourself if you're on a skateboard going a few miles per hour you're fine if you're on a skateboard going downhill you can wipeout well Humanity is on this technological skateboard that's exponentially accelerating and in that way the role of the individual becomes more and more and more intense which means that with this kind of stuff when the individual has access to the kind of technology that they have today they can do a ton of damage look what happened with those freaks all they needed was a pressure cooker and some ball bearings and they permanently they killed so many people and traumatized so many others in the same way five years from now what happens with when people have access to this kind of stuff it is it is it we are setting ourselves up but they're talking about very unique in individual circumstances in comparison to the 7 billion people experiencing things completely differently all around the world the problem is that you're dealing with 7 billion people that have access to the Internet or at least a good percentage of them yeah and have their stories being told so you're hearing about instances all over the world simultaneously all at once we are not designed for that we're designed to take in information from our local community we're designed to take information from all there's a band of dudes or about a mile away on foot and they're coming here to fuck our women that's normal that's what we're supposed to deal with yeah you're not supposed to deal with a story about a guy in Switzerland fucked his pig to death right you know you know you're not supposed to deal with this guy in Detroit that's got a fake Bigfoot in his cooler yeah I'll bet these are these are all you know this is this is just you're dealing with so many human beings an impossible number of 7 billion and you're getting information from a vast number of those people so you're always going to get these freaks you're always going to get but it's still the trend the overall trends better is way better than is ever exist and I I agree with you there I my hope would be that we become more ethical before we get the power to cause damage so we even though we're more ethical now any ethical mishap at this point would be a lot more disastrous it's not so bad when the most powerful weapon you have is a sword oh yeah well that's not true because gang is calm till 70 million people a divorce and a sword and a lot of people out other dudes with them but they did it with horses right 70 million people over his lifetime with horses but if the scenario is you have 3d printers and let's imagine 3d printers in 200 years where now you can like molecularly assemble stuff and somewhere along those 200 years someone discovered antimatter right so let's imagine that there's a way someone could create an antimatter that when it met matter would dissolve the universe let's just say there's an imaginary technology they could open up no it's out of it what's going to happen you people are going to die and then it's going to force everyone to learn how to be really nice to everyone because everyone can create a fucking antimatter bomb in their computer that's what that's right yeah that's what that's what I hope I mean they say a well-armed population is a polite population I mean the way to take it to the complete next level it's not only a bunch of black holes all throughout our planet that were created by assholes we're gonna have to hop over on our way to 7-eleven so glad there's a black hole over there oh thank you something in transhumanism that people don't talk enough about I think is making people more ethical I think there's only talk of making people more capable and intelligent that's impossible there's no talk of making people nicer for the sake of just living in it in a more sane world because we're nice now but what happens if infrastructure goes away and we become hungry again and we've got lots of weapons around right what happens yeah and it would it would take a longer period to build back up in this state rather than if we were nicer and had forethought instead of having hunger automatically take over and be like well fuck that guy he has food you know we I think that we should start having a discussion about making people more ethical and and being able to empathize with even other species because who knows who knows what we will run into in the future and that might be important well that's interesting you brought that up because that was something that Dmitry Itskov actually touched on in the conversation that I had with him where he was talking about that being important part of this whole movement and that the movement wasn't just about achieving some new technological state it's about Eveline elevating humanity as a whole overall and I thought that was really interesting that he is taking that into consideration that's one of the reasons why in this global future 25 2014 5 that's what it was ranked global future 2045 conference that he had he brought in a lot of religious and spiritual leaders to sort of ask some questions of these different faiths to try to get an understanding what their philosophies were and how they would incorporate this sort of new impending technology this transhumanism idea had it were to come to fruition it was really pretty fascinating stuff I mean he didn't just take it from the technological standpoint it's COFF really delve he dove into the psychological and the spiritual aspects of as well which I thought was unique and admirable and probably pretty important if this thing moves further you're going to have some real ethical questions you develop immortal cyber beings with skin made out of spiderweb silk that's bulletproof I mean there's already that's coming the Train Tien or be there ready dirty figured out how to do that right yeah the transhumanist Mormon that's what yeah what did you say yeah that's the story that's a real thing it's like saying gays for Jesus yeah there's a hilarious there's a humanist Mormonism yeah there's there's a subset of the Mormon community the problem is if you're willing to be a Mormon your fucking willing to be anything it's just matter who rings your doorbell first you know it's like just to sit him down talk him into anything you're a Mormon he believed a fourteen-year-old named Joseph Smith in 1820 found gold and tablets it contained the lost work of Jesus and only he could read them because he had a magic Rock no wonder why they're afraid of gay marriage your family because if someone can talk you to being a Mormon they can talk you to blow on them too that's the joke yeah that's right out of my standup goddamnit you got me on my own material you are the you're a part of a movement right now whether you call it grinders or transhumanism or whatever you're part of a movement where you're focusing on a very specific thing you're focusing on incorporating technology into the body to improve the body and as long as you're focusing on that as long as there's a whole community focusing on that whether or not now it's just magnets in the fingers and everybody's pooh-poohing it and saying what's the big deal is going to come a time where it's a lot more than that whether it's some new invention of something that has absolutely no rejection in the human body so you can add all kinds of things whether that some new technology comes along that radically enhances perception whether it's visual or hearing or thinking cognitive function the ability to read each other's minds as long as you both have the chip it's all going to happen right like you can't text message someone who doesn't have a phone okay but if they have a phone you can text them pretty easy and once we all have something like that in our head and it's like your phone will work with your friends phones oMG I'm looking at you right now and I'm writing this down there's going to be those moments where we we hit some next-level thing that we didn't see coming just like we didn't see the Internet comment we didn't see cell phones come in no one saw that shit coming again even Star Trek they had a fucking walkie talkie man hey Kirk out yeah like say that shut it I gotta flip it over it's so stupid they didn't see iPads didn't see any of that shit and you guys are right on the crest of the wave right on the crest of the technological tsunami getting sucked into the singularity is we're all getting torn towards that waterfall you guys are in the canoes at the very front how far would you be willing to take it if someone came up with some real Steve Austin six billion dollar man arms and legs they just had a saw your shit off and put on some new ones would you be down if you knew if there like a whole bunch it was like fake tits where everybody was doing it if it got to that point I didn't know everyone was doing it we'd all do it yeah came up to like a woman in the 1800's oh it came up to a pilgrim or something and said listen I like I like when you look like but I'm thinking bags of water surgically implanted under your breasts with you know get a lot more attention well the test bags soothe anyone else bag did you have plastic but they would think you're fucking crazy are we gonna think I mean is that us looking at the future about like it's gonna be standard like you still have your arms and legs oh my god girl what are you doing Oh what is that yeah that'll be the end of rape everybody's just fuckin super robot I don't need a new retro thing though to have a man fight off everybody yeah I think that retro comes it becomes an expression of yourself kind of the way that body modification is already yeah no I why would I replace perfectly good arms and legs when I could have extra or maybe that's something something nice really see greedy motherfucker trying to give you a super body like but I have a three dicks by the way then you got arms forearms would be great if Shiva maybe that's what sheep is all about maybe that is the Shiva the future as to her oh shit I never thought of that maybe that's what that was all about some crazy transhumanists from the past maybe they figured out a long time ago and I just barely wrote it down they were so high they wrote down like a few passages in the bhagavad-gita and then went back to eating mushrooms hold on six on is that what it says it but I do like that you asked somebody who has magnets under his hands if he would replace his arms with robot arms the answer was yes of course you would do it in a second even if no one else's what if you could enjoy like foot massages anymore would you replace your legs if they were just numb they were numb but awesome like jumping over buildings running 60 miles an hour but you there a numb you know you don't feel a good massage are you saying that if you're getting joy or grabs or thought you feel nothing I don't I don't think it has to be a trade-off I might have to be what if you keep your cock and balls but the bottom of your sack is numb you only feel your balls if someone squeezes them but the legs on down fake is fuck super-powerful Pistons and then you know nuclear power jump a tree you're saying I could jump over trees but my balls are numb I'm gonna bottom the bottom your balls gonna take numbers yeah I'll take all the way to that what did you think you would be willing to go through an operation that removes your legs I mean what if they get operations like look a long time ago just something like a fake tit would you'd probably die if someone tried to do that to you you would die just from the fact they did not sterilize you you didn't have any way of putting you under sure it was it would be nothing today but back then it was a serious serious thing today girls go back to work in a couple of days right the idea under why I keep going back to fake tits I'm trying to find a non sexist way of approaching this and far as male enhancement but can't find anything that's a standard as the craziness of male share of female breast enhancements one of the weirdest things human beings do but to try to if we get to some point where amputating legs is like nothing yes we're placing with an artificial one but super-powered think that the difference between a breast implant and fake leg right is that already my knees are given out already my my legs are going to wear out stop right there no mercy shake this had three tits three kids rather impressing the chicks tits who's had three kids everything wears out man we're made out of flesh right would have been way better if I said smother yeah mr. Burton again stumbled no so what we do we're out you're totally right there's nothing different between those two but we wear out yeah we did eventually your choice might be shitty legs or better legs that maybe that fixed the under sack and you know come some new technology that even though the under sack is artificial it has sensors and sends it I was just like everybody here to stop pretending that if they had super powerful robot legs you wouldn't get your legs amputated and replaced if I super that wouldn't be what about a fact is they're numb that's a weird thing man now would want someone to do nerve jumping over tree people already working on on prosthetics that that you know that the interface yeah that feel yeah you've already an end we're working towards more sensitive prosthetics that you can deal more all right and you can pretty soon I'm hoping that you can even dial it so that if you're going to do some thing dangerous or painful you can dial the pain down whatever it becomes optional what at that point it why would you keep these these aren't modular you can't switch them they don't rotate what yeah why why would you why because they feel good when you hold someone's hands but you can you can always put over a layer of soft stuff why not just pretend you're alive and jump off a bridge I mean it's at at what point in time do we end this okay you get your whole body is going to be this fake robot body and you're going to take what is the memories of your life and your consciousness and download them into some computer chip and the you rots and this dream you goes wandering around to your battery's run out yes thinking you're really living on a farm with the Waltons meanwhile you're a stupid thing with a battery you don't even know what the fuck's going on with your life meanwhile you're some you're like holding hands on the beach and getting foot massages while all of us are bonding through the universe jumping over building hey well I'm just playing devil's advocate but there always are those people that want to hold everything back know what like those assholes that we were listening to science has yet to explain how a seed becomes a beautiful flower and thus far yes actually it has dummy you know we were listening to these some of these religious people talking at that conference we're just like their ideas were so stupid and antiquated hanging on to the the mysteries that have already been solved right but in what we were talking about before those mysteries that have been solved when we do understand the mechanism behind a seed becoming a flower make it even more fascinating yeah yeah because even though we understand the process now it's still wow that's cool before it used to be while all that flower is beautiful what a mystery I am so glad God brought this to my life now we're like isn't it incredible the seed it got oxygen and then minerals from the soil and that it converts it into energy and it's photosynthesis and it grows and then the flowers bloom this is insane it's like the whole process behind it is like it's like so mind-boggling and enriching like and as a human being that's one of the things that like really jazzes us up when we learn new shit when we discover new shit it's part of like the like when you tell someone something that's cool like we were talking earlier today about this this discovery these scientists in Germany and in Germany in America they have discovered this new type of animal that used to be like an ancestor of the human being that's from 41 thousand years ago they thought it might be in the Anatol they thought it might be a homo sapien and it turned out to be some new thing that they didn't even know existed it's called they're calling it a Denisovan based on where they found it and when we were talking about it before we were all like wha cool wha like there's a there's a part of learning something new and discovering something new that just jazzes us oh yeah and that that's one of the things that brought me to transhumanism the the desire to see the Milky Way I mean learning that we didn't live we couldn't live long enough to explore the galaxy was just to me as a kid was just definitely yeah it was devastating because when you know you're a super geek is like no I grew up watching like Star Wars and and you're watching Doctor Who and then finding out that we're too fragile and we don't live long enough to see anything it's like we can't what we do is we say what's over that hill what's over that mountain let's go where I know it's dangerous but hey there's nothing else to do let's do it and the fact that we we can't cross space because we're just too much radiation orders you'll develop wrong or whatever that to me that was that was devastating and unacceptable I think that that that's just what other option is there but to move forward that's so funny that devastating unacceptable do you heard about the there's a gentleman the University of Connecticut that's the foremost scientist working on time travel roy mallet i believe is a trained mallet I forget I forget his name but he's a professor and he started his work on time travel because his father died when he was a young man and he wanted to go back in time to save his father so this guy is like a goddamn character in a comic book he's like Derek turned a Spider Man book and he's been working on time travel to go back in time and save his father cool that but it's those those things like where you're like I can't imagine that I'm living in a world where I won't get to fly in a Battlestar Galactica ship and fight the Cylons this is ridiculous I think that's what's beautiful about transhumanism is that it has the impulse within it is the same impulse they got people to go onto ships to sail towards a continent that they kind of heard about at the risking everything with no food probably going to die maybe the earth just ends I think there's something beautiful about what you guys are doing even though I do see it as a kind of self-destructive Act I think when you put magnets under your fingers you you aren't thinking ahead you aren't thinking about what you're going to be like in 30 years you know you don't know you cuz the dude who used to have a nose ring for like three days and I didn't kill the nose ring back didn't almost killed you you self-destructive best impulse they to give me the nose ring was not the same impulse that drove explorers through the sea it was just being dumb and high in Venice Beach there's no glory to it what these guys are doing is glorious it's really cool it's just a kind of look it's a bit you have to start somewhere you know you got to got to start somewhere you're starting with magnets in your fingers but by the way if anybody's listening to this the the scientist was Ronald Mallett Ronald L mallet mal le TT from the pH he's a PhD at the University of Connecticut would you like to meet Dmitry Itskov the man who founded the global future 2045 conference and if so what would you ask him you first please what would I ask him I I would ask him what would you say to him I mean it doesn't even have to be a question I do would you would you have anything specific that you would want to talk to him about I would actually ask him what his what his vision of the future is if it if it all pans out perfectly in his view what would it look like because I'm very interested in what his utopia is I'd loved I'd actually love to meet him what about you would you ask him I'd like to meet him I'd like to know what he thinks about where we're going as as a whole as a group of people who are experimenting with ourselves and doing this stuff and I would ask them for the resources that we don't have when you talk about how putting a magnet inside yourself you can't think about the long term well it's not that we haven't it's that the people we talk to we're professionals in these fields they can't risk telling us the answers because they have professional certification boards that would say hey you're behaving unethically you're telling someone to do something harmful to themselves and they don't know the risks they're taking we're yanking your license and so we don't get answers to questions that we need and I think a guy like it's goth could probably put us in touch with a lot of people we'd have a lot of answers for things that could really help us out awesome dudes thank you very much really fun conversation really interesting stuff fantastic subject and thanks for doing what you do and thanks for sharing your information as well and thanks for having us you guys have a great attitude about all this technology too and even though I play devil's advocate about it I really think that ultimately that would be the best way you know if all we all had access but the problem is you know people are weak bitches I'll tell you grindhouse wetware lays Joe goodnight
