like a human body does I make it feels like a human body I did one of those sleeps there today where you wake up and you're just completely like I don't have to do anything so I'm just gonna lay here so it's kind of stretch out a little and then I saw the flashlight on my nightstand like oh I'm right go deep with this shit it was clean had never been used before it was one of these new ones and I got this lotion it was it's like every time I think every time I think I'll just do it in the morning then I'll go back to bed so for some reason that morning nut fills me with energy yeah then I'm like alright time today that P Bunner where you you actually bypass the P and still come before you even go P that's amazing that's that's a talent right there those nighttime boners are so important in hotel rooms to go to bed beat off right before you go to bed like in the hotel room sometimes when you're on the road you have a hard time sleeping yeah that's one of those nighttime masturbation so here's my worst times when I'm on the road flashlight would come in handy and I know I'm gonna only sleep for two hours and have to go to Radio and I'd like to beat off into a sock but I don't I want to hop I want to reuse that sock just for morning radio I don't want to use a fresh stock for it that's when other words are you can't bring the flashlight with you though that's the de la I not something about traveling it's like yeah man you're just you know you're admitting that you can't even go away for a couple days without beating off haha I think such a blatant admission that's committing to it yeah so much so that you're not worried about being stopped at the airport and searched for sex toys they'd have a travel flashlight dude you don't even know what happened you know Veronica Ricci she she went to Israel last week for what went there by herself well they thought she was a spy and so they went through her luggage for like four days and they should have luggage for four days and they they were like asking her because I guess they thought she was like like a terrorist of some sort because there's no other like girls her age you know that they are not Jewish just visiting Israel right now I guess and so she got like she had to buy a whole no she had to buy all new clothes and then she said it was like pretty fucking dirty and scary there's people the machine guns everywhere play-doh bows and she's like - when you see my machine guns and oboes getting played everywhere so just because she came there by herself yeah they thought that she was a terrorist yeah no no that is really good in searching everybody and it was she also bought her ticket like you know last minute like she just wanted to go to Israel get through these commercials so we could talk about this we'll have to say these commercials first day so - bring your flashlight to Israel be careful but other than that go nuts we're we're also sponsored Bionic comets oh and an IT makers

that's effective for me is effective for you there's some things that other people are lured you to that I'm not there's a lot of weirdness when it comes to bodies yeah I don't know how your brain works maybe your brain works better than mine all the time anyway you know maybe some people need nootropics and some people are like those kids that can look out a window of an airplane and and then draw everything they saw an exact proportion interesting that kid oh yeah how does that kid do that yeah I don't know maybe his brain is just working like in that function in that regard like so much higher rpms and mine can ever achieve ever I don't know but I know for me nootropics are effective they are for a lot of my friends to take him a mayhem believes that him he told me the first time I ever gave him to him he goes I knew it was legit when I was fucking people up on video games he goes my video games cinemas would just not fire really yeah because you're - video games are fucking there's a lot of shit going on in your brain like people think that video games are vegging out bullshit military training yeah it's way your Vic played a really intense game of counter-strike or something like that you know I never got into that game but because I was really into more one-on-one games but there was a lot of dudes who would play counter-strike and these motherfuckers were like literally virtually going to war they'd have a land together and then I'll be screaming out and straw auctions at each other they all have headphones on and they were playing some dudes on the other side of the room I mean if I was literally they were at war there was a lot she's going on they had that they had that kid who got a concussion in football and then killed himself like a day later as I said he shouldn't have done anything that would stimulate is bringing too much but he's playing video games all day they're like absolutely do not do that oh my do not do video games and concerts like you need to round a brain for a little while yeah video games are really intensely like intensely exciting for the brain and about a lot of weird areas you know I mean they they get you like you're really in Portage Atal Wars going on you know especially the live one-on-one internet battles when I first found out that you could you could actually play a game with someone live on the Internet I thought that was the coolest fucking thing I've ever heard of the first I didn't know anything about pings so the first time I did it I'd like get a log on the servers and like Sweden was like yeah play some guy from fucking Sweden yeah but it's pretty cool via this huge lag time like your people are disappearing in front of you you're shooting rock it's like you're not getting all the packets from the game because they're so far away yeah so you would have like a big pain time to them we had we had Ethernet in college but so everyone's connected like Armageddon and in-between levels like whoever won that race whatever we'd all just pour out into the halls and start like mocking each other for like while they were loading at the next level it was super fun oh that's awesome yeah yeah there's nothing like what what video games can do like as far as like like that sort of a sense of a team game almost like a team chess match there's nothing like video games I mean chess is a brilliant game it's an amazing game for the for strategy they have for 25 straight hours other video games yeah you don't get tired you want to keep going it's higher to 2 a.m. 8 a.m. you what you wait you get away from the game and your hands are shaking the whole body's pulsating with adrenaline yeah dude we used to have these what these quake land matches where we would all get together and we would like to have death matches were like we would either have team matches where it'd be our team would go against other teams that was always real fun or we would just fuck each other up we would just have melees where anybody was against everybody we just run into a room and everybody fucking chill everybody till there's one man standing we should talk about this on the podcast we should know god damn it it isn't it isn't everybody most people will get this part yeah we have to make our commercials really commercials I have to shorten these no because this because this stuff doesn't get put on I don't think serious radio I know it doesn't okay on its calm you know what to do a rich entering the codename Rogen's save 10% alright cue the music the Joe Rogan experience trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night [Music] what do you do that time would be slowed by half the crafty devil it's DJ red band are each fears in the house a judge out we've been talking for like 10-15 minutes about how fucking awesome video games can be and so the serious stuff starts right now yes yeah Wow sort of do whenever they want it really she just record the commercials maybe maybe not people like it like this yeah some people don't you know listen yeah it's it's a conversation more than anything you know yeah I don't know I think it's more effective I've been listening to us on Sirius radio so much lately yeah it changes my whole look of how we I did this part of the podcast I think real it seems really legit when you're just driving around and you just flip a radio station that's me it's still theirs yeah well it's also the idea of the radio is it's people that don't necessarily want to hear you so you want to be like a little better for them you know the people that already like you like your podcast fans you already got them but if you're on Sirius and you know and they click on you're stumbling through your words and sound like a retard like what who is this yeah what the fuck the fear factor guy has a radio show he's saying I'm too much but he's saying you know every other thing you know you know I fucking hate that I say you know the other one that's better Sam I've been watching that lately you know when I watched MC Chris was on your podcast very nice guy MC Chris and this is not a criticism of him but it made me realize it about myself that he says you know you a lot and I'm like goddamn bitch you do too that's what I said to myself and like you say you know all the time yeah when you see somebody else you consider yourself it's like it's like a trickery for um you know what you you you're pretending you're saying um but you're saying it with two words you know well that's not no no no it's not you know it's it's um fuck what you're saying um what do I say a lot you say you know to a lot of us do I think it's Sam I think it's one of those things that one of them one of us starts doing then we all just do everyone just I think like yes you're a big like yes you say like a lot of girls say like a lot because that's my saying like here I'll give you a different example yeah well it's good when it works over when that is what you say but if it's just like you know this like so I'm like and he's like and there's like I'm like are you serious like is this like no I'm sure like whoa like you don't I mean I'm like I don't get it in our feet in the future somehow we're not talking to have her phone talk for us you said something really interesting the other day that I've been really thinking of and it was a very valid point you were saying that that's what autism is that's what people that are emotionless and that's what it's if eventually you digitally there really won't be a need for emotions anymore it's like that might be the next stage you know a lot of people speculated that what some of the autism spectrum disorders are is the human body possibly making a change possibly getting ready for some new development I don't know it could be about a lot of different things I mean they say there's environmental factors like look like a lot of people say that it's toxins yeah there's been arguments about vaccinations also two different things and but the idea is they don't know what it is or maybe it's that it's just being diagnosed more there's arguments both ways but something's happening and there's a lot of kids that are experiencing this sort of a disassociated behavior you know and it's it's super unfortunate but it might be representing according to people way smarter than me so I don't even know exactly what their meaning by this yeah but they're saying that it might be representing a next stage development of human beings and that as a result of all of our like technological connection with each other and you know being able to text and send pictures and do everything sort of virtually to each other that's slowly the human body is having less and less of a need of the extreme sort of emotional interaction that has sort of gotten us to where we are today I get addicted to the computer and the phone yeah it's like I'd takes me two hours to go just start a shower let me just check this again in the Facebook and Twitter and it's something unhealthy there's something going on with it there's something fascinating about it is just like what we were talking about earlier about video games that we were saying that video games are so stimulated like you never get tired just the light is that a lot of it may be graven the visuals you know really cool graphics it's the challenge and people that challenge it's like again it's like anything well it's also replacing all that those instincts that are in our DNA that sort of got us to where we are today you know I've been watching this sit still what's that sit still and look at things yeah I move your wrist yeah that's I mean that's replacing going out and killing animals that's replacing fighting off the enemy that's replacing you know swimming to safety because your boat breaks a hole in it you know I mean I mean this is the world that we're living in there it's not filled with all these needs for violent explosions and running away from danger and all the shit bodies program for so instead it's it's slowly entering to some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the machines and as it enters into this relationship with the machines it becomes less and less emotional it's less and less interactive with humans less and less dependent on that and perhaps one day ultimately not dependent at all because one day ultimately if you expand on how far how much of a connection we have with computers now and how this didn't even exist at all just a hundred years ago no electronics no nothing a hundred years ago think of it it's not outside the realm of possibility to in envision some sort of a permanent interaction that humans are gonna have with some sort of electronic environment clause that would come out to hold your phone when your yeah something where you know you're much more interactive virtually than you ever are physically and that you will eventually become a part of the fucking system like you will you become an emotional part integrated yeah bored yep aboard for real nuts right it's super possible super possible it sounds like a way more evolved state well you've gotta think I mean we're hanging on to these goddamn emotions these things that make us fly planes in the building these things that make us want to you know Jack other people and I was reading CNN today and that guy in I believe it's Liberia sailor yeah got convicted yeah those thing it's just a message the other tyrants ain't gonna send ship for a message yeah how is that the time you're even close to getting overthrown and you've already done enough shit to get tried for yeah I never even existed I was tailored he's one of the more amazing he just didn't have a good name it was his only problem not amazing yep he snuck through being Charles Taylor and just just fuck that country fucked up Liberia civil war for years what did he do what was his exact crime I don't know probably killing people probably killing maybe Jay walked back in for like a billion times in a row what was his name Charles Taylor uh-huh yeah my friend Jesse I have a few friends in there from Liberia from college they were just like saying it just ruined everything the infrastructure just ruined by the Civil War know the whole the whole story of Liberia is so crazy and we've mentioned this before but if you haven't heard the episode please go and check out Vice guide to Liberia you want to see what's up in Liberia holy shit was that fascinating they went yeah he went Shane went the tourism back oh my god dude it you got to see this guy's video vice guide to Liberia is one of the best pieces of online journalism I've ever seen ever they went into Liberia they explained everything they showed like these these like brothels where it's like a dollar or something like that or 25 cents maybe something ridiculous you know I mean it shows how scary it is there they got to talk to that general butt naked guy the guy who was telling them about how they would kill the enemies babies and eat their flesh he's telling him this I mean he's talking about how we would kill the flesh and eat the flesh of the innocent child and that that would make us invincible and he would fight Nick and they called him general butt naked because he would go to war naked he would shoot people I was naked yeah he's responsible for the deaths of thousands and thousands of people personally absolutely responsible and he became a Christian and when he became a Christian they forgave him hot yes he's a preacher and they forgave him for all of the lawyers because he found the Lord well how's the Christianity it's a crazy story well sorry for it yeah but I mean the fact that he was able to kill and eat babies and they don't want him in jail yeah he would kill and eat innocent children because he had a change of heart soon enough yeah he found the Lord Wow you know that's uh well it's just what really happened he's already rehab yeah yes he's he's out he's good he feels bad it was totally bad I don't think it was because he was hungry he only did it because he wanted to be invincible and he to do see you to be invincible you have to do something unbelievably heinous and in times of war you had to be willing to eat usually you get like their energy I don't know well you're committing so far to terror in horror that it would probably be I mean the berserker mentality that they must have had to be able to do that to innocent children I mean it's just to be completely inhuman like that and then the fact that this guy all he has to do is just learn about some old stuff and learn about Jesus and find the Word of God and where everyone's like all right we're gonna we're gonna let you go dude I know you feel bad you're a priest now I mean what are you mean that is a crazy place to live isn't all this priesthood he can have sex with lemon or he can oh yeah he can fuck okay most priests are allowed right uh yeah half and half no most priests aren't I think right are not allowed yeah that's I mean that's what it is in in Catholicism is nothing Qatar's oh my nose you want yeah Catholicism is nothing you know how to fuck anybody no no fucking done period but I think that's the only one that requires you to be completely celibate right oh yeah other ones just here to be married no monks monks aren't like right back Buddhist monks are not supposed to fuck that makes sense though they go without talking to right they had this interview with Dalai Lama recently yeah it's funny that everybody's like listen to this dude it was a real weird thing he's like you know they asked him about women it's like yo sometimes I'm attracted to women but I think oh so much work and I can't do this Dali Lama says that yeah yeah yeah I love his Twitter I always check it out I used he really is a cool guy I think really yeah that's cool I think so he's all positive it's it's all a llama his uh I mean his argument about being in relationships he's like five cats too much trouble this lot trouble East I mean is he's right a lot of ways so he has sex though he would go have a relationship I don't think he has ever has I think that's what's it mama where did he come from see it's not as born the Dalai Lama oh yeah he's one it's one of those things where you're sort of he's like teeth or something like that it it's what it is is beyond ridiculous oh it's not monster dude I was thinking with Gandhi is it dude that's been like Oh Gandhi's a completely different guy yes they should have met though they didn't I wish they did looks like he's old enough to know Gandhi how old was God if there's a lot of dalai lama's then there was a better one when he was around I'm sure there was Gandhi around 40 s twenties fifties and sixties you see Adam Jimmy Kimmel Co I did that presidents thing yeah what did you exactly say can you pull it up dude that was the what about the D arowana yeah he started who was okay he started strong and I went a little slow for a while and then by the time I got to the marijuana I was like tuned out already oh really yeah I was like it was just going over my head and then he ended strong no it was a uncomfortable situation she asked like how many people here a not smoke pot yeah and like maybe a quarter of the crowd raised their hand and then I think he made his point from there yeah it's play the shit out of it yeah beautiful no there's the whole thing yeah well I bet you can you're a fucking animal watch you find it not only for isn't he a was the Jackass which no offense sir but I think you got the wrong West I think you meant Alan this is the boring person with a perfect body George Clooney just members of the media politicians corporate executives advertisers lobbyists and celebrities everything that is wrong with America is here in this room tonight unfortunately the Speaker of the House John Boehner was on my glass I think from last year Nancy Pelosi believes in lipstick the same way she believes in government too much is never enough Jake Tapley so so far that's how he was discovered some people say Mitt Romney won't be elected president because he's me what are you doing Brian gonna piss off it I'm gonna play a little bit the nomination but he succeeded in getting his message out not just to Americans but to people all a flat the world Ron Paul is still in there he's still sticking with it to me Ron Paul looks like the guy who gets unhooded at the end of every scooby-doo episode it's great to see the Gingrich's here tonight because I guess that means the check cleared oh shit nude I have a question how can you be against gay marriage when you yourself are the son of two gay parents the Michelin Man and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man Oh stumble along marshmallow gamer I don't understand anyone who's against gay marriage and when you really think about it aren't all marriages kind of gay I mean whoa as a man when you get married essentially what you're saying is I will never touch another woman as long as I live now let's put jewelry on each other and dance not that it's any of my business mr. Gingrich but why are you waiting until Tuesday to drop out of this just do it now it's oh it's time to mitt or get off the pot the election process has changed a lot over the last years as you know the president finally gave it's really good is the Olive Garden seeping into the pot part commutative I raise our hands super commitments or super committees our two committees what super cuts is two cuts isn't it TV in 2000's of Madison let's take a quick poll he's so good at this use your hand if you've never smoked pot [Laughter] look at Brit Hume he's high right now he's on his fourth almond macaroon mr. president I hope you don't think I'm out of line here but marijuana is something that real people care about and the fact that you believe Speaker Boehner when he tells you he still has control of his party leads me to believe that you must be smoking some crazy great weed yourself Woody Harrelson just woke up as we know now last year at this dinner President Obama had his team on the way to kill Osama bin said it yeah he's so good at that man that guy is he's in my opinion I think he's the best talk show host alive yeah it's pretty fun he's the best at like weaving between like this sort of a subtle you know he's fucking around like way of talking yeah with like being like a very expressional expressive and alan seriously he's so good at it man I thought yeah a few times to watch the fight as a warm-up so to stand like on the side I don't think he gets the credit he deserves I think Jimmy Kimmel's the best talk show host in the country the other ones on right well except Carly fooled I still love letterman cuz he is to me Letterman is just he's a staple I watched those we grew up on interview that he'll do you know once a year I just have always just the guy so he's got so much histories I mean Letterman is so good he's so quick yeah he's been around for so long and I think Jon Stewart to watch Jon Stewart is it's so committed to politics and that political show that I don't watch it as much maybe as I would if it was just like if Jon Stewart had his own show instead of just the do show but I think he's also one of the best magic was on a little time now yeah yeah how magical is like one of the what do they have him what is the chorus correspondence yeah how magical is the shit he's such a great guy yeah that uh that guy's the best to usually I mean I think that he's the best at political stuff at Colbert or that fucking great thing he does it's like how does he keep this more a character to me another hours see how he keeps it going to take the opposite approach smart opposite side in order to mock that opposite side he must be smart as fuck he must be smart as fuck yeah I'm sure yes we're talking about the airplanes landing in Israel what's that we're talking about his wife getting pulled over in Israel Oh Brian's girl yeah we said wife skittish like Brian would you do I got married oh dude you your girl that you were seeing right uh went to Israel by herself you were saying yeah she decided she wanted to just she does that she likes to travel so she wanted to go to a yoga yoga retreat in Israel which is one of these places that you go to just relax and it's kind of like a oh yeah but it's a place you live can live there also we're gonna to if you help out there it's like a relay like I guess I should relax oh right was it called Rancho Relaxo something like that I suppose substance I forget the name of it some Jewish names why don't you relax open it okay what George dope like the with the mud and uh yeah a lot yeah the Dead Sea yeah what's it called the Dead Sea no it's some company that I don't know so anyway GOC Israel retreat and and so because she bought her ticket last second and because she was going by herself I guess she you know she's not Jewish and I guess you know it's at a time of war kind of its kind of worried right now yeah and I was like so they they took her luggage for like three or four days and she had to buy all new clothes and they thought she was you know got questioned up and down you know and I guess they really thought that she was some kind of like you know terrorist thing there was a girl with a Jewish photographer and she was over in Israel and she was taking pictures and healy worth of know of artwork like Palestinian graffiti uh-huh and since she had a photo of it on her laptop the guys at the Israel the T has their version TSA yeah they shot her laptop they shot it they fucking shot it and they gave it back to her they blew a hole in her lap OA through it yeah can I they just take out the hard drive go right here's your laptop back no I mean where do they shoot they shot it in the back she heard but bang and then the guy comes out and gives her a laptop and it's got a bullet hole in it that's crazy it's just well then he's trying to let her know like you you know I don't think he knew that she was a journalist I think she he probably thought she was someone that was seeing this and she was taking pictures of it like she thought it was funny or cool or whatever for whatever disrespectful reason this chick had it on her laptop in his eyes yeah he was like oh really yeah you look you like looking at that you like looking at someone talking shit about us he so he fucking so he just looked at it's Agra housing graffiti and shot it no he checked all her stuff and as he's checking her laptop he went through all of her photographs and as I went through her photographs he saw this anti-semitic graffiti home that she had photographs of so it closes it pushes her side fucking shoots it Wow yeah pretty intense I just know how to shoot rappers though I know that she probably had at least 20 to 30 different vibrators or dildos or sex toys in there so I wonder if that they thought all that shit was some kind of weapon so I could just imagine all these Jewish guys like with these big vibrators just like I don't think it's okay there's such a massive difference between Jews in America and Jews in Israel there's really it's like it's acidic ones there too what are the same the same yeah Pacific's is acidic she said she went right to the beach and it was just dirty and scary and then she went to a couple of the places that and it was just really freaky because there was people walking around with machine guns and then she said there was a lot of gay people in one of the cities because I guess that's just a new thing they're like amazing gay people go there Toby's a gigantic ass yeah that's where she'll and Tel Aviv I think so yeah the beaches are not dangerous by the way people is there army people down there all the time it's cool it's cool to get used to different take some time to get used to how long did you live in Israel for two years two and a half years two and a half years crazy what was it like for you it's great it's amazing it's such a beautiful country and Jerusalem's all built out of stone pretty much down I mean old Jerusalem and everywhere it's just like yeah things are great everyone sort of this knows each other a little bit not like completely but they're all I mean until recently you get hitchhike everywhere really yeah in between places you just tell me different now though right so yeah the intifadas changed things but as the Intifada the uprising the Palestinian uprising that's what they call it the Intifada to fight it so yeah that's what they call Wow what is the issue giving up land what's the actual issue the actual issue is Palestinians started in their chief tenant was we want to drive the Israelis into the sea and they're never gonna give up on the hit I was in their book that's what they wanted I'm in Tennessee yeah they will never rest until all the Israelis are driven into the ocean it's it's they want so in the meantime had to figure out a way to like appease enough of them to give them the right amount of land and let the other ones not keep going to war with us with them so when you say that that's in it's in their book is that linking one of their religious books now the PLO when they started that was one other Palestinian Liberation Organization and that was linked a lot of terrorist shit in the 1970s right wasn't it though the Munich the Munich lots of cults yeah the the killings of the Olympic Games yeah right uh-huh so what's the other side say like what's their story like if you talk to Sam Tripoli what would he say Sam would say he's Armenian and quit downplaying his struggle for the struggle of Palestinians he has no one ever fuckin respects the Armenians the Turks wiped them out it was the turn Armenian Genocide I didn't even hear about it until Manny Gambier Ian I was doing a fight about he was anniversary of the Armenian Genocide that's an honest I just didn't know about it I'm ignorant to it it was because only one million people died yeah got another word it's fucking incredible that there's been so many horrible things like that that have happened in the history of the world rather you know that this Armenian Genocide could be something that I wasn't aware of Armenians hate talks yeah hate them well when I was a kid there was a kid that I used to train with who was he was turkish and they hated the greeks you know like greeks and turkish hated each other really yeah Wow don't talks about no Pakistan India each other caboose I always thought it was so ridiculous it was like okay but silly Turks and Greeks really but in their in his eyes man it was like it was like a serious conversation it was a smart kid people get nationalistic I saw that Vlade Divac documentary about him and wherever he was from going to war you know internal strife some dude maybe Czechoslovakia or Hungary and and his teammates were like all abandon him because he wanted like unity and they wanted to break off and all these like people that like 25 26 like waving that I like to break off flags I'm getting really passionate I'm like well I've never been in this shit like that I'm just we were all just like video games or whatever else that was like I can't imagine caring well you know ever holidays enough but you would if you were there ya know if you will what if the East Coast was trying to break off and there was this nationalistic feel for the East Coast and we're different than them would you get caught up in it when you were little if you lived in that environment likely you would I guess like being a Yankee fan it's so easy it's so easy to get sucked up in the wave of your atmosphere it's just so weird when you think about how much human behavior can vary from spot to spot we have no strife in SoCal yeah nothing no no dealing with the weather that our only problems are so many of us and we need a lot of food you know no war ever sees us weed yeah your perspective here that's why someone like Paris Hilton can be so offensive to people in other parts of the world someone's just shallowly trying to attract attention to herself or no for no reason at all and when when it's successful it angers you it's like why is this even projected in front of me in a time where people are just dying hey Paris Hilton sure that's one of the reasons but this is so vapid because the more the behind wanting to be famous only for being famous yeah so vapid there's enough other people who are into it well that's why they keep it on like that in the Kardashians the issue is it opened up a whole new category of human being and that category of human being is the famous words professional celebrity for no reason celebrity the the the person who sneaks through the net and creates a whole new genre Anderson essentially Kim Kardashian is a reality celebrity yeah she's a hugely successful media personality and she did it from being just a person who fucked a guy in a video I mean the whole thing is really like her dad was a lawyer yeah and he not only got a famous writer lawyer a famous lawyer who got a gem sit off but the the whole thing behind it is that it's this this weird desire to to get attention for no reason other than that you want attention not offering anything you just want people to look at you you're not trying to sing you just want people to follow you alright it's like a lot of people want that but nobody is so specific I'm so hard to arrange you know I mean you're not trying to do anything like you know I want to be famous what do you do I don't know anything but then people keep walking in so then you feelin tightly like well I do great stuff like what what are these great things you do what she fucked on video I mean really that was the catalyst that's what started it all off so they're great they both did the same thing they both fucked on video and that got him into the spotlight and now it's got a boy now it's amazing that it is really an amazing trick it's fascinating it launched Paris Hilton from with just a model to those reality shows yeah yeah and and but but Kim Kardashian is far eclipsed Paris Hilton house is even more fantastic because Paris Hilton out does interviews and they asked her are you worried that your population your popularity might be waning and she caught up and laughed and got pissed and totally yeah I told her publicist like she's done nothing to deserve it so why would it go away because I've still done nothing so how could it go we're not thinking is nearly as clearly as oh she's she's thinking why would it I'm still awesome she's probably a fine person look I probably know she's probably not a fine person she's self-entitled sure no way she's probably a fine person I bet if she snuck in your cock I think you know I bet you'd be great at sucking dick maybe she's a little crazy and she grew up weird but maybe she's a kind I would give her a chance because I want that blow job yeah did that be a real possibility I wouldn't be mean right away but there's no way I'm rich in your life in any way that's maybe like a 5% chance maybe get a high on mushrooms and straighten around dude maybe it's you man it's Ari who can straighten the whole thing out who better than her own washroom fest that's right look read the on-target room fast we got a date now July 21st 22nd and 23rd yeah and by the way ladies gentleman you don't have to go anywhere for shrimp fest yeah the dress comes the beautiful thing is shrimp fest is a trip and oh don't do it if it's illegal where you live talking shitake yeah whatever yeah don't do it it's illegal where you live we don't want you do anything silly guys you know you know I heard they made Amsterdam because some kids jumped out of a building or something yeah that's like that Bill Hicks joke what young man on acid thought he could fly jumped off the roof what a tragedy goes what a tragedy what a dick he thought he could fly one he start off on the ground first last more on the world got a little lighter are you like a Hicks Josie it's one of his best yeah yeah you know I would have to hear him say it Tommy also had this you never hear a positive drugstore in the news I don't want to butcher this because I don't want to paraphrase it but his young man on acid you know and it was a beautiful positive message that he learned from acid gotta go a bunch of great great drug jokes you know it's just weird that he quit drugs so young and then died so young the human body is so fucking for some folks some so fragile you know and reading about these people that get these weird like fibers growing out of their skin have you heard of this what does what does that shit called again I don't know it's disgusting I was introduced to it on there was like one of those conspiracy theory shows like those Nazi Ventura conspiracy theory shows yeah and they were talking about entrails it was chemistry yes I'm gonna do wood couch I was more jealous hold on a second it's one certain town in like California in like a lot of them and then what people start growing fibers others like such x-files shit totally sounds like complete horseshit but the pictures are really bizarre man it's uh it's there's like actual fiber that's coming out of their skin like look alright can I check this out for the audio listeners just this is this is uh this is something a fiber that they pulled out of someone's skin that had this more gel ins immediately yeah it looks like a sweaters growing inside of you or it looks like a mosquito down there yeah well that picture is pretty extreme but goes around yeah I mean what a fucking weird disease man and no one knows what the hell that is I mean these people some of them have gloves on and they have these fucking that are growing out of all over their body it's a relatively new problem it seems to be growing with in leaps and bounds throughout the u.s. even in other countries although condition where gels possibly dates back to the 1600s it's only been since 2002 that it's become a modern-day concern it's probably has something to did the Internet wow-wow Wi-Fi we're we're growing wires and you imagine if that was really what it is a growing antennas Jesus Christ no crazy that would oh that's the next stage of development of antennas and we can't keep thinking that we're gonna stay the way we are and I know but is this what happens so slowly that you would never in one lifetime notice any change how do we know that you know there's been a lot of discrepancies about like how long it takes there's a there's a lot of arguments and disagreements about how long it takes for an entity to evolve but one of the things that they know is the Congo the Congo is a kind of a crazy place where it used to be grasslands and then a rainforest essentially grew there really rapidly and over a period of two thousand years became a dense massive rainforest where it used to be grassland so all these grasslands animals got trapped in the jungle and had to evolve they had to change and one of them there's a antelope thing called a duiker and how much the function was wins how much time was this less than two thousand years okay lose underwater and eats fish really yeah what was it it's in the answer it's called a I think it's called a duiker Wow yeah actually swims underwater and fucking eats fish it can swim underwater for a hundred yards whoa how is it what is where'd that come from I'll tell you why you'd be had to figure out how to survive if somebody has to fight let's say you grow a third eye let's just say some somebody had to be the first pure person as it slowly develops to see through that eye yeah somebody's going to be that right first guy to have that if something like that would mutate and happen I'm a successful transition yeah someone would have to be the first or at least have the first you know like Stubbs of it like we like some people more like a little stub of a tail yeah yeah what is that it's a pigtail but how come chimps don't have tails and we're supposed to be related to chimps dude chimps ever get there they ever born with little tail most of us don't have it though no very few of us have it I wonder if it's just a normal deformity just a normal slip of it's your brother's fillet can anybody move it can I control it yeah yeah that would be fucked manager if you a person you can wag your tail actually was a cat tail but you even want to take it off yeah you'd probably find some weird pride out of it but it's like it's not awesome what else because of it uh you know what if you could do that Flying Wallendas shit like no problem cuz you got a kiss because of that you know cats have the most ridiculous balance man I've tried to push cats off of like banisters I'm like eat off that bastard bitch and the cats like oh nothing all the way off like a weeble wobble then alright I got slides sideways on a banister yeah you see that video yeah of the chimp versus the cat UFC match no it's badass google it sometime it's great it's a it's a little monkey and a cat fighting but they're really fighting or they play they're playing but the cat has and cats have really good Jiu Jitsu how they grabs around that's er you know we're just comfortable with them because they're really tightening it now feral in uh in uh in Israel all cats yeah they brought him in nobody knows him as pets because they're so fucking disgusting they brought him in to hunt hunt the rats and they just it yeah than they got right no natural enemies you guys didn't kill him off because I bet you got Toxoplasma like a motherfuck they're all out there just out there dead but it's out of the road oh just everywhere they look a problem look yeah I don't like feral huh so they're tough mean yeah feral cats a little mom get away yeah they'll fuck you up dude and they'll jump at you too if you if you corner a feral cat man be fuckin seen one or maybe I just thought was just a normal cat that was just crazy well feral cats are just wild cats it's an amazing difference be the way they barn cats are you talking about funny no sure farm cats to material to farm cats are just retarded what me big I straight up on walls yeah so high like how are you gonna get up there yeah feral cats are I had a feral kitten and I the only will connect themselves to one or two people they really yeah they're they really hate people I was the only person of this cat could like trust enough to pick up horses and I never if he was something was wrong with him I could never bring him to that you couldn't no one could take care of me no one could even hold with me and I got them because a friend of mine she was living in this apartment building and her and her boyfriend found them underneath the house they found like a a whole litter of kittens apparently the mother had died or something like that that was a wild cat and she gave birth so they captured all the kittens and then they started trying to find homes for me I said ah I can't it's such a crazy story I got to take yeah so I took it and I I had to stay in a room with it for two days because it was so crazy and so nuts like to get it comfortable with me I had to be like next to it for two days so I just put a room in my house I put my guest room I put a litter box in there put his cat food in there and put a couple notebooks and some books no but I said yeah right shit down and and then I'll I'll do some reading I just hang out this fucking cat for a couple days to get a comfortable with you yeah so that's what I did for two days every time I go near fucking climb up there's like like there's like the curtains climb up the curtains you go fucking crazy and I go calm down little buddy calm down calm down and then I touch him then he would start purring and par like really loud he went from inject fear and terror to like purring so loudly I'm so happy that I'm actually taking care of he didn't know what's going on he doesn't know why this big giant pink thing he turned it out taury much well I had to turn him into my buddy no but I was the only one that could touch him like even everywhere else to be so secure on and even to me I would like if I'd come up to a mic I had to take him to the vet once and this is a really bad time man it was fucking bad just cat jacked my arm I had to throw a towel over him and tackle him really yeah and fear hiding man he was fighting and then I brought him to the vet and I told them that like oh listen man this cat its feral like don't worry we've had 25 years here yeah I gave them that cat and that's he said well you weren't kidding when you said he was fair like oh yeah it's a feral cat man yeah wasn't crazy that cat is the craziest cat we've ever had yeah that's a wild cat big black crazy cat you know everything my dad didn't the army with the kittens what they thought to make him raise oh yeah I wonder if it will Ferrell if everyone listen a story I made him raise my dad wasn't special special one of the code in the Army Special Forces yeah and back then and um and what they do is they make you learn how to take care of things you know just so you can know how to like care for your your other GIS or whatever but uh so they give you a kitten just like they give you that egg to care for and like a middle school they give you a kid you got to raise it for uh for like two weeks or a month I forget and you got to make sure nothing goes wrong with it if something goes wrong with it gets sick you're in trouble you got to take ever in addition to running all your laps and doing everything and doing all your regular chores and an end of two weeks you to present this healthy kitten and then once you present a healthy kid and they go okay now snap its neck and they make you snap its neck right there so they can shut you off and turn you into the machine Wow after you've cared for it for two weeks kill it with your bare hands not even like give it up for adoption fuck what was what was the story in the Bible where God was telling someone to kill his son Abraham why what was the story behind a test to kill Isaac to kill Isaac and uh and it was it was uh was it not its firstborn so I think his firstborn and then this is when they were split off happened between the Arabs and the Jews it was right then really yeah why because Isaac's brother was technically the firstborn so he should have gotten the birthright and the Jews say that he he didn't I went to Isaac and then Jacob okay so God said to Abraham I want you to kill I yeah so he takes to his mouth son yeah take your son it takes him this mountain puts him up on an altar yeah and Hannah um and then he goes to raise a knife over his head and God sent a sign he sent a ram which is a normal thing you sacrifice he sent a ram right then and that was a sign even though Rams were indigenous to that area at the time it was definitely a sign from God some retard God who couldn't fucking get his full words out so he just had to ram and that obviously means don't kill your son kill this Ram instead and then blow the horn once or twice a year because that's so obvious that's what it means because he could have just said don't kill your son and that's a good enough sign here to send a ram to walk by such stupid idiot shit once you realize oh there you were a little kid and you got sent to Israel to study this 10 12 hours a day like already did I mean you'd probably be pretty passionate about how he's supposed to take that for granted he sent a sign it was a ram walking by oh yeah that's a sign obviously crazy was easy who's about to kill his kill his son because God wanted him to and then the issue became like while we're still religion became like well why would God command that well how would that be a test for him why would you do it oh I just wanted to see you knew he was able to if there was a test your God you knew it was gonna be able to so like why wouldn't you just say okay good you're up for it you know you would know more than anybody about how much of what you read yeah you were reading the Talmud how much of what you've read had been translated several times how many times had it been translated before it got to when you reading in modern-day Hebrew how many times has it had been transferred to get to that no well it was it's it's the Torah is written exactly the same as it always was always yeah so you read it in ancient Hebrew yeah even with the same shapes of the letters was it the Old Testament that's different yeah then it's Talmud is that was handed down like orally for a while and they were afraid it was gonna get lost because of some dispersion so they wrote it down the oldest versions of the Bible or the ancient Hebrew versions right except for the Dead Sea Scrolls which not technically considered the Bible even though some of them yeah so they say that the oldest versions were in ancient Hebrew that they the real problems worlds yeah that they when they translated it to Greek in Latin they said that they only knew like three-quarters of the words in ancient Hebrew yeah that the specific meanings to words they don't know all those because some of those words didn't make it to modern Hebrew and they don't really have a good lineage to say like where was this exact words like if I said let's just say gently or lovingly they could mean the same thing at certain times right I gently said whatever I lovingly said it's simple similar but there's differences and that's what we have two different words when was this transition between ancient Hebrew and modern Hebrew probably during the dispersion we got you know cast out it's all different that's when we got white Jews and black Jews after that the ones went to the what year was that I don't know and so the so Israel or the Jews the the modern Jews they kept this certain modern version of Hebrew yeah it's like four thousand years ago probably something like that but you guys also have numbers which though they brought it back they brought it back when they they went with a sort of a modern Hebrew I guess but they just sort of made it when they decided like what should our language bill you know like let's bring in Hebrew was a dead language oh it was a deadly yeah I'm a Korean and all those people said when was this 1948 forty cent holy shit yeah Hebrew was a dead language in there wow that's crazy numbers big and there's some people that won't that the treated was like holy it's a little much but the cheaters holding they won't speak it won't speak Yiddish during the week and then Shabbat home that's me hit him with the Hebrew what is Yiddish what's the difference or weird bastardized mixture it's like southern talk Creole it's like not quite English yeah is the mixture of Hebrew and like Germanic mixed with whatever country you're from when you hear like the Yiddish chicks talk does gr there's no such thing as you know cuz anyone talks that's old oh really yeah a lot of Jewish yeah like nobody talks like that anymore how much is different in that and modern Hebrew Yiddish yeah it's mostly Germanic German so you most did you know kids understand it like Israeli kids with more relatives or better get it better really yeah Wow yeah it's so incredible you stop and think about how many different languages there are oh yeah they all developed somewhat similarly and how long was it before they actually started writing shit down how long do they have language before they actually wrote things down yeah cuz I've made a wild where they put put signs to it probably tens of thousands it didn't happen the other way yeah I don't know how long the the you know the first written language was but oh I don't believe it was more than ten thousand years ago yeah which is really like nothing kind of crane it kind of hurts your head when you stop and think that's that's as long as we were able to communicate without being there stop and just trying to put your head around that and the way this is what I would always use as an example if I was in a crowd say if I was doing a comedy show there was a hundred people in the audience and I would say what you guys represent if you lived your lives birth to death it's just a little room a little tiny group of people of a hundred people but what you represent in terms of potential towards life that's all that the next person was born exactly if they live there alone what their lives birth to death to the max which is like a hundred years which is most anybody ever lives they represent 10,000 years yeah and that's as long as that's incredible that's as long as we know about human beings Wow but like 4000 years ago when we got the Bible right that's right right yeah a hundred peat plants were not everyone's like better we lived a hundred years isn't that ten thousand one hundred people living one hundred years yeah a hundred people living tennis is a thousand thousand yeah yeah that's incredible man stop and think about that ten thousand years ago and it's just a little tiny room full of people living their lives birth to death represents the distance between us of today and nothing written uh-huh I have three maths jokes yours is way better than all three of those three what jokes math jokes math I call math jokes where there's numbers involved so they actually have to think before they laugh that's not really a math joke but it's a what the fuck thinking thing that's like you want to check his math it takes you a second I've been really getting into gamer Game of Thrones yeah it's amazing it's the best show I've ever watched I watched the whole force but it's like I love that kind of shit I love that Conan the Barbarian type swords and sorcery I love that stuff I love it so I'm enjoying the fuck out of it but it's making me think I mean although obviously this is of work of you know fantasy fiction it makes me think of what it must have been like you know if you had to live like these people lived you know with swords on horses I mean there was a time where people actually lived like that that is how they hunted these bows and arrows they did live in these houses they did have castles and they did have armies and they did have moats when these are all realistic no you know realistic depictions of a certain time you know take away the sorcery and all the other crazy stuff they there was people that in just a few thousand years ago lived like that it's hard to wrap your head around how short of a distance it is here between that when people lived like in the Robin Hood days yeah and today it's like nothing you'd be cool though it would still be cool having like hey I got these new silver horseshoes have you seen these things so proportions or you know like where even though you live back in those days people were still making new things up and like but that things were like different they'd make up a new thing every like ready for New Year's yeah what new thing would come yeah I'm sure there was little things here and there though just like everything yeah I'm sure there was a few intervention was so lame like Lenny got Chinese finger traps they were blown away by that does a party favor I bet the blacksmith back then was like the Apple like you'd come in to come and look at this thing at me you know this is a new layer of artisans that's something that's really getting lost you know we talked about that when Aubrey was on here last we talked about that musashi documentary lost no was uh they showed how they used to make samurai swords and there's a few people alive but still make them that way today yeah it's crazy some I mean you have to be the ultimate craftsman I mean if you and I were left alone in a you know and to figure it out on our own for a million years we'd never figure out how to make a fucking samurai sword the way they do it is so incredible they they hammer it down then they fold it over and then they hammer it down like they keep flattening it and hammering and flattening and hammering until it becomes this intense steel that you just fucking slice through bamboo I mean it's really amazing watching the the artisan work the craftsmanship and the knowledge passed down through generations and generations of how to make a sword you know when you stop and think about it's like how many people are out there in the world today that know how to make anything even remotely like that everything we're buying that's manufactured is manufactured in some sort of a factory if you're gonna buy a sword this is a big machine that's gonna cut it and make it with a computer and a laser and shit there's not gonna be some Japanese dude in flip-flops with wooden bottom shoes father okay it's wild to watch man it's why it's wild to watch what people used to have to do to make something you know it's it really it really makes you appreciate like how ridiculously easy easy everything is now people like I liked it better the other way I'm like why like you just melt rocks right or something like yeah you have to mine it you have it's in the rocks yeah to make steel you have to add things to it too it's not just iron now it makes steel I think you have to we should actually look at on what do they do just took some rocks and well them up there to mind the metal they're big or okay they have perfect of metal in the ground they have to add other stuff to to the steel they have to add stuff to iron combined it's an alloy technically it says according to Wikipedia made by combining iron and another element usually carbon and when carbon is used it's content and the Steel's between 0.2 percent and 2.1 percent by weight dependent upon the grade who figured that out I was given to us so I guess they had to add shit harder someone else I want to add carbon what are you talking about I mean that's been around for a long ass time to say who was the first person that somebody told somebody that's that doesn't seem like that that's aliens no you know what the crazy shit in the world is what steel cable who would have ever found some metal in the ground and thought for a second that someone is gonna take this shit and have so much of it so they're gonna have a fucking 5000 foot long cable made of steel and they're gonna use that to suspend giant beams that weigh several hundred tons over an ocean yeah did you like steel cable steel cable is crazy someone figured out how to take metal hold it out of the ground and stretch that shit it's hard it's hard how the fuck are you how is it moving around how are you making cables out of this what did you do they figured out how to not just make it but make it so it's big enough to pull boats uh-huh you can have giant huge ones that are they're wider around then your body is uh that's a cable we just said take it for granted well I'm gonna just get a cable and put a winch on the front of my Jeep in case I get stuck out there long for oil and you know people they have winches and shit so they can pull cars out they like to be the cool guy you can pull it yeah yeah that's steel cable you drive it in the mud yeah that's fuckin steel cable that winch is steel cable man get caught up in ashes and snap your arm off oh my god yeah rip your body apart steel cable they can pick up trees with that shit you can put a winch on it depends on the pound the power of the winch but if it's good winch get pull hundreds of pounds that's why black guys like it so much I always hear a lot like taking it from buildings stealing cables oh yeah that's the little cable still you silly bitch no steel cable like you don't pay for it Brian oh not like steel cables think about the first guy who invent wires who figured out how to stretch out some metal except the real heroes like the first guy who actually steel cable like somebody fucking figure that out and then share that now is from people I remember I used to have everybody did who figure that out though there was a guy that lives in the neighborhood that would leave up a thing when satellite dishes first came out yeah he would leave up like on telephone poles this is how it was in 1993 leave up a phone number and it would say you know fix your satellite box to catch any ha any channel and so you would give this guy your card and then they would they would he would he would come back and cards back to you and it was doctored and the card could get everything it's got every pay-per-view movie every porn every you know everything that happened it would get but it would never work it would really it would work for like a day I know this is working with this it would send a signal to fuck it yeah they'd crush it and that and then it just got to a silly point where I think me and my roommate were like why are we doing this just pay for this fucking Wonka stuff so we can actually have TV on so stupid you know I saw at that bar they say it's all at the barbershop in Italy the guys had hacked their Mac Apple TV and it had like every single channel HBO every movie that was in theaters it was just like just like watch now watch now and it was set up so cool like III forgot all about it but whatever it is you can live off of the just that like it had streaming channels had Ustream channel it had it had everything you could possibly want new movies in theaters oh I heard a disturbing story for you oh oh remember Warren to Vancouver yes and we went to visit that pawn shop yes but they couldn't sell to us cuz we were right not a state but somebody hooked up anyway he got fired for that for hooking us huh yeah oh I got fired for it cuz he shouldn't have looked this up really yeah it's so bad right it was like he was like nah I can help with anyone outside just gave us some yeah he couldn't sell it honey so he gave us some and you gave him tickets to the UFC after that yeah what the fuck that guy got fired I was like oh this is the right way to handle it probably brag too much about the I don't know debt sucks though sorry hear about that buddy I was like oh that's really bad for you someday it's gonna be easy to go anywhere and be able to buy weed just let them do anywhere Empire a beer how it should be you should be a fucking taxpaying grown adult who walks in there and acts like a gentleman and picks up whatever the fuck you need whether you'd like to buy a bottle of wine to go with dinner yeah well you'd like to get an eighth of weed cuz you and you check

out really young I took half and adderal today this is like the second time I've ever done adderall before well this is this is the first time that I feel like it like it's like a sativa I think if you are a fan of mad Aurora if you got a really good sativa it would be pretty similar I think so makes your body all jacked up and moving it's similar in some way but here's a deal Brian when you say half an adderall you have to understand there are different values for different pills yes five milligram adderall is far different than the 40 that you might have had split in house yeah by the way powerful Ari Shaffir t-shirts right yeah these are awesome watching um you guys that have to wear them all is here where can anybody buy these do these are actually really come online like a week or

is to try to do another one or a year yeah let's talk about that let's hear some new jokes of yours like some notes of yours right now I can't tell you like here no I think that really helped me when you're thinking in terms of this with Tom Segura ask Bill burr about it and he broke her down to what an hour is and he goes that's five minutes a month so you get pretty much five any new month that you like in my in five minutes ahead of where I was and just time it that way just keep a pace for yourself yeah we are the head of Heiser behind pace I had five new minutes the first time on stage because there was a bunch of shit that I'd written that I the last couple of months I hadn't committed to any new stuff I was just trying to just completely tighten the old stuff except this circumcision bid that just came out of nowhere I couldn't stop it and I had to put it on and it just fit in with all this other shit I had to but other than that oh my writing that I had from all that time is all bankrolled so I have to go over the writing you know the fucking nuttiness I just have to go over the knife you know see you don't work like I've got stuff right now exactly so since I did still keep writing there's a lot of ideas I just have to sort of set them out but this you can make yourself go through them did you end up doing the baby bee no no I didn't do that one no that's two specials a joke that's gonna be like YouTube video just released this video I should get out there on your own YouTube account yeah hire some actors I mean that'd be the tray that is three or four

that to promote the special when you have it here's a one free the next time you go to a big club just tape it Brian fucking tape from the back maybe from being get a close-up of him and get a far-away shot of him and cut those two go I'll go behind you so enthusiastically adderall but it was uh it was the Atlanta thing could it went great right couldn't got any better man these crowds are completely different crowds yeah the crowds that we're getting now are a hundred percent podcast fans and it's like it's like hanging out and doing a show in front of our friends it's like a bunch of friends that we don't know that and the other people who come just to come they're like oh this is a really fun thing do they're so hard overwhelmingly nice it's crazy it's I don't know how we did it I don't know what what exact the cottle exactly the combination was yeah to create that but that's very unusual it's very unusual when you talk to people that work at clubs and people that work at theaters they go your crowds the nicest crowd we've ever seen ever oh yeah they're pretty cool ones even close the good tippers they're good they're generous and they were fucking so pumped for the show dude it was not I was so comfortable it's the only time I've ever done special where I didn't feel at all like oh shit I'm filming right now it was completely in the groove I had done so much stand-up leading up to that too so yeah I did all my work and then on top of that the crowd was amazing yeah but now it's that the big challenge is to now to create a whole new hour yeah so I have to really sit down and I have all these scattered notes I'm gonna have to do some organizing of the house yeah we're gonna do some ice house shows dank we do Wednesday see what we do Wednesday weekend probably not probably not if we can let's do it this is what Lois it's you after you do the first year mm-hmm when you start the same process again the next year and it seems as daunting as it does right now you'll be like oh no I know this leads to a new hour of material yeah so it's okay I can do this yeah bench pressing to get bigger well I know that writing to me is just like it's like doing rounds on the bag or doing minutes on an elliptical machine you build endurance yeah you build like a groove and right now you know I'm in good writing shape you know I feel like when I when I write a lot I get in good ways a muscle yeah and I can I think it comes it comes out better the more you use it and it comes out your your editing skills on the fly get better at it right now than you were five years ago course we go no damn doing alone yeah yeah I'm so happy that I you know I always wondered what would happen as I got older like if my stand-up but start to sock one day you know I always worried about that I always worried about like hitting a peak and then not being good anymore seems like there's a plateau you can get it's like kind of like pool where you can play later to stand up later into your years it's not like a 40 overtire matte moment yeah well I think it has to do with your physical health too you know if you get depressed and you feel like shit I bet your comedies gonna start to not be as fun and not be as good I think part of the commitment there all the time well he's a different kind of stand up you know stand ups his comedy almost depends on him being miserable yeah I think every like every Cystic comic I know it seems like they're depressed and miserable it's not necessary but it that can fuel you you know can fuel you to go up there and get that charge where I know in times of my life where I wasn't happy I would go onstage and kill I'd at least feel like I can do something ready to get something yeah well at least feel like I'm capable of something like if I could go onstage you know if I'm feeling like a loser I'm feeling depressed I go on stage and get a bunch of people to laugh I'll decide okay I'm not bad at this I did a good job with this yeah I can feel a little better now exactly it'll pick me on short term so they all give you a standing ovation before you even went on stage I was nuts it was couldn't have been better couldn't not have in better and there was a lot of traffic because there was some crazy basketball games going at the same time and yeah we we got stuck like there was it was really hard for everybody to get there so the show didn't even start for like a half an hour late so like everybody was building up so when though the lights went off and when you know I came on the microphone to introduce Joey he went fucking huh it was so funny because my manager and you know Shandra and Jeff they're they're the best like I've been with Jeff since I was an open mic essentially like he came and found me in boston where i was a scrub and i think that one of the main reasons why I've been successful is that I don't have to think about the business stuff I just let him think about yeah and I just do my comedy I don't have to worry about it because because he's the best but they were like let's have you introduced offstage like just say your name clean and you come out alone on my yeah you always gotta bring me up let's your fans will want to see that too it's just we got five seconds yeah Joey has to bring me up this that's that's voodoo okay thank you for the suggestion we're not gonna do that I appreciate your input but they were like well let's just try it once like no Joey's never bringing me up this is it doesn't have to make sense it's just Joey they're not gonna talk about it he's brought me up and every special for the past really yeah years whatever it's been it's like I'm doing Canada right yeah I tried to do a chant at the beginning one of the specials but it didn't work at all we were way too baked haha before we came up with that idea we talking to get the whole crowd to OMA long and we got like maybe 30 people and then I was like what's happening are you doing they're waiting for the punchline that never was shit is such a trip the second show Joe turned to me and goes do you want to go up and do five minutes and we just got done smoking a joint and I was stoned out of my mind I like that was I got to go up and was pretty cool but it was so hard to judge that many people oh you're like like he said thirty people was doing it it seemed like you know that's thirty out of a million oh yeah I think that was different I don't want to say your material dude but you know one joke you have is fucking funny he's got one joke I just yeah I can't say anything it'll give away its junk that's one of them where I go damn I wish I thought that went up you know when you hear somebody say something it's just like fired up at a door that's a fun one to play with yeah watch over a thousand people laugh what that was really fun it's it's fun to watch someone go up that's never been in front of that for that big of a crowd but they all were really friendly like when you're going on stage they give you a huge round of applause I know you're probably that had it made you feel like you know they weren't they were they're happy to see you yeah it's like so much better yeah feeling is how much better the feeling you get when it's like oh cool you guys already know me nobody takes more Internet shit than Brian huh nobody takes more there's you have more haters and more irrational angry people you love it though right a certain party no no no no no it's not comfortable and then there's always some weird sort of analysis of Brian and i's relationship uh-huh look Brian and I are very different but obviously we like each other you know I've never had a job for more than ten ten years but we like each other I mean we like each other a lot I mean I would say love but it sounds gay because he's right next to me but of course I love him but we the reason why we keep doing this is because it works well don't you see yeah he says ridiculous shit yeah he thinks so but you say also some things that I don't think of you know you're you come at things from a weird perspective sometimes you know but for whatever reason people people get angry at shit that matter you have to do is say one thing you'll interject one thing and they'll derail a conversation and sometimes it works and sometimes you derail something and it becomes really funny and sometimes doesn't mean who knows you never know until you try that's what people don't understand if you're listening but they'll get so fucking angry at you you're like dude get up and go out there's a conversation going on somewhere and you're listening in that's it yeah that's all that's happening here there's no reason to get fucking spastic angry fucking violent mad like relax that's just internet angry motherfucker I'm gonna kick him in his cunt that's the only way to express like that's all they're trying to express that's the only way they can do that online they're all they feel I have to say that I'm gonna kill you I appreciate criticism I really do and it sounds like I don't because I just get mad and block people when they say kunti things on Twitter or whatever it's just but I'm not gonna argue with you man if you can't communicate with me like a normal human being if you can't communicate with me like you would if you just I don't care who I ever met if if I if I had to have a conversation with Adolf Hitler okay if I had to go back in time and have a conversation with Adolf Hitler I wouldn't start calling him a cunt and say crazy stupid shit to him even though I know he's a piece of shit that's like we got anything we're gonna help you it's not gonna help me at all I already know what he is I want to base all of my interactions with someone and how they interact with me not how I want to know about their past I want to you know I want to know you're dealing with a criminal or whatever the fuck you're dealing with but you should be as those ideas as possible to someone have fun always gets upset when people like right in shitty things and I ever why do you care that's just some shitty person who cares that's just a screaming baby what are you worried about yeah I see people go back and forth and fight with people on Twitter and like oh really yes where they fuck you you fucking cock home Dana White goes Wow Dana White has like multiple day really we can't do that there's no point what are you like what are you gonna prove to them that wrong has it ever happened in history of Twitter did you prove to someone that they're wrong Dana actually enjoys it though really does Lawson he likes to fight he still needs it he enjoys it he's good at it he goes to their fucking pictures and makes pictures yeah it's funny man it's funny he gets into it but he does it all with a big smile on his face I've watched him do it you know he's not like mean obviously Dana White had successful as fuck he's not really worried about what some twenty fifteen year old kid from the middle of nowhere on Twitter is saying about more he thinks it's 120 is a good word why D it's a sweet word and by the way though people that came to Joe show I want you to come to my show May 12th where's your show oh I'm sorry Denver yeah the comedy works oh well that's a totally different place in the world well the Marshalls your fans know your people can so it's shitty segue right there sorry thought I realized we just jumped off the subject and I was like guys we're talking with the specials do you think Will Ferrell when he brings his cats to my shelter that that they he has had many times like they'd actually accidentally killed a cat and why will ferrell brings his cats to shelters like like if he goes out of town and he takes his caddish no I mean like if you did do you think he would constantly have dead cats why why cuz I'd be like feral you know you know his last name what makes things up some paperwork or so you fuckin I just get done defending you and you come with that note so you should write down then repay it later and we're gonna wording I'm incredibly disappointed that in on purpose that's because if re throwing I'm incredibly disappointed with you Brian set you up nice for the rest of the show you could have walked away here oh no no this guy's right now you're fuckin stupid t-shirt we got really high this time yeah we got wait yeah it's adderall I know totally different yeah your your honor great that ice coffee I don't think you doing those things adderall which can wait like that was it way is that what you're doing it for no I'm just trying to be focused right now oh yeah you're so giving stickers right now is at a third full let me see that cell let's say that's a 40 milligram or not that is the craziest you know by the way you shouldn't be passing the shit around in front of a camera hey remember what our friend at Ustream told us well I'll show ya I got a prescription Rory it's just a baggie alright it could be implied as some sort of bullets it's made by pharmaceutical companies and it makes people happy yeah I know somebody who has a full-time prescription he takes it every day people have like severe ATD they take it to calm them down instead of hype them up I don't feel the Hound I feel I know you're getting a totally different reaction they are do you feel you feel it so no medical doctor will prescribe I'm I feel like I'm on a coming down from a coke boys why did you take it like four hours ago you're plenty of time how long's your not coming down sometimes nine ten twelve hours oh Jesus Christ few more podcasts tonight that's perfect dude that's a are you sure that it's healthy to make that stuff it's not like salad is it dangerous take half a pill those Oh would you quit saying half a pill yeah I just told you that's such a huge difference you should stop saying that just find out how much you're taking one five milligrams it's the same as half accepted a horse Brian there might be horse dosage heard of that there was a four on there ones available it's and you took a half I've heard of a ten and a 20 you cracked out right now son whoa easy let them come down from outer old is there a way to get I think you crush I know is there anything you can take two like two in order to come in well lighter does that know at the end of the day though my friend was on it all the time said sometimes if he has to do something late at night like a late night show now he it's it's badly timed and you know because he takes his stuff at a certain time every day so versus there's a late night show it fucks him up Oh Piper if I think one of those 5-hour energies no nut doesn't get too hyper he's done by the time the late night rolls around he's over he's tired but he can't take it too late cuz they won't be able to sleep exactamundo medicated we live in a strange world then I heard about a new drug what is it a cop told me in Austin crocodile oh that's a that's a drug from Russia yes a lot of guys that were who hooked on heroin are taking it it makes their skin rot it makes your skin rot it's where you can see the bone yeah yeah have you seen it they call it something else like meow-meow or something like that maybe I don't know it's called crocodile though yeah it's always that was horrifying yeah they said it takes about two years to kill you so it'll be plenty of time you can buck just a little worse just a little worse it must feel amazing it must that's what I asked the cop it's only about it I was like how what's it feel like awesome right I mean it's made how people have like rotten holes in their body where they're shooting it in I mean it's really crazy to look at when we look at the images it just rots away your skin we talked about this on this vodka no we never have good shit makes your skin fall off well that's not the effect that they want tell you about people are so crazy bro they're so crazy it's just such a weird animal just have to know how much to take us well how about none that's the good move my friend told me he took mushrooms and Amsterdam he didn't like him and I was like oh well how much to take where'd you take him he goes I took 20 grams and I went to those it what well that's why that's like drinking a fucking bottle of tequila and saying I don't like booze 20 grams yeah a pound a pound I don't know an ounce he's like oh that's different I don't know how many pound yeah it's at what two and half ounces I think two and a half ounces in a pound maybe I'm totally wrong I don't know how many grams in a twenty grams would be about an ounce that'd be right one I own equals 453 grams okay so we took 20 grams no ordinary pound yeah nowhere near still what you imagine you ate a pound of mushrooms my god what kill you what's that I wonder let's find out you might you might dies like even the same thing of anyone I think the last time the one time that I took it where I think I overdosed them I think it came out to about a quarter in a like a 1/8 1/4 so what is that a quarter and an eighth so one once I seen one eight two eight three eight three eight Jesus you threw me off three eighths yeah you took three eighths yeah that's a lot what kind of mushrooms do you remember I don't know the ones that look like fake like Mario brother mushrooms like the stems were really big and the cats were like like ridiculously fun fucking 280 milligrams per kilogram for a rat what would kill a rat yeah 200 what 280 milligrams per kilogram I don't know kilos a rat so how much killer how many killers am i well the problem with all this ld50 for rats is there's a lot of shit that kills animals that doesn't kill us yeah but there are also a lot of things that kill both rats and us and there's also a lot of times they weigh more the hill rats but does kill us kill us yeah and listen well they're fucking disgusting species they're really disgusting you know they eat each other yes I've told this story before I killed a big-ass rat my fucking garage and so you know yeah Kelly with a trap and I'm late at night I was like I heard it snap go off walls right now and I went out good tomorrow got up in the morning and there was nothing but skin a little bit of skin and tail they ate that fucking rat we had a rather truth through his tale in order to get out of stress yeah this rat was a big fucking rat - man they had some big Hill Rats up there in the Hollywood Hills they got a real problem there's like New York they're everywhere yeah some dude was would you ever have mice rats mice mice by a long jillion times yeah that one guy that we had on the show the hoarder guy well it's his face I can't think of his name right now bro Matt Matt he said that you would rather have rats why I'm pretty mommy go be anything yet a friend of mine lived in the Hollywood Hills or his brother his friend lived in the Hollywood Hills and they were he had like a dope house with a theater yeah but one they were watching the movies he goes when the movie comes on he just put your feet up because sometimes rats run across the floor it's like what get away worst movie he goes if you live in the hills there's just no way to avoid them what could you imagine there's no way to avoid rats in your fucking house like ants that's crazy though it's little animal or sand ants Wow have you seen Nemo Trias of your sorry Adams giant rats in the south yeah they went Dave Attell went nutria hunting once yeah yeah that was that show well I was watching some show on the one of those Outdoor Channel's and I was hunting and as the dudes a chef I think it's called dead meat or something like that that's the name of the show and he would go and he he'll shoot all kinds of weird things and cook them like all kinds of weird animals and so they cooked nutria they shot these nutrients but there's a balancing con nutrias for every nutria you killed they give you five bucks Wow really yeah I've never make a living that way yeah if you have a seven inch tail and you know it's there there big man there's a lot of them and if they attack people or there's soup no no they're vegetarians oh we just kill them the problem is they're they're destroying the wetlands they are they're the rate of erosion caused by nutrias what does it come from some insane amount it was like they came from another country they're like 350 yards or 350 acres a day they were killer eroding well yeah these animals were eroding like an insane amount of ground they can cover in a day and they're just jacking all these wetlands and so since they started this bounty on them the show so that they dropped it down to 50 acres a day but they're still they're still fucking things up I mean it's like with the acres a lot to lose and because every day they're just jacking these fucking all this wetlands to just kill all the vegetation you know all these swampy crazy areas they just kill all the vegetation they're huge the fucking thing was like a dog man and this dude they went out and they shot him in like an hour's time they shot like six or seven of them and they throw him in the boat and they took him back and cooked them it was really weird man it was funny how everybody was like repulsed by it like everybody that they told it was a nutria they liked but if you tell someone you got a pig like what is it half-baked n' it's like we came up with cool names for shit that's not the animal itself like beef memphis' cow you know venison venison is a deer you know what I mean they would have to come you can't just say you're gonna eat rat you can say y'all ready chicken yeah check that's true chicken is only chicken yeah but like pork is like bacon as ham you can have you could have work yeah you could have a couple different names for it yeah bacon so fuckin good so good you've been Jeni's when they have that bacon shit oh yeah they fatten the crispy meat it's so delicious thanks yeah it's so delicious that I mean this has been talked to death by comedians but the idea of it's become sort of like iho yeah put bacon on any kind of food and makes it better yeah yeah chocolate and Bacon's good have you read that that's okay how did the fair once yeah yeah a bit little salt on it you know what's amazing man salted caramel oh yeah Oh I feel like that's off your yeah salted caramel ice cream shit I know you're talking about there's a place in Denver - I forget the name of it but they have amazing salted caramel ice cream sounds amazing in Denver's where are you fear is gonna be next week we'll see see that's a segue son I'm there the 10th through the 12th of May but I brought the cool people like all these people listening all you got he wants yes so and by the way the comedy works you owe it to yourself if you're gonna see a comic like Ari go to the best club in the fucking country and the Comedy Works in Denver might just be that Club if it's not the best Club guess what there's no better there's no better Club than The Comedy Works in Denver there's no better club in the planet there's aa there's the clubs that are just as good but there's no better it's not any list of like these are the clubs I like the peg before I stop the Comedy Works in Denver is in it's at the level of the best club in the country I don't think there's anyone best club in the country because there's like like helium in Philly that's the same lyrics the same level there's no there's nothing bad about that club it's perfect it's one of the best clubs in the country and I in my opinion like helium and Philly and the Comedy Works in Denver they're the same level of club I think that that place is as good as it gets it's the it's the cream of the crop as far as comedy clubs go and good Denver is the stoniest coolest fucking city in the country I love Denver coming back to Columbus yeah I'm gonna book that I'm booking a bunch of shit now that I have to write a bunch of new stuff so when I come to Columbus that's probably I'll probably do the comedy club for a couple days yeah the funny bone is a good club there but isn't it weird how that place doesn't have a green room I kind of like it I like I like when you're roughing it going back coaching Troy yeah I like when you have to live like that sometimes it's realistic it's good it's good for you when you have to be in the hallway warming up and it's fucking people walking by with drinks it seems stupid but I think I think all that stuff you should never get away from that that all that we that's a real comedy club man that's that's that's where we all cut our teeth that's where that's what's responsible for a lot of guys making a living those kind of clubs that's those are real places you know energy when you're there for through two or three hours oh it does is nice to have a place yeah yeah but you know what just go out and sit with the people a bar who gives a fuck just go hang out with people that patio so be yeah you should just put a shed out there or an heiress Tina what if you pulled up in one of those truly yeah yeah and ass but they need that true the patio because people can't smoke in the bars right yeah isn't that the smoke is another laws now right yeah right so you have to go outside to smoke yeah that's that that law apparently is a big divider among the pool world pool players of really upset really yeah because a lot of guys first of all in the gambling they would just constantly be smoking poker had the same problem yeah they try to get it out there was a last thing to leave casinos the poker area yeah I know for that that breath that I just took that was like a lot of guys they need that and they knew that they needed that cigarette to calm them down whether gamble I don't think they needed I think I just got used to it I know they did a resisting change but they're addicted yeah and when they're addicted yeah you need it you know I've seen a lot of guys who just got really pissed off and they would start going to places that would allow smoking because I'm guys would let you chain smoke so it's like I thought like going out so I can't just keep going outside I just want to keep going the only way they can make that different is if you made it a private club like I belong to a cigar club yeah it's a very hall too schmaltzy me and my brother Matt and when we go we we can go and smoke cigars with all these people like out in this plane or make food we act like assholes a deal maker I'm a deal breaker up here you know sell it 17 and it's kind of a crazy place cuz it's the girls are all really pretty and they're like scantily clad and they sort of excellent food and there's all these rich guys out there you always seem like movie stars and shit but it's a club you know and you're allowed to do a lot to smoke cigars at this club they should make a place where you know I don't think close what's up why not the hot room I was gonna say where that what's that one I'm gonna get scared in Toronto oh no in Toronto yeah oh the winner here Rosa shut it down the back room scared yeah because when the shutdowns were starting they were like we don't want take any chances because people don't know how much I ought to go away with so just guessing they're gonna shut down times like let's stop it was a hash bar it was so great yeah full hash but people go there too right that guy came up to me a couple times when we were doing Sal's and he asked me to do shows there and I was like you're going to jail really like I'm like this is my if everyone's in there with a car why doesn't matter VOC there because there's there's the possibility always of federal federal invention if the DEA is in town because they're gonna start cutting down there was there anyway so if they just have a regular pot room I'm sorry they're yeah but not that room but that's where people are gonna be getting high actually physically getting high and a lot of them I guarantee you are not gonna be legal there's gonna be a lot of sneaky hippies that mama didn't have the money to renew my card and what's the hassle it should totally be legal anyway men nature gave me my license yeah those fuckers they're gonna arrest them you could be there doing a show while that goes down you might go to jail too everytime I don't want to wait when your card ever got renewed let's it ends May 1st like I'll just buy a bunch of weed April 29th and that'll last me till like June 30th but what am i doing well I just gotta buy two months for the fucking $45 it costs it is beautiful that you could just go to a store and buy it yeah I've really as I said that I don't think that's gonna go away now just because of the fact that so used to it volt now yeah and it's a big impact on the economy it's just the rest of the country really doesn't know that kind of freedom yet they don't know how easy it is to live like this you know there's like it's great and and people who think there's anything wrong with it you're being silly it's drugs it's drugs look that's not a good enough answer so is alcohol so is adderall so is that all chose this coffee I'm drinking this is a drug my feeling is like yes so what's a drug so is this a nipple ring and having my button trust yes do drugs all you want it what's the difference it's people are scared and Ari Shaffir they're goddamn scared they're scared of weed cigarettes have addictive Nick you know them and you shouldn't say like well just because they're doing something wrong you should be allowed to but like we are gonna have this so you know I was gonna write this thing I wrote this whole thing about this this Trayvon Martin thing yeah when when that kid got shot and there was all these people they were rallying one way or now I probably nobody really knows what happened it's like exactly no one doesn't know what happened but my my felt my feeling was like man when are we gonna evolve past the point where that's even a concern yeah exactly what are we gonna go all past the point where people are breaking into people's houses to steal and shit when are we going to evolve ask the point where people start and shit with people because they're packing a gun is there ever gonna come a time when that that's the past we're not hacking each other with swords in the streets every day everywhere you live anymore everything is getting radically improved security and safety radically improve every city all over the world for animals here yeah but I nobody said well he said they were in lines after the tsunami and the Japanese people were in lines you know waiting to get their food yes it's so nice that you wait in lines here and they don't so orderly he was like well that's the only way it should be yeah what are you talking about and should we've become such animals that would we think that's great well we are a country without much history or tradition you know we have a sort of a fake history and tradition make a big deal out of our history you know my history you know what history a bunch of my great great grandfather started escapees from other countries that fucking came over here and tortured and killed all the natives or you came later and oh yeah oh you came late out of my history you're white trash that's not a history it's silly when you stop and think about like say the history of China or the history of Japan one country that's been in one place for a thousands of years I mean there's a true history to Japan and there's a history of obedience and there's a history of order and discipline and it's it's a the tradition of it as far stronger than it is in this country that's a fact Brian and I saw it we went over there and I'm not saying the tradition if I had to choose to living in Japan and live in a generic America to America Japan or living with Jamiroquai apparently he gets crazy I love his music though don't get me wrong but apparently throws punches at people at shit but Japan was so much more polite and orderly and even like when we were at though they didn't understand us so we were when we're out the arena once we got in and I showed them that I had a badge they like talked about and I go now he's with me he's with me like oh they just let you go yeah I like that at some point we're like look obviously you can lie to me if you want right don't please don't do that I don't just check yeah there's a noticeable and I'm not saying it's a perfect society or utopia or anything like that but there's a noticeable leap up in impatience and a noticeable leap up and in kindness and the way people interact it with people is really interesting it happens we have unfettered access to rape a bold Chinese women is that what it is yeah I fuckin just calm down they just calm down there you go right there in London then go back there to come back to Japan soon I think me ambassador yes right we're gonna go are you and who some guy you met a lot yeah they're gonna get something Brad from Ustream has an office there so he goes all the time so next time he goes I might just go with him and just to hang out Wow yeah well I I found it quite fascinating I mean I've been to several different countries now and it really does illuminate you you know re and I was Raziel recently and we were sitting it was like 7 o'clock in the morning we may or may not have just smoked some weed and we're sitting on this balcony overlooking this beach and it's funny how all the sun's come up and we're watching all these kids play and play soccer and we were like who does this in America yeah at 7:00 a.m. who does they'll just run out there and start playing soccer and the barefoot crossing the street yeah and these other kids got home for my going-out but it was like yeah they're still out with her holding their shoes I don't think boys just out I don't think Brazil is better than America or America is better than Brazil but I know that that way of living is better than the way that most people here live I heard I heard a quote recently I think it was Mark Twain but Johnny Pemberton told me he goes up it was comparison is a death of joy Wow oh it's like who cares what better or worse I'll just tell you what the nice things we saw that's beautiful yeah do you know in Japan that the government plays it pays your electricity they pay a lot of things thank you one of that's gonna change now they're power plants are fuckin melting into the earth right yeah or maybe they just started charging for and they could have a better profit to make sure this doesn't happen in the future I wonder if that's even in oh I don't know with that - they're fucked Brian there they have a real problem with those three reactors how many mom'll be a fourth how would the profits have solved the meltdown well cuz obviously it seems like their shit was built like retarded style you know like that if they had like some more peak like intelligent people on wait a second why are you should not build it so it only goes to about a six point or 7.0 magnet yeah they had up to an eight point to only eight points but it was even larger than that it was like a nine why don't you make that shit 20 you know well I don't think they can the reality right so you go deeper yeah I just mean we didn't we just talked about this the other day this is my my take on the the craziness of nuclear power was that it's only been around for less than 100 years and think about in a hundred years all the different huge cataclysmic disasters from Chernobyl to Three Mile Island to this one and Fukushima this is three giant huge ones that have taken place and they've all it's only been in less than a hundred years how long is nuclear power think sir how long is nuclear powerful c2o coconut water my favorite it's delicious it tastes so good you think that it's got sugar and I even asked them I go you got sugar in the ship bitch nuclear the the real issue is they don't know how to shut these fucking things off and that's terrifying it's terrifying that they they're willing to build something that they don't have an out clause with they were just hoping to keep the power on so they can keep it cooled off they should have never really wanted to be without nuclear power and so to sweeten in forty years yeah I think Norway has moved towards that as well there's been a couple European countries that are considering this now they realize first of all they're very small you know a lot of European countries think about the impact of one nuclear power plant or two would have had on them you know Japan is very small and they're seeing they're seeing the impact of the radiation pretty far is there some kind of met this is might this is another O'Brien dumbshit thing listen there's some kind of a thing so well that they can almost just cover entire reactor like like the shook pewter feels too hot everything's gonna melt in it everything's clear we I know it's I don't understand nuclear science enough to comment on it but from what I understand they literally can't cool this thing off and they don't know what to do and they're pouring ocean water on it to try to cool off the reactors they've eaten through their containment they don't know where where it's gonna go as far as like how much is gonna impact the soil they've never really had one meltdown like this before let alone three meltdown in one area in Japan they've never this so they got to learn from what happened in Chernobyl I don't know if Chernobyl's damage was as bad as this one is but it's fun it's pretty fucking significant and the scary thing again is that there's several of these things all over the place I shouldn't say several there's hundreds of them all over the world and if these reactors keep fucking up in different spots of the world we're gonna have giant areas of our world that's contaminated and dead for hundreds of thousands of years and that's the reality that we're operating under and living under right now while you and I are sitting here talking on this laptop and you know our our information is being passed through the internet there's lights that are on and you know and you're gonna get in your car and you're gonna go and electricity is gonna fucking power that gas meter when you pump gas at the gas station and there's gonna be an electron all that shit is nuclear power son all that shit is built on the back of insanity our entire civilization runs on an insane idea that we're gonna take and we're gonna make a nuclear reaction we're gonna make a fucking reactor and we're gonna use this insanely hot thing to burn water and create steam and the steam is going to power and make electricity it's nuts it's fucking crazy and it's how the whole country works the whole country is essentially almost primarily on coal and nuclear power so it's either giant fires or it's you know some people have one mill there's a places that have like windmill fields right yeah dams can generate some electricity but there's a lot of it that's nuclear lot you ever been to that windmill fields it's like right outside of Los Angeles going up to Josh but you're good by the great pond yeah at night just thousands of these red dots and like I had no idea what it was and I'm just driving on what the fuck was I wish what is this it done a few fear factors out there oh yeah that's cool and those those those fan things are so slim that you're like what how does this do anything yeah can't steal cable wait Brian how does your brain work where we were on a conversation about nuclear power and stuff and you asked about the safety of nuclear power how would that be an O'Brien moment we're completely staying on on topic and not me because because I was talking about pouring metal on top of a hole about during long gown and big metal box there's little toys used to buy when you're a kid like goes a little cuter toys like whatever likes it whatever that is if you poured like a billion gallons of Venerable I think the real issue is they can't cool it down it's gonna take forever to come up how does other nuclear plants cool down well they have now the power to cool it down yeah I mean a lot of what's going on in a nuclear power plant is keeping it stable and making sure that there's not what's called a meltdown don't understand it enough to be just talking in vague terms yeah but what happened with Fukushima was the earthquake and tsunami and flooding and everything fucked up their backup generator so they they had nothing they had nothing to keep it powered so they had essentially eight hours before there was a meltdown so there's eight hours where they could just evacuate the area cancer started I don't know but I'm sure I mean there's a will so Bonnie's but there have been born with no ears it's weird mutants that are starting on the other and the fish things just hanging out with visibly non-working eyes what just hanging out front with me and Joe you probably have whatever we have now that's it for I was gonna not eat the sushi over there but it looks so delicious I was like whatever let's let it ride yeah that lasted a half hour I think we were talking about how we weren't going to eat in a day twelve great and everybody looks healthy that's not a cancer has no look we're uh we were just talking you and I were about Mad Cow they just found it oh yeah episode yeah they said the only reason they found is because they random testing Jesus didn't have didn't have the symptoms at all it was an irritable yeah no but they said they had they act a certain way dude it's so scary they're feeding cows cows mad cow disease comes from them taking cows and then butchering them and then grinding up their brain matter and also goes over and using it for routine basis they feed other cows I mix it in with the grains Oh cows aren't supposed to eat cows by the way so why are they doing that's really just save money yes exactly to save money because it makes for effective feed you can force the cows to eat that shit and they will he didn't stay alive and they get all fat and fucked up and they get essentially what's called Jacob skrutz Feld's disease which is the same disease that sab and cannibals in New Guinea get or they gather shakes they get this terrible neurological disorder from eating human brain because your program you're not not supposed to eat that exactly once it's a fucking trick by nature to make sure the cannibals don't serve it up a lion ate human brain you no problem no problem unless the lion ate a human who had Jacobs Creutzfeldt disease and that he could get it because he could get it from what what are called prions and that's the concern with people eating beef that came from England or a certain period of time when the mad cow disease was running rampant the idea is that you could have possibly gotten this Jacobs cuts had people start showing symptoms that ever sorry yeah sure died if you had cow disease and then the joke the Prime Minister of England was trying to say member that was trying to say it safe now so we shed a burger to his daughter Jesus this is how same I think it is Christ that's crazy that's the Game of Thrones type shit crazy asshole it's you know it's amazing that they're so greedy and stinky and disgusting that they've actually decided that there's a good way to save money feed cows cows you know mean it's just a conte decision just the worst decision what any company that makes that decision the government should come in like storm troopers and close their fucking shop down and or make it a socialist place you're here you should take over and feed the cows only grass Burger King is going to that's how to save chickens and something else in like next by 27 save chickens no not safe like free-range chance I'm more expensive but maybe it won't be as much definitions of free-range I better pretty sloppy been free-range is that they don't be they're not in cages they're in a giant pit looks like it's moving yeah yeah that's free-range by the way is house and look through the screen door the cats move all at once sometimes yeah it just looks like the floor is moving it looks like they're migrating to Diaz is a rock like birds yeah it's a 12 it's like a bunch of the homies yes no I think it's something like that I think it's really I have an idea cuz I need to get rid of one of my cats because it just doesn't work well with my dog and the other cat hates the two so that's just miserable so I want to find like a old lady to give it to but I was thinking about just like taking it over to his house and just kind of like throwing it into the mix why don't you pawning off on my ex-girlfriends never they've pawned off dogs and cats on you yeah I should know that's that's an old cat what about that's what grandmother's are for it but unfortunately all my grandmother's are debates always giving my cat as we go to take a dictionary and just that's gold giving you their cats thanks people need animals yeah yes I think companionship is fuckin for sure so if anyone in Los Angeles is old and needs a companion take your old cat yeah you're high okay I mean how much longer is that guy gonna live you hope it does right I think it's like six more years dude how do you come I'm going no you're not do you ever hope he does uh I don't hope any animal dies but it wouldn't be upset it is a miserable cat right now and I feel really shitty for for even trying to give it a happy life right now yeah but why is it so miserable because you got a second cat because I have a second cat and a dog and both of them fuck with those two love each other and they're like a gang and they've just like booked this other cat you know and the other cats the original original line and it's like damn babe you've created gang war in your own house you got police in your own house yeah really why you're supposed to get rid of the other two supposed to get really cat in the dog yeah but they keep the original they pay you off to pay me off really what because there's an attention yeah yeah you need that now my poop so he never poops on and the house he doesn't eats it right away and selling it up don't ask him because it's gonna be something like this he picks up after himself he shits and it needs a pack of and I never really yeah no it's not so disgusting yeah same poop up off the floor it's just like are you like are you joking around right now I hope you are not you leave that thing in it doesn't have it can't shit so just shits on the ground and yeah this is a poop pad and it needs its own shit huh it loves its own stop it it's a shitty peed of a dog but does not it it's a lot like all of it or just look at it you want to just look at it or is it there's all of it every time I come down and it looks like he had a nice cookie there's little crumbs of his own dude how how is not not incredibly disgusting to you because I hole dog baby out of his mouth look I put Listerine strips in his mouth and I don't I put I have this Dada jerk I have this dog spray stuff for a dog breath are you save this conversation are you addition processor if I can't allegedly allegedly I have to find out where I am what part of the world yeah right if I do I made it Monday's for just four comedians when I block out of an amount of time like that it's a very selfish because I'm a father I know I can I can smoke pot and be functional but I have to be real particular about like where I am where I douche room oh yeah yeah it's like a truth like it's gotta make it work I tell you the last time I did I just convinced I'm never going to do this shit ever again I've done it you know since I was a young person and then I stopped for seven years yeah and then I I always thought in that seven year time I'm like you know what I've done everything I needed to do at that that's stupid now I I need but then I started dating younger girls and then I had to rego through all their drug experiences and now I'm like back into how I was when I was 21 again well I think it's it's all about the intent like what are you trying to accomplish out of using in are you trying to find something out about yourself are you trying to have like a spiritual journey the answer yeah or are you just trying to play and party and get fucked up and say oh I can't believe what I took well I took so much because I think a lot of times when you do that and you don't go into a trip like you can you could take a mushroom trip for granted a mushroom trip can kick your fucking yeah they can be just fun too though sure you can't if you don't stay go like a concert the quantity food how much food you ate the quantity who you're with where your state of mind you all be with people you like yeah and you can get away with doing mushrooms but the when you do big doses like you did you did a giant dose yeah I firmly believe that was the last time be prepared for a fucking journey through space when you do that I mean you should be someone who's been going to yoga class well she I think that's I think that's an overdose amount like well like there is such thing as overdose amount meaning your body with that with you the rats here's the body and me immediately rejects any of it they get a small amount that's that's when it over it's all your body's like no no get this out of me an overdose yeah you're just you're reacting to that to that stuff that boys this thing about mushrooms is it's not poison it's what's gonna Jack you is like it's like saying Psaltis poisoned salt isn't poison but if you eat a pound of it you're fuckin dead its thorn yeah mushrooms are the the active psychoactive ingredients in mushrooms the it mimics human neural chemistry that's why it's so powerful what mushrooms is is like for with psilocybin is I don't know say it exactly but something like for phosphoric C and n dimethyltryptamine and and in dimethyltryptamine it's actually made by the human brain so it's dimethyltryptamine plus something else and it's some weird phosphorus something or another molecule attached to it somewhere another that makes it different but whatever it is it's so close to human neural chemistry it's not really a poison it's just some weird fucking side venture that you can take your mind on huh so the danger is only in like spectacular doses to actually worry about poisoning yourself taking three grams you're fine yeah you could take you could take a lot I mean I know I've known people who survived and 10 grams of programs from many different people and they are fine I mean there's scared as fuck and when they come out of it I mean they shot through the middle of the fucking rabbit hole and came back with Robert Lewis cat what does the guy thought what you did Bryan 10 grams it's about 10 grams yeah Robert Louis Stevenson yes yeah is he the one who wrote I wonder let's just go with a Lewis Carroll those yeah Carroll others multiply that times in middle so I mean all that stuff was that was all psychedelic inspired I'm sure all of this it wasn't it supposed to be but I acid it's supposed to be about that yeah you could you could take enough mushrooms even fucking lose your mind for sure but that's super super high you're no one my legs listen to me this is gonna take that much I my legs did not work I fell to the ground legs don't work I thought as he's walking down the street I mean like I fell to the ground and I could not stand up like it's not a good use of America no I don't think that's anything that people should try one less they thought was a research my brother safe and that was technical age what's that that was 10 grams that was that that was when it's a 1/4 in an eighth whatever that is they deserve better than that Brian you're a leader at this point I think you need to step up oh don't do it stop having your legs fall apart son how many grams do you think you did when you had this spectacular trip Ted its quarter an eighth that sort of comes out to 10 10 to 11 10 to 11 grand huh so crazy what was the most memorable part of it my hand turning into pyramids gold pyramids nice when I puked it was all colors and it turned into trees Wow and then it like felt like there was trees going in my mouth and stuff and then trees going to your mouth though Wow the walls were made of like at at Legos and they were just falling down and Wow it was fucking crazy I know it's sick I know what thoughts did you have all this was going on Olive Garden I ate so much I would poison why are my legs working I'm puking will you pear here's what I tell freak I wasn't really paranoid was more like something I've never had my legs never work I've never had body like I've trimmed a hundred times plus and I've never had it where like my body wouldn't work so you were just so bunkered out that you literally couldn't figure out how to use things I guess you laughs I mean I I recorded myself and I talked like I was fine and and and I felt like I knew what was going on but it was more of like I felt like a poisoned what's like the best thing you ever learned from a trip what is what have you ever come out of a trip and had like this is like a real solid revelation I always have revelations every single time like the last one I did which was I did in a shitty hotel room and I did a whole podcast with the other girl I did it with and it's on desk squad but well how do people find it it's just go there and type in it's on the front page of desk watch TV and it's like but for now people might be listening to this 100 years from now okay hold on I'll tell you in a second want oh I doubt it but hey hopefully it sounds something cooler than iPhones right or iPods that's good I did it with my her name what's her name I did it with my friend friend Pamela wall in Amy Hawthorne and we just went to this really really really really shitty hotel in a really scary place what's the name of it Motel 6 moto means that I would advise against by the way I could go into a place that's like a shitty environment death squad number 18 and so that's who were the people aren't just me and Pamela Walt just did we did our because she had it was her first time doing mushrooms I and she you know had got just got over having cancer whoa crashing well she's homeless you know she she goes from couch to couch whoa you know she just has had so much most of her life she had such bad social anxiety that she would never even talk to anyone and then recently she started getting better with the help of actually adderall believe it or not whoa and so now she's actually being able to function and talk to people which is something that she is like being reborn as an adult so does she like the mushroom trip um she had the most fabulous wonderful time she found all this and things and it was just the most ideal thing ever and it mazey enough shitty shitty shitty situating how the same stuff the same batch of the same drug it's not like you got a bad batch just some people have a good trip and everyone sin awesome as a bad trip I think a lot of it is going what's going on your head yeah there's with points in times in my life where I was teetering on a bad state of mind well you know I but if you listen to the thing there was a reason I was forced into this bad situation because I I went from being like alright this like we might get shot at this hotel this hotel is actually a place that you go to do drugs and get hookers like there's people living there and we explain this whole thing in the detail right so I ate it and then immediately started realizing like wait a second we don't want to be here for six hours trapped in this room I need to be a babysitter because this might be really bad that's something like Fear and Loathing in the middle of the desert type shit yeah that's funny shit everywhere it can be worried dude you should totally about that and that should be part of your act on stage yeah that's actually I need to figure it out that's a funny idea for a bit dude right without getting fucked up on mushrooms in the wrong hotel yeah it was bags like every time I wanted to go have a cigarette I had to go outside and one time there was like this black dude that right that was like running really fast then he hid behind a wall he looked at he looked right at me I'm like oh shit I saw him and then he started running as fast as he can like he was absolutely hiding from so neighborhood was this is in this weird place in Ventura it's really bad maybe he was on mushrooms - maybe but but but I would go out and have a cigarette and I started like I had this cell phone case it had all these little diamonds on it kind of like himself yep adored and so I started like leaving over everywhere I would walk just so I would have a place with about if they have to find me there was like I was doing read your mind could definitely water - on a bad situation where it makes it seem way worse while you're mushrooms right and then there was a fire alarm outside we're doing I'm like that's the emergency thing if anything happens if we get robbed or stuff something I'm pulling that that's how scary this the hotel was but I made myself puke but it was too late I wouldn't think it would be so fun if you grabbed that and pulled it and it's silence I know it just falls off and there's drugs like clanking happens but you gotta do that within the first 30 minutes - I tried - and it was the only time but never tripping out 30 minutes in that heart I hadn't eaten the whole day or the night before I actually had my finger down my throat and never have done that successfully in my whole entire life and made myself puke it up I gotta pee and I started tripping how long into this was was that about 30 minutes wait why'd you start if you just started shopping afterwards why'd you make yourself throw up no it was happening while I was puking guys all that stuff when he starts that feeling like terrible and stuff was happening before like as you said this was a difference just my latest trip when I tried a hotel room i I just when after I ate I started noticing like how bad his hotel was like we opened up the sheets it was like like fucking mess shit in there and it was like a stain that was on each side of the sheets it was gross and and yeah and then just people outside that were like it was scary like the cops came at one point and busted up this huge cops are good to see when you're on mushrooms even though they can't tell they don't know anything you're still like good cops is weird this makes it bad things when Pam was checking into the hotel somebody through the office in their car let's go there I didn't go there I met them there and then I ran up to the room thinking oh this is cool and then right after I eat cuz I was trying to catch up cuz they were or if somebody crashed through the window with her car when they checked in somebody crashed the car into the office so like the wall was broken up I got ya and you like Dom okay here's my credit card information this is not great I didn't do it but yeah it was it was a hat was sure my hell April while she was having the same exact opposite so it's interesting we just talked for like two hours about you can let yourself get in a bad place my friend took it once and with a girl with a guy he's barely new and a girl he sort of liked and it was just one of the worst trips for him because he said it was like he was worried about his behavior in front of certain people and that worrying puts you in a bad position yeah that's one of the things about ecstasy that's so cool you can do it with anybody oh yeah you just feel like you like everybody yeah released everything I still think that's the best drag in the whole entire ride use yeah one day other than weed yeah it's the dude like I said I love the experience but the comedown was fucking brutal it was brutal I took two pills I don't know what the milligrams were but yeah ham to the law yeah the next day I was wrecked yeah those are all sort of the same milligrams right they're just different I seen a guy once okay I take nine oh my I don't know yeah that's are the same people that like a long time ago always do ass well there's there's certain dudes like James Cameron I want to go to the bottom of the ocean this guy wants to go yeah yeah so if some dudes just want to go to the bottom I saw it one of the UFC's when I was ecstasy and some pop pills something and it was when clay weird was fighting I got so fucking into it yet yeah look at the floor hilarious we figured this out later like years later there was we went to a UFC once and he was so emotional and like screaming at his mom or and then he told me just like a couple months ago goes oh yeah I didn't record you this but I was on whatever you just sex is the best best Mari now the best re you fre UFC moment is documented it's when what the fuck is his name it was in Brazil in Brazil okay when they're Terry Adam got wheel kicked in the head by Edson Barboza Edson Barboza crapped him with this wheel kickin as he's going down you and Joseph are right there and you like put your hands on your head like holy shit yeah cuz I put my head up my mouth like oh no like that's so brutal Ari was like right over my right shoulder like where I'm sitting like right at the cage and always right behind me so if you look at like the animated gifs or online you can see re pop up there's a super slow motion when I saw that was like really cool just it happening super slow but I'm slowly I'm up before he hits the ground I don't care what anybody says that is I mean it was amazing the greatest job I have ever figured out how to I don't know how the fuck I ever got a job working for the UFC but that is the greatest job ever tell me around was row crazy yeah nuts Brazil was insane to be able to be able to be there right there ringside yeah I've seen like a like more than a thousand great fights like that it's really incredible you know and then for you in Brazil you were right there with me and I staged 18,000 people fucking scream I've never seen a crowd like a Brazilian crowd man anybody who thinks that American crowds are loyal or nationalist we just scream the USA but awesome guy trains in England yeah we scream USA to the other one yeah we scream USA but that's about it and in Brazil they scream you're gonna die you're gonna die they all chant you're gonna die and then when Mike Pyle Mike Pyle won his fight against this Brazilian dude only non-brazilian away yeah against punch and when he won the fucking whole crowd is calling him a fag yeah Portuguese it's their turn to the to the to the translator like what are they saying what are they saying right now she thought they were saying a different word turns out they were she thought they were saying cigano which is Junior dos Santos is nickname they were saying like it's like fig I know or something I was like just faggot how it's easy yeah it's unfortunate that Anderson Silva and Chael Sonnen are gonna be fighting in Brazil there was apparently we're gonna do it at the giant soccer stadium was gonna be 80,000 people but there was a UN meeting that was going on there the two days before so there would have been no hotel rooms it would have been a nightmare because you'd have to bring in 80,000 people from other parts Brazil in the world want to come in and fly in to see that fight so it was way too nutty so they had to saw it decided to move it to another place I would have because it's the biggest fight available it's just the biggest fight and then yeah you would be in the biggest city yeah it'd be like wow I think as far as what I've read is that they're still gonna do a fight in Brazil that week but they're they're locking down where that's gonna be and who's gonna be on that card yeah but the really Anderson Silva Chael Sonnen match is gonna be in Vegas okay which probably for Chael Sonnen is fucking way better man do you know I was he was in danger in danger I don't know that place was so goddamn beautiful Brazil it's amazing what Ari and I was saying is we were up in seven o'clock in the morning watching these kids my way they were like a concrete this life is like why don't kids in America do this why isn't everybody running around and playing like this like this is like they were so it looks so joyful there was so much fun to and you knew that they probably were pulls it that way like America used to be or at least is it still like getting in the Midwest and stuff we're just small towns we just get up and go play with people know what I mean what makes my place like Brazil is it just the environment the environment so beautiful the weather so beautiful there on the ocean ocean people dwelling people almost always have like us a certain appreciation respect for the ocean almost like a pretty little appreciation for nature it's why beach towns are always so calm you know there's like almost like a chilled relaxed thing it's like man you're just faced with something so impossible you're looking out at fucking a hundred trillion gallons of water or whatever the fuck the ocean is where it's never-ending you don't see the end of the water it goes you know they're bigger than the entire continent you're living on and just it's it's so humbling it's just one of those things you look at it just it makes you chill out a lot of a people when you have to have a higher power make you have a higher power but some people don't want to say God so that you can say it's like the ocean just only more powerful than you are oh I like that you know it sounds like less on to yes still number one in iTunes yeah Doug Benson dethroned him for a little bit birthday and then back back and forth Doug Benson is not a comedy album it's just a podcast and then puts his podcasts up for sale nice yeah a lot of guys do that there's a lot of controversy about that some guys live like one a month that they'll have for sale that's a big giant things like whatever yeah wow so he's back there Joey his is on my podcast this week okay on the skeptic tank yeah hey Joey DS driving fun with it yeah I am I like it do you want a week yeah someone will get a couple in a week or two or three in a week so if I'm gonna be out of town a lot you have me to do anything like that consistently really amazed how about us fuck man yeah I'm amazed we're doing it - what did his episodes us - 11 or something oh it's crazy and so you could at any point you could you be like I'm not gonna do it anymore it'll just be done there'll be no trouble yeah it would be a problem I'm getting fired I think at this point time we have a commitment yeah yeah yeah I don't think we would be able to stop there's too many people that's not that nothing's really pushing you on there's nothing real there yeah we all tired keep doing it we owe people they're listening they've made our life better because they like this podcast and I think we owe them that people go to so many more comedy shows we're not gonna stop dude I think it's in general not just with this podcast but in general it started this Renaissance of stand-up comedy yes I thought country and it's like and I see the club's the like hometown club it's just more people are out yeah people have access to this artform they've never had before and there's no more good guy yeah but that you can just find who you're aesthetically pleasing person is yeah you know max dices kid uh-huh went up at the ice house the other night didn't rate on the podcast and went up and killed yeah at the comedy show like I just I can't see enough of that I can't see enough of like this new generation coming on yeah good I can't see enough of that yeah it's so inspiring it's beautiful and podcasts are allowing these kids to sort of get their stage I'm telling you man that's one of the reasons why the Atlanta show went so well I'm so used to talking in front of people that's gotta be a lot of it - I wrote down the podcasting is like cross-training for stand-up people it's like yes not full jokes just training thinking of stuff it's like gets you in shape for standup yeah I could never have gone up on that just doing that whatever Kwikset if it wasn't for pod guys I would have fucked said fuck you and like shit myself you know Eddie Bravo's gonna do some dates with us he's no emcee some shows any problem I once who wants to go on stage he wants an emcee he wants to bring people off started he goes I might try to do a joke or two here and I'm like you can do it I'm like of course you can do it anyone but if he doesn't want they're just like he's what he wants to encourage him encourage him on Twitter because he can do it Eddie Bravo is one of the funniest dudes I've ever met it's all about for him it would just be about focusing there just be about him finding you know whatever it is that he thinks is funny and focusing see I know you're just scratching your beard but it looks like you're totally shaking your head when you just want to straighten that out with all the internet detective Brian has got a match on his face but you don't see that because the microphone balls in the face so it totally looked like you were shaking your head just crazy that was definitely an itch ha ha ha I just started going back to jujitsu again I took three months off I know what you booked up to get fat no I hurt no I didn't end do anything I stayed the same way I kept training I made sure I kept working out I stayed in shape I stayed in like kettlebell shape and weightlifting shape and workout shape but that's less than jiu-jitsu shape it's not good as jujitsu shapes harder well I I found myself struggling for the first couple of classes but not nearly as much as I'd be if I didn't do anything if I didn't do anything I wouldn't be able to do it I literally wouldn't because one of the things that I thought about while I was working out while I took the time off it was when I was training I was working I was training to go back and roll I knew I'm not you're tired yeah I did not want you tired I was doing a lot of sprints I was doing a lot of especially on the elliptical I do these things were just purely for cardio purposes I would do maybe 10 to 15 minutes as a warm-up at a reasonable pace and then I would set it fairly stiff like level 13 or enough and then I would know I would blitzkrieg for 30 seconds just as hard as I can do it for 30 seconds and then kick it back and recover for 30 seconds and then do it again and I did it for 20 minutes so essentially 10 over 20 Sprint's 20 mad crazy Sprint's when I lost all that way that's what I used to do yeah elliptical I would go as hard as I could for a minute and then two three minutes of just you know just kind of sitting there with my heart rate really high and then it's so hard man it's such a great workout I mean like when someone tells you you can't get a good workout on an elliptical machine like pitch you're crazy I go I'm in hotel rooms if I'm staying in a hotel and they say all they have is an elliptical machine I can get a fucking ferocious cardio workout in on an elliptical machine yeah you just got to use it the right way yeah and the beautiful thing is you don't get injured on those you don't you're gonna hurt your knees or yeah it's no impact it's all circular motions have memorized you did - yeah so ready Bravo really some sort of a meniscus thing gonna happen to you I think if they said cartilage this time cartilage yeah my other knee your other knee you playing a basketball still mm-hmm no no no I'm not I can't dude those body work bodyweight squats though I know I showed those yeah those are like literally miracle workers for strengthening and tightening your knees yeah one of the best exercises I've ever had for a leg endurance and for building up the muscles of your club endurance I just standing up I took my shoes off after basketball I stood up and I just felt a pop and then fluid well can they fix it what'd they say he's got the exact what it is first that same doctor do the other one that really he's real I didn't know that's the pot doctor oh whoops oh I know my doctors are my doctors yeah he's a real doctor yeah he's he worked on my knee two times he fixed my right knee and he fixed the meniscus in my left knee he fixed my left knee when everybody else fucked it up or the other guy had fucked it up the other guy he did wanted scoped it and he tried to stitch it up and it just never really healed it was always amazing how when you think about it you think like doctors know what they're doing but like some doctors are bad you need doctors that work with athletes that's what you need because one of the things that happened after I got an MRI when I tore my meniscus which is a really simple thing the meniscus is not that big of a deal on the scroll the rest over but the doctor sitting there telling me I need to stop doing martial arts by the way this is only I was only 30 at the time you know and the doctors telling me you need to stop doing martial arts and I'm listening to her and I'm going first of all why am i why are you telling me I'm not asking you for this oh my go I don't see where this is like that big of an issue and she's like you're gonna can in you to injure this knee and you're telling me that it's impossible to rehabilitate a meniscus tear and get my body to a condition where I can train again I call shenanigans okay just because you know you say you'd rather not have that but like what bitch what are you talking about I've been stitched up together like 15 fucking times I know what I'm doing sometimes deal with it no she does being my mom do you think do you think it's gonna catch up like say 30 years from now no no I have no I know pain man see first of all I make sure I stretch out like crazy okay second of all I eat a lot of fish oil I take like ten thousand milligrams official a day I think that that alone promotes like healthy strong joints and ball eye stretching and doing all these bodyweight exercises really important for strengthening up the joints and student tightening it those bodyweight squats you go all the way down your ass touches your heel and your heel comes off the ground and you push up from there and when you do like hundreds of those right at the knee is where you build on your muscle like all up in here like the the cap of the quads yeah all around your knee all that builds up because it's like a really high volume you know you're doing like 200 of them yeah and it really tightens and strengthens everything it gives you more endurance and it also because the fact that your legs have done so much more work and they're stronger you're less likely to have them buckle on you they're less likely you've at all car literally though so technically that's a lot of the reasons why people get injured is because they don't have enough physical strength to stop the injury from taking place their body you know their their the coordination or they're exhausted or all people follow break their muscles there's enough no fucking no they don't but they broke their bones because no muscles to guard against that to weld also that bones get really fragile that's one of the things the osteoporosis they they if you're not lifting weights or taking care of your body in that way where you're adding you know it's really important especially as you get older to actually physically lift weights if you want to keep your bone dance really bone yeah your bone density yeah it's very important there's so there's old dudes like you can go to the gym and there's a guy named Albert Beckles yeah and I believe he was in his late 50s or 60s Brian Google that guy for me please Albert Beckles and Albert Beckles bodybuilder and he was a really old man and I went to the gym there was a Gold's Gym in North Hollywood when I lived in North Hollywood and I would used to see him training there like Charles Alice B and then he was all as fuck dude and he was so wall like a motherfucker look out the photos of that guy on me he's got a really nice asshole what was the other guy's name that old look at this photo this guy receiving a nice big one that's him he's black yeah dude you mean right there he's probably like fucking 60 years old or something really yeah I'm not kidding the guy was fucking enormous just don't get a picture of his bicep that's his bicep just pick just click on one picture so Ari can get us there some of them he's bald and old shit and just look at the body on that guy's ridiculous fuck there's this would be that's the only way you can do that well steroids but the other way is you have to lift weights in order to keep that density up at that age that keeps your bones yes not your muscles you know your bones weightlifting especially like real heavy weight bearing exercises like deadlifts and squats they contribute to thicker bone density Wow yeah it's really important as you get older especially because that's when your bones start to get brittle and fragile so guys like Albert Beckles I bet that guy's like look at that guy's body and that's an exam as 50s there dude I mean he was just for animal there's three dudes like that yeah by the way Terrence but haha also intense workouts and intense training and focus you can't just give it all the stare out there because the guy still had to work after steroids if he took yeah if he just took steroids only he would still never get that big those guys he just lifted weights hug there we go I'll never be that lean you know you have to be incredibly dedicated to get down to that level and he's like championship bodybuilder level what the difference between a guy like Tim or a guy like say Steve Maxwell Steve Maxwell's the guy was a hundred percent natural and he's a fitness fanatic and he is I believe he's about 60 doctor Steve no no that's that's Steve Graham Steve max was the guy who teaches me kettlebells and comes over like a couple times a year and we you know will body if he comes and trains me for like three days and shows me also it's a new shit and I film it on my my iPhone he's a master dude he's steve maxwell you could follow him on twitter i don't know i think its maxwell strength & Conditioning maxwell S&C maxwell SC maybe but he's a real master when it comes to training and and different things that you can do to to keep your body healthy as you get young like he has a whole series of DVD series all on joint mobility and how important it is to stretch as you get older your range of motion especially if you're not like if you're just sitting in an office your range of motion is gonna get more and more limited because you're not doing shit your body's not going anywhere you're just sitting there all you're less able to use it those yoga guys that can stretch like crazy they always a shocked me yeah it's incredible it's because they keep doing it it's because you know i mean most of the reasons why i'm still flexible at this age is because when i was fifteen to the time I was 44 I never stopped stretching just keep doing it if you keep doing it you can keep it up but if you take off just like a few months you take off just a few months of training and don't work out and don't do shit for a few months your body will turn to a sack of shit like that do you feel that when you when you stop using heavy training we kept working out dude I've never stopped even when I get injured I'll stop doing certain things like I've been in places where they say you can't do any working out like after I got my nose fixed I couldn't do anything for a full month yeah they don't want you the elevating your temperature or your blood pressure rather and possibly you know opening up some of the sutures or in it so no exercise at all for four weeks so for four weeks almost like fathers just eat pizza and commit to it no I just try to eat healthy but I couldn't do shit in in hopes that I didn't want this operation to be fucked up cuz I was without a nose to breathe out it for most of my life and I knew how terrible it wasn't but then once I did it I was like I was in a race to get back in shape terrified to stick because as you get older man the more easily to just stay there yeah you could just become a lazy fuck what what you go to this campus festival next year which festival Moontower Moontower Austin won did you just get back from that yeah what was it everybody's got a festival man you know they take sports or do they uh yeah yeah we're gonna have a desk wide festival we should that's what first we're gonna have music like honey honey ask them if they went economy we have some everywhere we where should we do this I think fucking Joshua Tree really but no no no in a city yeah why do they have to go somewhere Vegas Vegas isn't a bad idea Vegas is not a bad idea Vegas again cost money man you got flying in and shit taxes through it for locals yeah Austin Texas Austin Texas might not be a better somewhere where it's warm that's all yeah Austin Texas is in the middle to some lot of people can fucking drive there or fly there a lot easier and it's well if we were gonna have it we would want to have it at a place where there would be enough hotel rooms there's how many people gonna come see let's say if we have like let me do a comedy show they're so expensive yes look at Southwest by South West we do it in the same area all those hotels that Austin right that's South by Southwest yeah maybe we could do it six months after when South by Southwest is there so we don't compete with them at all Austin des quad festival when is South by Southwest some months ago I think a month ago yeah so it's what April worried about competing with the South by Southwest anybody all right Damon Dave first of all you can't do it anywhere near them because first of all they're way more established they're gonna eat up all the hotel rooms oh yeah I mean if you really wanted to do but then you would have to like organize it man and then you'd have to pay the band's like if you have bands performing yeah you get a higher tour manager we'd have to figure out who would be I mean if we're gonna have a death squad Comedy Festival we'd have to be really picky about who we let go on stage too yeah you know if it's three days we just know the same guys we always is but there's like we have like 30 people that we use all the time and just in different rotations and stuff we made it a big festival and people got to plan for it they would want to do this yeah 30 fold we don't have 30 people that are good enough to represent us well yeah if you start grabbing back telling like hey you like to make be stever and his ease ease and all the a pretty law cards and be like hey do you want calm 30 though I don't think it's 30 I'm sorry girl what do you think Oh burn who are you talking about we're talking about like little Esther you know we're talking about like you know that all the guys and then you might even find that if it's a big enough thing that like there's just people that want to have hang out for a weekend like a party style so you might get like maybe like Greg Fitzsimmons to be like hey I want to come to this no and shit like that maybe he would he would want to get paid and as he should absolutely well maybe like a festival but then what you had different shows so they'd see different people twice yeah I guess they would have to if they went to different shows it would have to be some people on certain shows and yeah the kind it sounds like a lot of work yeah but it'd be kind of fun maybe someone you think of you know I mean look if the fucking insane clown posse can pull something like that off we could pull your not Dethklok shows at a comedy fest you know the really the best way to do it really would be to make it super simple and start it off simple and as easy as possible try it out one year and then then let it build you know the next year moved to Vegas maybe we try an ambassador know one year maybe we tried this year in passing that's what you do yeah here yeah but another cut you don't pay for hotels for almost any comic yeah how about that how about we do here it ice house continual ice house shows and we'll have like bands go up and perform at the ice house we'll have two shows going on at the same time with the ice house and just take over the club for like a whole week and have all of our friends come in right it's so hard how about the fuck out of it have all of our friends come in that we you know all of our friends like from out of town that we know that are great comics that maybe live in Texas and to be here yeah plan to be here I've bringing Stanhope and pay for them and you know and and they put him up in a hotel and give him the door 100% of the door and just and pump the show up and and and set it up so it's both profitable for guys to be and it looks like it's fun and the whole time we prod cast ourselves like that we want to have two things set up one we're gonna we want to have set up something so in the podcast room at the Ice House we can see the stage and on step one step two is we're gonna broadcast the podcast to all the people waiting in line so all the people are waiting in line as they're going in will be doing the podcast with speakers outside of that little courtyard area yeah so that will be going on and then we'll have shows we'll have bands that can go up I love it's they made they made the bar room of Lovitz you should pull down a screen they show what's going on in that big screen on stage that's not a bad show the podcast you can drink and just do that bar area where would you do that outside yeah they just do it there yeah I mean the ice house yeah you can do it outside yes I ready we go to smoke anyway sure why not put a big screen up there right yeah if you want to know if like you could talk to like the border that on that whole property because that whole building that is owned by the same person that owns like that parking lot that's right connected to it and if we were to like close that off and make it like you know different outside the summer in the summer product podcasts broadcast the podcast to the parking lot and just have pull up your own chairs you need certain permits because you could disturb other businesses and you disturb the neighborhood have that permission with all those businesses I don't think you could do that I don't think I think you know that first of all that's always in the park ten into a license a movie and it's in a park this isn't a parking lot and it's right next to people's businesses either would here for sure honey honey is out there jamming oh yeah oh yeah live band there's a festival that's in Columbus Ohio and it's the whole weekend called calm fest cut is what it is it's community festival where everybody in the community gets together and volunteers time work making a festival so like a lot of my friends would like sit there me you know the people that sell beer all day and they just do it for free and it's just there's three different stages four different stages and it's just music and and in poetry and there's girls walking around naked and it's and it's just people go there but tents and like pretty much just hang out at this park the whole weekend and and it was like imagine if it was something like that where cuz like your fan base is so like like that kind of like you know outdoorsy mushrooms nature kind of you know they like music and Jimi Hendrix and well we could eventually do it someplace like that someplace cool but we'd have to make sure that there's enough combinations for all the people that were invited to come down you know it would be tricky and we would also have to make sure that we could safely get all the artists there and put up put them up in places that's why it's starting it off in Pasadena it would be super easy because everyone's local we could have all the local guys go up and people that want to come here they can come here it's easy to get to Pasadena you can come here from all over the country we can set up a tent act calm Fest this year what's come fast that festivals you're talking about yeah I have a comedy tent I don't think we need to bring in people like that I think I think we advertise to our own people we advertise to everybody to follow me on Twitter and everybody who follows me on Facebook but you give it like the poet month to your lead of time yeah yeah say like this is the week you're gonna want to make your hotel yeah or I do that we could do that now and get thousands of people to come from all over the country I have no and just a bunch of shows throughout the week leaving that yeah two shows a night pretty much say I said or even do in a couple locations bags house and somewhere else this house is a great place because it's look it's close to LAX who can get there they can get rental cars they can stay it's not a far Drive you got a navigation system it's not hard to swing you know it's it's totally feasible and we have the best relationship with that Club the you know as far as clubs around and there's two rooms there so we could have two rooms running simultaneously and just keep doing shows we could do like two and three shows a night like we could have an Early Show you know we can have a bunch of different shit going on or have a music side stage we just mad security for nutty people so many nutty people have been showing up at the ice house lately oh me actually loves me during my show in La Jolla did you just run up and shove it in her mouth and how much do you love me bitch why you talk it was crazy I don't say what's wrong with you you need to be quiet so what happened after the show did you hang out with her no I told you I believe eventually I was like I understand she was weird through something was on something yeah she was on I love Ari wants a Jew dick what's up just there by herself well how did you end that's what they should leave oh she was there by people there by their self isn't really thought oh good sign of crazy not always a lot of people come by themselves that are very nice but occasionally it's a sign of crazy sometimes yet going anywhere by yourself it's like what what are you gonna be up to right now not always you know could could mean you cool I met some really cool people that came to shows by themselves nothing wrong with it it's not like a hard fast rule rogue fest but if you meet a girl though yeah and she comes to a show by herself that girl's a freak almost night I mean she's like I'm just here by myself just hanging out mmm so we would have to call this the death squad festival or something like that to fest yeah we'd have to figure out what to call it like the Insane Clown Posse they call their shit the gathering of the Juggalos we would not call the gun or the Juggalos no we couldn't call it that they already have that yeah to him I that would be so good in order to get people to come out but death squad is gonna give people the wrong impression oh yeah it is maybe we need to come up with a name for the festival like a yearly name just call it Olive Garden's maybe the happy primate festival comedy festival happy primate comedy fair but it's not it's not quite a Comedy Festival it was one dance - oh and we would you get just man come on I mean if you would get like some music club in Pasadena to show those shows no we would do those with the ice house to put it put us but they'll be easy to put up like honey honey they could play at the at the ice house easy I'm sure they've had bands playing that place gonna have the jump off the stage yeah yeah it's not much room yeah I don't know how they would do that how much room is there do you think there's room for a drum set no not on the stage absolutely not no way no no absolutely not there would be take up the entire stage though there's some of their best things they do is just him and her him playing guitar and her playing band who think they can do a cool set yeah that's better anyway man the acoustic shit they did on my podcast was brilliant yeah do you like 15 20 minutes at the end or 30 minutes before she is not like she has a real voice man that chick has a real voice like that's that's a legitimate voice it's not like she doesn't need any effects or any fakery she really can sing I would do a storyteller show get Christ she has to do it yeah we didn't get to sure yeah that could be a part of it absolutely that's a good idea yeah different themed Egyptians for like that yeah and you know what we should also have a how about a show we're just out let's ask topics that's exactly what I say questioning that answer we should do a entire surely we did a little bit of it at the end of the show in Atlanta but it's more like mocking people for the stupid questions and more moon landing hoax conspiracy talk people I wanna hear from ozone wow this guy goes well I do know that we went to the moon you don't know stop it I love just saying that well I dunno like I'm just saying it loud him I'm sure you sure we went what does that mean silly 1969 you know what happened no matter what the argument well I just know yeah so you're just saying you're just done talking now no one knows I mean we can kind of assume most likely that happened I'm pretty sure Kennedy got shot that I'm 99% positive but I wouldn't even say I'm 100% positive that buck knows this goddamn dark world people take that argument too far sometimes like well how do you know there was a candidate you know that's world's real how do we not know that you are not living in in computers and by the way I thought that was really hilarious I saw a video of you explaining to people how to download the bone zone and you did it as a handicapped person I know it's because I don't people don't know how to do it one Brendon Walsh was complaining that people were having a hard time from cast it's pretty much I showed Brendan how to do it and he made a big deal about it on another podcast it's like come on hey let me do it real slow again for you to show people how to download just the yeah or just well I think he wants it to be under his name is that what it is no he's just like people said that the kids search bone zone and it comes up when iTunes and so I was like no let me show you how to do it wait but you can't show the people some people searching that's we have to convince not pregnant how many people that are in your little network get upset that you have the network as the name of their show and then they're shown next instead of the way everybody else would I think out of let's say if there was a hundred thousand people I think I hear it maybe two times on Twitter no no no I'm talking about the Peabody host their shows nobody ever want to change it to their own name they must oh no I don't think right no no Jose none of them that's right now come on Brandon Walsh doesn't want it to be in his name and then have you as the network second now I mean they look what happened in Freddy Lockhart when Freddy Lockhart did it he you know he got lost and so he came back no no no no no no first of all Freddy didn't he left you he stopped doing it and when he left her it wasn't that he was you know that he went under his name that's why people couldn't find him it's like he really nobody gave a shit about him in him you said you were gonna find a way to have people know know how some come on podcast know Freddy left because he wanted to do it on his own and then what I'm saying is that when he did that and no one could find his podcast anymore because no one was listening to anymore well that's because that's only because Freddy had not and he said dude not publicized it well he didn't we talked about in on this part of nowhere that went on podcast we tweeted it I even retweeted him tons of times no it is it is an extra that's not enough if people you consider the numbers of people that are listening to yours but in order for him to have it go off on his own think about that he was doing yours for so long and it still hadn't developed a name where he could everyone is number one podcast on death squad when I left it went 270 but you know so well you know understand what I'm saying no what I'm saying is he in the all the time he's doing it with you still hadn't gotten independent he was still attached to your name so it's almost like he wasted time doing a good podcast under your name and never got his name out there so when his name got out there on its own it flopped cuz no one knew about it so he had been doing all this all this podcasting and spending all this time developing this this sort of a bunch of fans to follow him and he couldn't take it with him whereas if he just did it on his own whatever he built up would have been his own it would have stuck with him yeah do you make sense you know do you know how many podcasts that there's comics out there that you've never heard of in your life did you know Mark Ellis had two podcasts but yeah well Mark Ellis is not a famous comedian you know Freddy Lockhart first of all was on a television show and he's been on our podcast many many times and you know Mark Ellis no but it would be nice if people could search for his name yeah well again they can search was named the the real thing is like the question is do you do it the way Adam Carolla does it where he has you know like someone's whatever the like Penn's Sunday school and then underneath that it says ace broadcaster he has it in a secondary position and he allows the the person's name of their podcast that's first yeah and he's just the production arm of it you can build up a new yeah whereas Brian the way Brian does it is he has a channel and you know it's the death squad channel and then everybody else's podcast is sort of secondary that it's the exact not work it's collecting it all builds up the network it builds up the network as a whole instead of building up each individual as an entity on their own and everyone helps each other if you're a big Sam Tripoli fan you start listening to Sam triplet you're gonna start listening to Brandon Wallace vice versa there's so many people that never knew who Brandon Walsh was until the day just were like well I like Freddy Lockhart I'm gonna start listening to Brandon Walsh now because they're on the same network and vice versa so that's so in case of one people that came on to this podcast yeah but this is the same reasoning there would be people who were like oh I don't like let's just say I mean here's anyone who wants pockets they get annoyed and don't listen to the same tripoli podcast here's an example again and turn off by the stuff they're not into and like how much of this do I have to sit through before you don't don't listen to it would you listen to every single whine no be just less lucky to see it why it's less lucky to see it just six things that are there and you only do one of them is just like you're less likely to check in to see when there's updates well my only thought is that someone this is gonna make their own shit on their own if they're doing their own show on their own and they they Brandt I mean they start like Doug loves movies started out on his own captain on zone and at this point time because live shows that there was like equity that he's built up in that name and doing it on his own yeah and for a lot of these other guys they're building equity into the death squad name it's not it's not transferring look at look at Ari Shaffir look at Tom Segura there's ways that you can do it right they were they were lucky people like their show and they're listening to it aria is doing good on his podcast and so is Tom Segura so what do you try to say I'm just saying right dependent they left I know that's what I'm saying I'm just saying that that I don't think that like it works for everyone okay I think and I think that like like I think if Sam Tripoli wanted to like move off a death squad he can totally do it and he would probably survive but like I don't think that it's it's mean I suppose the way to stay on desktop but also have their own picture from podcasts with somebody yeah their picture that's all reason why I mean you you actually made a bad example because the reason why Ari and Duncan well Duncan especially did it completely independently on his own but what got them would got them famous was being on a podcast that was famous this one that's what got him that's a hundred percent was nobody asked me this week so not being on desk well they're like how many of your listeners already do you think are not a fans of Joe Rogan maybe like 1% maybe 2% which is fine you know look we're all sort of different but like-minded folks will apologize they're like like I didn't mean from sorry I didn't even know you you just and I didn't want to even see you before I hear in the podcast like I don't care that mean they're here because of that that's awesome the biggest thing I want to stress though is the reason why it's done as a group is is is also looking past what podcasts like I don't really think that Howard knows that in 20 years podcasts are gonna be fuckin kicking ass or anything but one thing I do know that's coming up is the the the basic future of cable television and networks and stuff are going to more of a streaming base a download based system like Netflix or iTunes that that is true like there's not gonna be an NBC antenna you that would happen independently of whether or not you made your show the first name or their show the first name anyways what I was saying is death squad TV to me will is like I'm kind of considering it more like a this is a channel this is more than just just you're listening to a podcast at your house this is like a TV show Network where each one of these shows are like it's like being on research desk squad it is like dot TV but it's like being on like MTV and each one of these things underneath it is a show and so one of the biggest things with like all the people saying you know like I want it to be separated into all the different things on iTunes and all that's all that stuff if you don't want to just go to desk without TV and download what you want to listen to we're making these show pages right now we're like as an example if you like the naughty show it's going to have all the knowledge the naughty show it's going to have an RSS feed which you can do right now in any browser if you open up your browser pick a search string of any kind who's gonna make an RSS feed thought that no one's doing that it knows my guards well anyways I'm just saying that you can't you can do it if you if you're freaking out about RSS feeds you probably can easily cut and paste and RSS string no people don't know no one's fools freaking out about RSS feeds exactly the one percent so anyways but what are these each one of these pages like like the naughty show page and stuff like that will have all the individual shows for each person and it's going to have each host is going to have a PayPal a show donation how many of your network shows are you actually in every single every one of them so that's another thing that's that's I produce them all there's the only ones I don't do is win like like to say Brian Cowen or somebody's doing one in their hotel room doesn't that drive you crazy to be in all those different podcasts I mean your brain must be scattered No because it's its quality control for everything I mean there's like there's like there's like shows like I love Esther to death but you know if if I didn't if I wasn't there and just put it up I would be mad at myself for fucking letting you listen to it and and vice versa sometimes you know there's there's there's a quality that all these people get we're like you know when when Ari was on on death squad he sent me one file once and it was like one person was really loud one person was super super quiet you kind of hear him really and I know Ari was angry at me from not wanting to put that up no I'm angry you for saying we're not putting it up before you let me listen to it that's all there was right let me hear I'll make my decision right but I kept saying no I can't I couldn't put it up because honestly I sat there for two hours trying to fix it to make it so it would be acceptable and it wasn't you know totally make sense yeah okay so I people don't know that yeah I'm on these pockets because I'm fucking producing them I told I told uh Callen cuz after you told me like his stuff was the same way it wasn't coming through I was saying you know you have to get microphones and courts for that right and he goes no I didn't know that I was like yeah you gotta get microphones and chords sit got told him where to get it yeah I like this way better from now on yeah the only problem that I have is that we use the name des quad for all of us and if you got a network that's des quad and then anyone it's on there because one of those people and is not the real just quad way to do it is to do Joey's podcast Ari's probably don't like that has to put it on a page somewhere but that's another link page we could put that if you if you if right weighted offensive right no one's saying anything but because that makes no sense about that that doesn't it's a no it makes a lot of sense what I'm saying what I do it just splits 100% of what you're building is being attacked exactly and and people on the internet think you're doing the same thing because because what it is think I'm doing the same thing what because what I'm doing is you're you're pretty much saying the real reason to do it a podcast network like like I'm not doing a real reason to do it just because I'm using the person I'm saying the the right way to to call it desk Wan it should not just be the shows that you're in it should be all of us it des quad is all a bunch of friends right all these people that way have I I'm doing all these shows I've been on the road with you Sam Triple E is done on the road right there's your Eddie Locker stop it doing people that have been on the road Pamela walls not what you're doing you you've got a bunch of other people doesn't even know who these people are they talk about the host of the show Brendon Walsh used to take us on the road right to some of them so you want to consider moving in the death squad Brian some of them some of them some of them not you know the Troodon James yeah come on all that shit there's a bunch of them I don't wanna name names and I want to criticize anybody I know but every person that's a guest on the show I wouldn't consider it beyond a desk wad would you what like if you have a person that's on your show as a guest there's a big difference in having someone on as guest as having someone who you're doing a show with them and then you're calling it desk wall and you're putting it on a network running you essentially have taken over that name and use it for your own stuff it's yes but it's Network on that desk quad you're on everyone that desk what all of us are desk while you were on every one of them because I produce every single show on that that's why yes but do you not see that that is like that is like you Joe or sort of 90% of the shows like I probably talk about 10% at a time no it's not it's usually it's more of same thing if you listen to a Howard Stern if you listen to any of the shows that have producers like Iraq or anything like that that's a normal thing Joe dude I'm not saying there's anything wrong with what you're doing I'm not saying that at all I'm not criticizing I'm just saying that to call it the death squad is kind of weird because the desk squad is supposed to be all of us and most of the people that are in the death squad aren't on the desk wad team okay so if one of you other guys did something with a decimal four I was the first one I was like hey I'm just going to make a collection of shows and call it desk card cuz Opie's said it one time and it was funny yeah but it's not the people that you don't do you know well use a little different yeah like you feel it's like the four people that was in the room why do not I feel it's family it's all the people that were family and I I think there's a lot of people to you podcast with you they asked me we're girls nice than Brian Keeley she's very nice girl Danu Oman very nice girl those people are your family we were good I've they're friends of mine they're gonna meet their friends of you okay then there's a friend she's a nice girl she's not much you've had her on this podcast I have what is the question Brian just a lot of people we've had on this podcast but yet you're acting like not only like a treehouse and you're like you're not allowed in this treehouse oh that's not what I'm saying I'm saying you're calling it desk wha when des quad is us desk was us as friends tagging all the people that were hanging out together in that group there wasn't there was not the whole demo Joey do P call this death squad so you're saying Joey D is because Jew who is Joey Diaz not one of my best friends is Joey Diaz not constantly on the road with us but we D is not the one who uses it more than anybody he was the one who actually started calling everybody death squad he's the one who ran with it she thought it was hilarious there's obviously some heat here then because you're really having a problem with me using the name not having a problem at all something and we were all talking about and I just happen to start calling something death squad it doesn't mean that I'm like no he was talking about me and it's all me and I'm just squad and that's what I mean I'm just saying that I used the term that we all use and I bought a domain and started doing a podcast for it you started doing a podcast and started calling the show's death squad and so you've essentially hijacked the name you've taken the name for your own what that name desk well you've taken it for your own network the network name of the videos not saying you aren't I'm just saying if it really was desk one you would have so sorry on that might show you have big links to all the people that you're not profited from as well if I if I created a podcast network and called it powerful are you saying that that wasn't I wouldn't be allowed to do that it's a big difference but people that call themselves death squad we've been calling ourselves death squad for like almost a decade and then all of a sudden the podcast comes along and you call this pot I thought that domain 2007 as you bought the domain didn't we call ourselves that before you bought the domain yeah so we call ourselves a lot of things but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to say hey I might use that as a name for you guys I can't even believe that you don't see another side of this I can't believe I see what you're saying but it's kind of funny that I've been doing it since 2007 and now you're just making it ever is that it should be all of us included guys the guys that aren't in a podcast network you don't profit from that he's not saying we've done something specific hold on listen for a second it's not saying you've done anything specifically wrong I know who knew I was gonna say that No and so the whole numbers I couldn't talk I know he's not saying you've done anything specifically wrong he's saying wouldn't it be nice to have built a page or in the future to build a page to include the people and they change right so what it should be in that group to begin with it should buy a squad it should be all of us it should be Joey Diaz it should be Duncan it should be fuel that I've never been in there we go right there because because that who does this who does that gets to chooses on it because you said some me how about I'll choose yeah but but why shouldn't your desk wide I'll tell you this because I'm gonna treat it fairly how about cuz I'm gonna let another actually is I'm not because there's somebody that you might went on there that I might not went on there and there might be sorry you don't think Duncan deserves to be in because you and him and having an argument you don't think that Duncan deserves to be part of desk wanna tell me before but he was telling argument when you're the argument cams from Duncan gotten upset at Brian when we were in Atlanta saying that Brian doesn't pay the comedians when he charged his mom for the shows at the ice house and they should but yeah I do and he just did no you only paid the MCs that's not true okay I can't just you should pay now are you gonna throw into because Yankee if you started paying people recently this is a different thing don't turn off bro because one thing not don't raise your voice and don't get crazy loser I agree first of all let me explain that Duncan shouldn't have done what he did what he threw me under a bus he cornered me drunk even though I had a beer in a Red Bull so he's also just fuckin it wasn't correct he was trying to diminish he was trying to attack me alright so mystery what's the whole thing was discussed the problem what I have in what he was getting at is we were talking about Southwest by South West right Southwest he does this video that where it says that Southwest by South West makes honey whatever it's called and they don't pay people to come out there because he was offered to come out there and he didn't get paid and so what I had brought up is that I had been hearing that it it really it's all about the venues like Southwest supply so it was like a blanket name kind of like a death squad and it's it's into each of the venues that that if they want you to come out and play their bar that they might pay you you know but Southwest doesn't do anything to promote it as a big party you know like they do advertising the promotions and stuff like that and then one who doesn't do Duncan made a video saying that they don't pay anyone in and they steal from comics so what happened is I was talking I was explaining like hey I heard this and he goes you're drunk and I'm like well okay this is not you're really paraphrasing obviously obviously obviously so so what then it turned it turned into that he said on a podcast you steal from comics and I was like what the fuck are you talking about because you steal from comedy you don't pay your comics I'm like well Duncan one why do you know why do you think I don't pay my comics I do pay the the emcee or the host usually which is like Tony Hinchcliffe or will I give him 40 to 60 bucks yeah and I then I pay usually if there's any people like little Esther or anyone that I know that is like fucking you know like they wouldn't have gas money to get there after I'm 20 to 40 bucks sometimes and like as an example this last one I gave you know little extra money I gave mark Ellison cash you know I spread it out I'll tell you those people been grumbling you got to show that cash to people all right what do people like I'm driving out there there's a cover charge how am I not getting paid all right saying this you don't want to say name people are saying people were pissed all right well here's here's that here's what a couple reasons why one because I don't get paid till following week so follow anything I pay for that night is I have to go to an ATM I have to take out money and have to fucking go RA how much money did I make did this so it so well the following week usually well and so then so then I have to figure out how much money did I kind of make this so I'll that's right there the door look how much money I could do that if I wasn't doing a live podcast at the same time but anyways and then I get tax and all that so everything I make there which is not even the door I don't get the full door I get like 60% of the door or something like that then I get taxed on it so that that pretty much cuts in half so when I'm what my average is usually is is about $200 to $300 I make on a show I usually spend about a hundred dollars giving it to miscellaneous comics to $150 and the other hundred fifty dollars to me is like okay now I could either not do the show or make $150 for booking a show advertising a show in producing 15 bucks a ticket times it's usually 15 when Joe does it in ten when I do it but I give out so many free tickets that it's usually wet not not when Joe's over dude I give it up when Joe does it too y-you don't have to I don't have to usually but if you give it away people you know but usually yeah but usually I give it away free tickets you just putting people visit the Comedy Store as I like they split the main room just the one show but it's nice the main room half goes to the comedy store half goes to the comedians but then let me say something here's how you avoid all this don't do this is how you avoid all this forever be infallibly generous oh yeah be generous to the point where they can't infallibly do it to the point where they can't argue against it be generous to the point where you're not saying you know I'm gonna make 150 bucks because I feel like I deserve you know what I do want to do you're right you know what that makes me want to do not do it I don't give a fuck okay it's a very defensive stance especially when you're talking to me and then the reason the people are going to the show is because I'm headlining and I'm promoting it on my Twitter obviously is not a bad thing man look you should make some money you should make I don't you know what I don't I don't do it for money I don't want any money but I also don't want to do anything like that for free because I consider that work then you're doing it for money if you don't want to do it for free than you doing it right you shouldn't I take you to it then okay man listen you sounded like a little kid this is craziness because I'm not being mad at you at all but putting on podcast we can put no one here's attacking you bro you you and I are friends we're like brothers okay always like a brother we're all here together we're trying to talk but you're like really triggers strung in one of the reasons is because you feel like they're attacking you fine choice and you're trying to defend this choice I am what I'm saying is the only reason why they even can attack you is cuz there is a point of view that they're expressing that maybe this a myself by Southwest where their version is this like well you should want to be here it's a really fun time and you're like yeah I do want to be there but it would also be nice if the money you're collecting for these shows and Austin would come to some of us and it shows I think there's good in having those shows there I think it's good for the comedy club I think it's good for the first the comedian's should be getting paid directly to the comedy club so you don't have to fly easily do that should that see honestly to to mean that have them take each of their jokes to me in the past honestly it was more like you know what this isn't how it should be but right now I'm too busy to fucking sit down renegotiate this thing that we started ok well that's honest that's very and I never did now I've never not paid anyone on a show meaning there was never a show right and pay anybody sometimes Brian when you get really mad at something that's because people are right and it doesn't mean that you're a bad person it means they might have a point and you know this is the reason why I'm pissed off at this originally pissed off of it because I first heard that one of the first things I did was Duncan did this and it did it on a live podcast he blunts and he blindsided me and Wow if he went to death squad TV there was a huge fucking link that I did out of they own kindness my heart you didn't ask me to buy his poster you had okay hold on you have this engineering an argument to bring up something else you've done nice for a person well well - then somehow I either so how dare you bring up this a argument when I wasn't even see for you know I might separate or three minutes but you see a very good point the only thing the reason I would say that is because in the past I've done a lot for this guy yeah and he and instead of just like talking to me and going hey why don't you do this or divert and I could have explained this whole thing I just did to you and you'd be like oh that kind of makes sense no no listen we're gonna end this part we're gonna come back and wrap this up because this is too ridiculous we'll have a little part one and a part two so let's stop this portion of it and we'll come back with a very informal five minutes you know we'll take a little break but we need
