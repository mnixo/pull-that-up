four three two one they were live so what am I not supposed to say huh Oh cunt oh yeah yeah it sorry that's the title the title to show that we've we've omitted from the print yes listings yes yeah the shows actually called don't say cunt with apologize this is the one place where you're not gonna hear the word cunt yeah it's a kind of a promise minutes there'll be 45 minutes because as we understand it Americans don't like the word cunt some Americans yeah it's getting number that's what yeah yeah well that day there was there's an a bunch of women that we're trying to take it back who was it was that the the guys we fucked girls I think it was they were trying to take it back they're trying to like you know take down a cunt yeah well I think I'm very dead inside my head what's the matter Dave Dave's having to die oh my I might have disconnected yeah this is fun for the you to me I'll hook it up you're okay yeah Mike there's a little bit of an issue I feel like I feel like there's a pressure differential well you only have one ear on - oh yeah both c'mon ya took it off because they couldn't hear anything check check check check three four five no thanks that's me a little no that's Paul apparently I think that's me that's me I can do something that somebody's in here gremlins in with the fucking side which was me and that's our show this one one I hear your game there we go there we go that's good so I always hear Dave so what why did you guys choose that as your podcast title we're Canadians and cunt is not not nearly as bad in Canada really this is a swear word yeah yeah it yeah it's I don't know what they need to put out some sort of a periodic table of the atomic weight of swear words you know hunt would be quite quite heavy but whatever you're in the American yeah but here in America can't actually just wood drop through the crust of the earth yeah it's too heavy just tumble right down to the core he'll go through the other side yeah so yeah I guess we just found that patently ridiculous well we like you know we we grew up I grew up hearing the word a lot from my my dad what is your dad like not like much anymore he's dead Thanks 1979 sorry dude 1979 okay but no as I always say he was mad there are no better parents than dead parents they can't fuck you up in yeah that's right but my dad that was a real really fond of that word in English there's no Canadian a full Canadian but being Canadian is kind of like being brush letters have English people on your money stuff yeah yes and we get all the English movies on English TV show we we pledge allegiance to the Queen in school you know still and in our sleep so many good things about Canada yet so many preposterous things yes true it's the fact well the fact that a monarchy still exists at all is preposterous yeah is great on paper yeah yeah well the monarchy even itself has become Kardash unified well yeah right like it but didn't they weren't they always I guess they were I mean like tell us in two days and yeah or even just back to Henry the eighth I'm sure what what maintained the the monarchy other than the fact that people wanted celebrities and those the only celebrities they had right and the priests and I think Henry the eighth also had a sim plants yes he did yeah yeah Wow yeah good for him progressive yeah it's ahead of his time yeah that that is an interesting thing it's like the Prince Charles lady Di's saga was essentially one of our first reality things to enjoy yeah yes that was madness yeah and it happened it was so huge and then someone said well what if we just make housewives in Orange County royalty hmm and and you don't have to pay them as much as the king and queen you can cancel them yeah those shows are wonderful there I've never seen an episode of any of their fascinating the Beverly Hills one is there was well there's different versions of them right and different versions yet to see the geographical creepiness of like Atlanta yeah yeah Atlanta's not a bad one the worst one was Jersey they're fucking savage people yeah that's my ancestors those fucking savage monkey photos yeah I'm the worst anything kind of version the worst of anything the worst the worst penicillin is the jersey penicillin you know CSI jersey was terrible by the way no that doesn't exist yeah the Beverly Hills one all of them were fascinating it was take take people force them in these situations were they gonna have his artificial disputes well it was crazy to me is watching people succumb to the pressure of all that attention when they've never experienced it before and then you're gonna just thrust them into this massively popular you know yeah for lack of a better word cunt fest yeah right well if you take a chance yeah and you divorce it of any supporting sort of supporting under you know talent structure yeah or does no offering there's no painting no sculpting they take yeah because Fame will destroy if you're a brilliant artist Fame will destroy you yes if there's nothing underneath the fame its there's nothing to hold it up well I remember watching kelsey Grammer's wife I'd met her before she seemed like a very nice lady Camille yeah Camille and then she forgot her name thank you I didn't want to just contacts owner he was a huge Camille thing I tattoo I was gonna say do you have a tattoo but she decided to play the heel and the prat it was so obvious that the pressure was just overwhelming the hatred that was coming her way you know she had decided she was gonna be the boss bitch on the show just let everybody know you know this is how it is and I'm I'm here to run things and yeah just a swamp of evil that came her way and she's like uh quit done fuck the show she bailed out of good for her yeah well this even joins that role or was it like a producer it said here's your angle well according to Kelsey he told her like hey okay this is what you've always wanted here like because that's like what led to their divorce or what was happening during yeah them getting divorced you know he essentially said you know this is what you've always wanted like I don't think you understand this so good luck with it and then you know she just kind of vanished afterwards like fuck all this which is wise on her part she she recognized what it is but they're like those those people that are on it like I know some people who know some folks that are on the show yeah and it's they just go crazy they start popping pills and losing their mind they're in therapy every day and just madness yeah the desire for fame with nothing more to it than other than a desire to be famous yeah can only drive you insane yeah I think fame fame as a as an emergent property of doing something right is bearable it's ironic but it's so strange and so difficult to truly manage yeah but you can at least say I don't define myself by the fame I divide myself by the work that you created the fame yes whereas if there's no work underneath it it's you know it you only exist in so much as people are aware of you you exist in those moments when you walk into a room and everyone's staring at you yeah that's what you look for and that's it I have that anyway because of my body so I guess you know real Fame yeah and your and the horrible allergy you have to pants that's true I can't wear pants and yeah every time I walk in the room well I always said like that the that fame is a property of the beholder not the beheld and that that Fame only exists along with somebody in the room knows who you are right at a minute you're in a room where no one knows you your fame evaporates that is one of the weirdest interrogations I've ever gotten is when people go why do these people know you yeah who are you who are you take a photo with you there's somebody but I don't know who the weird thing is they're almost offended that other people know you and they don't yeah like why are you're playing at game with me white why don't I know you angry yeah well they're all so there's the other thing about famous that people feel like they could just start talking to you yes yeah yes yeah just you can sit next year oh yeah you could be in the middle of an intense conversation with the your favorite person on the planet they have a farm now why do you they've been in their house I their living room I had a guy come to me in the street and just go hey Dave how you doing and I thought no one must know him says that oh I'm good how are you doing man and his next line was you don't even know me a fucking phony baby that was me that was you I wish I was better at faces was this in Canada this was in downtown LA real ins amazing I even know me a fucking phony I'm just trying to be nice yes was he a drunk no it was like he was a guy you just pretend I know him just watch this Wow was that the end of the conversation yeah that was basically it Wow yeah what a rude person that's a terrible conversation it's like the guy who auditioned for News Radio in 96 just never got no fucking I was on my way to stardom yeah and it'd be fair was me I tripped him up yeah yeah um you still doing that show with dr. ken no we stopped when they cancelled it oh that's always a good move yeah not right away it's several months in doing the show after it was killed yeah we didn't we called the doctors can't remember what was the name and we could still call dr. Raza real doctor right I don't think she as far gone as drew once you've been pushed in front of Congress yeah and they questioned you on your weight loss claims yeah yeah yeah yeah I had so sorry that your show that had a crazy title or something wasn't it doctor can that was it dr. ken yeah he just did a Netflix special he did he's being that back doing stand-up yeah he's one of the sweetest guys on the planet Earth he is a nice man very very nice guy and he's uh yeah I got a lovely family yeah and a super good guy um are you still doing the acting thing you enjoying it off and on you know enjoying yeah difficult concept will you always that's that was the take I had on it with you back in 94 it's a better job than most yes you know yes you know I like that I like you know it's you know it's like when you're doing something you like there's a certain satisfaction but even that even like when we were doing news radio you don't get to enjoy it because you're you're so focused on whatever the flaws are well you're making it right right right yeah you get to enjoy it during the wrap party yeah yeah or or 20 years later right yeah yeah I've occasionally someone will send me a clip online it just is so strange to watch it's so strange when you're watching yourself from 20 plus years ago say something you don't remember saying yeah and your watch like how do you remember that episode at all yeah yeah I don't remember most I don't I never watched I think I only watched about six episodes Wow Newsradio yeah and I loved the show but but you knew I didn't want to watch it happened yeah I watch all I'd be doing is nitpicking the editing right right right yeah it's it's a strange thing to look back when you go back you know 20-plus years and think of all the all the scenes all the writing all the work and now it's just sort of now well that's the other thing that we never anticipated that it would be floating around the internet yeah you know yeah YouTube clips news rate is floating way out in the periphery of the Internet yeah just like drawn in sometimes but shows like like like friends like if I can you know you have young kids mm-hmm like my daughter's 15 she's watched every episode of friends at least twice Wow that's 10 years of shows and it's not just er it's every 15 you're my kid too in the country yeah has one and it's like that that you know is coming back into significant to these kids man well what's fascinating is I don't think those shows are being made anymore no not like no I mean there's the Chuck Lorre type shows that I watch and I go I'm missing the G my eyes everyone laughing Sarah do you ever seen those without the laugh track I can imagine days be life taking some of those shows in the Big Bang Theory they've removed the laugh track and you watch it with just the actor saying the words and it's like is anything funny ever happened well it's just it's strange it's like you're watching Minh take any sense yes it's illogical yeah and that that that that place people get in their heads where they just go it'll be fine yeah yeah like I mean Newsradio if we did a scene and it didn't get a laugh we rewrote the whole scene yeah literally like in with the audience there well I think the term good enough is perfect for comedy yeah that's good enough people are kind of chuckling well it's the thing you once you get a certain number of characters that you can get to interact with each other and predictable ways on those shows then they just sort of have them have these little scenes and have different inflections and different stumbles and and they make a show out of it and for the other thing he just becomes comfort yes their familiarity I maintain that's what drove Charlie Sheen crazy mmm was doing that goddamn show for a long time for a long time I think that's what drove him to the edge I thought I think he was always crazy yeah but I think when you do a show that you don't enjoy doing or that you don't look the guy was in fucking platoon yeah right yeah I mean he was in some an amazing ferry he wasn't very funny in that no yeah they should've taken that as a warned yeah they should take that comedy label off that that should stop ending up in all those companies Wall Street I mean he was in some giant good way he movies and then he's on this show that doesn't really make sense yeah and he's really talented yeah like he's a really really talented actor yeah you know and really funny as a narrator a great at missing timing what was the like the zuker Brothers franchise hotshots yes those they don't make those kind of movies anymore like nobody playing jokes an hour I don't know well can't do jokes effort is frowned upon right I think you have to know be lazy well comedy movies are you know there's still comedy movies right there's like the judd apatow type films and you know there's still they still make comedy movies yeah but there's it seems like there's not as many anymore yeah or maybe I just don't go out as much there's a little bit of that too yeah but it's also like the subject matter so dangerous now like everything that used to be funny we I watched Ace Ventura pet detective with my kids and I did not remember how transphobic that movie is like the whole movie is one gigantic trans at the end of it I'm like whoa I forgot this is crazy like the men when they find out she's a girl they're throwing up and or whether that she's a boy rather there's teeth finished yeah be done and they stole that whole joke from The Crying Game Oh which is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen which one came first I don't know any magic if the trying Crying Game did a serious version of Ace Ventura I have an idea crying hole a stalking scene would be totally different mm yeah I thought I remember watching The Crying Game going and like heard there's this big twist big surprise to it oh that's a guy oh I bet what happens is that the the transvestite turns out to be an IRA spy [Laughter] you know I forgot that movie yeah yeah so what how long you guys been doing this podcast this house just before Christmas yes I guess not not that long yeah yeah probably know each other we've known each other a lot three years what motivated it our wives they say get the fuck out of here do something new somewhere else and and they're actually in on the podcast with us like Chrissy my wife produces it and you know puts it all together super hard to fire it is well we're the ones we'll get fired oh yeah well she fired me once so ten years right everything yeah I'm Chrissy and I we separated for ten years well you well uh it will actually last time I saw you was well during that separation yeah but so you got back together we got back together that's nice yeah Chrissy's great I remember running into her at a Satan thing that the Satanic Hogan thing right yeah Duncan Trussell my good friend was performing at is it Stanton lavas grandson or something and Tomlinson yeah grandson and they were getting married at this fucking crazy theater and your wife was dressed as like a devil or some shit Yasim said oh god she was like dancing there and I'm like oh hi how are you what are you doing here normal person why are you here yeah but uh there's a picture of me with Anton LaVey that knuckleheads to this day uses evidence that I am a station Satan worship Robin yeah that's you're merely an associate yeah or are you were a Satanist so she I'm Satan to Jason yeah I think that's what they say no yeah you know and that's that's that's me and they I think that's Hank Williams the third shirt that I'm wearing there that's the thing people the fact that people still worry about Satan is just I mean you wanted to say calm down he's not a problem cuz he doesn't exist just like your God oh hey but are you they people listening right now they just took their earphones off and threw them across the room yeah well I could hear cunt for 30 times you want just yeah you know whether or not God exists is a fascinating point of discussion but what's interesting is is this agreement that people say when they decide that God exists and you decide that God exists and I decide to God exists so we both have agreed that there's this weird thing that makes no sense that we're on board with so I know where you stand on a lot of issues you know I probably know where you stand on abortion I probably know where you stand on guns I probably know where you stand on climb change like it's so weird little thing that you do when you say that you know when you say well you know I'm a god-fearing Christian oh yeah okay now I can predict you better it's like you're all wearing the same decoder ring yes yes yeah well that is what a lot of it is a lot of it is people with whether or not you believe in God or not it's the saying that God's real and the worshipping God and the talking about God is just letting everybody know that they can predict you yeah they know where you can't like if you're a gentleman if you're a gentleman you wearing a tie with a nice suit on and pair of pants I can fairly likely predict that you're going to be reasonably behaved yeah you're a gentleman yeah I know if you're a Christian if you're a person who calls themselves a Christian and you know well we go to the bio go to church every Sunday and I'd like to read the Bible and I am a Christian yeah and people automatically go okay I kind of know where you came from I couldn't I can see where you are and now I like that you can predict me because you'll like me better so we don't have to talk yes no reinforce those those patterns in your head yeah I'll say some things that I've repeated things that I've heard other people say about God and Jesus and mm-hmm yeah and it's a nice way to kill time it's not a bad way you know believing in God and going to church it's a great you kill time and you know until death nullifies all meaning well I think the community thing of it is a good thing yeah there's there's some there's some really powerful like bonding experiences that people have when they've agreed to be humble together yeah you're describing curling juice you can see words in Canada yeah a very popular hunting curling yeah that's right and there's no way he's curling is one of the top TV you cannot rise to the tops of curling without humbling yourself once you humble yourself the minute you say I'm not go curl it right when you pick up that brush a big smile on your face yeah decide to sweep I yeah I'm tried curling man it's not easy no it's hard which still doesn't make it a sport I've made fun of in Newfoundland and they fucking got so mad at me oh yeah don't make fun of curling you read a theater where I was at like had these pictures of curlers on the wall I just could not shitting on them yet hey hey legitimately upset on Mike is a preposterous endeavor yeah you know it and I know it you're sliding a rock on the ice yeah used to be a reason to drink that's what curling was where everybody still is wasted and you don't fall very far on the ice because we're already squatting Yeah right yeah and the other people are leaning against brooms that's right you got a broom to lean against that's great you're getting it's also like when you fall in ice it's almost always funny always yeah never yeah no one's know everybody catches himself no you know like gently fall really trying to get up is good to know this you don't fall elegantly on that right now go hiking and slip a little and catch yourself yet but even like when you're watching the NHL and you'll see players that will just fall down yeah just for no reason it's hilarious these are the best Gators in the world and there's ass he's a professional athlete yeah yeah if I ran bullshit with at Volkswagen I couldn't knock him over Yeah right but he just fell how long has curling been around hundred oh it's a Scottish or it's a Scottish sport where they used to use actual rocks they'd find in fields ya know and play it on frozen lakes because that's the only kind they have in Scotland yeah hmm our frozen ones and Montana round there's a lot of he's a wonderful curler David are you Scottish I believe I'm from yeah yes I got the wife is also part Scottish I mean there's a lot of Scottish people in Canada so you can see what curling would be popular you know yeah very very Scottish country Canada it's strange that's why there's so many gourds and and Craig's or I take that Watson Gordon yeah that's right there's Scottish word alright yeah Gordon Gordon yeah and of course because of Gordie Howe every would name their kids Gord I went to suppose a guy named Greg likes teas I mean that was his first name Greg or Greg go I know a guy named Gregor Gregor Gillespie fights in the UFC okay there's an animal I haven't kind of Gregor problems yeah it's a savage I just give one interesting UFC memory for me please I watched the very first UFC one with I had a troop at the time and we invited Scout troop it wasn't it was a comedy troupe that always we dress the Boy Scouts but we invited Neil Patrick Harris over it was 20 years old at the time we was in town we just met him and he came over and soon as the sumo wrestler got his face kicked in and there's spit a tooth out I believe he was like I'm out of here I gotta get out and we made him stay and watch though and that's what made him gay thank you ruining the story I don't know if that's true I don't know if nothing happened yeah maybe someone dropped him on his head yeah I don't think he knows he looked like he was already as a kid something them wrong or right mm-hm depending on if you're his boyfriend yeah imagine depends if he's a good boyfriend yeah yeah well yes but I mean if the braz many i was doing the husband yeah the guys really into him thank God you watch that fight that time yeah thank God in other words can I never found a chick yep looking at me and shit oh God hmm yeah so do you have to get remarried or did you just bleed on me never well we never got we Chrissy and I never got around to getting divorced caught at paperwork beautiful yeah so we were yeah we're yeah we separated we actually filed for divorce once but screwed up the paperwork for somehow mmm yeah and then yes and then and then we just never got around to it again just didn't fix it and now Ellen yeah I'm not you know I'm not I'm not good with organizing so we just so we were just separated for you know it's funny cuz he's very organized she is yeah it seems like maybe maybe Jackie JB she's the one who wasn't willing to let go you know she was telling you something yeah she's there like something Dave early yeah and that's what that's what yeah that's what like always I go on vacation with them when they were DeBoer like divorced they would go was it together and we did all our families reps didn't they did all family tour the whole day we weren't together well the first two years we weren't that we didn't do much no those are no yeah the dark years yeah the dark is yes but then yeah that was yeah that's why we have kept taking all of our family trips together we go to Hawaii it's like they were still me all of us yeah and so when we finally did get back together it was really just so mostly about the convenience of our friends it was just like you know this is gonna make everyone else's life easier really yeah cuz they don't you know what we didn't have to go to two houses yeah yeah which I hate it it's so Canadian of you yeah so polite that's what you're Canadian does yeah he's doesn't get divorced because the for how long have you been married now ten years and you in you that's the only time you've ever been married thank the baby Jesus oh my god yes yeah done that it's working yeah it's it's great yeah yeah if it works it's great yeah I always tell people don't do it it's too risky yeah you could 50% of people don't make it yeah it's it's a it's not a good good rate no success would you drive a car if you knew that 50% likely you would die in a crash right yeah I mean it was an institution made sense when your own gonna live to be 40 well it makes sense there's some parts of it that make sense the problem is that it's become a business and it's become a business for people to try to squeeze his like I'll never forget trying to talk Phil and getting divorced yeah I go just give her half and he goes it's not half it's 2/3 it's a scam the fucking lawyers get a third yeah give away 2/3 I mean he was fucking freaking out about it yeah and it's true and he could have lived nicely authored he should have given her that yeah I don't think that I mean the word was that that's why she killed him that he was leaving that that was he was finally leaving yeah and then that's when she killed him but when we were together with him there was always days where he would come to the set and just be just in hell oh yeah well what yeah and he wouldn't well it'd be this he'd just be on the floor of the studio and like ranting yeah about about you know I'm living in my boat and yeah he lives in his boat yeah it was rough about me yeah and then he would come back like a day later and it'd be I'm back together with my blushing bride that's exact quote yeah and this exact quote and we'd all just be gone you know it was poor bastard and alone uh no it the we're theme news right there was not one good marriage on the show you know like everyone was going through a terrible marriage at the time like I was proud that I was one person who wasn't I depressants therapy but I probably needed it I think we all did yeah but yeah I mean I'm everybody started with like he was the second season we came back and Steve root had gotten divorced you know and he was the first one hit that I mean I think everyone for you to be me or Phil yeah I would get divorced first Eva and then Maura right but Steve yeah we didn't know how bad it was for Steve I guess it's hard up there it's hard it's hard to make it mmm hard hard for people stay together be nice to each other yeah yeah isn't yeah it takes does they say it takes work but it actually takes work yeah it does take work one way to show you were an adult too yes good move yeah yeah most people get married before they're adults yeah I think you should wait until you know who the fuck you are and still I'm still guessing yeah even to this day I'm guessing Who I am literally my dad almost on his deathbed told me don't do it you can't get married until you're 30 yeah that's a good move and he I didn't oh yeah got married at 30 but he was like don't do it you don't do it before 30 cuz you don't know who you are you don't know what you're what's going on well I've seen too many predatory marriages I've seen women marry men that don't really like because they know the man has money and I've seen I've seen the opposite it's just such a weird thing when you enter into contractual agreement about romance like it's it's it's not just I I love you you love me let's let's have a celebration of our love and let's invite our friends over and tell everybody we've we've decided to engage each other in this very special commitment but then you start bringing in lawyers yeah right and then it gets weird and then you know you have weird state by state laws where there's common-law marriages if you live with someone for 10 years and yeah might have been where humanity went wrong was when the first guys said I'm gonna be a lawyer like that was his decision I'm looking around and I think yeah there's a lot of ugliness in the world yeah what was the reason they had to work on it was the first lawyer what most there's a series of laws right the first lawyers had to have been priests right I would guess oh yeah yeah I mean the laws Affairs initially we're basically lawyers right now what is the Pharisee like the Jewish the Jewish priests okay makes sense that does make a lot of sense ya know a lot of my relatives yeah yeah like when did it become a thing where it was you would go to law school and it was a respectable occupation mm-hmm and it would be good to know a good lawyer yeah I think those things started out as not respectable and people did them because they didn't have any other you know like choice yeah and again they realized though they're making all the money you know and then it became respectable yeah well once they figured out there's all these legalese and loopholes in the system there's ways to extract money yeah he's gonna be weasely about it and like that and then they invent a whole language to exclude anyone else from understanding it yeah do you think they'd build hourly back then still yeah but then again time hadn't been codified so so what did they build by an hour it was basically decided by community standards you know when was Tom confide when the railroads came in that's when time zones were created time zones were created by the railroads everybody every town every town set its own time like well like you could have you could drive you know you could drive from you know like from Denver to Fort Collins and the two cities would be in completely different times Wow and how you sync up your watch with the town clock yeah you have that yeah clock in the main square and that would be the time that's the time but when they started having to schedule railroads they realized well huh all these towns and then they started having huge competitions to invent ways of synchronizing clocks between cities so that did they use a sundial to get the initial reading I think it really was just as simple as we'll call this midnight or we'll call this noon you know and then he just went from there and none of the clocks were that accurate so time would shift over time so it became that was like in like the 19th century was a huge move to try and find a way to synchronize clocks and that drove kind of drove a lot of the beginnings of technology do you remember when you were a kid you would call phone number to get the time always yes for sure the exact time the weather as well yeah but the time the time is exactly yeah 59 in 35 seconds well and in Canada at one o'clock every day they had the National time tone right yeah at the Secession of the long beep will be exactly one play radio on TV why 1:00 p.m. I don't know why yeah but that's when they would do it at 1:00 p.m. every day the CBC would would broadcast a tone mmm and that was the time for the whole country wow I never would have guessed that time zones are created by the railroads yeah but it totally makes sense schedule without yeah cuz before that nobody went anywhere you know Arizona still doesn't do daylight savings time they're like fuck you yeah that's stupid they're allowed to do that yep yep yep Wow if you drive from like if you drive from Nevada to Arizona you're you're you miss an hour yeah they're at the only state isn't there another state that doesn't wonder oh there's no one I'm aware of they're an island they stole Hawaii yeah that's right then that island is theirs yeah that's a that's a fucking country that we occupy with hotels you feelin out there yes its own viewing the rest of it was given to us by God yeah that's true it's manifest destiny correct yes the rest of it but not Hawaii no cuz that came less late there's no single cut like there's no state where the people are so clearly like their ethnicity is so clearly defined the Polynesian lookin yeah North Dakota or fucking Florida some shit it's it's like they're not from the European no no heritage no there's you know there's an interesting debate going on about what is Nate California moves towards permanent daylight savings time we every day we get to get up an hour early yes earlier earlier majority of Arizona's on permanent Standard Time and the year-round daylight savings times followed by Hawaii and the territories of the American Samoa Oh glom and minor outlying islands whoof well I say California let's be really bold and go for permanent daylight yeah just give up on night well and then just everybody wants to kill themselves when it's nighttime there there's an interesting debate going on in Hawaii right now as to what is an invasive species because so much of the wildlife in in Hawaii was brought over yes and so there's there's some debate on certain islands where they want to eliminate the wild pigs because they say they're an invasive species and then the people are saying but we'll hold on because we kind of came after a lot of these wild pigs yeah like a lot of the wild pigs were dropped off by pirates like pirates and and people that were in a boding like that we're traveling by boat across the world they would drop off goats and pigs on various islands so they would have something to hunt when they would come back for food because they knew that this would be a stop along their route mm-hmm which is clever it is clever it ruined a lot of islands especially the goats yes destroyed a lot of islands I just and now there's in Hawai there's a lot of mongoose oh really yeah they brought a mongoose in at some point I forget what it was it was to control the rabbit population that was brought other rats things to control that that came in from again from shipping and then the Mongoose Pro started another was just all over the place yeah Mongoose Laska Holiday and I made a joke about you know I'm looking for beavers cuz I didn't think there were beavers in Alaska cuz it's too cold they said no last 10 years we've got tons of beavers here because of global warming Realtors everywhere yeah they're moving well yeah beavers are migrating north yep Alaska's a fascinating place that you can go to the summer you go there in the summer you have never seen more aggressive mosquitoes it's like they know they only have two months to live yeah so you get out of your car they swarm you like a cloud it's crazy I've never seen anything like it in my life you would think tropical weather that's where the mosquitoes ya know Alaska yeah they're fuckin ferocious and they're huge yeah yeah I'm actually gonna go there now November I think oh yeah no what are you doing doing the touring with the who's live anyway like an improv tour so who's live anyway like a take off whose line is it anyway yes yes like Greg Proops and Jeff tomorrow and yes so Greg and Jeff and Joel Murray okay cool and me I guess Joel marries Bill Murray's brother yeah yeah yeah so I was like a rotating so those three guys to the core and then there's a Ryan Stiles myself Drew Carey and and chip esten sort of rotate through oh no it likes it the tour drew Carey might be the nicest person that's ever lived I don't know him well he might be the nicest guy ever yes did he yeah member it was the Drew Carey Show that finally got news radio cancelled November we did a whole year after I think that was what it was I don't think they wanted to do it anymore after that yeah I think a ratings tanked when we when they put us up against true care our ratings are always shit that's the most amazing thing is that the ratings were really great once we got cancelled and then it was on TV like like they would show the reruns and people go this is a funny show yeah they found it it's true I remember Lou Morton one of our writers showing up at the he'd show up at the Reed with a different number on his shirt every week when we were in the real shit er when we're falling apart oh yeah number 98 out of 100 Nate was one day no bullshit wherever I go is that real he's like yeah I'd like to have this shirt and made yeah yeah no you draw it basically basically a sweatshirt with the marker on it that's hilarious he would just show up with this fucking number on a shirt and I was like hey he's like a source of pride when you can you know still be hanging on the one year that I thought we weren't gonna get canceled was the year we got canceled I was like well we're doing pretty good yeah well I shower ratings were yeah the five years show right yes but but much like the whole like we never really hit a hundred episodes we got to like 97 1997 because NBC didn't own it so they did that with a bunch of shows they didn't own they do that on purpose that year in about four or five shows they canceled it 97 episodes really yeah because they cuz there's it's a hundred it goes into syndication is that right it used to be the rule yeah yeah but now syndication and it doesn't really exist anymore well the weirdest one was the Charlie Sheen model that they did with that anger management show where they devised a whole new system 90/10 yeah if the first couple episodes do well fuck it we order a hundred yes and they produce them all in the year yes they just so mash them together they just they wrote it within five minutes and started filming like filming and writing on the fly everything was dog shit Charlie makes a and they shot like four episodes a week the day Charlie in crass and see this yeah yeah thousands of dollars with a crack into his account yeah they had one of those old-timey ice guys that used to deliver ice deliver the crack door yeah because here's the thing they have them solved you can't get crack out of an ATM machine yet no not anymore you can get pot out of one now yeah yeah pot out of a dispensary mchale good yeah why don't know where well see you find out where they are but there's there's they do have marijuana dispensary machines yeah yeah you must have to like show some sort of a ID provide a yeah yeah proof of age but I guess if you just have your if you have a sponsor yeah a passport or driver's license like if you could read Passport they have a machine that reads a passport at the airport that you know when you go through if you have like Global Entry they got that face recognition fantail I know that clear yeah I got that fingerprint one that's nice too yeah Global Entry is the best oak you don't have to fuck with that giant lawn yeah just got that I got this stupid tea God Global Entry is great because it comes with TSA pre yeah I got the TSA angrier that makes me mad yeah the the ultimate combo is TSA pre and clear yeah because you they just do the fingerprints boom and then they push it right into the line sounds like venereal disease and nice people walk you they walk always been clear yeah clear not to pit TSA pre but clear the nice people walk you all the way over to the pony or block yeah yeah you can't the person you have the option of actually pissing on the peoples of your passing their feet because they don't have any shoes oh my god I have to get this yeah sounds fantastic yeah go out of the cup then you have to travel some don't know not much I mean to Canada but that doesn't really matter at some entry yeah yeah it's still in this country yeah well you could always go through to the woods to get to Canada it's true people would talk border the border is 100 100-yard clear-cut is most of the border with Canada's just a hundred-yard clear-cut in the forest so it's it's actually cut yeah it's cutting trees down it's like a hundred yards wide mm-hmm and that's the border all across it's not redundant though not only is it it's it's actually easier to cross the border than the surrounding area yeah because the surrounding areas of forest ya know do they they actually maintain that cut yeah really so every year someone's job is to cut down the trees for a hundred yards space between the United States and Canada yeah why most of the Canadian border just to let you know if you're a criminal and you cross here additional charges will apply yeah now you've fled the country well have you ever seen them you've seen the footage of refugees coming into Canada and the Mounties meeting them and they're like the Mounties are just there going now you understand that when you cross over here we will be arresting you there's Luther that's the line wow that's crazy the 49th parallel says yeah wow that's fucking crazy I bet that's a you need two passports to watch out there there America there's where your terror should last the opposite of a wall yeah that's an actual coming past actually yeah that shows how much we like Canada yeah or how little you think about it easier to cross yeah well make it really easy it's easier that 100-yard stretch is like ah don't trip eh yeah relax yourself you're about to hit paradise and most most of the visa overstays are Canadian which is the the bulk of a local generation America is Canadians overstaying their visas yeah it's a giant part of it right I mean we all overstay our welcome British folks - definitely yeah you know but no one cares but the thing is don't think about Canada there's a lot of people in this country from a lot of other countries that just keep their fucking mouth shut yeah no one knows like one that whenever they say that they know like they take an estimate on how many illegal aliens might that's art yes oh yes guest yeah well its got like was just thinking you actually had was uh Brian Cox on yes and he said we they talk about the the the size of the universe yes most of it's just to guess based on the the observable universe based on the number of galaxies they can see they're just guessing how many galaxies there are I think that's the same for the legal immigration you're just going to be more likely to be accurate with illegal immigration than you are with stars mm-hmm yeah I think the star thing the problem is now I'll butcher this but I think it's that literally we don't have the capability to look past thirteen point whatever billion years yes can't really look yeah so if they look and they go no there's just like a big space and then yeah you go 18 more billion years back there's a thriving community of galaxies galaxies in time but then the just the sheer vastness of the sky they've only actually like like looked at a fraction of it right well talking to a guy like him is so amazing because you you realize like okay well there's different kinds of humans yeah there's there's humans that are actually studying these insanely complicated equations that are trying to prove that the very nature of reality itself yeah and then there's chimps like me who are just listening going oh yeah okay so real real big how do we know it started there was a bang okay what started the bang mr. smartypants but Brian Cox he's innovative in that he is an astrophysicist and he looks like a young David Cassidy and he's a musician does he's dreamy yeah he's a great guy I had a crush on two comics yeah super sweetheart of a guy like not just never met a buddy I loved watching him on TV I did his podcast once the live version of it which is interesting it's great and it apparently has a new show that's coming here that I'll go with his work show come with ya left it's um he has a gigantic screen behind him filled with interlocking LED screens that apparently it's like this unbelievably gorgeous high-definition version of the cosmos Wow so and it's created by the same people who did that movie with which one interstellar interstellar no no it's created by and it's like that accurate like the the CGI is actually accurate according to you know like his type of equations yeah he worked at CERN you know he's like he's amazing he's amazing yeah and he's legit beautiful man yeah oh yeah no he was a legit rockstar yeah I mean genius rockstar yeah good luck guys fuck your wife you got a real problem I think it was in squiddy politi yeah I think someone should drink that why are astrophysicists getting cuter I mean no yeah I mean you start with Stephen Hawking then you get - what's his name Green right no no no Neil deGrasse Tyson sure yeah good laughs yeah used you didn't have to be pretty in the old days no position of science communicator is so effective was so important because most that stuff is so dry and so difficult to wrap your head around I don't need someone yeah someone across a evening yes someone engaging they can deliver this like with with Brian he's so nice mm-hmm like that as he's like so smiley and he enjoys it so much he loves talking about it so much that it becomes infectious because there's a lot of that stuff that's very difficult to follow when you try to read the papers yeah yeah I've read the Stephen Hawking books and I would zone out yeah so much while I was trying to comprehend what was going on I had Lawrence Krauss on and I was trying to get him to explain some certain formulas and just even when he's explaining them to you it doesn't yeah to click like you really have to it's one of those things you it's like someone trying to explain French words to you by only speaking to you in French yeah don't speak French you're like yeah well you're fucked yeah like that's the as soon as you say infinity you guys we go thank that's only a mathematical idea yeah I mean how can anything be infinite I mean I know well there doesn't make any math you can say it like that you can say that a straight line goes on forever and two parallel lines will never intersect pi is there theoretically wouldn't it you know it never ends well why is that difficult to grasp though that's the real question like why is why do we need everything to be defined by a very obvious beginning and an end mm-hmm because it's everything we experience has a beginning and it's biologically because we experience time yeah time doesn't is not experience them yeah the same way well time is experienced at all if you're not sentient true Zona your whack it off it's different yeah but yeah it's the I always wondered if like there was a reason why we wanted things to have a beginning and an end like is it because we have our life and our life has a beginning and then all the lives of the people we know yeah we definitely do we blur obsessed with it we want 7 beginning ernet or are we terrified of beginnings and ends threat to did you know a lot of it is terrify we create you know gods and religions is because the idea that that life ends and then it's all been for nothing just terrifying to people there's a little bit of that yeah there's a little bit of like doing it to create order in the community and there's a little bit of people find mushrooms and they need an explanation fuck their feelings rains are constructed in such a way that we need an end yeah yeah or else.you yeah don't understand where am I now I have there's no end my very uninformed theory which is that first off that everything is meaningless but that only the brain-damaged are capable of can conceiving of meaninglessness because our brains are meaning machines mm-hmm and that we evolved and he gave us an evolutionary advantage that we give meaning to things like I said this is a table because we say it's a table right it's not a table to a cat that's why a cat will just get up and walk around on it look it's a song yeah that's because it's from a mutual agreement yeah we agree this is a table right and that kind of meaning let us organize our lives let us be better hunters you know what you know it constantly occurs to me and bothers me is that we decide not to drive into each other because we've painted a little line on a road in the middle yeah we've all agreed not to cross that line as I say we ascribe meaning to objects and that gave us an advantage over other animals and so our brains just evolved and then when we got to the point we realized we're gonna die oh we go well there's got to be some meaning there too so then we had to create myths that where do we get created meaning about our lives that's a very dangerous loop of there's no meaning to everything and nothing has no mean nothing has meaning that that's a dangerous loop for a person psychologically because you can get stuck in that and you can really but I don't think you can because it's impossible to conceive of unless you are seriously brain damaged well no I don't think it's impossible to conceive it's it's you won't you can imagine can intellectually think about it but you can't you can't grasp it isn't living in the now kind of the same as life has no meaning no you're not thinking about the future you know you know you're not thinking about the fact that has no meaning usually now with very joy the meaning you're enjoying life you're enjoying experience you're enjoying each interaction with people enjoying your thoughts I think that the the problem that people have is like what's the point that's the problem that what's that what's the point right and that's a weird loop and that's the things it doesn't really matter cuz you're gonna create a point anyway mmm like I mean it's like there was an existential psychology they had there's like five different ways people ascribe meaning made a physical meaning reproductive meaning biological meaning or creative meaning legal the works you do right that somehow you live on in all these different ways mmm you're like a lot of atheists are tend to be artists who believe that they live on through their work and which is totally as stupid as believing in God it is it's definitely silly I mean obviously someone's going to enjoy your work but I think the real meaning is in creating the work and then the fact that people are gonna enjoy it if you're doing it because you want it to live on forever you're a moron yeah good luck with that because there's no there's no forever of the whole planet but I just think meaning is an inescapable product of the human mind you know the example in example is like like they did a study where they went all like into the jungles of the Amazon to people who have never had any contact with the modern world and they drew a circle with two dots and a curved line and everyone sees a face hmm everyone sees a face the only people who don't see a face are people who have been brain damaged and can no longer form the meaning of those lines Oh interesting so you there are people who suffer brain doesn't that correspond to their own artwork because like that their artwork is very similar to our artwork and the fact that stick figures and they represent humans yes circle yeah all that stuff but they probably haven't had the happy face t-shirt I had lunch with Erich von däniken last week oh my god yes very interesting very weird yeah he's the guy who wrote Chariots of the Gods oh god yeah yeah in his 80s Napal book at our house and he was showing us slides what's the real story they're mostly nonsense unfortunately yeah yeah mostly mostly what it is is evidence of lost civilizations ancient civilizations that were incredibly advanced I follow the work of Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson and a few other people that are being proven actually correct more and more almost on a daily basis by new discoveries that show that that civilization predates what we initially thought yeah yeah the initial thought was that somewhere around the great pyramids which is like 2500 BC that was about as good as anybody gotten you go back to like ancient Sumer which is about 6,000 years ago and that's basically it what they're saying is that no there was most likely a reset a global reset of civilization due to a cataclysmic disaster and there's a shit ton of evidence there's massive evidence in the form of this nuclear class that exists when there's asteroid impacts and also there's a guy named dr. Robert Schoch is on the first guys to propose this it's actually when he freaked me on the podcast he said there was a mass coronal ejection that most likely caused lightning storms like a rainstorm but lightning like that much like narrowing the ground and that the only people that survived were people that could get under cover that could get into attorneys yeah and the mass extinction of yeah 60 Plus percent of the large mammals in a very short window of time almost instantaneously in North America the the the end of the Ice Age like ten thousand plus years ago there was a mile-high ice in most of North America right most of North America covered in ice and then gone and all these all these areas all these points of interest point to this one one moment in time that's somewhere between ten and twelve thousand years ago that some big event happened and that most likely just crippled civilization and then people had to rebuild whatever people were around that because also that they found like just looking at DNA that all of humanity at one point got wiped out except for like one village hmm that there was only that everyone is of everyone has descended from the same group of about 5000 people well there was a super volcano that erupted somewhere around 70 thousand years ago they think this is predating this cataclysmic disaster 12,000 years ago that they are pretty sure wiped human beings down to a few thousand folks no yeah always that word like I want to say it's where's that that supervolcano there's a supervolcano that knocked everybody down we'll find it yeah Yellowstone's gonna get us all every six to eight hundred thousand years it blows think we're due right that's why I don't go camping well that might not be the worst place to go don't go camping be over it that way yeah that way when it ends it ends quick you don't want to be living in New York not just choking that cloud it does yeah that's the worst watching people eat homeless folks in the street yeah know that now a place yeah well there's also like things that fly through space and zip by you know and they're just missing finding these things yeah that's thing well its things the erich von daniken thing I remember as a kid going my promise that they kept showing all these massive paintings that can only be seen from the sky so therefore there must have been drawn for your aliens that I couldn't know if you believe God is looking down on you you're gonna draw big paintings for God to look at right so you don't need that but now right but now I'm more the thing I've become obsessed with lately is there's a skepticism about UFOs yeah that's why I wanted to talk to you about this because you told me that you've become obsessed with UFOs yeah oh yeah completely and it's a Leever yeah totally really yeah totally believe the UFO phenomenon is real I don't know what it is but it's totally it has to be real something's happened why is that because there's just way too much evidence that it is real what evidence well radar evidence that the the f-16 locked on a UFO that footage and also just uh like I know the friend of ours I don't know if she want us to say but her father was an air traffic controller mm-hmm and he told her they said yeah every air traffic controller has seen something you know and I had another friend whose father was in a commercial pilot and she said yeah my dad said every single pilot has seen something and they've all been told not to say anything about it we have a couple of friends that say they were abducted yeah yeah the abducted one is a little easier to wrap your head around because when you're sleeping your brain is producing all sorts of endogenous psychedelic chemicals yeah almost all of these experiences happen when you're sleeping almost all these experience when these people are abducted they're taken from their beds which is when they're dreaming yeah I mean it's just like there's some real clear easy steps to follow for no fault Occam's razor and not you not get crazy but it knocks those out but it doesn't knock out like Barney and Betty hill and all the people that are affected will fully conscious and that and that remember it without hypnotherapy like I'm not sure about the abduction phenomenon but all right I don't know Barney and Betty hill I know the story you know I don't know them yeah so I would have to know them because yeah there's a lot of people that I've told like I did a show for sci-fi called Joe Rogan questions everything yeah I watch that show that cured me that show cured me of a lot of my nonsense with with conspiracies well we used to talk about yes yeah that's tough all the time yeah yeah but I I needed to actually study it so for six months that's basically all I did I interviewed people and I like Bigfoot believers UFO believers all and the one thing that they have in common is they all seem to be kind of lost and dependent upon this thing being real yeah great instead of being objective there's only one lady that I interviewed that saw Bigfoot that really seemed to be telling the truth but I think she saw a bear yeah bears walk on two feet all the time they do it all the time as video footage you can find it all the time and she was in the Pacific Northwest which is incredibly dense woods you see something you glimpse it look I was hunting once in in in Canada and Alberta and I thought I saw a wolf for like two seconds it was a squirrel okay understand this no no I just saw fur right I saw her and I was cause it's really because I was looking for fucking wolves cuz I was like cuz I know we did see one wolf it cross the roads either wolf or coyote was hard to tell because it was at dusk it was very dark out but when you're looking for something you think everything is that thing you're looking yeah so like a thought that fucking squirrel was a wolf that's funny yeah well expectation and perception are very linked yes yeah well that they found that that 50% of everything you see is a product of memory yes that that when you observe something they've done FMF MRIs and that most of the activity in the brain is in the memory centers not in the visual centers interesting only about 50% of the activities in the visual center so you know crazy yeah thing is very I when I was a kid I went and saw Carl Sagan speak mm-hm U of T at the University of Toronto and I was like you know 14 but he did an equation on the board of the possibility of alien life other than us in the universe and it came to the smallest I mean he spent the whole time writing on this chalkboard mm-hm it was fascinating hmm he actually came up with a number at the end and it was such a small he says there is there is something out there but they are so far away that yeah they'll that unless they can go faster than the speed of light which he said was impossible at the time yeah the 70s yeah there's no way we've seen them that's what he said so if some other beings have conquered the speed of light thing then maybe we could see them yeah but that's a thing with who's that problem with this skepticism in general is like that it you know like like the skeptic skeptics of the 19th century the ones who say germs don't exist right because we can't see them and and people who said germs did exist were ridiculed and laughed out of the trade mm-hmm right and I agree with you completely just because you can't see it or it's not happening doesn't mean it can't happen and even since Sagan's day there had been no exoplanets discovered then right we now though there are literally trillions and trillions of it sure planned earth-like planets yeah well they did they just speculated us to the existence of them outside of our solar system before the the real problem is that if some there's a leap and a leap a technological leap that opens the doors to massive innovation yeah that once this happens once this happens in this and then all this stuff sort of exponentially expands in terms of technological possibilities all you would need is a few hundred years and you have an unrecognizable set of technology yeah sure you know I mean we were talking about CERN I mean you know antimatter an idea that they're still trying to figure out yeah that's an unseen source of energy general you have never even experienced yeah you know with them with a grain of sand yeah city and it's that big yeah and there's also the theory there's recent one that space-time itself doesn't exist so the the speed of light barrier becomes moot because that is I guess it's the holographic quantum hologram their quantum holographic theory of the universe yeah Albert's book I can't remember holographic universe but it's yeah I think so and but the idea that the universe is basically just a tree that that when you look at it from a certain angle seems three-dimensional right and it folds on folds into itself so you could and it's Ravel that's the wormhole thing well that's it's not even that is the idea that that that space-time is an illusion is and that that it doesn't really exist and that's why you know like entanglement is possible you know the idea that you know spooky action at a distance yes that yeah yeah but the reason that you know you know these you know atoms on opposite ends of the universe can be affect each other instantaneously at the same moment is because they're not really at an opposite into the universe they're really right next to each other it just seems like they're at opposite ends in the universe because our ability to perceive is basically based on what we have to do to stay alive on this planet who's our meager little chimp brains trying to trying to quantify all of these things that are around us all the time so we put them into this sort of three-dimensional box of movement and distance and that the entire am the entire universe could be a compact thing yeah that projects itself like a hologram onto a screen I love these kind of conversations because I'm clearly too stupid to really understand what and I don't understand you to say how stupid well we don't understand each other yes is part we're all the same yeah like I think I'd be interesting to do a good document or something about from about you apology because one thing is the assumption that their extraterrestrial is an assumption mm-hmm but I think it intrigues me is the power of ridicule to silence yes even the most intelligent people in our community from examining something like the ridicule kept doctors from accepting germs sure because they didn't want to they didn't want to be ridiculed by their peers mm-hmm and even now you've got people that will like Michael Shermer will cling to the most absurd explanations for a phenomenon like the f-16 radar footage what did he what was Michael Shermer I can't remember it but it was it was pretty it really went to great lengths that entailed having to basically diminish any respect you had for any of the people who reported on the events hmm I had to go and had to go into character assassination in order to to eliminate it yeah that's the best way to kill an idea he's a professional skeptic and I like Michael a lot and he's been on the podcast many times yeah I actually had him debate Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock about these ancient civilizations and it wasn't very good for him there are some psyche moments as skeptics are believers well the problem is their instance they believe in the problem is being a skeptic itself it's a stupid way to look at the world it's a jet you're actually not sure about something I don't mean you should be objective right don't be skeptical right being skeptical no but I know for sure that that's not true yeah but it serves a massive purpose for people that really don't understand things and he can explain to you and with actual science as long as the actual science is being used and it's not Cara the assassination it's not mockery it's not it's not there's certain people that are just deep bunkers they can call themselves skeptics but they're not looking at thing like oh maybe that is effective maybe that is healthy yeah that is interesting no they don't look at it that way they're looking at it they're trying to pick it apart and that's fine if you can pick it apart but if you cannot you have to be objective about the fact that oh well this is a very interesting phenomenon and this is what we know about science is that and this is what we know about this thing and now right now we have we have a weird conundrum did Chariots of the Gods yeah did he Erich von däniken was he was he believed 100% he's all is still in it all in I asked him the first thing I asked him I said what is that Maas yeah desperately have to go go go yeah the first thing I asked him was what is the most compelling piece of evidence there's the you know and he pointed to this Mayan stone plaque that's in Palenque have you ever seen it it's a book yeah it's a god one of their one of their former Kings that is lying on his back and he's looks like he's moving some Jaime see if we could find that thing it's just really cool carving that they found that looks like there's a guy who is in a seat and it looks like this fire behind his back and you could say them like you could say that he's manipulating controls on a ship and he's you know shooting a rocket into the heaven I would like to see what this the mainstream version of that is because also it could just be art you know an imagination yeah it could be that they they knew about certain things being propelled by fire there it is yeah that's it so if you see this I mean that's a big a stretch to say that guys in a spaceship I don't know what the fuck that is he's sitting down like an altar kind of he could yeah but it doesn't look like he's looking through an eyepiece right what's true but what does that mean is it a telescope maybe he's just got a telescope or maybe it's just an astronomer yeah it is possible I don't think they had telescopes no I don't think a telescope was even invented till no do they even have glass at that point well I don't know if the Mayans did Wow but but that was this number one piece of evidence was like that's kind of silly I mean when we were kids in the 70s the you know Bigfoot you know and cherry to the gods and everything was so new you look at this image look at the bottom of it even the part where the flames supposed to be coming out from below him yeah that's the where's the flame I guess the flame is the shit the very very bottom but I mean I'm not even sure I buy that if you were gonna draw fire you'd do a really shitty job if that's your fire that doesn't really look like fire to me no like could be any more ornate seat right something right if that's fire like what is all the stuff around them what's all that stuff is that that looked kind of mechanical though right Lucy there's bolts does today I'm a fire god maybe they the fire-god looks like a monkey kind of a face with titties monkeys got some titties oh now I get it right yeah and then the monkeys is that his teeth it's the first Hooters right it does it could be armed but that's the point is it so open to interpretation there's so much that you could see if you're looking to see but what I do see is this guy who's he's reclining and yeah went shilling and it looks like he's looking through something what's that thing hanging across him you see that thing across his arms yeah fuck that is but here's the thing I don't think anybody knows what the fuck that is but so for him to say that this was the number one most compelling evidence I mean we're people getting high at this point oh yes I mean that could be just some guy got high in LSD or something yeah they were they were taking different kinds of plants that have lysergic acid in them there was a I had a great tour in Chichen itzá we went through when we hired a guide who is a professor who's fantastic it was really good who's really loved Mayan civilization super passionate about it and then when he found out that I had read a bunch of books on and he was really excited about it so he took us to these all these different areas but there was a one area where they had this like like hall where they would just get fucked up he's like this is this is where they would do their their psychedelics no they would take different forms of plants there's a bunch of different plants like Morning Glory seeds really yeah Morning Glory seeds the same ones you find today mm-hmm yeah they actually try to mute them a lot of people don't know that Morning Glory seeds actually contain what is the active compound I think it's a cousin of LSD it's it's something psychoactive that's very closely related and what you did would do is they would make it they would take the Morning Glory seeds they would they would soak them and I think they would smash them and make a cake and bake it so they have LS a LS LS a less surge occurred right is that lysergic acid it concentrated Wow yeah and so when you fly this they've engineered Morning Glory seeds many of them to not be is psychoactive they've done things to them because Apple in the 70s we're getting high off Morning Glory seeds oh is that funny yeah Terence Mckenna it was one of my favorite psychedelic authors that was his first psychedelic trip he was a young lad he ate morning glory seeds he bought them and smashed him up teens trying to get high sickened after eating flower seeds Today Show what years that that's so far years yeah they bought flower seeds recently they probably heard me talk about it yeah well that's baby with Rose that's so funny Morning Glory yeah okay those are Morning Glory ones yeah but see there are these welcome banana peels I don't know why they're getting sick they're probably pussies too many little bitches apparently these seeds contain d large Surgical amide LSA which closely resembles LSD but see all of them don't have that no when they say they got sick would they not see and vomiting oh they had a batch and introspection yeah introspection is sickening yeah yeah apparently that's how a lot of the Mayans a lot of the Mayans used to take LSA they said take this stuff that used to take Morning Glory seeds and McKenna said that when he did it he saw a lot of like classic Mayan iconography he saw like a lot of imagery so maybe that's just how it reacts with the brain it could be there's also there's that's a really plausible theory there's another theory that's a little more slippery and this one is very woowoo and the idea is that every experience that you have like say if you take mushrooms right every when you're eating mushrooms you're not just having an experience where your brain is interacting with this substance but you are in fact experiencing all of the people that have ever interacted with this trip so that that's one of the reasons why psilocybin is so potentially potent is that you're not just accessing we're talking about moron glory seeds oh right and other getting high and morning glory seeds and this was something that the Mayans did we I remember we did that when I was in high school out there but there are zillions a lot of thought well the McKenna was saying that when he did it he saw all this I think he said either mine or Egyptian iconography saw a lot of like images that were very similar to like these ancient civilizations and the thought is that either this is what's it's doing to your brain or the more woowoo thought is that when you are having a psychedelic experience especially when you're consuming something like a fungus like psilocybin that you're not just having this experience where this chemicals interacting with your brain but you're entering into the realm of all the previous experiences that human beings have had with this which is one of the reasons why psilocybin has such a rich history and these are incredibly potent experiences when you do take psilocybin and then also ayahuasca when you take that people see Jaguars and snakes and all these different things and so the thought behind that is that you are interacting with all the experiences that all these many people have had with these with these various substances is it what's genetic inside you like I'm here I mean who knows she's stored yeah that's all just speculating but that what's interesting is that McKenna said that ketamine which at the time when he was alive he died in the early I think early two-thousands right I think he died like early 2000s that ketamine was a weird drug to take because it seemed like no one had taken it yet that you would take it and it's like you were in an empty office building like it's all built but there's no one in the building whereas if you're taking LSD or if you're taking psilocybin you've this all these experiences that people have had so it's like the drug itself or the compound itself absorbs the experiences of the user and transfers them to the next users very woowoo yeah it is I like that idea though yeah you do something that says potent is like psilocybin you you're open to fucking anything like if that's possible if you can eat five grams of mushrooms and that happens like god damn it I'll take whatever you got what else you got what else you tell me is this and that's yeah I don't know yes yeah it's also happen can treat intractable depression yes people take know it opens up doors yeah brain that you take it one will always stay close yeah that you do one psilocybin trip and then for like six months their depression is completely gone yeah my parents had a had a friend who was experimented on in Canada as a with the LSD mm-hmm so she lost her mind eventually yeah but she didn't know it was a government they the CIA was experimenting in Canada on Canadians of course and she was to get across that clear cut yeah that's right back then it was harder there was Rob yeah they couldn't get over yeah they had they had good full cooperation is that it was the diefenbaker you think yep you guys know the ted's kid since he swore the Unabomber I know about the be Unabomber part he was a part of the LSD Harvard studies Oh was he he was more this is kind of the same same deal yeah they cooked that guy's brain yep yeah yeah there's there's a documentary about it it's really interesting he was like a 16 year old kid when he first went to Harvard because he was so fucking smart that he was entering to harbor at 16 years of age and there was a psychologist that was working at Harvard at the time that he is he's been photographed with and was friends with and he was a part of this program this guy was notoriously ruthless with his application of LSD to young people I mean just gave it a shot let's see what fries them forever does but here's the thing and I've been thinking about this a lot lately I think that he was onto something and this is what he was on to what he was onto he was trying to kill people that were creating technology because he felt like technology is gonna be the end of humans he's right he's right yes I'm saying on your show yeah you're hot as fuck on ass and they probably gave him a fucking coffee cup full of acid at 16 yeah who knows how much they were they didn't know what the doses were they were just experimenting with yeah cuz I Ken Kesey and Leary were exactly part of that exactly yeah a few weeks ago when I read an article online and at the bottom had said this article has been written by a program not by a human oh yeah yeah I was like what yeah I arts coming hain't paintings paintings done by AI Symphony no yeah what's happening no its current in it now well once they figure out a way to make a reality that's indiscernible from the reality that we're currently experiencing which is just it's around the corner yeah that's only like four or happened a billion years ago right and we're just living in it well you only know what's in front of you you know what I mean yeah and if you've done the you know the you know what is it the oculus stuff and all rift yeah yeah I mean we have a HTC vive in the back it's too hazy they're incredible right yeah it's amazing but your emotions everything mmm it's like you're there it's no different yeah you know it's very similar there's one where you jump off a building have you ever tried that one no you go out in a diving board on a on a high-rise and over off yeah well they are they're using it to treat PTSD and yeah I reckon the phobias yeah it's going to happen yeah so once they figure out a way to give you some experiences that you can't tell whether or not those experiences are were real or not then the aliens are feel they'll land it's the matrix in Iraq it really is the matrix I think that the artificial life and art in intelligence that is sentient that is also completely autonomous that can run itself and decide for itself it's only a matter of time that's not a matter of the this is not like HG Wells science-fiction 200 years ago like we're just guessing this is like you could see it coming yeah they already have machine learning they're ready have certain artificial intelligence that guesses certain things about you and yeah but Siri is still a dumb cunt what's better big spear series I don't ride Bixby Samsung's version like I never use it yeah it's incredibly effective yeah but it has a terrible voice that button to sit employs an app it out to anything else is it the voice of Bill Beck speak is that really cool all right from the Hulk yeah and no or John tell you about music come child to pick I never loved you till yeah yeah and he had that Japanese lady that was a keeper but he never hooked up with her I was like come on she's right there bro she seems real nice she seems lonely too yeah yeah I didn't like how are you not with her man she's so nice to your kid yeah you guys a big a sweet family very long you know Davey may have you got in like five or six more seasons though overs on Netflix or something yeah there to push that angle I started watching the magician a little bit you seen that what does that have to be show Oh Oh God what is the worst of all - is one of the CBS movie mysteries it was like with Columbo and was terrible really I loved him yeah he was the magician uses magic to know magic yeah oh that's hilarious yeah I don't solve crimes of magic you don't you don't you know you just do magic yeah oh and you're solving crimes and then someone else solves crimes yeah it's probably a producers idea right guys here's the show a magician who solves green sell it I got another meeting I gotta go he leaves yeah yeah I they gave me a pitch once it was a guy who is immortal he was an Egyptian this was a pitch to me yeah it's gonna play this yeah who is immortal farts good casting yeah more like God mm-hmm yeah something happened back then and a woman put a curse on me because I was like banging her sister or something like that and the curse was that you would live forever so here I was many thousands of years later I had to pretend that I was a regular person I could never die and that was the sitcom that was yes as a sitcom who's a sitcom oh the dumbest like that I've ever heard in my life great isn't one hour yeah I was like do you solve crimes because I know I knew it was gonna be a problem when I met the guy and he was wearing bowling shoes but he wasn't going bone shoes a lot of character my shoes are interesting I used to do that well do you remember when there was the writer teams but it was always a one guy who was the typer and the other guy was really funny yeah you know there was a lot of those teams and those teams would branch off and one of those guys would get a lot of money and then the you know the fucking paper there's a lot of that with the teams the teams always seem to be like one really talented person yeah who's kind of maybe introspective and weird and they eventually figured out oh I can just hire a typist mm-hmm yeah and you got rid of that guy and then that guy got a big development deal all right remember development oh my god I had so many of them I had one one year where they gave me a shit ton of money and we never did anything I got all the money yeah I had three Munson I had about four right after Newsradio did you yeah and they creat smaller and smaller networks each time so yeah right get down to the CW you know you got an issue I might have to actually write something out no cooking channel so what is this obsessing what is your your more recent obsessing about UFOs what's the origin of this it's well part of it is just the fact that that the evidence just the evidence itself says you have to take this seriously and yet no one does or very very few people do I'm even like I again that f-16 footage that even Neil deGrasse Tyson who is a great skeptic said us on one of the late night actually said well if you really want to look at the possibility of some non-human intelligence that f-16 stuff is pretty compelling what is the f16 stuff that to the Stars Academy put out it was this long yeah he's crazy on the park busy oh yeah very nice guy what do you see he's a very nice guy and a brilliant musician yeah and he's a loon yeah fucking full-on believer yeah he left blink 182 to go do this to the stars Academy shit he's the biggest goddamn rock band on the planet okay here's something interesting about this and this was pointed out like by okay film video film by fighter jet shows an unknown object near san diego video from 2004 was released by the US Department of Defense well the way it moves there's something about the way it moves is really weird huh that way one of the pilots told the media the object was not from this world hmm yeah and here's the things like the skeptics in order to dismiss that they have to go well front they have to make arguments like that jet fighters are not better observers than anyone else pull up Mick Ward's take on that Mick Ward the guy who he runs deep what is it meta bunk meta bonds a debunking site and he's another one of those guys that is all in with the the conventional explanation yeah it goes way out of his way to not look at anything that could be which is the opposite of Occam's razor yes yes how comes razor says you know that if you have to go to great lengths to dismiss something right that's not following Occam's razor right Occam's razor says if the jet pilot says he saw this he saw it I think he had an interesting take on it throwing one thing says there's a time during the video where the pilot shifted from 1 X 2 to X which makes the image move more because you have magnification like if you ever used magnifying glasses by nose like if you use 15 X by nose it's very difficult to hold on yeah but 6 6 you can't look at things in distance yeah but that's if you don't have about about 3 million dollars worth of stabilization equipment on you're dead walked on to this object right which is why that stays in lock he had an expert although that was kind of interesting and when it breaks free of the lock he saw unbelievable just take off or something like it just at one point just the object just breaks free the lock and that's almost impossible hmm I have a glitch I'm possible for anything that man wants to do with the quality of cameras today why is this footage so shitty this is infrared footage yeah yeah I mean do you need this when you're shooting at things in the sky you can't rely on well you're looking at heat yeah I can't see visually it's so far it's so far it would be best game in the rabbit hole how did debunk conspiracy theories using fact logic and resistance so what is he saying what is he saying the program that uh make that a little larger for my stupid eyes said for all you made sure you are talking about the right video there's two that are confused here we're talking about the gimbal video which is not from the Nimitz incident just discussed here so scroll down a little bit the gimbal video is in ok yeah that's the one we're looking at it's an unknown date and location from an up from unknown pilots nope the tic-tock one some yeah that's 2004 ok that's David forever the media's discussed these videos tom belongs to the stars the link contains the frames what's he saying keep going keep going keep going the black shaper on the objects I'm kind of infrared flare glare we know the shape of a very bright infrared source like the engine of a plane can be much bigger than the object itself is explained here ok so this like a flare mm-hmm doesn't explain again Occam's razor is ok so this guy this guy's saying it's look at it looks nothing like it mm but even if it is a jet at jets not capable of breaking free from the lock right yeah and if you look at that you can see the jet his own example debunks is debunking right not be moving yeah the video need not be moving and it's also something that that this guy doing probably a few hours research has come up with something that is more credible than a trained fighter pilot who is there and visually seeing it what do you think in tracking a view I guess I don't know let's get crazy oh I would I think it is it is an intelligent craft is a craft being piloted intelligently why aren't they talking to us uh we're fucking ape smile even fucking plastic straws everywhere oh we cured it no more plastic straws when you're when you're looking at an ant colony you didn't go listen to me ants yes you just looked at them you know there was no you know and they say why why don't they go to the White House and so what I would do when you look at an ant colony go I must speak to the Queen right you know yes noise look at ants yeah that's what the most ridiculous thing about like the old movies like the old movies it would land on the White House lawn right that's it yeah Bharath to Nick whatever that thing was yeah Klaatu barata like - Nick - yeah that's the Day the Earth Stood Still was like nineteen forty years 15:55 fucking great great music I watched it really recently a little bit stories are great he was a Crow's people is name is John Carpenter Oh JC that's right rice was a carpenter they shoot that object out of his hand the first second he pulls it out remember he has a thing that's your cancer yeah they shoot him they shoot him and they just shoot out of his hand media and at the end of the movie he is he is killed and resurrected that's right right yeah they she's taking the robot - yeah yeah the robot yeah robot yeah very tall yeah yeah and like he looked like you would want a robot to look in 1950 yes yes metal and shit Smith yeah Chrome yeah those those were the days we thought that they would communicate like it wasn't there was a whole rash of them that were seen over Washington DC yeah there was a PA there was some dozens yeah dozens of UFOs tracked and admitted by the government that they were tracking them and watching them hmm but they essentially and then the end there explained to us nothing nothing particularly important you know we have a mutual friend who claims I won't say her name but chick knows and I feel eggs I wrote her off as a lunatic when I first heard yeah well she was claimed to be abducted yeah and then I I was doing a show with her years ago and she was telling us the story we're all like oh huh that's pretty funny and she says and then they took a scoop out of my back and I'm like a scoop they took a scoop out of your back and she showed on their back shoulder there was a hexagonal diamond-shaped scoop out of her back a divot that it was hexagonal yeah that was clearly clearly and no scar tissue maybe she was a crazy bitch no scar tissue might know how to make this yeah give myself a little punch but I am hole punch back there I worked at a bookstore at the time years ago and I went into the alien section of the world's biggest bookstore in Toronto in the name of it and of course I went to the alien section and just looked all this crap up immediately and there are other people yeah what the scoop there's a lot of other people with you know abduction stories and some of them have like little pieces of something in their body I remember you talking to me about this many many years ago I was like oh no Dave's interested it was like implants you're talking about people that have alien implants in the body yeah and that's the things I to me it's just I guess the one thing that's I'm kind of obsessed with now is just because we're comedians yes and what the power of ridicule to silence debate is unbelievably potent sure and we're part of that we're part of the machinery that was used very very consciously by the government to silence yeah any inquiry you know it was like you know feeding it you know feeding the story the right way to late-night talk show hosts mm-hmm made it so that nobody would talk about it so do you think that the government consciously fed those ideas like Johnny Carson and those folks yeah I think there's documentation of a pro you know of that they you know to to make the UFO phenomenon ridiculous do you think they did that to avoid mass hysteria like if you're you're the government and you know there's nothing out there but you see these people freaking out you okay look we've looked we've used all of our military might all of our scientific power and we we don't see shit I'm not buying this but these people are freaking out this has the real potential to get out of hand and go sideways on us let's just start making fun of this yeah I don't know I think it's more likely that there's something there that they feel powerless to control do you think Kennedy was taken down into the the basement of whatever and shown the alien sitting there this is what I say about aliens with when in regards to Trump if there's anybody that would fucking tell us it we did it you know tweets UFOs are real but CNN is fake yeah New York fails to find UFOs if the government does have the evidence they are never going to show it to Trump right that's the problem like what the fuck's the point being president if you can't find that UFOs yeah if I knew that to become president meant you get all the access to UFOs I'm like oh yeah yeah okay so like I try for that the presidents who have tried haven't gotten there no no one gets it like Jimmy partner Jimmy Carter you know said he was he had a UFO experience yeah he saw something right yeah yeah I saw he said he saw something but it see that was back in the 70s where everybody was seeing shit they were all talking about things there's more the zeitgeist was people were legit like after Close Encounters of the Third Kind especially people are legitimately thinking that aliens were gonna come he proposed such a possible scenario and I move it was so good yeah it wasn't anything you expected it was gonna be but like I was gonna say here like in that exams like the range of some like like that explanation of the f-16s locked you know footage like Rendlesham forest were the the they claimed that these American soldiers in the woods out in England mistook the light a lighthouse light for a spacecraft that they were within 20 feet of a craft that they saw and took notes on difference of yeah they were not even like bright up against it and they you know wrote down notes saw like different sort of hieroglyphs on the ship itself described its you know described the the feel of it this electrostatic feel of being around it and the official explanation was they mistook a lighthouse several miles away for this spacecraft so Occam's razor again says that's hard to believe that these trained observers and that's I think they always try to dismiss the idea that trained observers are better observers but they are better observers sure in the age of yeah today where everyone has a high-definition camera yeah in their pocket have you taken a have you taken a photograph of the moon on your phone comes out super doesn't look like the moon what's true right there's no details comes out as work alone the lenses are too wide but but Occam's razor says all right they saw something but this you know because what is the likelihood that trained observers who have been on this base for years on this night would mistake a lighthouse that they've seen every night for the entire time they've been on this base for a UFO I mean what is the the likelihood that that explanation is correct I'm not aware of this door o Rendlesham forest yeah how do you say it bent woods in Rendlesham and REM d le SH a.m. Rendlesham forest yeah who's been woods it was to noise like a character actor on Columbo were you afraid there was you have an episode and it's a nuclear relation and Rendlesham forest the nuclear installations are always ripe with UFOs yes yeah what year was this this was in the 80s 1980 yeah hmm interesting and it's you know and said obviously the obvious explanation is or nothing except the only thing you can accept is that these observers saw something right described it accurately is it something that had crashed if you want to say that no it came down was was landed in the forest and then took off what do you think of the wrong case the night before that Roswell I I think it's probably true we're you know you're all in yeah what I mean because it's interesting again because the because the cover stories for are so much less believable than an alien yeah I used to have a joke about it yeah that they put on the paper that they have recovered a crashed UFO and alien bodies and the next day they set up we made a mistake it was just a balloon Mexicans yeah they're Mexicans they were drinking apparently without the balloon pinata yeah you go crazy believing you're right but we just invented some new stuff yeah we're and then 30 years later they go oh we were they were high altitude dummies they were dropping that's right to test how they would fall and now we have lasers and invisibility cloaks well they showed up again the next day with a bunch of weather balloon scraps yeah look this is yeah what the guy holding up what they don't tell you is that they flew the wreckage out to wright-patterson Air Force in two separate planes and the Truman met them there yeah yeah yes I mean yeah the more rational two separate planes the more because they were worried that one would crash the the weather the weather balloon thing is not rational yes something weird happened I listen I want it to be an alien so bad question myself so that's my problem I want all that stuff but I again I I won't like I'll be skeptical about stuff that just seems crazy over people that you know believe you know sort of ascribe some sort of metaphysical explanation for all this my my thing is just well if the preponderance of the evidence says something happened right but doesn't tell you what happened right then you still have to believe something happened not knowing what happened isn't evidence that it didn't happen and yet you're still a flat earther yeah whoa have you looked outside it seems y-yeah have you studied hashtag spaces fake no you just lived in people dumber these people there's people that are so dumb they think the earth is flat and there's people that that are so dumb they make fun of the people that are dumber than them yeah yeah they think that the space is fake space is fake there's no space no space and it's basically what isn't that well that's the holographic theory yeah no but you google it it's really religious it's it's all about the firmament and the Bible they're they're really it's very strange because stars are hung in this guy over what you would call like yes and YouTube people here it is right and you know what fuck I have fully again because I'm 50 wow that's incredible human Explorer I understand I have to be sometimes yeah hashtag spaces fake human dug earth hmm yeah you may explore ocean suddenly discover a thousand miles really well-written yeah super super completely they can discover a thousand miles I wonder how many of those I was talking to you about Renee de Resta who's the woman who studies all these Russian troll farms and their Mockbee I'm wondering how much of that is them that the Russians like the side Flat Earth a spaces fake Department where they just mark because it's always in English I don't think there's a lot of flatterers Russian proponents God if I was one of those Russian guys that I would want that to be my department yeah I just they call people globe targ's or globe heads yeah if you believe it if you believe it's around yeah yeah Qatar's I've saved some of these memes cuz they're so wonderful they're just like this is rich I had the wars uber ride with a guy know who was a flat earther yeah he was and he was a computer programmer what yeah a computer programmer slash flat earther yeah and then I was driving an uber not working now so I held the whole time while he didn't argh while he drove me crazy he drove me he knew what he was doing I think it's doing on purpose I think so so how did he start off so I bet you're one of those guys believes the Earth's around huh well I talked about the beautiful view from the plane they picked me up at the airport yeah and and you know it's so beautiful the sunset over the curvature of the earth not really the curvature of the earth that's how it started stop oh my god at the point where I was I think I think I tore my clothes off you made me so insane there's so many of them now and you know we we uncovered the origins of it of what we think the origins of it it was a troll from 4chan 4chan was fucking around they started promoting this idea that the earth is actually that's where it started a lot of things start from that that's was a free bleeding movement started from I know what that is women are expressing their power by controlling their menstrual cycle with pads or tampons just bleeding into their pants to show their power yeah they did it on 4chan as a joke and the women started doing in real life for real yeah they thought that thought it was like this is a way to like these people are disgusted by menstrual blood or something yeah shit on the patriarchy by showing your pussy blood crazy makes me want to start one 4chan is the best they just they're so good at that they're so good at starting these goofy ass fucking little movements and then getting people behind it it's like a it's like a game yeah yeah game well it's you know what it is it's probably bunch of really smart people right some of them not so smart but some of them really smart that are stuck at their desks and they're bored shit with some computer job somewhere and I think of in the meantime they just decide to fuck people right we're talking about flat earthers you know free bleeding the free bleeding movement which is also started by 4chan yeah 4chan started this movement where women would express their power by not controlling their menstrual cycle by just letting the blood leak out into their pants and they did it as a joke yeah the 4chan did and women started actually doing it caught on yeah yeah a lot of these things it's so hard to mock like it's so hard to figure out like what is mockery and what's real exactly what is parody and what's what's mirror that what's the onion the onion is you know if you do you know that James Lindsay Peter Bogosian what's ha the woman's name the woman that we didn't mean the grievance Studies hoaxes do you know Peter Bogosian is a professor at the University of Portland and I think that's the school he's in Portland and he decided to with these other academics publish these fake papers on like rape and dog parks and like like like cisnormative like different like to see what what happened know people loved them ridiculous things like fat body building like bodybuilding contests for fat people like to talk about the importance of these things like things that you would read and you would think would be obviously a parody someone's fucking around they submit these these academic journals not only get published but they get praised for for their scholarship mm-hmm and then they came out and said hey we were fuckin with you guys so late yeah it's out there and you know and you guys love these papers you morons and that this is problem part of the problem with the humanities today yeah is that things are so sideways in terms of like it's so difficult to find out what's what's parity and what's reality yeah mm-hmm that's insane it's at the same time is insane as it gets yeah yeah yeah they guess it's very unsettling it's not know to not know if someone's having me on or not exactly yeah and will this vary all the structures they used that for good or for bad would filter things down are gone yeah you know like we you know everything was handed over to powerful people who filtered what we were given to know there used to be a an agreement of common sense that you hang around I think the cure is to line reading and I think we're gonna accept that cure because I you know Elon is working on some sort of neural link things the only way we'll know if someone's telling the truth we're gonna have yeah I think it's good we're gonna accept it and we're gonna give in and we're gonna we're we're going to be able to take another step further I think they're gonna create a universal language everything is a lot I think there's going to be a universal language that probably is augmented reality some augmented reality language shapes or some kind of symbolism symbols yeah something that is great too and we're we're probably not gonna accept it because we're old we'll like fuck this next generation our kids maybe even our kids kids our kids kids are gonna be the first people to adopt it and then it's gonna be universal worldwide and with augmented reality and some sort of ability to interact with each other yeah through my kind of bandwidth I remember the first time I heard about cochlear implants mmm that's the first thing that popped in my head is this is the start yeah this is the shortest interface you're now officially you're a sidebar for clear implant you are a cyborg there's a six-link people with Apple watches on yeah you know you're wearing an Apple watch like what do you would eat what is that you have a computer that's constantly strapped to you all the time answering you monitoring your heart rate yeah you know and then we've been sitting here and when we don't know something accessing the entire store of human knowledge Jamie's our cyber yeah yeah yeah we're accessing all of human knowledge true anytime we woman that was Ellen's other thing that he said on the podcast you're already a cyborg you have a phone it just it's not in your body but it's and you're holding on to yeah it's voluntary cyborg did you guys read the third wave years ago was that a book you know no that was the prediction of all this really yeah and it's in the early eighties and it was prediction and the one thing third one he predicted was that the next generation the first line in that I remember was it's all about information yeah it's all gonna be about sharing information you know that's almost gonna figure out a way to share information well that's when I saw the cochlear implant I thought well if you're erase your your brain is interpreting an electronic signal as information directly its bypassing the ear entirely right and it's just a neuronal connection is that well that eventually is how we will access the Internet will access the Internet as though it is our own thoughts it'll be as Li as I remember your name remember any other fact well beyond matrix and we'll all be part of the same yeah we won't be sitting in pods somewhere well see it for yourself it initially will be like a peripheral thing you'll be able to tap into it or not as you as you wish but I think as time goes on it's going to be more and more integrated just like distinguish which run your own mind look you used to have to go to a computer that was hardwired into the wall right and you dial-up to get online yeah now everything's instantaneous is your phone and this isn't I remember when we were on Newsradio I first got an Apple computer and got online and I was fuckin fascinated I couldn't believe it to CompuServe yes how we got to bring it all around the first thing I did was download UFO reports downloading UFO like a dork like all these things yeah I remember the first chat with somebody I remember in 1993 yeah and it was a 95 office computer first time I had in news raid was the first time I had an E account remember that and getting on online I know it and me at first I think I went to the Louvre site sure to see what was on there and you know watched you know Hieronymus Bosch paintings downloaded in about 30 minutes why I remember you had a program on your laptop this was like 96 you had a program on your laptop that kept crashing but when it worked it was amazing because we give you the news yes it's ask run saver yes as a screen saver the news would just come up yes constantly the constant flow of news and I wish that still existed it doesn't exist anymore I don't even think it was Wi-Fi thank you again I had I had an ISDN line in my house oh my I remember which gave me 128 kilobits per second light years ahead of everybody I knew yeah I had its he one line installed in my house yeah yeah I remember it like it's like I need there's only I lived in the woods it was the only way I could get like really high speed internet just had a carve a fucking hole in the ground and give me a business pipe amazing now five g's around the corner man five g's faster they say it's goods of times can change again yeah it's to a fiber optic link yeah on your phone yeah I think CDs are those are gone now forever I save a post in case yeah just is just yeah well the real question is like where are we storing all this stuff if we're only storing it in one than zeros like we're talking about the demise of civilization there's all that up right but that's what that's what probably I mean every society probably I don't think they reached that ten thousand years ago but I think every society probably reaches some point where everything is just ones and zeros on a database somewhere but there's no crashes it's a physical place right where that exists something like all our Gmail accounts exist somewhere there's huge shillings with internet exchanges sure you know if someone just drops oh no no that's absolutely the case but also if something happens and the grid goes down and we I mean we're right if Matty yeah where I ever yeah I'm sure of what dr. Robert Schoch was talking about if there's a fucking lightning storm that he really torches buildings and starts everything on fire good luck accessing all that shit not only that if human beings just skip a generation like we have a generation of turmoil and chaos and and then we slowly rebuild civilization how many of those people are gonna understand computer code how many these people can understand Linux how many these people that are coming up without any education from a formal university from no internet connection whatsoever for decades perhaps hundreds of years it's like the resetting of civilization you talked about earlier exactly start all over again and that's when the aliens come because they know we can't do anything but draw shit on ya they wait until we can take pictures anymore then they come yeah and we engineer yeah right now they just you know relying on the fact that nobody can frame a shot well with the weirdo thing about the alien theory was that they came down and genetically manipulated lower hominids yeah that's the really humans BS that's the weirder one yeah or that they are they are a later evolved version of us coming back to check on us right right right yeah and that's the other thing too is about that archetypal image of the alien with the big black eyes is that if you go you go down from Australia Pittacus to home modern homo sapien if you make this connect you see this hunched over very hairy almost chimp like all humanoid and then standing up but but losing all of its hair and the head is much larger doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years yeah well where's that going is I gonna keep going well if it keeps going this is what you're gonna get you gotta get a fee yeah feeble thing with a giant head and that's what these aliens are they're always feeble with giant heads it's true yeah yeah terrible and if they left what they've been living off earth for a long time yeah then yeah your bodies you know they're very out of shape well they also have no penises or vaginas so they realized that saves a lot of time yes that gives you time to get stuff done I'm already there and it's more of a meritocracy you're not banging people based on their tits and ass yeah you don't have that anymore there's no more that you just more wasted time yeah just sharing your thoughts transparently through the air no orders you don't even orb like and yeah yeah you need to pick things up anymore everything's telekinetic right now using that giant head to move shit around never have to leave your house that was the other like your pod there's a guy that worked supposedly he don't know if you really worked at area 51 but the the whole story was good document is it yeah yeah it's you can't breathe where you it's just dealing with him as an individual to go okay this guy isn't you know he isn't the the firebrand UFO believer that some people want him to be hmm and he's not the lunatic that other people want him to be but he didn't tell the truth about his education right isn't that the case there's there's some some finagling about yeah well definitely like the records of his education if they if he was telling the truth those records aren't around anymore right yeah so if he was telling the truth somebody expunged and yet and he's and he's basically his argument is well if I didn't have this education why was I hired to do this job right you know I mean I was hired to do this research by the government and and they have the records of me doing the research so why did they let me do this research for all these years if I didn't have the education to do it but wouldn't every someone who went to school with them like don't you have friends from high school right well not many well I I do have some friends they can go yeah oh yeah wasn't there a guy who went to college with Bob Lazar could say yeah yeah 6 101 which is out there yeah I think there aren't people yeah yeah they remember him oh cool so you you enjoyed the documentary do you remember what the name of it is uh what is it called Bob Lazar the guy who it's a newest yeah somebody emailed me about that well Satan the guy made it that's a real problem like UFO even this one is a fairly rational documentary but it's but they're so bad even this one is just this just got just bad filmmaking right you know Obama's are area 51 and flying saucers for the title yeah four point one that's it Jeremie Korbel yeah I think he's the gentleman yeah and that's what I said adults but it has like Mickey Rourke doing voiceover very dogmatic voiceover karf at some point I loved it as the wrestler doing it as Bukowski that would be fine it's got 20 percent on Rotten Tomatoes but it's movie here with your fucking UFO but I mean you've seen you've seen the was I know what I saw and out of the blue those documentaries no you haven't seen those are great are they out of the blue is a great serious documentary about the UFO phenomena and and I know what I saw is one sort of tracing the participants in the the disclosure hearings at the Press Club in Washington God you got to bring me back in the ship yeah I love them man I really wish they're real but I'm telling you my experience talking to these people when I did that sci-fi shows like yeah this is all nonsense yeah but again that maybe those people were nonsense but the Train military air traffic controllers the pilots yeah you know government officials like was his name fief the governor of Arizona he's one of the guys in I know what I saw an out of the blue oh yeah he was the guy that was told to like mock it dressed like you yeah in the segment he talks about how much he deeply regrets doing that and this is from out of the blue yeah really deeply regret maybe now is not a governor anymore he's trying to get a new angle on his career well he basically said you know what well tens of thousands of people saw these craft right and we lied we came out we lied mmm so he did say who directed him to lie I he didn't really didn't say he was really directed to do he said he felt like people were in a state of panic and he thought he could relieve some of the fear by making a joke of it and he said he really regret he really just wanted to make relaxed people hmm because he didn't he didn't know what else to do he said he didn't he said I saw it everyone else saw it and I didn't know how to calm people down so I made this joke and he said he regrets it you know to this day there's another thing about these UFO experiences alien experiences where people really dive into them there seems to be the AC the atheists version of religion to aliens fo yeah yeah which again I that I dismiss you know do you yeah I don't think that's likely to be the case that they're here to save us or they're not can no I don't know Nash and I mean that I mean the people that are believers that are really into it it seems to be that that instead of focusing on a deity they're focusing on transferring its something baby daddy yeah that when we decide to point those nuclear weapons at each other and you know it's gonna come down they'll come down at the last minute talk to Russia and prompt and make a good what's not yeah yeah yeah right but where were they during her Shima and Nagasaki yeah watching well everybody deserves the lunch break yeah but I said I think whoever whatever is going on it's not an intervention well you know right after worth right afterwards was when a giant swarm of UFO sightings happened yeah right after the nuclear bombs were dropped yeah that's when the there's a big uptick in UFO sightings yeah and a lot of the yeah and as you said a lot of the incidents are at nuclear missile sites they're going for fuel yeah well they've uh I mean there's the one in Arizona somewhere they they were UFO showed up and shut down the entire launch system they all the missiles went offline at the same time and it's you know and it's documented and it's in the records of the time Tom Tom Tom but all of the missiles went offline you don't seem like they're buying this I I'm I'm literally right in the middle that's where I live on this thing is I really don't know I'm not quite in the middle I'm in the I desperately want it to be real yeah but it's not I'm still I'm calling bullshit yeah yes I guess I'm edging but my desire my desire is Tory out I want it to be real when John Landis came out as a Bigfoot that bothered me didn't really yeah he came out as a Bigfoot believer no he came out as the guy in the suit oh yeah I remember that no that's just lie but what did you do then about five or six Harry and the Hendersons that suit no this is him and his college friends they made their the Big Foot in the in the famous video no that's pop no that's Bob hieronymus no no no there's a video of Bob Bob hieronymus was friends with the see that that story that Bigfoot stories a real problem because that's Robert the Patterson film Patterson was a con man who went to jail for writing a bad check that paid for the very camera he used to film Bigfoot he went out looking to film Bigfoot yeah they had a fucking suit I mean he's trying to get a suit they got Bob hieronymus is a big tall guy who walks like Bigfoot so there's a video yes the Patterson footage if there's a bit video that superimposes Bob hieronymus walking on one side and Bigfoot on the other side walks the same they fucking this it's the guy yeah it's him and by the way Bigfoot looks like a guy in a Bigfoot suit it's not a fucking animal on the planet that looks like a person in an animal suit you never look at a swan and go hey looks like a person Swan suit know things that like if you see a gorilla it does not look like a person in a gorilla suit right now the difference different that's the same with this fucking stupid footage it's so dumb that the people that buy in them believe it it's like come on just look at ya it was always as always see we can find that footage yeah Bob hieronymus right next to the Bob hieronymus as Bigfoot I mean there's a there's a video on YouTube where they show the stabilized image of this animal moving across the eye not by the way I've been to that area where they saw that thing yeah that's really interesting because this isn't your show that yet but there's still like people like anthropologists who will still say the you know that there's clear evidence that can own structure of this Bigfoot but Concentra doesn't matter human if there's a single thing that survived I mean it's not a single thing yeah there has to be community the compelling interesting aspect of Bigfoot is that there was an animal called Gigantopithecus that existed yeah as recently as a hundred thousand years ago and they found in the 1920s an apothecary shop in China that were an unknown hominid and then they were like where'd you get these and then they found the area where they found them and they started discovering more and they found some jaw bone fragments and some various bones see this look at this look at that guy oh my god I mean get the funk that's the guy that's amazing that's him and he admits you yes that's the same he admitted talk to it's fucking him he talked about it he said told the story they said all right ready goes exactly so put that guy in a big ole stupid fucking furry suit and you have Bigfoot and that's great it's a hundred percent him so does that mean he's not one out there no so Gigantopithecus was a real animal that they think was a bipedal hominid that lived somewhere around a hundred thousand years ago for sure but most likely coincide lived alongside human beings for eons right and this thing was an eight to ten foot tall and North Sea if you get an image of the photo of a recreation of age I can't open thickest next to a modern human being it's really interesting it was huge a huge bipedal fossil record of it it's a real thing yeah yeah I mean it makes sense like if a gorilla what are those girls like five hundred pounds I mean gorillas and gorillas are considered mythical creatures until like you seen 1900 scroll up Jamie there's a better image right above you was it even the 1900 says grills were first just like officially discovered do so there's a better one where that shows man with the the the fake Bigfoot wrapped around his keep scrolling there's uh yeah that's a good one yeah guy that's the guy so that's what that thing looked like yeah so if you saw that in the woods you'd be like holy fucking shit oh yeah eight foot tall gigantic hairy ape creature I wouldn't touch it like that guys touching well he's a fan right now that's his buddy it's like when you see dudes from Russia with bears it was hard but so that's a real animal so that's probably why there's so many mythological stories about this thing and the Native Americans have more than a hundred different names for these creatures they find that they thought was extinct for yeah yeah armored plated fish yeah there's there's a lot of animals mean that's cryptozoology in a nutshell there's a lot of animals that we think are extinct that probably aren't but that one is very unlikely one because it's you know would need an enormous supply of food yeah yeah I mean it's a huge huge animal but the thing about it is that the sightings occur all in the Pacific Northwest which if you follow the bearing landmass that's where they would have come across if they came across with humans they would have come across into Alaska where there's a lot of sightings and down into the Pacific Northwest where there's a lot of sightings yeah oh there's sightings all over the country now yeah but is there any fossil record outside of Africa specific its new no no there's not no there's not yeah yeah it's all it's Asia actually Asia is where they find them yeah it's not even Africa yeah ironically yeah Asians are tiny yeah oh right tiny people well it's not a person not this one it's um it's it's compelling in the sense that there was a bunch of different kinds of hominids that existed yeah you know we only now know that we interbred with Neanderthals yeah yeah yeah that's most of us have no DNA in us yeah most white folks which is interesting right because it was it was the opposite if it was black people had it it would be a really controversial subject you know but instead it's dumb white people like me yeah I have 57% more Neanderthal DNA than the average person you know what I'm not gonna argue that I'm pretty sure my neanderthal count is low you'd be surprised at the club you carry around it's I got rid of that bro oh it's a European been a lot of Europeans you know interbred way longer run than we they well they colonized Europe wait yeah wait for they were around for five hundred thousand years unchanged I mean Homo sapiens have only been around no I'm quite all three hundred thousand years and are sort of says oh we usurped and we we drove them into extinction yeah and in fact now we just made it them into extinction fight them to death yeah we just dilute it up yeah what was going yeah we were ruined their purity right probably drugged them and neutered him yeah probably once you figured out how to do that which is early you know about that Hobbit person thing that they found the aisle on the floor yes that's another one that they didn't know until it's God Lorien Sissis I think that's the name of it it's a tiny little person like Fang that there was like three feet tall with yeah and had large feet yeah you guys looking at me look mm-hmm not bro no just we all have our own Ginetta yes that that was a real thing that is really an image that's why and that a that existed yeah homo florins see Ensis that's it and they existed as recently as 14,000 years ago yeah yeah they coexisted with modern humans hmm yeah and they think modern humans might have wiped them out because they were probably they think there's some cannibal it not cannibalism but they preyed upon our children and stuff like that they ate us they'd us yeah well there was one of us one of the things that I've read the speculation was that they might have there might have been an issue with them like invading and trying to see you know like chimps have stolen babies and eating them yeah it's a really common thing actually babies are delicious well that's why people like lamb and for exactly yeah that was there was a company that that produced a vegan version of human flesh to sell to people in Papua New Guinea that's disgusting where do I get there were no longer allowed to eat human flesh that's hilarious offal I read this thing about people in New Guinea that were cannibals and they were talking to them after World War two and they were trying to figure out how the Europeans once they found out how many people were killed during World War two they were trying to figure out how the Europeans man to eat that much meat yeah and then they told them no they don't eat the people they kill and they were horrified yeah they're like least you waste all that all the people in battle yeah yeah yeah yeah it would be whore it's a waste whenever and then they believe they absorbed the noble qualities of their enemy mmm only the good spots yeah eating certain spots you don't eat yeah if some if you're if you killed some in the battle who you thought was really a a great warrior that's what brings you back to the whole UFO thing that makes it so compelling to me and so we have really serious protocols for dealing with uncontacted tribes we don't engage with uncontacted tribes and we find I mean we always universally agree I mean the loggers do in the Amazon assholes and mean people but the the idea in the scientific community is we should leave these people alone and so when they find these uncontacted tribes whether it's North Sentinel island where that missionary was killed recently or the Amazon when they're you know going through these jungles and finding these small bands of people the overwhelmingly everybody wants back off and leave them alone yeah yeah and they are so close to us I mean they're human beings there are Homo sapiens they have tools they have civilization they have law they have all these different things that live in these communities they're us yeah and we back off imagine what aliens imagine what aliens would do imagine yeah that's true that's their consciousness Jaime if they don't want to screw that with the human flesh alternative the healthy human flesh that's it hoax from like 4chan and deep fried tofu burger yeah once you see tofu processed you like oh this is some back to me this is is this really good for you like what this is so processed so fucking slots like reduced to nothingness and then formed again can I just eat soybeans like what the fuck is this yeah what you can do that's the way to go I think so don't you fucking tofu tastes like a toothpaste tube well it tastes like nothing and it's like it's weird yeah so weird choice yeah I can't I can't yeah I can't stand anything mate tofu but I think that if aliens did see us there they would probably take a hands-off approach if we weren't totally ruining everything like if we didn't have some antimatter weapon Irv yeah some black hole weapon that we're just gonna just fucking nuke on New Mexico just to see how it works if they saw that it was gonna burn a hole through the planet and kill everything on they might step in before they launched CERN and open up well that was lack hope that it would create a particle that would devour the fabric of the universe yeah that was a black hole that would expand and expand and expand and dig into what we did man maybe we restarted yeah you know maybe we're in a parallel universe maybe we were knocked off our timeline into another place you know it makes less sense yeah it was it was the things that the evidence of multiple universes that we pop in and out of different yeah right like the fact that we multiverse it's a Ford logo let's say do you remember you recognize this part of the Ford logo and they say most people never noticed it this is a weird little squiggle in the f really yeah only said the FedEx thing blows people's minds - yes I see arrow what arrow exactly mmm bring up FedEx if you're never if you you'll never not see the arrow again yeah same thing with the Ford logo it's like this yeah perceptions it's like hmm and so there the whole time and I did us I didn't know there was an arrow there and other people will insist that oh the FedEx arrow is really Oh interesting okay but that's an accidental arrow no you think so they design their they dish where's the air they definitely designed it oh yeah right there mmm the white part yeah yeah yeah I never see it again or never not see it again I know it's funny huh but I mean that could be like here's a Ford yeah what's the for you look a little squiggle in the F Jesus why is that a squiggle why is its notes on that that's ridiculous that makes an F like that yeah that means it actually spells fjord yeah or for Lord fool is that an eye what is it a squiggle why did they do that oh it's none there didn't used to do that that's right yeah that's people who insist that Mary Ellen died in in jail so was there always a squiggle when did what is that a real Ford that little thing when did they make the squiggle okay that's one because that's what I thought the Ford thing look yeah someone I saw this maybe you know did they stop the squiggle at some point they must have or the opposite maybe they add the squiggle David bring up the squiggle without some on do the research what's a modern Ford go to you put 2019 Ford Mustang let's see that let's see if they have a sweet hasn't squiggle now it does I think maybe some this quick asshole wanted to justify his existence by ruining their pictures logo yeah um okay let's see I mean logos do change that is the squiggle that's a squiggle yeah yeah that's a new Mustang so the squiggle is current yeah yep the squiggles current it really doesn't fit no it's stupid it would look better without that stupid score globally the only thing that's saving that squiggles that no one noticed it up until now oh great now I'm never human della effect I hate Mendel effect i but that just seems like people fucking with something that's not broken yeah right yeah it's like let's just change it up right remember when they came up with a new coke fuck yeah it was a like a riot yes of a parallel universe it's just a stupid idea this ruined coke yeah yeah the cokes made with real cocaine the original coke yeah no today today yes I thought the thought they replaced it with caffeine no they used coca leaves back in the things locally for flavor yes in fact the company all dude is crazy the company that makes the coke the the company that uses the coca leaves that brings in the coca leaves to make coca-cola is the number one you creator of medical-grade cocaine they use that coca leaf to also make medical-grade cocaine there's no cocaine and in coca-cola but there is a flavor pull that's a bunch of different four logos yeah over the years I drink diet coke with 27 1927 to 2003 all of them I like the one in 1903 that's actually a pretty dope google coke they use coca leaves to make coca cola they still do yeah actually do does that because it makes cocaine cuz of the yeah because the recipe for it so it's ass laser herbal there's like in one Marissa going yeah yes it's a flavor yeah but the diet coke is just chemicals it's all artificial remember I was in school and the new coke thing happened and the ceiling of this advertising besides producing the cocoa flavor agent for coca-cola the Steffen company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves which sells it to Malin crock did a st. Louis Missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company the United States licensed to purify cocaine from medical use medicinal use yeah there you go so they're actually using actual coca leaves so someone I guarantee you if you follow the paperwork there's a bunch of cocaine hanging around all those guys they get a little bit work yeah gives you a little pep me up right mmm that's what's amazing is that you're not allowed to chew the leaves because apparently chewing the leaves is really healthy yeah you get flavonoids it's actually good for you and it gives you a pickup that's very similar to caffeine yeah I mean that's why yeah people living in the you know this forest what's this gene I just wear things that pops up when you see a ninety percent of their sales are done the United States but it's an Irish tax registered matter explosion mark weasel moves when them tax weasel moves yeah taxes that's a bizarre when you find out these giant corporations that make billions dollars if they're all in Ireland and they weasel out of taxes you know how much they pay us they don't believe in socialism did you read that on my new taxes I paid last year Amazon no zero zero well you know it's nice it exists you know you get a one click and have some toilet paper said I'm happy use their product and that's why they need that's why they needed a billion dollars in tax breaks from the city of New York how does that work they could pay zero in taxes zero yeah but what and why did they need those tax breaks in Long Island maybe that's why they're going to anyway like you fucking dummies you let Amazon fuck you over like yeah or me with car me that's why they're I mean here all their money's in Ireland yeah Ireland's doing great yeah Harlan's kicking that shit I'm gonna yeah pawsley aliens got a bank somewhere I'm gonna curl and there's leaves a current there's some sort of a ballot initiative where they're trying to put psilocybin in the same medicinal category as they're using as from aerelon erawan I hope they do because I mean like we'll be able to get in will in store in California they're trying to do that and pass medical the medical psilocybin for therapy yeah well here's I've been on antidepressants since Newsradio days and I'm just actually just went off at this month this month are you feeling good look great good yeah I feel like part of it was cuz I had this head injury a few years ago what happened I had a well I don't know if you remember this I used to drink quite a bit I do you remember that now I now I do one night about four years ago I went out got really drunk right before Christmas and wound up I guess at a the bar called the must downtown right around the corner from my apartment and I fell down on the patio just fell over like that I would call it there to you I would call it a dead fall on the stone patio with enough force that my brain gave me a black eye from the inside of my head it's called cerebral hemorrhage every way and I had I had a subdural hematoma I was in the ICU for four days get this bread I had one of those bright red blood eyes yeah no pictures yeah I do somewhere I think one scram yeah no I guess I'm okay Tabitha's that's half of Jesus yeah that's all right Thank You Marie though it's like Total Recall where you can just remove things but Christie you know Chrissy has the photos of all that but but the worthiest and then I decided I was alright well I said I gotta quit drinking and I thought listen you know it'll be hard but I'll do it and and I kept waiting for it to get hard to not drink and it never did like I'm now four years haven't had a drink in four years and it's not heroin and yeah you do anything nothing no pot no no I wish I could I don't like pot I would think it'd enjoy what don't you like about it it makes me very quiet and paranoid that's my favorite part yeah but you seem very lucid when you're on pot yeah I seem very and very communicative yeah whereas when I'd smoke pot I can't put a sentence together oh yeah it makes me friendly yeah makes me very withdrawn alcohol makes me friendly right is that for me - yeah we say the one thing I miss about drinking is you know the liking people thing but I have because of this brain injury it never was hard to not drink I my urge to drink was gone from getting knocked in the head yeah Wow and also I noticed over the couple years is that I haven't had any depression whoa and so just before I guess and like November I said I talked to my doctors I want to go off the antidepressants and see what happens and so I've been like gradually weaned off in just this month took like the last any depressant about a month ago so how long is the weaning process it's like about three months and no hasn't really detective yes yes and how do you do it when you're meaning it's just gradually reducing the dosage the daily dosage and then doing it every other day and then it's gone but they have a protocol yeah yeah and so did he discourage you no I doctor was excited about it so that's great congratulations good good you know and said but you know keep keep in touch and little doctor - yeah yes I guess so yeah I think he had a reflector on his head that's all you know not being talked to you lab coat yeah he was like you know and he's like I think he lives in the neighborhood he's always walking around outside that's him yeah that's a doctor so so we did it and and so now I'm about a month one thing without any antidepressant what what is the difference I don't really know yet I mean it's higher don't feel different agent I definitely feel more emotional you know I kept crying at the Oscars really what all of it what you could have had Kevin Hart host definitely more I think I'm more emotional you are connected yeah and you know supposed to have something you know hopefully I mean I hopefully that's I'm part of it ups thinking I hope it will help with writing cuz I felt like I was having trouble coming up with story ideas yeah you do hug me too long now just yeah oh I've become a predator yeah but I feel good about it this is important so the only thing is emotions and you feel more creative you feel more in touch I don't know yet I don't know and I don't even know if I feel I just know I I definitely know there's a there's a heightened emotional ISM mm-hmm has it affected your improvised a little while and it doesn't seem to have but I was worried it would I was worried that I would be I like I might not be able to go out and do those shows because I'd be more I was worried it might be more Moody and you know mmm yeah yeah but it so far hasn't affected them because I went on them and newsreel because I couldn't work at one point I got to the parties couldn't work anymore and that's when I started going on antidepressants and it saved me you know so totally believe you know people should get on meds and stay on them you know it definitely helps some people I mean it saved a couple of my friends for sure yeah there were suicidal and just really didn't know where to turn they got on the right ones and you know they had experiment yeah I don't think I would have made it through that these you know mm really Wow you know and we you know like we just lost Brody Stephens just yeah died yeah he got off his meds yeah he he didn't like the way it felt to be on them and you know it was so that he's so hard that's such a hard one to take because everyone loved that guy and you think that everyone I mean he has no haters I don't know a single person was like that guy was a dick no no no no one everyone loved him he's everybody really hurry up from close friends two people just knew him a little bit like I knew him just a little bit he was so sweet but he was so so tortured he was just in pain all the time and yeah it's just it's so strange that you think the thing that people like most is for other people to love them and care about them and everybody loved Brody yeah but yet he couldn't it just couldn't go on but I never I've never known Brody to have a relationship yeah I never known him to have a special someone in his life and I mean that alone yeah probably be very very depressed is he well especially if everyone loves you but you don't feel connected to any of them right like how empty that rails and that's yeah the core fame yeah but it's also the core of depression I have is having had depression yeah one of the things that hits you is that feeling you just can't connect and is it was yours coming about when your first marriage was breaking up I mean I have lifelong depression but I didn't get it treated until that point when I was like you know it was like yeah because marriage was breaking up and I had to fly to like Africa twice in a month kids you remember the time that I protected a reporter from you Oh at the to see ace yeah he was on malaria medication and drinking which apparently enough to yeah super sweet kind Dave was was gonna kick someone's ass and I literally had to like hold on to him and kind of want to see that yeah when I had that was the other thing I just been to have been flown to Africa twice and it just got back we did the TCS and I think I also threw a glass at Tony Tony Tony Tony Jesus yeah fuck him blankie to nice guy sorry dude Randall Tony Jesus I love Tony's a great guy but I was like out of my skull and I just yeah well that was that was her part right you took his report you took his tape recorder and dunked it in Detroit yeah like and threatened to kick his ass yeah because I was yeah I was drunk yeah and yeah I was like oh my god don't do something sorry miss I was like I have to stop this this is crazy yes yeah when it was after that that that I went on the antidepressants crashed really hard after that and it was like one things I thought they were gonna work you wouldn't do anything you were experiencing that combination apparently of the malaria medication and alcohols I go crazy conversation yeah and then you add to that jetlag yeah and the trauma of being separated from my kids yeah yeah the malaria pills on their own yank you mentally all the things I love her yeah yeah I left her re to the sound of my my my eldest child screaming daddy don't go oh you know which even now I can't talk about God see it's not worth having kids no no yeah you have a 17 year old yes it's good they're on their own now basically in the year you can off yeah that's right next year he's going to college but anyway if you are out there get on meds and stay on them yeah like Brody should have stayed on his meds well you know I just I wish we could have all known and how he was and how close he was to that yeah well that's the thing it's like people think like like suicide the things like if you're close to suicide it's the most rational choice you'll ever make when you're when you're that close it just seems like the most sensible way to do this because it's otherwise it's too much pain yeah I heard someone describe it as um it's not even an immersion it's just burning it's jumping out of a burning building yeah yeah like there's that choice into the burning building or yeah was that feeling right where you go this is not as a notional decision I mean there's no choice I've had two friends hang themselves this year yeah Wow yeah yeah that that is I never thought I would ever say that yeah I never thought that that would be a way that people would be going out either yeah I remember we had Drake say there yeah oh he was hard yeah that was a hard one I knew Drake back in the but essentially my open mic days yeah he was an established comedian in Boston and I was just starting out oh yeah but so even though I'm happier than my brain injury yeah seems to have cured my depression that's fucking crazy you know the brain injury was responsible for Sam Kinison of the car crash yeah I got hit by a car when he's a kid and became this wild man yeah same thing with Roseanne I mean one of the reasons why I wanted to have Roseanne on the podcast and talk about her her issue with her television show and everything in her outburst and all the crazy stuff she says on Twitter yeah it's cuz I know her and I know her past and so I right away the beginning of the podcast I was like let's get into what happened to you and because I don't think she talked about it that much she was hit by a car she was in the fucking psycho psychiatric ward for nine months yeah like she was gone and she was never the same person again was this she was 15 years old she was walking across the street and someone had glare in their eyes from the Sun and didn't see her hit her with a car the fucking the hood ornament went into her head I mean she had a severe brain injury she couldn't count anymore she couldn't do math anymore she was she was a very smart student before then and then crippled by it afterwards yeah and then for nine months she was in a psych ward and she talked about it I'm like I wanted people to know like this does think anybody knows that they know now hopefully more than they knew then but people that work with her did so when they were writing her off like Jesus Christ this is like taking a person with a broken leg and saying you know I'm mad at you that you can't run yeah and that's the thing and like whatever you're I mean obviously Roseanne said some crazy and terrible things and and messed up a lot of people's lives but she's also a genius she's a comedic genius yeah she also made that show one of the best shows on TV when it was originally on the air she's always done crazy shit you member when she grabbed a crotch and spit when she did the national anthem and everybody hated her then they went crazy and this is like yeah early 2000 she did this she was always wild but that was why she was so good as a calm that was her appeal she did not give a fuck I'm predictable yeah like just wild and that is like Kinison and it came out of head injuries you know really that's a lot well there was the famous story the guy who I was working in a mine there was an explosion and like rebar went through his brain and they said before he was an Isis gun after that he became they said he became evil he was just an evil person you know after this rebar went through the frame and I mean there's also Providence yeah and the Texas schoolbook depository shooter not wasn't School Book Depository I'm to confess Christ our shooter Texas our shooter had a brain tumor yeah well this is what it was yeah but you also have people who have suffered brain injuries and come out of it being able to speak French yes yes or play piano yes yes they probably have a brain injury suddenly can paint photo realistic paintings yeah yes who I never had any artistic ability before but in the brain injury yeah and it unlocks that well you're all I got was sobriety example how it's amazing though it does happen for real well they don't yeah they can learn it quicker I think I don't think they know it you know it's about knowing it no I mean well the piano I've heard people they they literally could sit down and tell could knew what to do well there's certain things that happen right if people have certain spectrum issues right where they're far better at mathematics if are worse at social interactions there's there's pathways that are more lubed for you to figure things out that aren't as confused by social issues or social stigmas or just normal human communication and I think right as people in history a lot of them a lot of super fucking geniuses are on spectral Einstein didn't speak till he was five Jesus yeah yeah like they thought he was they thought he was he was mentally retarded Wow yeah don't speck when they use that worked it that's right yeah now you can get in trouble yeah when you had the head injury so how much time was it before you felt like did you just stop drinking on the spot yeah it was December 22nd remember Jackie was yeah I want to visit you and and remember it was Hawaii right they were going on no New York New York I was gonna go to no not at a New York Christina Lina to New York we're gonna go to New York for the holidays for Christmas and New Year's my wife is like now you're not because you did this you don't get to go to New York with your with your fam and they went they went by that way but you know but then again Chrissy and I woke up in the ICU and Chrissy and Alena were there and we celebrated Christmas in the eye I see you Wow you know and that was a pivotal moment yeah yeah so you just decided on the spot no more drinking yeah I just said all right I'm gonna think I'm done and Wow and but again I was preparing because I but a few years Erlich likes buddy maybe eight years earlier I tried quitting drinking you told me about this you were talking to me about pot yeah we were talking about you know I gotta stop drinking how far did you yet I went a year and a half without drinking I think that's pretty good yeah right I did I hated but I hated every minute of it really yeah it was like every every day I thought it would be nice to drink every day you just hung in there for a few hundred days yeah yeah but even now like I'll still let go oh yeah I think I do miss the taste of scotch you know you've worked so hard to learn to like it yeah you know and you really like Scott yeah and what what are the positive benefits of not drinking of not drinking you don't hit me that's true that's only positive for you Paul that's true I thought yeah whatever I think the not that that I don't do anything to unknowingly embarrass my daughter if I'm going to embarrass my daughter now it's deliberate right that yeah this mostly just just you know remembering things knowing where I was yeah the night before no I don't drink and I embarrass my son every single day by walking around yes yes being next to them yeah it's like come on dad do you think you are a genetic alcoholic or is this like a learn thing well it's hard to say cuz I mean obviously alcoholism runs in my family how does that just because you know we were raised by a horrible alcoholic do you think it's genetically connections probably Jeannette just predisposition to it yeah I think there's the connections to almost all behavior yeah yeah yeah I don't think you know I'm you know I don't think there's a there's a lot of real free will right yeah I've come to that more and more as I get older I mean I battle with because obviously there are conscious choices you can make and yeah especially when you did you know really make an effort to move into a certain path of the way of the thinking and believing but yeah what's causing that you know how much is life experience you can make conscious efforts to I guess mmm ameliorate the influences of your genes yes but it's like it's like you can you can live healthy eat healthy and avoid risks and and you're still gonna probably die around 110 at best at best if everything goes great yes some new advanced yeah we're going farther than that guy yeah we very well good we very well could I mean I had David Sinclair from Harvard on two weeks ago who's a life extension specialist who some fascinating shit yeah stop those television snapping off remember the the notion because people always talk about you know human lifespan is we used to look to be 40 on air but human lifespan hasn't changed at all since since essentially the beginnings of human beings hasn't changed at all the the oldest possible lifespan is still exactly the same as it was you know yeah you know and as this angel guy it's just more people fewer people are dying young right right more people are living close to their potential and a lot of that is infant mortality if you yeah the actual statistics the reason why it's so low yeah it's not necessarily that no one lived to be 65 back yes yeah babies died yeah thousands of years ago people did live to be over a hundred yeah but back then it's your foot and and died two weeks later yeah you know what I mean yes yeah but maximum human lifespan hasn't changed at all mmm and that's the thing that maybe is going to start changing you exercisable never never ever in your life I mean as a kid I like sports never like go for a hike or anything very rarely very really feel really good I probably would yeah it'll relieve a lot of tension I just mean just a little highlight yeah you know you don't have to do anything crazy ya know I keep meaning especially now that I'm I think not just getting older but the old yes you know what I'm actually old dude we were a young when we met I know our old people know if a kid sees us like oh those old dudes in their 50s yeah we're old dudes yeah I know it's crazy I'm yeah I'm and weird I'm really almost 60 well you know 56 that's almost 16 it is you know it's closing in long yeah and I'm a terrible looking 39 it's true which is good though that gives you longevity in this business that's why Steve Martin looks good because he never looked young jump yeah yeah yeah you could just listen to like books on tape and walk it's great man you know just find a place of like Runyon Canyon just go walk it it's so nice because you can do it at your own pace and it's so good elevates your heart rate without anything crazy now you know if you have to do anything nuts yeah I mean I amaze 11 on the road so I have been doing it on the road but I haven't like started doing like some like light weight lifting and oh great great yeah yeah do you know just hire someone feels good maybe some come over your house and tell you to do it I think that's the way to do it so just make you do it they're there 10 a.m. you oh hi Bob yeah no way yeah yeah mmm get some hot russian lady yells at you that sounds great great there now there's my next divorce are you still doing stand-up I know you're doing stand-up little bit you know what I am gonna do again no okay go all right last one all right stop stop okay stop no I stopped doing stand-up once you got the television oh yeah yeah I love that guy I don't see him enough it's it's cool to see you two guys together it is you know cuz that's I don't want to say it's a lifetime ago there's a lifetime one but those are in your 20s 30s oh yeah I mean I was a totally different human being yeah I was 27 you were 100% what's yeah yeah yeah I was crazy I was I was completely insane what what where was the switch for you well I got older and wiser and realized how fucking stupid it was but also I was only a few years removed from fighting you know when I first started doing news radio it was only like five years removed from my last fight and I still was sparring so still getting hit in the head a lot would you like come into work with a what the face full of bruises no not that bad I started doing jujitsu somewhere around Newsradio to around 96 so that was like I stopped really kickboxing very much after that and then I think I stopped entirely when I was like thirty I just realized like this is gotta stop I gotta stop doing this so you weren't smore you like this fit guy that just left it all behind or always did you always keep it up I work out for sanity I've always worked out for Sam you know a lot of people do that I need it you know for whatever it is and also like my personality was sort of forged by having these moments of clarity after extreme exertion you know that was my person I was formed that way like if I had a problem if I had something that I was dealing with I would just blow it out at the gym and then I'd have a better look at it and probably wind up calling someone in apologizing or so no interesting so it's like a rush of oxygen to the brain yeah well Russ a rush of oxygen in the brain and maybe even more important more important that a draining of excess energy right because I think once you if you develop a certain way like I did martial arts literally most of my adult life and growing life up into that point and so my my body had sort of developed with this need for that exertion in order to have clarity and so I just I'm like this is my formula I'm sticking with it so I never let it go it's amazing that you did stick that you've never gone away from that I can't that's I want if I don't think right I don't think right I think wait I think so much better when I exercise I mean there's no comparison it's like a pill I did this sober October fitness challenge things with my friends in October and we went crazy we were working out like three hours a day because we were wearing these heart monitors and one of the things that I read because we're trying to like get a certain score and whoever got the highest score one one of the things that I recognized from that was that the more I did in terms of cardio especially the less things bothered me there were more clarity I had the more peaceful I felt the more at ease I felt no more no internal chatter you know I just think for what everybody's is their own biological makeup and for me my BOB my biological makeup is entirely just gonna get all the health benefits from it is no benefits are giant but for me it's up my mind actually yeah you know a friend of mine said that sitting is the new smoking you think we say that does that does that made for you it's a compression of your your discs for sure especially your lower back and if you don't have a good posture it's not good yeah you can mitigate it with exercise you know just gotta make sure that you don't only sit you know stretch yourself out take a yoga class I'm liking this I should be writing this down seriously no do you do any exercise I'm I'm starting more I I found out if it's hilarious I would like have kind of I had a Gulf back injury type thing coughs like we swing that fucker this long it's hard it's hard on your back so I go I go to the doctor and x-rays me and I got frickin scoliosis that I never knew oh why all my life yeah I want the bottom of my spine yeah do about that laugh at me by the way I'm in there with my wife Jackie well he brings in the ex x-rays put them up on the thing goes hey buddy you got scoliosis and she bursts out laughing now everything says that's why you walk that way for real oh that's hilarious every school at some point had one the one hot girl with scoliosis who had the headgear I go oh she didn't have that headgear and she's really hot they had to have headgear for scoliosis yes he tried to strata no neck and head men like metal rods yeah I thought that was a broken neurosis that's a neck hey Vera girl whole chest thing yes yeah is like a big plastic best she had to wear to keep her like spine street kid wears like 2 years or something you know work sure I guess I mean she didn't stay in touch what do they do with it my sketches she you know is still the same thing I had a meeting with the specialist yeah and he's like well I like operating on people I like when they're asleep but you know you could do some exercises and some you know physical therapy and stuff to alleviate it yeah if it gets so bad down the road I could maybe help you out with some rods so there you went in there because there was an initial issue I had I had like issues when I was young when I used to do like track and field and stuff I would get like a pain in an area mm-hmm and then it kind of went away most of my life then I started golfing and then I golf more and more and then one day I didn't wore him up I did I did a twist and it just frickin yeah mmm and it was almost certain smack and I went and it was like you've always had this condition but there's a picture of Paul there you go I know I look terrible in that part that's a strange level foul that's hilarious that's like what's going on this dick that's like an ER let's like text getting constricted second that's that's something they'd wear on its loose the costume from TLC yeah it is androgynous phase yeah yeah they said I just got to suck it up and exercise and get a strong core and I should be fine take yoga that's like I got to do that that's like keep hearing for old people all the time yeah did you just start as an old person no I was younger and then I didn't do it seriously until about three four years ago then I stood now do it because you always martial art yeah and obviously that yoga was for people that just were too lazy for martial arts no yoga's Yoga does some things that really enhance martial arts yeah hot yoga guy yeah I like that stuff yeah liked it that seems like torture to me it is a little bit torture but it's really good for you because your body produces heat shock proteins that are similar to when you go into a sauna feels great when you come out of there you feel great but it's also really good for inflammation just the act of doing it in itself in the extreme heat like sauna would be amazing for you too for that reason yeah when heat shock but this woman named dr. Rhonda Patrick that's a regular on the show I have her on all the time and she's genius but she's a huge believer in sauna and they did a study and I was like Sweden or some shit where they took people with regular sauna use versus not and the regular sauna use had a 40% decrease in all cause mortality heart attack stroke cancer yes because your when your regular using it 20 minutes a day for four days a week what they're sent essentially saying is that your body producing those heat shock proteins and those cytokines 20 minutes see okay no no heat heat sauna just saw me just suddenly sitting in a sauna going in a sauna out here sit in the sauna 20 minutes that just doing that is because almost all ailments and issues and deal with inflammation yeah well I that's I I have to pinch nerves right now and like herniated discs and and they were like I was like like on the couch for like two months cousins that from your injury no I don't I don't think it was I don't know what it was from but it was a man and made him but it was like one day it just started my arm my arm started hurting and you're talking pointed towards your neck yeah it's like somewhere in here her need this so that makes sense yes yeah that's your lower back but the arm her two months my arm oh my arm my entire arm felt like it was going to explode mm-hmm I felt like there was this pressure building up in it and it was literally like like it was gonna explode and and I was getting like one of the kind of the shots you get when you're having a pepid or I was getting a turtle shots that we're doing nothing I was taking 16 advil a day take that yeah and I was getting no pain relief all and then I started using CBD ah and like that it was gone amazing like and even now is like you know I couldn't I couldn't do in it for two solid months I couldn't get off the couch CBDs incredible yeah I use that so so much yes I got that rubbing stuff that's great to it and it makes it better for about two days my friend Hans though he told me he has a shortage recent shoulder surgery and he said everybody likes to use the rub stop but you really should take it with the edible stuff like oil oral CBD and rub stuff works together smoking again I started I had the Kirino just I have a pop a pill yeah I agree know that I grew up and then I started using the tincture with it mhm we have some here if you want some yeah see there case in the back that that case is given to us by Spade weed yeah that big chest chest a lot of marijuana that's a lot of ways crazy and here's the thing try starting on the tincture along with the the cream yes my arthritis went away - yeah yeah this finger stuff meant yeah good I couldn't bend my hand Wow yeah and it's like that's gone my inflammation yeah the knee my arthritis my knee is completely gone it'll go away even further if you cut out sugar yeah I did that and I felt fantastic yeah sugar was gone crazy right mm-hmm pours in ourselves our whole lives that's a poison yeah yeah absolutely that's the one thing when I quit drinking I wanted more sugar Oh in effect cuz I've never had a sweet tooth really but one thing when I quit drinking I suddenly was craving the ketone glut of course yeah makes sense I should go back to zero sugar I went zero sugar for a while and it felt amazing though I'm just like little tiny bits here and there do you do zero I do I had dessert Saturday night I had a big old cake with ice cream on dinner so no checker I went on a date with the wife at Mastro's we have this fat steak and then I got this butter cake with ice cream and all sounds great so how do you say no to that that sounds amazing and occasionally you got to say fuck it yeah yeah yeah but I just for the most part I'm on like an 8020 diet 80% of it is super healthy and then the 20% is occasionally off yeah yeah I've seen that that too 2 & 5 fasting mmm yeah where are you two days a week you do like 600 calories yeah mmm the rest the week you can do whatever you want I'm on the seven and zere seven pick out I I do intermittent fasting so every night if I you know have dinner at 7:00 p.m. you know I don't eat anything for 16 hours you know once you're at Passover and yeah like my cholesterol just dropped through the floor yeah when I when I did that but I have been doing it lately ya know boys we just did three hours oh my god we do this more often this is our only our second podcast ever not it's crazy yeah and I'm in much better shape this time yeah great man everything's wonderful yeah um tell people the name of your podcast Adam yeah it reads says don't say with Paul and Dave yeah so once you get there be warned it don't say kala Dave but we can't put that in print um give away your Instagram handle I am Twitter all Greenberg one that's ERG and I'm going to stay Foley on Instagram and I'm David David Davis Foley on Twitter and our show is don't say with Alton Alton name Dave mm-hmm and you know it and and and if I've done this wrong and Dave you go then you can just use another web search in your own and maybe not have everything spoon-fed to you right yes together do some work for once yeah all right beautiful thank you guys what's why exhales you're having us that was great thank you yeah that was great I was really fun thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
