let me find my way ever sign the waiver before I we're live great while you sent that sound great I'm glad that people are seeing me Neal Brennan sighs Whitman everyone will be a notary notary public I wonder if they can live there's a software they can listen to the sound your pen is making and figure out the lines you're drawing you know they have technology now where when people are speaking in a room with a with a window they get rid of the window noise they can know they can tune in to the vibrations of the window from the sound of your voice and pick up everything that's being said in the room I heard that there's a net flick you because before I mean efflux doesn't give people ratings but there's a way that there you can get they can gauge reflections off of with some weird fucking technology where and it's fairly accurate reflections off a window yes I don't know secondhand yeah like second it not it's like I believe it's sound waves oh wow yeah that what are they monitoring Jamie's got some I have no idea why this right now Jamie long-range laser listening device the long-range laser listening device laser microscope is a highly sophisticated surveillance apparatus that utilizes an invisible infrared laser beam to eavesdrop on a target this is the most effective long-range laser listening device in the world that allows the operator to conduct an undetectable surveillance operation on any target from today Stark Industries with at least one window at an impressive distance of over 500 meters that is actually very enough so far that's far as shit with the laser beam fuck and you just buy that as I say that's commercially available and I wonder what is not commercially available oh for sure it's right out there like you remember when there was that story about some weird sound weapon they think that the Cubans using on ya means that were in Cuba there's probably a bunch of shit like I was reading an article they can list like submarines have technology they can listen to basically like fish farting in the ocean if they if they wanted to they can hear sound that quiet they can hear anything so if like literally a fish farts they're like what was that what was that was that a sub nope was a fish Wow who was the next sound yeah good for us or something I guess it's for somebody good for us I guess yeah that sound thing was funny cuz it was like people would get sick yeah and they could and then it there was also they did in China too they would like they at American civil like NGO like non-government there like kind of work for the government tangentially or they worked at the Embassy there apartments were above each other to separate people and both of them it was on 60 minutes like not long ago like so they targeted the rooms yeah it's like a dog whistle for people it yes in essence and it's like well what do you want me to do I guess you just leave I guess it is like a dog was just want you to feel just sure yeah duh fuck out of here oh yeah there's probably a ton of technology like that that we're not aware of my friend Mike Swick used to fighting you have seen before that he did a brief spent stint rather in the military he was doing something some sort of easy it was either Secret Service work or something along those lines but anyway he was at the Embassy in Russia and he said that they had found listening devices that were so sophisticated that they were being powered by the natural sway of the building Wow with the wind so the wind they didn't need a power source the natural swaying of the building in the wind was powering up this little microphone that was listening in on things and he said they were lit they were looking at this stuff they're like we don't know anything like this like this yes completely new stuff and that we found it and yet building I like I mean I don't love but it's like it's kind of cool it's cool yeah like I just don't kill me or us you don't even like the hope is we just boat would they have their thing and we and it's just like mutually assured destruction like a arms race of Technology because that's what's gonna happen the amount to use the cloud yes I I know like I don't use it for important stuff yeah but I use it for like my apps yeah my apps are backed up in the cloud recordings are backed up in the cloud sets sets yeah but there's like no photos or video it's just a bit like I don't know man the kids fucking crazy I mean we're we're we're getting down to some very strange place with the cloud what stuff B yes in the air and the amount of trust it takes the presumption that will just never run out of energy mm-hmm and will never run out of the ability to tap it in the cloud it's like I don't that seems presumption I I'm not even like a doomsday person but I just feel like it's like the difference between how men dress in public and how women do it and like on AB night out women are wearing heels and guys are dressed in case they have to fight I'm still like we will do the thing in the mirror like yeah I'll fucking fuck you like that's how I feel with technology where I'm like what do I have a back-up plan for this even people with like Wi-Fi door locks I'm like I don't know man no no no man I don't know if the Wi-Fi goes out what yeah like please be care I don't I don't know what the what the negative scenario is but even my garage in my place and I live in like a townhouse thing and there was a power outage the gate won't open and like oh there's no really there was a fails there was a release that somebody a better person than I figured come I didn't have a good plan but someone figured out like you'll open a hatch and then there's a chain and you got to pull the chain and it was like okay but it wasn't it wasn't easy right like you know it's the Doomsday thing it's like well this guy yes guys been on my show several times he's just done recently and he's one of the main proponents of this theory that something somewhere around twelve thousand eight hundred years ago hit the earth and fucked up everything and probably reset civilization killed off the vast majority of us 12,000 miles not that one yeah that long ago corresponds at the end of the Ice Age there's a lot of physical evidence for it and increasingly we're seeing more and more evidence in terms of ancient cultures that existed far before - twelve thousand eight hundred years ago they really didn't understand they thought people were just hunter-gatherers back then now they're finding evidence of things like it's a place called gobekli tepe which is a giant these huge monolithic structures that are made out of stone carved like the huge columns yeah that don't seem like they were made by hunter-gatherers it seems like there was probably some sort of a lost civilization and they know that this all happened somewhere around that time somewhere around 12,000 years ago so it can happen again and if it does happen again our stuff is on digital now which is even weirder it's it's weirder than books right we have books but the vast majority of most of the data that we all keep and share we share on phones and on computers yeah and we can't read it we can't read it without program I don't know first thing about commitment you don't I mean like I don't know anything about I was I was talking last night like I don't know much about my the different the the level of education women have about their reproductive organs versus men oh yeah like my my balls I know about my balls I know the medical term is testicles hmm that's about it don't you know hot yeah again that's like that's like a child and you only know that from like Oh cuz I got them hot one time right but I don't know how semen gets to the I don't know the name of the two I don't know anything cuz that's my body right women know tons they know fallopian tubes will evolve cervix like everything yeah guys know prostate cancer home what my asshole oh yeah I'm not curious I mean like not like curious in a way of like I let's just hope just hope for those it's none of my business plus to get checked out you have to have finger in your ass and everybody puts that off yeah now meanwhile women do that once he constantly getting jabbed out and swab swab yeah they get the pap smear a smear smear see in the title oh Jesus just everything imagine if you needed people to come inside you you needed them to not just not just exchange bodily fluids by kissing now they have to squirt something in you to make people yeah stepheson god they're poisonous little dirty DNA they're dirty little fucking infected it's awfully gross baby get like ten feet away from it you're like Jesus know what they're doing but why you're in the moment it seems like the most logical you got to do it cannot do it yeah did you what speaking of that did you see the thing about Jerrod no that I don't want to bring it up but he basically came out a little on HBO came out came out a little to his mom said I've had sexual experiences with men oh and it's good we should cool with it yeah sure what's going yeah I think when I Bieber like what do you think I'm like I don't that sexual preference at this point to me is about as interesting as like your workout region like I just don't care like what are you doing there you go cool no what I care about are you funny are you funny and are you cool yeah and and like do we have shit to talk about right great yeah I don't I couldn't care less who's what type a hand you like jerk and yeah you know I mean like I think what kind of a mouth with some guys with like Tim Dylan I think it's an advantage with his act that he's gay yes he's so ridiculous and over-the-top and he's like big fat gay guy yeah but he doesn't really talk to other you talk about ever talk about it sometimes yeah but I mean you know it's not a big deal to him he treats it the way a guy treats his sexuality like you don't have to go blaring through the streets that you're straight all the time like you are I usually assume you're really not right right there's no yeah there's straight you're straight yeah if you're not no one fucking cares in the comedy community literally no one cares yeah it doesn't it makes any difference so the only thing that bums me out when guys hide it it's like calm does it bum you out for them or you for them yeah I'd really boast but having said that I get it I get it like it's a real bummer it's sad we know you know the few guys that are in the closet it's you just feel bad for them like Zach like yeah man I hope it's not unbearable right you know domain like like I get while you're why you're in the closet I get why actors in the closet like especially male actors like because it doesn't serve them to come out it's not gonna it's not gonna help them I think it's the worst thing for them in terms of like getting roles as a heterosexual mm-hmm if you're a known homosexual you almost can't get roles as a heterosexual yeah I remember there was some who is what is that guy's name Neil Patrick Harris he was in something where he played like this arrogant guy who likes girls he was in know with well no we and know it was on to uh how I Met Your Mother yeah and that worked he also played a straight guy in gone girl pretty well yeah was that before or it was at a both been after really and I was out cuz I said I was surprised that that's what he played but like certain people they just I don't know he might be the only guy that I agree that like he came out and it's not then he's he you buy it somehow as a romantic lead you think that it's like it cancels that out like if Tom Cruise decided to come out if Tom Cruise is gay and he decided to come out like that would be a real problem you know what I was talking to somebody about this the other day you know would be a hilarious movie idea gay couple caught Tom Cruise and John Travolta John Travolta gets kidnapped and gay Tom Cruise has to save his gay husband John Travolta and but other than that it's a real action movie it's just gay I like it would that be fucking cool like you like just a straight gay if anyone out there's a screenwriter that have at it cuz I'm never gonna write it with that fly would people enjoy that like if it was really good like John wick style I think it would I really think it would if it was if the guy just kick it's not like gay guys are like a feat in the fan I know like rough gay guys it'll whoop your ass laughs bro bears bro they gotta pick up their own growl that's how fucking bad these guys are yeah I do really it would be fucking so cool like he was gonna yet cuz that's how I feel with someone like drunk um and I'm like I don't care okay I know it's never come up we we've been good friends for a decade just never came up yeah my kid he didn't seem that interested in women but I don't also don't think he's not introduced just maybe a little there's definitely a spectrum right and people are just yeah and that's fine too yeah yeah I'm also not mad like if I were on the spectrum I think I would absolutely do it yeah I'm just not on the spectrum like I but any type of opportunity there's a lot of nights a year Joe oh yeah there's 365 nights a year oh yeah you could you're not gonna do the pussy yeah say man I spun it up dammit I had the best joke about that he goes he goes I he goes this is how little I give a fuck he goes I wish I was gay just so I could come out yes I wish I wish I had a secret like that yeah that's a little I give a fuck it's like it's joke about I'm gaining weight for a movie I don't know what the movie is yet but yeah but yeah gay action we would fantastic I like it I don't he'll I within a year or two people would be definitely ready for it I if it were a legit good action movie yeah I think they'd be if it were Tom Hart even if maybe if they were both one of them was straight and one of them is Tom Hardy and he just plays gay and like he it's it's taken but it doesn't have to be two gay guys could be even crazier two straight guys who have to make out yeah they could be played by two straight guys absolutely then we're right now we're talking now we're really talking now you're talkin no commitment because I was thinking about do wimp if Tom Cruise was gay right and he just came out and there's a movie where yes to save his wife would women not believe it junetta main like yes like so if you come out so it's like alright so now in the next mission impossible they just kidnapped his husband yeah well for sure you could do that with lesbians if you had two hot lesbians oh yeah of course hundred percent yeah no there's no issue that would be no problem there'd be no resistance and that's the difference between a lesbian actress they can go a woman who's a lesbian you know why I believe gay straight because there's a big portion of men who never truly believe a lesbian I have a bit about it yeah I had a bit about from one of my old specials it's like we believe that you believe you're a lesbian yeah but you just ain't got a piece of this we stick yet you never spent a Saturday with million Apple bees I hate you with an Applebee's and the bar corner bar forget it the panty-dropper tequila shots when he got Brokeback Mountain yeah it wasn't really an action though I know for sure that both of those guys are not gay we do not we us I mean Jake Gyllenhaal straight and you say so Heath Ledger but you saw that movie house tree I mean come on man you saw he thought you believed it jack know what's that good an actor definitely crazy there's no way he could play crazy that guy's definitely gay trust me I know things I've seen many movies and understand them I know when someone's acting and someone's just yeah hey a fucking kid yeah that was easy for him ya know it would be that but running around yeah that could happen that could I think that could happen I think we're on the verge of that I would enjoy it I'm happy for it because then people stop getting free passes where you're goofy but you're gay so we let you slide with right silly behavior like no no no no I want equality I want you me to be able to call you a dunce and not have to worry about being homophobic and no one hears gay dunce right when you say yous guys a fucking dummy dunce yeah I got you're homophobic yeah oh my god oh my god yeah it's the that's how it would go at the Comedy Cellar like just like this fucking dunce down here it would count did I hear that the Comedy Cellar is like seriously has a social justice warrior infestation they need to like spray the place oh I don't I mean when I've been there and hasn't been like that I mean they've been there been people writing about it they're been Reming it's like the comedy sellers like the main hub um culture now it's a hub of wellness I mean it but it's also like the the main battlefield of wilderness where it's like Lily came and they were protesters and then I couldn't sit at the table and I because it's like my right I mean I don't think it's pull your dick out yeah I told Louie to pull it dick out and she was a hero I was I was quoting all these tweets that were talking about it and articles were written hero she was heroic I think that I think someone sent me a Louie article today I think there's just fatigue at this point yes I think people are just like taught like what's he I don't okay like try to find a new stormy Daniels article yeah everybody's like enough yeah it's right we thought it was gonna work it didn't yeah fuck he doesn't care she Justin Martindale was and I'll never forget he's in the fucking hallway of the college store as flamboyant as he could ever be yeah and he goes that's our Monica Lewinsky she's gonna take him down I'm like good luck stormy Daniel yeah I'm like good luck I ain't gonna do shit yeah so what's the worst thing that comes out of this that he fucked her or they paid her to keep quiet and she didn't keep quiet what's the worst thing do we think he doesn't fuck yeah it's all different strains I'm like we knew he was gross no one cared the only way that wheel it goes even raises taxes yeah or then he'll lose his base or you raise the taxes on lower middle class people and if he if he like doesn't stand by his abortion stuff but otherwise all the donors are sticking with them everyone sticking with them what happened yesterday there was a new abortion ruling was in an Alabama yes that it basically outlawed I personally believe it's gonna backfire you think so yeah because I think people the thing that that's always been true was Republicans were against abortion and they would go like we and they'd never got to repeal it right but I think they're gonna repeal it and then people are gonna go like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is crazy if you don't want to get abortions fine but you can't change a law based on a lot of times not even a plurality of you know like in general elections like in the general presidential election like it's not even the majority the country that elects the president now what it who vote it was just something that the people of Alabama being now it's the it's the government like that the state legislation yeah and it's like you're going you're doing ninety-nine years in jail if you know if you give an abortion or that one yeah that's what it is now yeah that's what it's gonna judge the law that they passed I just personally believe that I mean I'm obviously hopeful but it's a bit like now that's too far it's a bit like when they made Clinton testify and people are like yeah that was - that was like the the the - too far a line was crossed when they made Clinton testify about his sex life and it was like hmm we don't like that we understand that you wanted to reduce the guy but don't make the press and I feel like I'm hoping and I believe it's true that it will be too far afield for moderate people I hope you're right and it's just it's very dangerous when you just decide that no one can do it anymore based on a few people's decision mm-hmm that is going to affect the millions of people that live in Alabama well laws are odd because it it's the assumption is the reason Christians want to outlaw it is because they think God is gonna say what's with your vote on that I saw that you voted for abortion what like you want to kill babies yes so you want to kill babies like well not and I didn't kill any babies yeah but you voted for it's like they don't want to live in a country where that's legal having said that if you googled the worldwide rights of abortion it's not legal everywhere which surprised me because I was like where is it what is America's where do we stand within the rest of the world and there are not a ton of countries but there's an there's I think it's illegal in a quarter of the world Wow if not more well Borgia is one of those things where it's like okay when does it bother you doesn't bother me at all if you're two days pregnant doesn't bother me at all it bothers me a little of your four months pregnant bothers me a lot if you're five or six bothers me a lot if you look really pregnant you get an abortion it's like what it what is that is that a baby that would be viable outside the womb because it's one of those it's it's something that people just have a deep discomfort about when discussing even if you're a supporter of it if you just discuss the actual reality of what it is what the Act is what this surgical procedure is and it makes you know it's not it's not nothing that's not not forever like and and I think that one of the indicators it's not nothing and I'm Pro pro-choice design yeah like your right wing Jo everybody knows that so I'm so far right I go the other way and left the back side the I actually do want to talk about that the the presumption about you that you know the one of the indicators is when people talk about even getting an abortion they are they always whispering this stigma or things because they it's kind of not nothing yeah it's a it's a personal thing to I don't think they want to discuss it with other folks but I wouldn't care if you got it if I got a cyst removed I mean if that's the indication just yeah if it's just a medical procedure and again pro-choice have at it yeah I'm sure I've never I don't I haven't had any abortions that I know of but I don't I don't know at what point I would be like ah and these attitudes about it about the taboo of discussing it though and impedes rational discourse it impedes your ability to talk about things and communicate about them because you have to have this very rigid opinion that you're always pro-abortion Pro women's rights woman's right to choose which I am it it but we're still talking about a real thing and that real thing is killing a thing that would grow up to be a person and that's why people freaked out about it and to pretend otherwise yes just disingenuous Louie was the first one I heard to talk about that on stage and in a way that was funny we're like if they think they're bird he's down there yeah I'd protest - yeah if I thought they were if there was a place that I thought these people are murdering babies right I'm out there every day yeah he's like I don't care I personally think they are murdering babies I don't care got in trouble and yeah this is one of the things like when like that parkland joke that he did I was like that's not his best joke but it's also he's working it out yeah doesn't stand up in ten fucking months he's working it out but if you say that he's different now we're getting to see the real Louie like bitch you better go through his library yeah that's what he did yeah the purpose is like his ninth most offensive joke yeah not even close he's he's that's what he does it's called comedy yeah the idea was like well but we didn't know he was he didn't know him you assume what you believed what he fed or you wanted to believe I actually I have a theory that one of the reasons people like the New York Times and and and other media outlets got brought the hammer down so hard on him is because they'd heard the rumors and ignored them so now they have to signal that like this is wrong because there were rumors before right and they were like we don't like they would they ignored them so now they have to overcompensate be like he is absolutely he's the face of hypocrisy and evil okay well he just caught it at the worst time yeah exactly yeah he just says that's a bad he had beachfront property during a tart you got the deep stilts not the fucker yeah like he had such ones your flat here's what I want to talk about with you the idea because whenever I tell people we're friends or that I go on your show they're like how can I'm like first of all cuz you're a fuckin good dude and have been a good dude for 27 years that I know of to me make you it doesn't mean you're always good whatever you're always good to do it every time I said whatever I don't fuckin know your life I don't know what you do outside of fuckin Encino the and now the next question becomes why do you have cranks on what people would consider cranks on the show and you and I have talked about this a little bit off the show explain because you are basically liberal yes but you believe in having hardcore right-wing people on because you like them personally or you like you believe it's worth some of them I like personally so it's worth having a conversation like ben shapiro was one that had a long conversation with he's one of the more controversial guys that i'm on but people get upset at me and call me an alt writer meanwhile he's been attacked by the alt-right you know I mean he wears a yarmulke for Christ's sake he's not all right it's not a white supremacist by any stretch of the imagination he was the number one target for anti-semitic remarks in the entire world the 2016 but we had a in-depth conversation a very long one about gay people yeah cuz he's I saw a little bit of it where he was like he kind of didn't he kind of got a little lost well yeah because it doesn't well he had two different take here's like David Parkman had an interesting take on it Pakman said that if you look at his explanation cuz I asked him a couple things I'm like do you really believe that Moses part of the Red Sea and he said I would look for more naturalistic explanation for that but then when I talked to him about gay people and gay things he wasn't exactly in a naturalistic explanation and he also wasn't interested in giving people the ability to do whatever they want he felt like you're not you're supposed to resist that and his take is that like you you have an urge to murder people but you don't do it because you're a good person and you should do the same thing with being gay and I was like wow that's a crazy that's crazy mental gymnastics so that is a naturally natural occurring thing that God is testing you with I mean I'm putting work as many I think but essentially that's his position his position is that God doesn't want you to do that it's in the Bible he doesn't do it I mean he goes hard yeah he doesn't use electricity and the Sabbath till the Sun Goes Down the whole deal yeah and you know a lot of people like you know you giving this guy a platform like look I'm communicating with someone and I like him as a person he's a very nice guy I don't agree with him at all about that about the game you believe it's worth giving people a platform but it should see well I'm not flattered but like I think that's a real problem that's discussing things like that like giving people a platform yeah because we're living in this world of D platform yeah people I think that's inherently dangerous and I think that just stopping people from their ability to communicate just makes more pressure on their side it makes more people that are on the fence support them because I see you as being a censor and that's why I think we found out with Jack from Twitter of Jack Dorsey when he came on and talked to me about it and when he brought vid John who's the lawyer and you know like censoring one is censoring all sort of it's not smart it's it's not good it does the opposite of what are you intended to do it makes the other side magnified it makes whoever you're censoring more popular and makes them an underdog and it also goes against core American values like the freedom of speech and I know that these are private institutions and I know that they're not necessarily forced to uphold what we determine as free speech in terms of like how it's written in the Constitution in the Bill of Rights I get I understand that but I think that the principles of human interaction on this planet are largely dictated by our ability to discuss things even if you disagree I actually do agree with you that that the I think like deep platforming and silencing and he's a danger I don't there are very few people that well there's no one that I agree with 100% of the time right including yourself yes including your joke about like you don't agree with yourself like I don't I don't like real yeah well that's also there's something Buddhist about it which is like your thoughts are not correct right they're not even your thoughts they're just like pendant upon your ocean sometimes yes their dependence upon your stress levels yeah you know sometimes you just like your you just don't have it in you like stop yeah other times the same situation you'd be super calm and reasonable and maybe you could turn it around yeah if you've eaten yeah like the I think yesterday doctors are worse in the afternoon judges are worse I've heard search before we get surgeries in them yeah yeah so - you're right wait I think the right wing thing is just an easy way to dismiss me because I'm not right wing if you ask me my positions on things it's very left-wing yeah the only thing that I very with the orthodoxy is with the Second Amendment with gun rights I don't think it's that simple I know a lot of really good people that have guns and I know a lot of really good people that never shoot anybody that have guns to protect themselves yeah and to label everyone the same is just like labeling everyone who drives a car the same as those in cells that drove into people in Montreal or were that it was it was at Toronto wherever that was yeah it's we have a real problem labeling people and labeling people with it's lazy and it's in attempt to marginalize or dismiss their positions and it also feels good yeah to do it it feels good to like I guess what writing them off I'm superior I have a very clear moral view mhm I'm taking out one of my moral paintbrushes Jones ooh you are that mean even if it's not a moral position even if like that Neal Brennan he's such a left-wing cuck yeah he's this into that and boom there you go I got him in a box I'm gonna put a ribbon on it yep ship him off so you've read the comments yes when I'm on the canceled you're canceled I hear yeah that so I brought up that makeup boy and the makeup of my daughter's in Lovelace she washes his makeup one tube and now he's been canceled I understand he lost three millionaire and she's she was telling me to have an eleven-year-old sit down and tell you about a gay makeup artist and this is the funny part she goes well there was a couple things okay so there was the thing with he has a friend who and he tells me this woman's name who got him into the business and then she asked him to promote her hair stuff but he said no and he went with another hair stuff so he totally totally betrayed her all right it's like 11 year olds telling me this and then this was the best part she goes there was also some talk that you know he is gay and there was boys that were not gay and he tried to get them to be in a room with him it's like listening to an 11 year old tell me more by the way that also could have been how that's how that's the tone of the internet anyway as an 11 year old girl at least it came from an eleven year girl instead of like so-and-so's cancelled like yeah no you're a fucking 44 don't go why are you talking like a little girl you're on a fuck you're on BuzzFeed you're on Fox like it's in the point where the New York Times is gonna be doing that like did sit close to it now I mean I think that Alabama oh it's abortion people yeah what it is is the media right now especially journalism they're fucking starving for hits it's just so hard to make money it's so hard it's so they're drowning yeah and so they're trying to grab whatever branches they can yeah they gotta make a good story with a clickbait ii title fuck it behind deceptive title who gives a shit yeah we got a good store that story's vetted yeah and even if it's not totally vetted if it's a little slippery but that you can make an amendment later you know I'm sorry we need a little bit of apology and we have to make a retraction yeah let me read those goddamn retractions know you should have to have a retract if you if you fuck up so hardcore that you attribute a crime to someone or you do something like that and make it a retraction it should be on the front page your paper and nothing else for a month yeah that's it this is your newspaper name I'm sorry we don't get to tell you the news anymore by the way fuck this up so hard that we printed out to millions of people you have to just put in a little column in the corner yeah we'd like to apologize my month also 9/11 half planes run into the World Trade Center and too hard to be a journalist man well that's what I this is what another day I wanted which is absolute meaning if you believe like I still believe in like institutional journalists I believe in New Times I believe in as well Washington Post like so and you use the fact that they wrote about a UFC fight they just said he was bloody and earlier he wasn't just a bad very bad description it was very inaccurate I'm like why would you do that you guys are crazy that the New York Times is allowing this yeah completely an accurate description of something that millions of people yeah it's so silly and it makes everybody question everything else you say and you might think it's trivial because it's just a boxing match but it's completely inaccurate yeah and completely exaggerating what actually went down well if you you've had articles written about you they fuck up everything yeah every but now having said that we can't dismiss all the dirt like there needs to be an absolute kind of an absolute truth and that's what I feel like is sort of melting in this era of anyone goes like well they said this and that's not true so everything else they say is fucking bullshit right of course which I think the the Trump does a lot and I think people are all too happy to believe it because they resent institutions they resent these smartypants motherfuckers which I also get I get the impulse I just don't think New York Times right yes a smartness the old gray lady yeah and it's like it just plays on every stereotype like there are so many stereotypes at work that can make you write it off I think we're in a transitionary period that's what I think I think what do you think it gets replaced by them that's the real problem the real problem is they they have all their pieces all the best journalists right all the best people are all locked into two ancient systems one ancient system is print medium the other ancient system is broadcast medium the broadcast medium the ancient product part of it is it has to go on at a certain time Tuesdays at 8:00 p.m. and then you have to sit there and wait for the commercials unless you DVR it right so that's inherently flawed and then the print medium well they figured out a way to get it on your laptop and your phone now so okay they've got a little bit of a workaround there but they have a really hard time getting people to sign up for digital subscriptions is the distributions not nearly as good as it used to be yeah it's hard it's hard to get people to buy newspapers but at least they've they've got their foot in the door with click titles like the times in the poster yeah are pretty successful online they're actually doing much better because of President Trump yeah because he talks so much shit about them the people actually said I need to see what the New York Times what is it well the yeah because they're like fuck man this guy's child yeah that's yeah responsible he's trying to match how I think you might have with abortion where it's like oh wait whoa I don't even want to get it but if you if this is where you motherfuckers we're headed because they were being held back it was like motherfucker I'll fuck you up and then they got free and now they're beating the shit out of abortion people like whoa accidental pregnancies are the real problem it's not even I mean obviously abortion is a solution right if you have to if you want to do it but if the accidental pregnancy is the real fuckin problem like it should be it's one of the things that I talked about with Jesse Itzel who was on the other day we're talking about genetic engineering so like they're gonna eventually one day move away from sex for procreation and sex is just gonna be for fun she's gonna people bonding and joining each other's bodies that's not gonna be how we procreate we're gonna we're going to procreate through some sort of you like cause it'll certainly drastically reduce the amount of people that have kids you know but what he said is everyone do you freeze your eggs and like give sperm I don't know how they're gonna do it I don't know how they're gonna do it I mean I think there's also the problem that the baby supposedly bonds inside the mother's body like to have a baby grow up in some sort of a fucking weird electronic womb and then you make that kid a fucking sociopath Brian no connection to people when he's born doesn't give a fuck just so it'll be yeah I mean there was that test-tube baby thing which I think started before me but I remember that being an insult they put the bot but the baby in the block yeah they put the embryos in the person's body and there is the thing of surrogates yes so they who'd of a bond life that's a weird one man like that's that's the Kim Kardashian way now yeah and she's having a bunch of babies with surrogates like you know you show up for the wedding or that you show up for the birth and a fucking tight skirt and like yeah my baby I'm born today like what what you're you have your clothes on yeah it was happening here yeah I think now she's I got I hired some my friend I got a girl on it my friend actually did that he's gay and he and his husband they they mix their sperm they shot it in Turkey based or something into some gal I might even follow science too tight anyway she got pregnant their surrogate got pregnant had the baby and decided to keep it decided she couldn't part with it and it's their baby so it's their DNA and mixed with hers and she decided to keep it and she got away with it did they sue her they just were like oh I don't know I didn't want to push they were very upset and then upon they wound up getting another surrogate and then having a child and everything worked out was quite a while ago yeah but they were really bummed out man I mean they were ready to be parents but then you know some people say well they were never gonna be parents in the first place because we're good no didn't even have sex with her right but it is their baby right it's their DNA that meant that but it's not they didn't adopt a child right they chose to have a surrogate so ya know it's complicated and it's getting well that's the thing of like it feels like the level of danger and difficulty in the world its just getting steeper by the day we're like wait what and then there's always global warming you're like oh fuck do you see a fucking the science guy Bill Nye going crazy screaming when he was on Oliver oh yeah the planets on fucking fire and yeah a little silly yeah I know all right no I saw the thing that an TARDIS is like 84 degrees oh my god it's on fire I mean yeah yeah do you really see something yeah it was 85 yeah something in the art circles 84 degrees playing three days ago fuck that what it's gonna be a it's gonna be do you ever think about like global warming but really what it will look like like in 70 years what it will do to the art like and I'm not talking about just Miami's gone or any that's like incredibly like crazy to think about it's not available those Miami people they're gonna move other places and ruin that's probably the biggest that's my biggest worry lamborghinis Jelena girls in Spanish eating outside everyone's fucking eating outside but like would you fucking get indoors you maniac a lot of salsa I love Gustafson like North Carolina like fuck out of here salsa dancing fuck out of here with the fucking dead ain't been a thing that's a good bit there they're like another country that's attached to Florida yeah it's like Europe it's always saying it's like people do you see like Italian people like in Beverly Hills or Miami and that I always say to my friend those are people that were too douchey for a Toli we gotta take it to the next to douchey level Miami deep yeah that but but you think about like okay I'm like not like 28 days later but like yeah you know like huge like scary fucking scary especially because we're gonna be near dead and no disrespect you're not gonna be in the same shape here and now and you're not you do I mean people may give you respect mmm but like it's gonna be fucking scary we're gonna have to move to the mountains where would you move to shit hit the fan somebody Sam who's what's Callens friend Sam fighters mine Sam cedar no Sam the fighters mind he wrote him and how can I not remember his name yeah this is gonna be worth it guess listeners this is Sam Sam Sheridan that's right yeah I'm sure thank you told me ten years ago and stuck with me go to the marina cuz I live in Venice mm-hmm he's like go to the marina and basically just get basically you got to pay to get on a boat or just be like I will be the hard part is how do I qualify to like I can help right cuz I get seasick here's what I have go for its seasick Boies cuz you just get away you get away from from anyone you get away from in LA's case millions and millions people and you can if there's a attacker you can see them you assume that they're not gonna be like you know SEAL Teams coming out of your boat attackers well I know but that's what I mean like how crazy could it get yeah you got to go to Alaska but how do you get there it's a good call I'll do can you dry reports closed and I mean I or lights connected right you could drive you could technically drive yeah technically cut off that road all the time in like the Napa Valley cuz the landslide will show a fuck you gonna go and your funds yeah it's like burrs got the helicopter but he's it's he's got to go to get it yeah that's his escape I had a great bit about that yeah quite special yeah yeah I would move north I'd probably move somewhere that was if I could just go to a place if I knew I just had to get to a place I would go to a place that is sustainable like whether it's Alaska Minnesota or Michigan somewhere there's a lot of animals and there's wildlife and you have you have cold you have water you have a lot like cold is better than heat because cold you can make a fire like if you have shelter and you can make a fire and a cold you can live I have a counter-argument which is I don't I the cold kills more people than he does like every yes but that's just because you know people are unprepared for it you can prepare for cold with clothing you can't really prepare for heat with clothing with heat you need air conditioning and you need water there's a shade yeah you need something if you live it like this people that have lived in very cold climates as long as they have a good house and they have a good supply of wood they're fine if you live in the desert man you kind of fucked you're kind of fucked if the power goes out you don't really have anything to keep you cool you have to stay in the shade and stay indoors but it's not good enough when it's 110 degrees inside it's 100 and if you're hydrated as well I don't think you will just die from its from heat exposure you won't but you're not gonna find a lot of water one of the problems with global warming is gonna be that things like lakes lakes and streams are gonna there's gonna be less there's less water it's gonna be less dribbling down to the creaks creaks we're gonna dry up streams will dry up you gonna have a hard time getting water if you're in a desert environment if you have bite by the same token if you have enough water you have as much water as you have would obviously that it's not a one-to-one analogy because you can go get more wood easily yeah but if you had a shitload of water right if you just had like I hear your thought about getting cold but I don't know if I had shade I guess you don't I guess with cold you don't have to have electricity you don't have to have electricity with cold and also you have more of an opportunity to find animals you'll find more animals in cold climates and you're gonna for delicious animals for sure yeah more things to eat but you might you could still easily easily starve to death like the idea that it's easy to go out there and and shoot a bunch of animals and eat them all the time like not most places most places you don't have an abundant enough supply of wildlife you're also a guy who does archery yeah I know you have skills for this and I would still be panicked I'd be like fuck this is not good if I have feed my family with a bow and arrow first of all I'd say okay how many arrows do I have I would have to make sure that I have enough arrows I mean yeah you have to practice two arteries not like a rifle if I have a hundred rounds I can kill a hundred things I don't really need to practice that much if my rifles on off I can I have good trigger discipline I'll pull through the shot I'll try not to flinch and I'm not only literally those three things I have no fucking idea we're done shooting you don't want to anticipate who I anticipate I go yeah you don't want to flinch when the trigger goes off so a lot of guys like Tim Kennedy who's a friend of mine who's one of the baddest motherfuckers in the world he'll practice with dummy rounds so he has regular bullets and then four bullets are just not real bullets so it's like bang bang bang click and then he has to get rid of that that bullet but he least he knows if he was flinching because if you're flinch and you'll see this movement with right no no gun goes off the bullet doesn't go off but you make that weird moot because you're anticipating the shot and that's the way to train yourself out of it yeah you have to do something like that you have to have what's called trigger discipline well first of all trigger discipline means don't put your finger on the trigger but also the way you squeeze you got to just squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze and let the shot go out by surprise and not real to it it's the same thing with a bow and arrow you have to have a surprise shot you want you wanted to just you want to concentrate on the target zone it in and which feels like you kind of can't even be there meaning like you just have to be like I'm doing a thing you know like you can't think about the release you have to just think about the target that's very astute of you there's actually courses is a guy named joel turner who has this whole course called shot IQ he's a he teaches first responders like SWAT teams and shed the out trigger discipline and about how to shoot properly under pressure and he works with people with archery with us it with the same thing because it's it's a psychological thing to be able to but my point is with a bow and arrow you're kind of fucked you need a lot of goddamn arrow so you need to make sure that bow is gonna stay okay with a hannibal - like like a deer well your deer or bear would be like the most edible thing yeah you want a bear if you have a bear you can eat that motherfucker for a long time and you could take that fat and you could render the fat down use it for cooking and use it for you know you can do do a lot of things with it and that meat is a lot of meat anything big you want a big animal because you want to be able to dry it out make jerky you want to have something that's gonna sustain you for a few days or weeks until you find another animal you're gonna want to dig a hole in the ground to make some sort of cold storage you want to get below like the frost line yeah if you got it you got to protect it from other pairs yeah you got it you're gonna have to do a lot of things and you're probably not gonna make enough food it sounds hard it's the hardest yeah every time I go on a hunting trip I always think like imagine if this is the only way I could get food yeah it's so goddamn hard to get close to an animal it's so hard yeah people see videos of it like on YouTube and there's the deer and you draw your bow back and you hit it in the heart and the deers down and everybody celebrates well you don't see as days and days of working all day long just go if you could watch from a livestream of the moment a hunt start to the moment you're successful and you just sat through the whole thing like as the fucking games of Thrones marathon then you would understand it but even then you wouldn't really because you wouldn't be out there in the cold exhausted hiking uphill going thousands of up and down at elevation and then the wind shifts and the deer smells unit darts off you're like fuck it's hard man it's like tedious and to survive off of that see I'm doing it from my own food but if I don't get a deer I'm gonna live I'll go to a restaurant if you're if your only option is deer that you catch and kill and find your shot or sick oh my god and you gotta fucking catch a deer that's when you wonder you know you wonder how am I gonna watch them starve to death that must have been really exciting for Native Americans serve just any ancient people of just like getting like like you know I think we could kill above all yeah we all like we all have to be fed like we all have to team up and that's why humans have survived but like they must have been so fuckin like it's celebration like an Ewok celebration you know what's crazy to this day there are these areas where they find a lot of arrowheads mm-hmm because they would drive these Buffalo off cliffs yeah how fucking nuts is that like yeah I know the spots where they would drive them off cliffs and fall down and sometimes the bodies would decay cuz I didn't need all of it right there did a hundred buffalo fly off the cliff is only a thousand Native Americans got in this spot what the fuck they're gonna do yeah they're gonna eat as much how we gonna get rid of the three but the rotten ones literally exploded and caused a forest fire in one area they think a forest fire was caused by a rotting pile of Buffalo that eventually exploded like a whale explosion yeah like that kind of deal Google that make sure that's not horse shit cuz it sounds like a lie coming out of my mouth they believe that a rotting pile of bison was responsible for starting a fire yeah because that's how they because they found like all this charred like stuff and they're like they were trying to piece it together if I remember the story properly and I think they were like this might have happened because the bodies rotted so much they exploded and it started fuck cuz it's like you have the gases from all this rotting tissue like you know whales explode on the beach they splatter ya people yeah fantastic so they're trying to take this to a next like how much heat would be generated by all this bacteria like what kind of explosion could this make yeah and also why would the explosion is it a spark light cause I was in with gooey methane gases and rotten gases yeah like there would have to be some something to ignite it you know those little arrowheads they find you're supposed to leave them in a lot of places if you find we're supposed to leave them there just for like luck or something for you go fuck yourself I'm leavin shit Wow yeah Arrowhead like oh you have to leave it I know where it's guys if I can going up there yeah where is it going like Wiz if I leave it someone else can pick it up yeah yeah but good man have a good person no no you can't have it is that like the parks commissioners or Nathan I know when I was hunting in Nevada they said that if you found that Arrowhead yet to leave it there huh oh you know what I haven't talked to you about that uh doing these big venues no Reno's yeah weird how do you like it it's fun man San Diego was a lot of fun it's um it's strange though it's a lot of goddamn people does it feel like disconnected no not didn't surprisingly San Diego was interesting like the people that were in the front they were right there man it was my name is it seven thousand now San Diego was twelve something almost thirteen thousand to thirteen thousand yeah yeah it's a lot of people and they was in the round yeah that was weird - and did you have a plan nope like I guess you can't really think about you can't worry about the people that are behind you you can't you got well they have giant screens everywhere right everybody got to see you I definitely was aware of the magnitude of the show and I did a lot of sets that week I do like eight nine seven yeah that week before I did it look funny thing was I didn't understand I was like how is he not selling this out and then I saw like oh it's a fucking arena yeah I was like I thought Joe was as popular he's ever been and then I'm like why is this guy posted so much and then I'm like out because it's a yeah hard to get that last last thousand I know and you're still and you can't the I don't know if it's the human mind or like the competitive comedy mind but like can't leave it alone you want that fucking thousand what you wanna hear you're sold out yeah like doesn't like yeah but you don't want to go sell Joe Rogan 12,000 people you would sit hold like twelve nine yeah uh what a pussy you can't even get nine hundred more people yeah like you bro and you would kind not you would think it's a failure but you would always be like yeah Josh wall showed me a picture once of him on stage open enough for Larry the Cable Guy in front of 50,000 he did a football stadium Jesus get her done well that's what Kevin art does those big I mean he does one of his Netflix but yes like 49,000 people yeah I'm fucking insane if I mean that I wouldn't want to see that I wouldn't want to go to that we third balcony like what do you even I mean I don't know but people like communal experiences like that yes I think that's a good way to put it but like when a venues fifty thousand you're just far away yeah but I guess if you like signs and everyone's in there together it's you've created a culture so people go to be a part of the culture my cabins created a culture Larry the Cable Guy created a culture so people go it's like to be around their brothers and sisters kind of kind of I mean straight up though why not like it's even intentional that's the thing I like about podcasting as a successful medium and your pockets in particular is like this shit you're you're into comedy you're into fucking weed you're into UFOs and the unexplained you're into government conspiracies you're into gender issues you're you're legitimately into all this stuff and you created a tent where everybody feels like welcome my guy it's gonna talk about the thing that I've got like you're interested in a lot of shit generally you're not going I'm only interested in comedy or more neesh about it you just like this shit you're into your inventions and fire and guns and hunting you're just into a bunch of shit legitimately and you express it and people love it well that's the difference between actually being in shit and talking about things you're into versus talking about the things you think will be popular right yeah you kind of you can't you can't do that for I guess you can't think of anybody could but you'd get off the top year off the top of my head who that would be it would be obvious that you weren't really tuned in you wouldn't be really interested in it you're not you you wouldn't be as enthusiastic yeah way and you are genuinely you only have on people that you genuinely like or genuinely interested in and doesn't matter if they're famous not famous like whatever it's controversial not controversial like it's just shit that you're into you're expressing it's the the another reason why I like pockets it's like watching someone exist yeah it's like an expression of your subconscious or your your brain like it's like the typical day in your brain I'm just like I like this and then I go over here and then and you and you've been able to like do it in a way which is why it's so popular it's like it is popular but it's not even the right word it's like resonant with people yeah I think for a long time people have been doing shows where the show was produced and there's a bunch of people behind the scenes and whatever that person is it's it's almost more difficult for them to get their personality to shine through all that shit but it's just stuff that you're really interested in yeah that people go to and it's also CPU like and then segura takes off and bird takes off and uh Who am I forgetting the Joey takes off I didn't know how long you'd been Friends of Joey Joey guy has been friends for 23 years yeah vo like guys that you just genuinely like like that they're just kind of like even the the like the sober October thing or like it's you know the numbers are massive yeah it's cuz it's like it's show it's like a I know it's everybody's a character and it's like an old radio play and like here comes fuckin Bert Kreischer you think he you got something called the Mickey Mantle team what the hell is the Mickey Mantle thinking about like everybody's got like it's setup and it's it's not like it's sloppy in a fun way yeah and and it's cool and you get to reap all the reward all the guys that are responsible for the because the other thing is so many this is the first time like in in certainly in media history where guys are in charge of their own everything yeah like sure you own the Labe I mean there's not even a lei but it's just my thing there artist tried like the Beatles had a record label and they would bring people on and then they would they it always got fucked up every single time and this I feel like it's the first time where it's like Segura's got like you know his umbrella now he's got like his he's got his spin-offs and it's fucking excellent it's just amazing excellent it's so great I was talking to a guy who used to be in charge at Viacom and we were talking about you know when they when people do shows now like you know they'll pay candy bar so they'll pay Sean arrived in lepay Dave Allen Chris all these guys like 20 million the writers get a hundred buddy my Mike sure created good place and Parks and Rec and he's getting 25 mil a year for the next five years yes it's his heart his shows are picked up and successful but they're not like cheers right and I said to her I like the guy from fuck I go how much were you fucking guys making before what were these what were these companies making 20 years ago like what was ABC making 20 years ago that they and they even Seinfeld said that he he's like I was the first one to get a hundred million in episode and I go which is a pittance compared to what they could have paid and he's like I know that now but back then a million dollars in uh what are you even gonna deal with it and now it's like what are they gonna do with it what the fuck they were making they were making a hundred million in episode but because it's a logo and a corporation go well that's what a corporation's supposed to make 100 million dollars an episode meanwhile if a guy makes a million you're like what are you gonna it's like this unfathomable thing it's like where they get mad at basketball players and not the owners of the teams yeah and it's also that distribution model of like putting something on a network it's there's so much fat there's so many people there's so many things that you have to pay yes so much so many different places the money goes it's almost like you have to make a hundred million dollars in episode for everybody to make out yeah but also another don't live but also they're still taking ninety yeah you know main yeah even with all the revenues with all like the the all the miles I got a fade it's still like a huge profit but as a writer don't you think of like investing your time and effort into a sitcom today it's like good luck with that I don't dude I like I just started to used to the podcast me motion to this podcast call the champs it was great and and now I just started one like a month ago called how Neil feel look for it and your local things know how Neil feel that's the name of the party got a theme song everything's very good but it was I was like why am i trying I did a pilot like a year ago for a network and they gave me notes and I was like oh I forgot about notes I forgot that they were gonna give me notes like uh like I don't just let me that was the always something that me and Dave got to with Comedy Central and they finally left us alone after like six episodes where I was like let us show it to the audience yeah and let them decide we don't want to bomb we want to bomb less than you guys do trust me trust me you've never met two people who want to bomb less than me and him and so they'd be like well we don't really let's show to the crowd if they like it then great and if they don't then and we did we did this real world sketch and they didn't they're like we just think it's a bunch of unfunny scenes back to back and we were like let's just show to the crowd and then we showed it and they were like all right we don't know we're talking about they literally said we don't know we're talking about so do whatever you want unfunny man what a fucking yeah oh those feet but but that's the I get that they feel like they have to do something yeah but we're what comedians are willing to like all our skins in the game it's all it's all of our it's our hide every time so why do you feel the need to like correct us or I don't mind if it if like a executive is like the first audience do you know domain are like hey your shirts fucked at whatever like like a minor stuff but it's like materialized most of you are not good at divining what's special about somebody or what's an innovative segment or you know I mean like they'd only think about that they're just they're ambitious people who are just like working the way up a thing and they're like is it my turn yet right I get fucking I get to put my stamp on it now yeah yeah I want to add something even if it's irrelevant like me I had a joke when we were doing half-baked and then going to a four to eight day but uh we're doing half-baked and I said to Dave ago we should do a thing at the end where we should just say hey let us do whatever we want and at the end we'll pass a hat around and you guys can take credit for something because ultimately that's what you want you want to be able to take credit for something don't fucking make us do it I know you just want credit that's all you want you just want to feel good about yourself you want to feel like I contributed to this thing but let us just let us do the thing United man yeah and if you're like you would just been howling been doing the podcast almost ten years yeah maybe ten years in December you're gonna do a big Network show about okay taking over an AM radio station for the day that's so funny it'll be really fun funny the wonder if they'd let me but even like in when we used to do it in your house yeah I mean like and it's like that was a long time ago you were on you were on an episode at least seven years ago yeah yeah I did two in your house that was back at the kids be in the background yellow each other and shit it here in the hall yeah and they were a little yeah crazy 114 Wow episode 114 so that how many that's two years a year and a half in yeah probably what is episode now was 1297 till 98 that was 98 now this is number one nine eight no it helps like what is that podcast left are 100 episodes 1100 episodes ago yeah and it's from look at me at a fauxhawk beautiful 80% knows that was before I realize I should put beer down where a little beard we're a little scruff podcasts are a very very strange thing that's it's just this no one saw this coming and everyone can start one but I don't could even think you saw it cut you know what I mean like I don't feel I can see this yeah like presidential candidates are on my phone yeah show yeah tell see gabart on yesterday's yeah wonderful president I didn't watch but yeah I wanted to talk about real issues that affect the world yeah yeah and I'm sure do you feel I mean you kind of can't change your ethos you can't be like I'm a role model I need to know that's not I'm just gonna be me you know and the world is gonna be weirder but it's just me but it's also the thing of like when you're in these like development TV movie worlds and you're like just let me talk just fuckin like I promise it'll be interesting like it won't all be interesting but it'll be interesting enough it'll be interesting enough often enough you know that just let me talk well I couldn't imagine giving up that reins to someone now like if all the sudden we brought in some sort of a producer or network that's like look we're gonna take this podcast the next level but you gotta listen to me Joe yeah Joe where's that episode you did with Elon Musk you know one of the great reasons that that show was very successful the way you were dressed yeah I know you don't like to hear this we tested it yeah we had nothing to do with him being weird and smoking weed and having a fucking having a run for our shirt you were a nice shirt is that I mean is there even like there's you could never decide you could never test like whether a podcasts gonna be successful you could know you know it's all it's all word of mouth it's just weird fucking they like it they like like a conversation like this with yennai we're actual real friends yeah so when we talk it's very evident we have chemistry yeah what's known as a chemistry yes I could just yeah that's right normal yeah yeah right like so enjoy your time here and this earth well that's the thing doing so doing this and I told I remember telling somebody like it's like doing the Tonight Show 78 in terms of like I was in Singapore and a guy came to the show who saw me on it like every it's this you can't it's not even worth knowing if you're you it's like fucking don't worry about it you just show up and talk but I can't pay attention to that yeah by paralyzing yeah but the so I'm like the funny thing is when you do TV when you do something that's gonna be seen or heard by this many people like a TV show if I do to Seth or The Daily Show like I prep this I'm like fuckin we talk about like so many times I'll run into you at the store and we basically have like a 10-minute podcast in the hallway yeah you know we just start Dino say have you seen this yeah you pull me aside like have you ever heard about ketamine yeah what and they all said you're telling me you're taking ketamine yeah session but and that's the the thing if there's no there you can't prep and it would be odd you couldn't explain it to people ten years ago like it'll just be people talking now the the the comedians are by nature pretty entertaining at least he's talkative yeah at least pretty talkative and at at and on the high end entertaining and funny so had the worst advice he's like you gotta edit it doing it for an hour just do it one hour and edit it yeah like all right now analysts do you know when people turn it off or anything nope I know that the average time that someone watches on YouTube we know that which is like what 35 minutes or so 35 minutes on YouTube which is a lot yeah so that's it because the average is like 15 seconds but yes yeah what's a normal average only 2 3 or 4 minutes yeah for everyone that watches for 10 seconds there's someone that watches for an hour and a half or 3 so the average would be like 3 or 4 minutes for a normal Channel yeah well you know the difference between something on YouTube in something that's a podcast that you're listening to though I think though the people that are listening or I don't want to say this I'm not know it's really true but they might be more invested in like because they're subscribing to it and they're listening to in their car on the way to work they're listening to a lot of times in there at the gym people on YouTube can flip they just decide to go to the next so what's this and that and then they get to you don't get taken down a rabbit hole with podcast with audio podcast you just listen yeah you listen the whole thing you're one of your other yeah whereas YouTube like you could stumble upon this accidentally right now someone might be stumbling upon this very video right now on yeah welcome welcome welcome friend same for you bitch the other thing you forget is how much people fucking drive yeah we're the like I'm in my car for hours today you're like what Wow and they're like and and you are their friend yeah that's weird do you know any man like you're there whether you it's like you don't know them but you they really like you and they feel like they have a connection with you yeah and all the other people that like you and Theo and daliyah or whoever's here you know people that yeah come in yeah then then those people become characters in there yeah little world play as well yeah like you'll see it in the comments of like this fucking skinny fuck is like literally like the reading no well the last time I did it the comments were so bad and I didn't even you or you texted me I was like boy they must be very bad because you were like we might we did something right or something I was like well they must be awful and then I didn't cause I know what they're gonna say it's like what do you think I'm done I'm not a dumb you gotta say whatever you think of me I'm not dumb right so I believe you politically I don't you know like I don't I don't that's one of the reasons why I bring people on that I don't agree with I think it's important to have conversations with people where they're on the left or the right that you don't agree with just to find out who they are and what they think yeah and just to have discussions also like testing your own feelings about just like okay now that's that's all right I still feel having heard arguably their best argument or a very cogent argument for their side and you go yep I think that I think the the thing that is lost in our in one of the things that's lost in the world now is because of I partially because the internet or blog or whatever where you have to be a hundred percent in every belief and it's like I'm not a hundred percent in any belief no like I'm like I there are some beliefs where I say I'm 50 then I'm 51% and but that still wins 51% is still the thing I tell you where if people can't believe you either got to be a hundred percent or zero or a cock or you're a fucking stud like and there's no like yeah what abortion is a perfect example where we're both like I'm for it but but it's pretty brutal or it's pretty it's a severe thing or whatever the but and you're not allowed to have a butt anymore can't you just can't go I have a measured point of view and it's I took the vote in my head and it's 70/30 yeah or not you can change your mind some learner that's bad that's my home one said well not just one person many people said you flip-flop on things like no I I consider things yeah and it's not it's also not when politicians do it it's because they it's politically in their gonna work in their favor yes you do it because you've thought more about it or you heard the right argument at the right time okay yeah I changed my opinions all the time I don't I don't I'm not married to those fucking things I don't need them my opinions are just the ideas in my mind or something that should be explored and there's certain ideas that I just hold steady fat don't rape don't murder people don't steal all the obvious ones yeah everybody holds those yeah but then when it gets too unusual weird slippery things I'm like okay well what is why is there an inclination to lean towards a certain direction like what we virtue signaling or yeah you know we are sending out the the flag of tribal obedience yeah but what are we doing when we're discussing these things and a lot of that is what ruins discourse and this is what I think I have a real big problem with deep platforming when you start deep platforming people and censoring people you don't just want to not hear them you want no one to hear them and this is where I have a problem it's cuz oh who the fuck are you like why are you the one who gets to say even if they're wrong even if they're one let everybody figure that it's misinformation that's the thing it's like pizza Gator one of the third like the right Alex like what the fuck are you doing Pizza gate is a good example right because people get ramped up in it they're like what and there was that guy Ben Swan who was a journalist who had all these he was he had this video that he put out that showed like all the different connections with conspiracy theory or with pizza gate and various conspiracies and pedophilia and it was it was a real weird one it was like what's just because these things are the similar it doesn't mean there's a pedophile ring going on they're like what is that what exact exactly is happening there but then you hear about someone like Jimmy Savile and you go wait a minute waiting room what this guy was fucking kids for how long yeah and no one like how are there any other ones right now that they have it exposed yeah you know what I mean like that kind of that kind of shit does I don't yeah having yeah I I think there's a big there's a ton of distance between there are pedophiles and there are pedophiles in the pizza place in the basement yeah like very I believe there's pedophiles right and that they should be stopped and they're mostly and I might bet it I don't think none of them are powerful and but I don't think that there is a I just don't really buy into conspiracy just generally I'm buying a some because there's some of them that are provable there's some of them that it really did happen where you go Jesus Christ they really did that there's oh yeah I mean like they're like would like been in like third world countries or will fuck with elections like salmon but shit like that like that is yeah like that's not even a conspiracy that's just like a poorly told part of history that's all those things Howard's all shit honkin is right oh yeah yeah yeah but that's I think that's well I think that's out you know domain oh yeah do you know about the operation Northwoods do you know about that one I don't know that one's probably the most disturbing one because that one was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff they were going to organize a bunch of attacks on America and blame the Cubans so that we could go to war with Cuba yeah we're gonna arm to fall from yes and have them attack Guantanamo Bay they were gonna blow up a jetliner and blame it on Cuba they had all these plans and it was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then vetoed by Kennedy was like what the fuck are you like what were you guys doing you guys so I went to fucking the Hyannis Port and I come back he's trying to blow up airplanes and the thing is it's this is something that didn't fly but we found out about it how many of these things we didn't find out about that actually did happen yeah and that we think are legitimate instances in the news or real attacks yeah I just think it's a drop in the bucket I should drop in the bucket I think it's less than 1% comparison to actually the actual reality person I agree yeah and so when when people are the reason I don't like conspiracy theories I think it people use it to explain their own failure a lot of the time like we see it a lot in comedy like well you can't make it unless you're a oh good the enormity like all right I don't work yet I hate that fucking that perspective is so crazy it's like listen if you're killing people are gonna see you if you kill a lot people go to see you a lot yeah it's that simple you can't fake it is a meritocracy it really is is it and it's like there are there are certainly like some quota of stuff in the margins mm-hmm but not no one's making it no one's doing arenas because of a quota you can't pull yeah there's nothing you can do to get into arena yeah people have to actually like you and this this excuse making that people do do as a straight white man I can't get a break in this talent oh my god when you're a straight white man and you're complaining like you got one of the most fuckin captivated hands of cards in world history in the world history in 2019 straight right now still a great handle you might get beat with a crazy you know Nanette yeah and then that hang out at the hamstrings man that'll get you on the river she what I know she got number one fuck it man what's anti car all right my gunden in that thing and I haven't even seen it it's like do people like it yeah good I saw it live do you like it yeah I liked it a lot nice like stain I thought New York I saw before was on Netflix like I saw it and met her and was like thought obviously nice it was an awkward conversation I'll say that well she is a little spectra me right isn't that sad I think that's a fairly open about error estimation yeah like it was it was it wasn't like easy do you find that you when you speak to certain women in particular you feel like almost like you're guilty or something like you did like you're a male like you're an oppressor do you ever you're not too many women and it could just be a projection it could be my own it could be if I'm like Otto projecting where I'm like I definitely do that I there aren't too many but I think you have to work against stereotypes you're working against tattoos build bald yeah right wing podcast well cage fighting commentator yes so like you have a lot I'm pretty you know a feat the way I look is a problem yes like and I one of the others you're not sexist right or a dickhead yeah yeah not that good yeah like what are the odds like so you try I mean I don't I don't feel it too much but I can imagine how much what percentage of women do you feel like you have to do that with the ones who don't know me once they know me like I'm pretty pretty nice like go to a venue you go to the venue that you've never been to mmm there's a woman the backstage one of the works for Live Nation or she works the venue like does she assume that you're not they work for our nation okay I'm nice to all those folks yeah but I think that if someone has like a very staunch feminist perspective and they meet someone like me they might depending upon their perspective they might think that I'm the enemy that that's that's a possibility that like right away they look at me like the enemy yeah well that's the thing of like what are you absolutely no even and you you can tell sometimes when you're arguing with with people that are super dogmatic about whatever they believe in but they can you can watch them go into a line of logic that they note that they then realize I can't because that will like cede some ground to this person they go oh uh and it's like yeah I saw you start to go down that like a just a reason and I'm not saying stop believing what you believe in it's just like it's you don't have to be a hundred percent exactly just it's fine you can still but you're still win the popular vote things just majority rules it doesn't have to be overwhelming just just don't it's dishonest in a way because they don't want to believe they don't want to have they don't want have a check in their Armour in terms of logically yeah to want to lump people into categories because it's easy to define them too you know we were goofin yesterday me and Joe list were goofing around about Alyssa Milano sex strike yeah and I was like with one of the things it's offensive about that is first of all that that women would agree with you that they would just withhold sex from the person that because Alyssa Milano Alyssa Milano said you should withhold sex because in fucking Georgia their limited abortion laws but the second thing is like that you would assume that all men are responsible for this not even just the voters in Georgia but all men somehow I got a man in many appleís should be denied sex from his progressive girl or that he's gonna call like his friend in Alabama like man did you work something because I'm not getting no pussy up here bro this fucking sex strike is for real bro this is hitting us so it's so delusional and such a dumb flag of virtue that they're throwing up and it's such it's such stupid 2019 woke politics that that was by the way it's like based on lots of strata like a old Greek play wasn't really yeah no shit yeah sex strike yeah that's the yeah and that's what that movie chiraq was about it was it was a sex strike no yeah work it's I don't think it's ever I don't know well you google and see if it's ever been done imagine the girls just users excuse to not fuck a guy they won't don't want to fuck it's also like I'm honest most of them aren't fucking anyway it's like yeah like what are you gonna like rock had that joke about like what are you gonna you can't stop your already not fucking pay to die when you hear when hear women talk about not wanting to fuck their husbands and so I could such a depressing like I was listening to this gal she was like wow you know most wives don't want to have sex with their husbands like what Oh as a husband it bums you out or as as a human being humans that they're in a situation yeah well the thing that people like the most about relationships but besides the fact that you love someone you care someone is having sex with somebody who wants to have sex with you yeah it's great fun yeah it's a fun it's very rewarding it feels real nice core especially take a little hit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it feels great so when you hear that someone doesn't want that and then you know their attitudes that most women don't want that most women don't have sex with her husband they just do it cuz they have to well that's also it's very hard to get a clear story about women and sexuality in that like it's I don't I think its varies from wildly oh for sure like hasn't in girls you've dated yeah even the other day I put a thing on on Instagram where I said how if you start following a guy how long do you think he should wait to DM you because as a guy i'll have girls follow me and because i like just do jokes on there i'm like this is girl wanna i don't want to be like so you came for the comedy also dick yeah that's a lighter thing i don't want a father i want to bum her out if she just came to thinks I'm funny but like yes but what about fucking me can i interview in that what about my penis yes so and of course the answers were all over the place yeah like 4 days 5 days 10 minutes and then I said but if he's cute it doesn't matter and they wrote nope yeah but if it's Aquaman just let them yeah I am slide I like that you're referencing Aquaman it's like the paradigm of hotness not because he really is he's as good as it gets yep he's but this is what my wife said she goes he's everybody's type yeah he's including fish yeah he's a big giant handsome beautiful man who seems to be extraordinarily kind yeah he's got hands like oh man he dates an older what woman that's older than him like he's got he exercises what does it say furthermore sex strikes have been open this and didn't read it as pointed by Chicago ists in Kenya the Philippines Liberia thanks Nobel Prize winner Lima what house but say that GB OWA mug will be whoa whoa kablooey and in Colombia where women held a 10-day sex strike in 2006 to end gang fighting Wow and it's a great it is a great idea it truly is like if you want to affect change just get every other saying to somebody last night like we all know like every somebody was asking me about cheating on and I was like I'm not a cheater but I was like every guy does what they do most human achievement is because they men wanted to get like yeah like buildings electricity if you think that schedule problem in unions just trust me if you got a fucking sex them's yam how's it gonna collide work what am I gonna use I haven't a lever this is my main leverage like but but yeah like it see it's a great bargaining tool oh yeah I mean it's the 8th is the bargaining I mean that's in some ways that's most the negotiation of a relationship is like we're girls kill like women don't control it's like they may not control it explicitly but I know if I do something that's gonna get you in a bad mood you're not gonna fuck me and legalize prostitution is one of the one of the best ways to combat any kind of sex strike and that is one reason why women fucking hate the idea of legalized prostitution they don't ever want that to not be negotiable they don't ever want you to be able to go oh oh I'm an asshole yeah I'm going for a drive I and you go right down to the store yeah will you go to the sex store yeah you pay for a ten and she's built like Jessica Rabbit and you got anger and you have a time of your life and you go home and your girlfriend's got a little bit of a gut asshole saggy and you're like I just no I'm not you can't tell me what to do anymore I spent 80 bucks just it wasn't that much yeah if sex was legal but financially if it was transactions it is legal in a lot of countries they're not a lot of countries but a few cut a few yeah enough but if it was legal in this country how much do you think it would shift perceptions and would the way what people I think it would I don't know because I was just in Singapore and apparently it's legal there by the way I went to like there's a I was in Singapore did some shows excellent and and there was a place called its Orchard Road and it's a mall during the day and at night it becomes a mall for prostitutes they have a prostitute mall yes it's like Road and the awful saying for it is four floors of whores which is I did I don't know it just bugs I was like you wore it just feels like dice it's like hooker I don't know I like hooker is a term of endearment Oh hugger no not like that morning mo shut your mouth hooker like yeah girlfriend who's just joking around but oh shut your mouth hooker and then yeah oh laughs yeah so but it I would so the the the local guys were going there and I was like well yeah I'm gonna go also because I want to see this place because I've read about there was a restaurant there that they ate and which is a whole other issue but it's literally like a mall like a shitty mall like not like you know Glendale Galleria where it's like like all along it's just one of those like square ones where it's like four floors there's escalator in the middle of them there's just basically like and there's just wimp prostitutes hookers as you call them out in the walkway Jamie's got a visual for us I was trying to find something but I found out a trip advisor review yeah Wow don't go here at nighttime unless you want to be shocked a little the holes place turns into a countless into countless brothel bars I feel like I needed to scrub myself after our visit I I don't dis like I was there about three minutes and I was like alright because the thing is there's a difference between legally a legalized prostitution and anyone wanting to be a prostitute and they don't want to be I mean they are right I don't think they're being forced or coerced but life is coercing them what are you doing what did you think about the Robert Kraft situation here's what bothered me about that two things bothered me about that one they they accused him of being a part of sex trafficking right but turns out that wasn't true but they weren't there were just regular girls who wanted jerk eyes off for money right it wasn't there's no one wanted I think it's a big word willing did it voluntarily whatever and they were threatening to release the film footage yeah of him like what are you doing you're trying to shame him into submission and the fact that this guy even though he's a billionaire you can't stop that from happening I kept Chris well the funny thing is the fact that he's a billionaire and still has to go to the must to the fucking drive-through it's like I boy I wish there was a better system this should be a better system yeah I mean I think it's gonna be robots I think sex robots are gonna be like blur the morality line I was at a this is a similar thing about like there's no release of relief anywhere I was at a party recently and DiCaprio was there and there were and there were a bunch it was just like a huge crazy party like crazy Hollywood probably like the kind I never go to maliciously just everyone's there and DiCaprio's girl wanted to leave and he goes well the girls are tired so I gotta leave the greatest party ever like he had to leave like even did Leonardo DiCaprio the King of Kings hmm the girls are tired god I gotta go they been at the party for uh right on the hour and a half or something but there was like a dinner before but it was it was just a funny thing like okay so there's no it doesn't matter who I am yeah you still you're at the win they're done yeah when they're when they're done you gotta go sometimes but having said that we still all do it for some invisible and uh shangri-la that she would have stayed at the party for Aquaman you know what I mean yeah option was human like it's fine let's stay yeah my feet my shoes yeah the the but yeah there's still he's still coming it for some primal like all the achievements and all that shit it's still some yeah well you want to be respected and loved and liked and you want people to desire you yes that's part of it right even if you're not gonna take him up on it right like I told an anecdote on on Helena field this week about the best compliment I ever got I was doing a show in Vegas with two buddies of mine who shall remain nameless we get on the elevator at the end woman gets on it goes can I just say I'm married but I would fuck all you guys whoa and we and it was great but it's like oh you get we feel accomplished we did a great job at the show you're attracted us having to be married and that's so nothing's ever gonna happen but thank you for expressing your attraction to us I wonder if she was saying even though I'm married now she was saying it like just so you know if I weren't marry if I wasn't married yeah and not and she didn't mean at the same time either she was she was but even some ridiculous that's a very nice thing to say like that's kind of what you want from everyone for a guy yeah like hey I would fuck you girls don't want to hear that like yeah thanks yeah they no kidding of that yeah hey how do you like doing a podcast with Bianca I love don't abuse less she's funny she's smart smart and she's a pain in the ass in terms of like she is very like no like she has her own logic she has her own belief system and we just argue it out she's more in like and she's also like ten different rat races yeah she's like so she's pulling from a like her father's middle-eastern and she grew up in Oakland like she's got a lot of different like got Panamanian and she's got Panamanian she speaks German I think like for real like she's she's just like from all over and she's a fun she's fun and funny and she's funny too she's fun to be funny around is she on how Neil feel yeah she's on honey I feel it's not that's the name of it so how often you guys do it once a week that's cool yeah do it in literally in my bedroom oh nice yeah beautiful because it's it's not that's the only space we have that's cool but it's like you know it works how many of you done so far four oh cool but I nice the beginning of a podcast yes nice you can see would it become like below expectations yeah we're still starting up yeah I like it you're the stiv you done any other store no I literally haven't done any I don't think maybe I did one in the basement once it's a nice little spot man that it is yeah it's cool it is kind of a cocoon yeah it is it's it's the way they have it set up down there it's pretty badass and the fact that like wow we're doing a podcast at the Comedy Store feels it feels kind of historical because that is the thing that brought that place back yeah podcast brought that place back from the brink and made it the thriving center of comedy I I think you can all agree that is the center of comedy in the known you hundred percent 100 percent yeah in that podcast even like Robby from Netflix is like podcasts are like the indicator of streams like you know it's it's pretty direct yeah the correlation and I don't know what Tom would be more popular from Netflix or the podcast they're both pretty fucked yeah like it seems my won-won a late term so he's murdering it right now yeah his podcast has rabid fans like whenever they do these Garth Brooks things yeah oh my god Garth Brooks is haunted he doesn't know what to do he's so trapped by your mom's house fans yeah they just won't stop with the memes and the deep fakes with James face over Garth Brooks body by diem the deep fake guy yeah and because I was like is it hard cuz it's terrifying someone said he did it Jamie used the software to make one with me with Trump's head was this easy yes someone I was talking to somebody about it and they said it bums me out in the way death used to bum me out when I was a little kid I know what he means it was like unfathomable like oh this is not good jong-min check this out look at this are you talking about which vice-president I'm sorry former Vice President Biden actually that looks like me if I was fat and I had a crazy haircut to look that's me everyone's competition I knew everybody there sometimes that's so good how long did it take for real it's about that I was teaching myself how to do it really I like this version took I let it run overnight because there's a little bit of what the machine learning kind of thing doing the longer you let that run the better it is it's right I've been learning so this was just my test of like eight hours maybe could have multiples going at once or once or in a hopper the crazy thing is porn they're doing that with gals they're taking like you know lovely give you use word gals twice we're fucking I love it this is a good time to bring this up because I just saw something today literally and it has to do with this and I don't know if this is real but this sounds it sounds scary and this is where someone's taken this technology into a weird place ladylike is a Facebook post it's why I don't believe it but she said she was with her son and while she was out of her house her husband was called saying that her son was kidnapped and that he heard his son's voice saying mommy help me help me help me and that give him money and it the dad was freaking out didn't know what to do did couldn't get ahold of him and for finally did after six minutes and she said they couldn't even convince the dad that that wasn't real like after hearing no I'm fine we're fine I'm with them but I don't know if this is even real how they could do that at this with the capability now I'm not sure but they might be able to oh for sure they can do it but yeah boy I mean if they can do it with faces they can do with audio they did it with Tupac at the Coachella like five years ago that was the way he said Coachella is exactly how he would have said it and they have that that hologram that looks just like him but look a little more jacked just a little yeah like you went to CrossFit yeah yeah that's I can I totally believe they can do the voice yes seven years ago for that one yeah they're so close now even if you go back and watch Game of Thrones like season one and what the wolf's look like they look like shit really yeah they were their shitty CGI wolves a little clunky but now they look amazing now it looks like a real fucking wolf what is this that's too Park look look how Jack Diaz do you have any idea situps you have to do to have stomach like that you got to be on that Wiz Khalifa it's all cells routine it's also you got to not eat any starch right I mean you sugar the mini cotton you can't be fucking around with carbs carbs it would keep you from being really shredded I mean not all carbs but I mean either doing some a lot of fasting you got to do something to get your body fat down that low because it doesn't matter how many sit-ups you do right it's not gonna blow sit-ups make your ab muscles bigger yeah and make them more defined I can see one of mine yeah you gotta lose weight the only ways to guys want to see that it's so easy to get fat too I'm so amazed at how easy I can get fat on a vacation like one week I gained ten pounds if I go on a vacation and I just go drink and eat pasta ten pounds in a week well that's like you're running such a small margin yeah in just in everyday life where it's like yeah if you if you just eat it's not a mean it's fairly massive but it's not like what do you think it is 800 calories a day no that's right man the extra I don't know what man I go hard when I when I eat on vacation drink drinking and eating like just the drinking when I'm on vacation I might drink four or five drinks a day maybe more every day do you drink during the day you're on vacation without you sometimes no no no not without my kids but when my kids are there I'm hammered yeah you got a day yeah no but if I'm on vacation and I'm out I might have a drink at the pool or at the beach or wherever I am and then at night if I go to dinner I might have two or three so find out four or five drinks every fucking day that's not a normal day for me such it's just piling up yeah and what are you drinking whatever whatever you got yeah if I'm on vacation you know I'm trying to get fucked up I'm trying to have a good time doing like it's my job and are you does your wife get drunk she'll get hammered with you that's correct not as much as me though I get more drunk than her that's fun yeah well yeah well you know nowhere to go and you can just walk to wherever you're supposed to be yeah yeah but uh ten pounds later I'm like you fat fuck I don't grab on my sides when I can yeah like a fistful of meat right where my love handles on like Jesus Christ well cuz it's so like you fucked up and you just like have a thing that you have a handful of regret yeah it was like week to get everything back in line by the way that not that long I mean that's not a very long time compared to compared to most people like at your age fuck people people's metabolism take some people get fat a little bit and then they're done yeah but I still do the same shit that I did when I was 21 like in terms of like the amount of working out and I do yeah I still I'm still running the hills and doing serious kettlebell workouts and martial or every death though at least five days a week the muscle shit every day are you doing sometimes I'll do something every day I'll do multiple workouts in the day because I have a gym at home so I'll get up in the morning and lift and then I'll do yoga and then I'll do something later I just you have to keep going when you're 50 years old like your body requires like you can't have too much slack in there cuz when you slack if you get out of shape fuck man it's hard to get back in jail it's hard like your body just trying to die yes not trying to put muscle on and up your vo2 max it's not interested in that it's interesting yeah dying and get tricked that and continuously working out is he kind of like yeah I've been cranking a sauna up to 200 degrees because Gabriela Reese told me that Laird Hamilton puts his shit on 220 220 that's what she said right 220 which is you cook meat at 220 degrees that's like that's fucking hot and I was like there must be some sort of benefit in that so I'm like I'm gonna ramp my shit up from 180 to 200 and it made a big difference what and what's the difference first of all it's way harder to do the difference sheen 1:16 one like I was at a sauna this past weekend at a gym like a hotel gym there's a nice sauna but it was not hot enough it was like 160 ish and as that's not hot you're sweating and it's it's helping you're getting heat shock proteins it's good for your body reduces inflammation but not nearly as radically as when you hit 200 200 is fucking hard to do like you're the first of all the wood in the sauna that you're sitting on is hot as fuck you need your sweat to cool off the wood because the wood is like a plank like a cedar piano you're cooking a fillet of salmon on that's what the wood gets like it's hot how long can you stay in it 20 minutes and those last five minutes are ruff and how do you deal with the hey and whatever the like you can't you don't want to move right yeah what were you just like still the last five minutes get up and I start walking around actually I feel like I have more of a hard time sitting still in the last five minutes so like yeah I would think you have to yeah I distract myself by stretching and are you wearing flip-flops or that they would smell from now well you know what works though surprisingly air pods those fuck really don't die out and 200 your phone would be dead as fuck yeah but ear pods keep going so if I put my phone just outside the door yeah I put air pods on I could listen to music alright do you think they were hot to the touch yeah they're hot I feel them but they're not breaking down they don't they hang in there at 200 degrees good for you everybody know they're good and and you feel it markedly different yeah you feel good when you get out of there man like all your little aches and pains feel like they get a big bump like a big reduction and aches and pains and that's and most your aches and pains their age and working out yeah yeah just inflammation and Jeff hey what age would you be pissed at be pissed if you died at 60 would you be pissed do you know that nah I mean my piss can fuck you I fucking did all the right shit yeah I don't know man you know I just heard John Singleton he done yeah 51 yeah you know Luke Perry died at 51 or 52 a stroke both those guys yeah fucking that's me that's the sage strong of Stevenson even I mean he was not in good shape but like he wasn't old no no he's Berlitz and yeah that one's like how old was Keith when he had a stroke fifty fuck yeah like at what point would you be like feel ripped off probably right now so sixty you would be like the shit out of this body though it's amazing this thing works as good as it does you know if I think about my body's like a car that happened do you still feel like you're beating the shit out of it or do you feel like the jujitsu stuff was beating the shit out of it well I still do that though but I died running in the Hills yesterday hard fucking workout yesterday how far two miles but it's straight up or steep yeah it's like one one stretch is more than a-- it's two hundred yards straight up and it's fucking hard it's a hard sprint like the dog runs ahead and i'm trying to keep up with them it's yeah but you get to the top of these really steep hills maybe your legs are on fire your lungs are killing you but man it makes a difference but it's also are you beating the shit out of your body or are you just doing it i'm strength right i'm doing it right but i am i am putting a lot of pressure on the joints i'm putting a lot of pressure on the muscles and it's not simple some like doing yoga everyday I'm doing just pretty heavy-duty stuff but I feel like if you do it smart and you warm up a lot any stretch and I've been pretty diligent about recovery sauna in the big way but also begin trigger point muscles release therapy like which is like really hardcore brutal massage that you literally want to cry like like this kind of like elbows yeah I teach fucking puts her up on the back of my neck and yeah but it makes a big difference man all that stuff cryotherapy all that stuff everything's got a little place it helps but the moment the main thing is consistency like you can't you can't take months off you can't you can't take weeks off you can't just eat lecture you'll slip away your body wants to do what it's been doing yep like your spirit whatever like whether it's like you know whatever the laws the body in motion stays in motion but it just does its gonna like sugar same thing eat sugar and you're like we got to get more sugar don't eat it and four days later you like that good feel like variety is really critical to like I'll make sure that I get at least one or two days of yoga and at least one or two days of running at least one or two days of lifting at least one or two days of martial arts I do a bunch of different shit mix it all up together because if I don't mix it all up together then there's like too just too much repetitive stress possibility like you're just running every day I'm not I don't think that's wise and you you why don't you do interval training with running I do sometimes okay yeah I do I do a bunch of different shit I mean I sometimes I just do hill sprints and then I slowly go down the hill I wait to my heart rate gets below 140 and then I sprint back up the hill again you know I I mix it up but the the the key is consistency no matter what you're doing whether it's yoga or running you got to do something almost every day yeah I don't do some every day but I'd try to do like I got a treadmill and I'm now I have a Bowflex I'm proud to say I'm a proud owner of a boffo you're the last guy to buy one I know about to go out of business but think we're just gonna fuckin order from 1988 bro yeah my my ex-girlfriends roommate had a Bowflex I remember using this going why in the fuck nigga actually like it's like it's takes up a lot of space I didn't even put yeah bro come on they don't that only that's when it yeah it does have like wing it is a winged bird does it work yeah I yes got a good workout I got him getting my gains bro I still have like dumbbells and you know punishing bands I tell people if you really want to workout at home all you need is a chin up are everything else you do on the ground you can do bodyweight exercises you can do plenty I got to say I don't even think you need to chin apart I mean again you know ten times more than I know but I'm saying like what are you getting from a chin-up bar that you can't get from a push-up or a dipper roll-ups beginning but I'm saying it's all that's right you're getting your back you're getting your back you're not getting it back much you're getting a little bit if you do Hindu push-ups we got down and elevate and then come back up you're getting a little bit your back but you're really getting your back if you're hanging on to a channel bar and you're using your whole body weight yeah that's what you want that is that is an amazing I don't work my back out very much am i fucking myself yeah for sure you have the strength in that bitch to keep the stability in your spinal column you want meat you want that to be armored you know that's very big I have several machines out there that are just designed to keep my back strong and you just think it's good it's best practice yeah I do that almost as much as any other kind of exercise I do a reverse hyper I do a whole series the reverse hyper machine and the the glutes the glute machine where you you you know that cannot believe how hard glutes are like it's the hardest that's the one after it I'm like I'm gonna fucking throw up it's the fucking wars are and you have to even like I was talking to a trainer and she was like well you need to like activate your glutes and then part of me is like I don't even know what you're talking about and then the more research it's like our glutes are dead as like normal people we don't use our glutes and they are literally atrophied that's why women get so disgusted by a guy's flat ass they're like this motherfucker doesn't even activate his great nobody's gonna run ton of shit yeah you know what ton of shit just and she's like you would take it would take you a couple months to even just get them activate and I was like I don't know what you're talking I just thought it was some trainer shit and it's you have to like turn them on yeah like you have to like do bed like I do a ton of shit I don't even know if I'm doing it right then I get it up yeah they gotta you know you gotta get a train I should get a turn come on man yeah yeah catch yourself a train in the Oh Brenda yeah thank you unless it's good because you have to make is this your Bowflex no that's the mirrors look if you think I didn't almost buy this you're out of your mind let's go not magnets this time you're waiting wait something or other I've been seeing this online recess to courts how much resistance that's what I want the resistance is all internally done just by magnet pressure that you what's the maximum amount also cuz I don't know if you know this but I'm jacked no yeah I heard how much 148 pounds just in the middle I think you're probably 200 some plus pounds eleven I think you look I think 140 it'll take care of most people yeah and if you just doing cables so 148 on each side is that what it is I don't know literally I just it's new and I was just curious if you had seen anything that looks badass so the mirror is showing you your forms your forms versus video I guess porn versus like are you doing it and they tell you what yeah and it goes up and down and it fits on the wall is that a gimmick is there any reviews that it's wait it's Brit it's like brand new I don't even know the reviews are all pretty strong this is did like as you're saying it all comes down to are you gonna do it yeah if you do it every day it's fucking great right you just most people won't do it every day yep they just because it's got to write it down just like every day I brush my teeth yeah so do that too but take longer I meditate twice a day it's fucking why is it dead yeah really 20:28 Wow damn interesting yeah so how does that work what do you do sit down set the timer for 20 and close my eyes and repeat the mantra was your mantra I can't tell you and it I think it works I think I need less sleep as a result really since I've started I started like a year and a half ago and I've needed significantly less sleep from before and I don't know again because it's impossible to know what you know right what's doing what but what other benefits in terms of like clarity and stuff I don't again I don't know I think they're good but I it I can't say like well I was writing 4.3 jokes a month before and now I read 4.8 like I don't there's no direct correlation I am happy with my output but like mmm isn't that funny that like to an average person they'd be like we wait for point you're joking right no no if I get four great jokes a month that's an amazing month yeah well it's like that I was gonna bring it up when you were talking about deer hunting yeah right yeah if you it you see the special thought of it all won't at once yeah I'm the special you had a great line about writing and that like like writing in a notebook or on your phone that it's like a net to catch ideas yeah that really it's like thought about that like that is a great way to put it yeah like here put throw this in the put it on the thing and like and then you can look but you ever have an idea write it down and then three days later looking like that's fucking funny yeah yeah funny well that's why you got to throw a lot of shit against the wall I have pages and pages stuff that I review like late night rambles that I label them late night rambles because I write a lot of times at night after the store so by yourself yeah yeah everyone's asleep I'm high just sitting from the computer and is it like you have a germ from the day I have sometimes some but I have one hour they have to write so I'm one hour in front of that computer I give myself that one hour and then after that I can watch youtube videos or whatever you like but I have to get that one hour in and man there's been many times where I'm sitting there staring at that fucking computer for 20 minutes then and then I got an idea like oh my god there's something and then the next day I do that on stage boom it gets a laugh like fuck yeah that reward for the tediousness this is just getting through the the sitting in front staring at the blank screen staring at some fucking weird notes you're not even sure if they mean anything trying to find some old shit where there's just a spark of me out an ember yeah blow on a turn to a fire or like I had a joke that I tried that I was trying and I was like I know it's good I just have to come up with the right thing yeah and then I tried a couple then huh first couple times you fuck it up you don't say it right it's so it is the TD and the mild embarrassment of just like trying and failing but uh but having an idea writing it down doing it on stage is the to me the most rewarding thing I can think of it's one of the most rewarding things in all of life yeah I mean honestly and I don't say that light I dust mean like living a life that is the thing and it's not that's the one that's not really about women or not about that's more like spiritual yeah it's like about like our nation yeah and like you it goes through the your filter yeah and you're like no one ever thought of that right know what fucking ever thought of that right right rock that's fucking crazy the best one so like how did I calculate out what rank you Thank You earth how often do you write on stage how my oven II ad-lib onstage very rarely I see I come with my sheets yep and like but I have a new joke show every Tuesday in Santa Monica and then so I'll go up and do as much new shoes I have and mix it in with my mean you know that when you have a punk then you'll put like I can do it I can put that part in there so you kind of have to do some old jokes that like fit in the new part yeah and but my I'm like I'm like if I write four jokes one of them will work yeah like and I just like nip yeah all right four jokes one of them I'll have something and then sometimes the other ones you like now if you're alive or not I gotta stare at you for a little bit try to figure out a way to bring you to life yeah this might be something there I may be missing it on the first pass set it aside you ever have a premise and years later you'll figure it out years later I'd like aid yeah yeah and you're like oh fuck you just know how to do it now yeah maybe you have a bit that you did that taught you about something else or some other aspect of writing yeah yeah and you couldn't explain it to any you couldn't explain it someone who doesn't do it no like you can't it's kind of not well I mean maybe athletes a little bit where it's like they figured the game out in a different way but it's so private and it's so like and that's the thing I was talking to somebody about this like how many funny people are there in the world there's a lot of funny people but how many of them are funny stand-up funny yeah if they could just go onstage and make a room full of people laugh that's a hard that's a hard couple hundred if you're being generous if you're gonna be really giant like how many real legit professional comedians at you and I respect yeah maybe 200 yeah man there's seven billion people in the world and like that the rare and I as much as comedy is like deified and ways that are sort of goofy now it's still like no this is all we do everything it's fucking interesting it's like we're and especially now the way the culture is like were the only people speaking freely in public or at least in an organized way in this this format as well podcast and stand-up those are the only two things yeah I mean everything else right now is compromised it seems like yeah and then everybody else feels at work you can't really talk freely yep at home in relationships there's like and it's not like we're just talking extemporaneously like I don't even know where I'm going but fuck fucking know what's gonna happen at the end of this sense but but that and that's the thing that's so riveting about it is like is there no one else is doing and there's only a few hundred people that can do it well yeah that's crazy and it's also riveting to like the creation of like these these little things that you come up with if you keep going eventually there'll be a special eventually it'll be something that actually can record yeah and there's like these this thought like I'm on to something I've got this is I'm piecing this little puzzle together and not even knowing someone said like so what do you how do you come up with it's like I don't even know what I mean when I start and then I write the jokes I'm like oh I see what I was doing or going through do you sometimes rewrite a bit like write a bit and then rewrite it from a different angle I mean there's obviously like threads of like like you just do the inverse sighs I'd take a bit when it's already done and I say okay let me put that aside I know it's done I know it works let me approach the subject from a completely different angle now yeah let me approach the subject as a hater well couldn't you do you end up probably doing both of them right like a lot of your feminism shit the thing you were closing with felt like you'd written half and then we're like well yeah yeah yeah and now my own rebuttal well I wanted to rebut myself yeah and I also wanted to shit on myself so hard that by the time I got to on the feminists like it worked yeah that's another thing where it's like if you couch you can say anything yeah as long as she's preface it with like I'm not a monster just know that I'm not a month of course but some of these bitches are or some of these whoever's are like I'm not a total piece of shit but let's talk about that yeah that's the the I'm thankful that I just thought of a another like frame for a for a like I did to Mike Stan no I don't know but for Netflix so I thought of that frame as like three microphones on say and I just thought of a nother so it's not like a structural thing but it's a way to do a show and my first thought was fucking thank God meaning you don't want to be like you don't want to do a a premise II show every time because I did three mics then I did a half-hour on Netflix New Year's Day the communities of the world thing that Dillion Swartz into two and uh and now I'm like I would like to do a kind of not one-man show we think it's not a maudlin version but like a way to do jokes that are more it's like jokes but also if you could thread something else in it it's like you see that there was a girl tonight live I think it was Halsey who sang a song and fuckin painted at the same time she painted a painting and I was like wow wow see if you can bring it up because the song I can't play it now it was the second song it's our life yeah if we play it will definitely get the boot YouTube is brutal with their copyright shit brutal I mean bad well it's it's just very it's good and bad yeah but it's very easy for someone to claim copyright off of just to play a clip and next thing you know your video gets taken down you can't stream so a part of me is like yeah that's it right here so she's singing she's singing and cheese and just by the way great looking yeah okay she's got a lot going on and she's barefoot no I mean is it amazing no but it's fucking amazing for singing some it yeah it's better than I can do not singing but she's uh quite a character I don't and that felt loaded that's yet so like I thought of another premise so I'm excited about that that's awesome do you think gonna film if you like I got a I have I kind of written it out but like I'm gonna probably do it like in New York like I did three mics where I did it like sort of off-broadway okay so when you do something like that will you do like a long run and then film at the end of the run yeah I basically did three mics at it for like two months four nights a week so I did it all in New York yeah and then what did you do some theater like on the Lower East Side where Birbiglia does his and then and it was cool it's cool it just like have to do an hour every night it's a cool like oh I'm going to do an hour and I'm in a town I'm in the same town that is cool and I'm doing an hour every night and you're doing essentially like a play on yeah like it was an emotional there was a there was a like an emotional fucking I talk about emotional shit this will be less emotional it'll be less wrenching and emotionally people saw three mics like it's fucking pretty gut-wrenching but uh but this will be less gut-wrenching but you have a premise that's exciting to you yeah which is fucking you know that's like fucking excellent and it's also the only thing that like it's like will you know make money I don't know I don't care it doesn't matter it's like not even consideration yeah it seems like that's you're wasting your time thinking about that because all that really matters is do you enjoy doing it this is the audience enjoy all that other stuff comes out of that right yes if you enjoy it they're probably gonna enjoy it too yeah and and even the thing where people go like so what are you doing and you're like you can say you doing the podcast or you have UFC stuff like I like oh you have to have something that you're working on I feel like like I'm doing an hour comedy special for a huge stream streaming service that's gonna broadcast fucking everyone what are you do that's it yeah you know that's how they end you're like this is a what I'm doing is fucking it doesn't it's not time consuming visibly day-to-day but like it's consuming emotional like thinking of what's your take on what's going on with Louie like what he's trying to do with stopping people from quoting his bits and quoting I mean I think he's just trying to stop people from writing shit yeah it was his own fault cuz he just didn't have the bag he didn't have the honor back like he could have him was like yeah it'll be fine what's the worst that could happen Louie now he's doing everything he's got the under bags he's doing small clubs yeah he also has a sign that he puts up saying that if you leak any of the material that they have legal repercussions ah good yeah I mean why should why should it's a spoiler it's like it's like a fucking but it's worse than a spoiler yeah it is worse no spoiler because every every joke is its own movie right to be nice yeah to exaggerate about it but it's like yeah it's a huge it's a it's a that's a huge problem and it's also it goes to that 11 year old girl thing where it's like yeah wait said ha yeah when you have 11 year old daughters men it's like you get it okay oh now I see how people are thinking kids and what's the how would you describe it but sort of like simply sick yeah looking for something to be naughty someone do something back Oh what did he do what did she do what are they doing well we'll tell you right after the break you're like oh I can't wait yeah yeah but I don't I mean Louie's a hilarious dude and and I hope I'm interested to see what happens I think he's going to come out with a motherfucker of an hour that's what I think I think he's gonna pee he's constantly touring he's on the road all the time doing this I know he's not doing it just for money because he's only doing these little tiny places yeah he's doing zany's in Chicago yeah or Zanies in Nashville right now he's gonna come out with a motherfucker of a special and recent man his position and I think there's gonna be people that are still mad at him no matter what I don't matter I don't think that you can please most of people that are mad at them no meaning and I don't I just think it's like there are reason they it's more fun to not forgive them yeah it feels better to not forget them yeah yeah yeah fuck him yeah I get it I get their perspective but for everybody else we're gonna get treated to a monster hour that's what I think I hope when he's all done I think it's probably gonna be his best hour ever I listen to the leaked one yeah it was good yeah it was good I mean 10 months out yeah no no comedy doll for 10 months and then he starts doing it again and there's you know some bits in there that would have been great if they didn't get leaked the thing about what are you gonna do cancel my birthday is so fucking funny is it since it's like he's so fucking funny it's bananas yeah because my life is over my birthday god damn funny yeah yeah like I you know he's a he's a fucking hilarious dude yeah that's the front of the line I mean when it comes to comedy and political correctness in the push back that's the front of the line for the pushback is stand-up like nightclubs stand-up the stuff that you and I both do we say a bunch of fucked up things that happen to also be funny and you're doing it in front of live crappier I said on stage the other night they're going to a strip club and complaining about cellulite that's what it feels like it's like what do you be this is a we say a ton of shit some of it doesn't work yeah some of it doesn't work because it doesn't cross the the comedy barrier some of it doesn't work because it's ideologically fucked up but you don't know it until you say it's like yeah even the funny many great bits that you love are fucked up to someone sure to someone like or you have to figure out a way to make them weren't like Chris Rock's bit about this is difference between black people in the end yeah that bit he said bombed Oh long time boy figured out shortly before he did it I was on his ACL it's great but he knew he's like god damn it there's something in this yeah and and also it is fucked up it is a fucked up like it's fucked up you can weaponize that joke sure a lot of white people did right like a lot of races maybe like I told you I've been saying that in my car for years and that's exactly but at the same time you can't worry about that like I was talking to somebody did a thing on the pockets where I was saying like I don't understand the problem with Jordan Peterson and you and I have talked about this at the club like and and then and people email me and they said well people use Jordan people right wing people use him as an example of didn't I that's not his problem right that's and he promotes someone said he promotes an all meat diet no he doesn't he said he does it but he didn't promote it he didn't make a commercial about the shit you can't worry about how someone takes again this goes to a point how someone interprets your art uses community interpretation exactly and also by the way then throwaway taxi driver and and the Salinger book that catches our eye because that's responsible for killing when and shooting Reagan like place like okay well so these fucking dummies use it as their thing right so now I can't enjoy it like to go fuck yourself yeah there's too many interpretations there's too many perspectives there's too many people you just have to be a reasonable person be nice do shit do your best and you know look we work together all the time man people are laughing yes have a good time yeah like and and it's not it's also like what's your intention yeah it's not our intention is to create right our intention is to come up with funny thing and like me as a person who enjoys stand-up I like sitting in the back of the bow R and watching someone kill I fuckin sure it's the best I told somebody like I'm a gym rat but for comedy club yeah I've been seeing you for 27 years yeah just hanging out like me and Chappelle were in Vegas and some kid was like what do you he was a chef at a this place yellowtail and and he was just saying like being a chef you just fucking have to cook for 12 10 years 10 12 years just like it hard and shitty I was like I've known him for 28 years he's been going to clubs for 33 years yeah like that's the only thing that Matt it just makes sense yeah it's fair it's like it's an economy that you understand if the idea is good enough we will get this response and it's not there's not really politics there's not there's preferences but there's not like you know like Oh have him although you got the fact that you got banned from the store somewhere that is like from a movie like will ban we have to ban one of them but uh but and you want in the end as it worked but um but it is a fair thing and it is like the only people as Rock says we're like x-men where it's like Dave they're always mad at the x-men they're always mad at the x-men but like fucking you still like the x-men yeah you're mad you're you're mad at Louie but if he went on stage crazy yes if you walked on stage they would stand up and give him a standing ovation yes and there's also it's also that it's almost that corporate thing where it's like if you know Chinese slaves are making phones did they make this one like that like where as with Louie it's like this one guy is responsible for all institutional sexism like now he's not he's a fucking he just was a dumb he just was dumb and he handled he was dumb from beginning to end any talk about it yes he was fucked he just fucked up and it was stupid but he doesn't have to take the fall uh you know for whatever like he is valuable yeah he's valuable he's valuable to our culture he creates a lot of I don't think of stand-up this way where it's like you create joint for people like I never think that way but he did create a lot of thought and Jill and like yeah he's responsible for a lot of positive shit I mean that is what the art form is yeah you're literally changing a person's state yeah I mean Anna as an audience member I still love it and that was a that was a struggle for me early on because I was jealous I could see people doing well and I wasn't doing well like god I wish I was doing that I wish I wrote that joke yeah I wish I was doing that show I wish out and then I realized like oh this is like totally unproductive like yeah the opposite of productive it's negative yeah they can be activating in terms of like if you turn it into bleed then work harder right well but the problem is like I wish I did that like that part of is no good or god why is he have to get this that part of his just no positive to that but what is positive you watch someone kill go god damn he's funny I gotta go to work yeah that's good but the hate part yeah like is taking it out on him it's like Spanish act it's not it's counterproductive it's really common I think it's then 11 year old it's that's your first that's the easy reaction like and then it's like okay but what am I what's underneath it what's underneath it is like respect I don't and then there's certain people that it's like I've never hated Brian rege and also like there's so of them yeah and he's fucking hilarious in a way that's just like I don't know this fucking dude this dude's funny he's so funny and so clean you could take you grandma to see him and never worry for a second ago where is he going with this yeah grandma gets a fuck I gotta get a drink yeah he's just he's one of those rare cats like Gaffigan that figured out a way to make clean just as Sebastian - oh yeah like Sebastian I always forget he's clean and Nate bargatze is now like getting into that area where he's like clean southern accent like it's a big it's like it's a good place to be but he's fucking so funny if you're naturally inclined to do that yeah yeah like if yeah if you're forcing yourself to it but uh yeah I think that there's a ton of value in in stand-up I mean it's it seems so obvious but it's like and I think Netflix must there must be some metric Annette flicks where they at a certain point they're losing a ton of programming meaning all their shits licensed mm-hmm Disney's taken all their shit back in like a year to a lot of like parent like all of these places are starting their own apps so they're gonna look and I think they realize like a lot of Netflix is stand-up in documentaries mm-hmm and I think there must be in terms of like right they can never monetize it in terms of like if the Ali Wong special begat this much money but if it costs them five hundred grand to get Ali walks for special including producting they made a lot of money you know I mean like the image millions of people and and like as well it's
