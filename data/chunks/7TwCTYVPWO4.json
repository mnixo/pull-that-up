hello freak bitches so what did you guys do for entertainment when you're in there oh shit did you do stand-up in there at all yeah I did later on that's a crazy question long ones really I ever asked me that that's what Joey got started you know yeah but it was different because in my last my last year and a half I'm locked up in Norco so all these guards are Mexican most of them they're Mexican and they're like I used to fucking see you at wile coyote they're like I just seen you on Showtime and they're like you're at the Ontario improv so you know they got together and they're like eh uh you want to do comedy and I was just like fuck I did not want this I did not want like to be popular you know what I mean mmm like I didn't want to stay low-key yeah then I was just like uh I don't know man like I'm offensive I'll say something that I'll start a riot and they're like nah all the races already said you can say whatever you want like they planned this shit I was like all right I'll do it so all the races you have to have like a little race knowing fuck yeah hell yeah so how does that go down it's I don't know I wasn't involved in it it's just so they had to like meet with maybe the guards went up to the white rep the black wrap and all the reps was like a man check it out you guys we have a celebrity comedian here that's how they pumped me up I was like motherfucker I can't even get a week at The Improv but I can get a week in prison that's a good new one thank you so it was it was oh man it was weird I was scared as hell like no mic and they put me in the TV room and there was like 60 straight like fools like just like come on Dawg make us laugh and like wow you know they never heard my jokes so I did my whole set and there it is like oh then I guess one of the cops this is the weird part as all the cops left their dorms to come watch this show and they went back and then they told the inmates so when I go to yard the next day the inmates were like hey Dawg let you charge come do a show in our room I was like what do you mean they're like I heard you did comedy I thought everybody said it was cool all the races said you were cool and I'll just like I don't think I can go to your dorm that that's like against the code so the cops would be like alright everybody give them an item and you can go in there and perform an item an item is like a soup hot chocolate that's how people pay to get you sure Wow yeah and it got to the point where I did every everyone on our yard and III assembled like a little crew I I'm I taught this guy how to open for me because he was cool ass druggie from Whittier he was just he was stupid you taught him how to do stand-up you know he knew it but didn't know he knew it he knew it but he never did it yeah cause like I remember he'd be like hey when I'm on the street he has fucked up teeth it's like I call girls and I'm like they're like how's your body and he's like I just smile I'm like chisel you know that's a setup right there like you just he did it and I the look on his face was cool man but I just remember he's like hey Dom I hit you when I get out we're gonna go on the two are like no you're a fucking Tweaker you know well it's fine because people that can make people laugh if you always tell people like if you can make your friends laugh you can make people you know laugh it's entirely possible you could be a comedian it's the same thing it's just a matter of whether or not you get these people to allow you inside their head yeah that's really kind of what it is right yeah that true comfortableness but you know some of them wasn't like I had a rough time the couple like first ten minutes cuz fools are like I thought you were gonna do George Lopez's joke so I was like no I'm not I don't know I'm not an impersonator like like you didn't do any member members or nothing like that oh that's funny yeah so they just thought stand-up comedy's kinda like music yeah yeah like you would just go up there and do like some hits yeah they didn't know yeah this is the crazy part is the warden catches wind of this shit and I'm in a program called SAP its substance abuse program and I'm only in it because you qualify for half-time if you take this program so the wardens like a sacramental is coming down here I want to show them a rehabilitated cotton or criminal whatever I'm a felon whatever so I was like what are you talking about is like will you do comedy in front of the program and Sacramento but no cussing no like I think this was the easiest deal I've ever made I said look I'll do it if you bring me Kentucky Fried Chicken and soda Joe I was just saying at the talk shake you know like right when I first started getting gigs I always call Joey Diaz a hater they're gonna give me 700 if I go do my cell he's like town 2000 dumbass they don't give it so after the show he gives me two two liters of coke and a fucking bucket I could take you home oh man and he was just like I remember walking back and everybody was like I gave all my people a piece and it was just like it was kind of like that movie of xiangcheng production when they're drinking on the roof mm-hmm it was like the first time like we ate outside food like I haven't had a soda in years right so everybody was like I was just like okay get down homies like yeah it was cool wow that's fucking cool there's something cool about appreciating something that you you just take for granted cuz you can get it any time you want but when you're so restricted you get those things and it's so good no they loved it like they loved it and it was cool because like a lot of I mean dude I make friends like there's guys I still talk to there's like friends and it was it was awesome like how could I say that how was prison awesome but it was well people say that about war to men yeah people say that about I think human beings need a certain amount of struggle and then when you experience that struggle then the non struggle feels so much better you know there's there's moments where I've talked about this before but I win like hunting in Alaska on this island Prince of Wales and it rained every day we were there for six days pouring rain drenched ever hunting yeah yeah it was the worst like as far as like getting wet and just being soaked and cold all the time - one of the worst experiences you could ever go through because you're just it's always like 4550 degrees pouring rain and you know your sleeping bags wet the inside of your tents wet everything's wet but when I came back I remember it was sunny out and I called my friend Steve Rinella who took me with him on this trip I go - I've never been happier in my life like the sun is shining like what I normally just totally take for granted exactly I was like it's amazing I love it I'm like I'm driving on the street I'm so I don't think I've ever been happier but I was that happy because I had gone through this struggle but nobody wants to do that on their own you know and when you're kind of forced into a situation I would imagine like being in prison then when you get that Kentucky Fried Chicken and you get that soda you're like wow we're fuckin livin it up right now yeah because I I came from a place they have this thing gets called fuck I forgot what it's called but I you have money in your books everybody has money and they do like a sell off for a logo to the local Vaughan's by the prison and they'll buy you can buy sodas cookies and pizza but nobody ever had Kentucky Fried Chicken in that bitch to this day that's like I want to put that in my in my like my bio at Kentucky Fried fucking chicken in prison [Music]
