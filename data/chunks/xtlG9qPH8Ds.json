hello freak bitches I've noticed that ever since I started making money guys sexually want to dominate me choke me that did happen in my twenties when I was broke dough when I was twenty Zimbra and my band broke guys wanted to coddle me in like eye contact and grab your face and weird it now that I have money I'm getting choked I got it I got a I got a tell me what this is I think I put his four fingers in my mouth and just leave him there for like two minutes what's that I don't know wash your hands I'm a seven year old she's sick because she touches things and then touches her mouth yeah well I mean just learned so much about you you could never be single by the way today you better make this marriage work forever cuz you're able to handle it cuz the hands in the mouth it's very unsanitary out there Joe Oh hands well I'm not worried about myself so he stuck his hand in my mouth I've spent every night the Comedy Store for ten years my immune system is on I know I shake about a thousand hands a night after all again sharing a microphone with 3300 Road comics every night does a number on your immune system I never knowed Zak it never gets it yeah shakin all those hands does it yeah really believe that yeah sharing a microphone with Jay London you're good for a wife yeah he's like Pigpen everyone's googling Jay London and no results found on Last Comic Standing so he stuck his hand in my mouth I was like this did not happen in my 20s and I and I'm thinking I might get right regarding me what I've lost the plot at this point right did you ask him right well I'm sitting there and I'm like just waiting for something like hey I'm gonna talk about this on a podcast I can't wait I'm not going to talk about to this and so I'm sitting there and I'm like and then for him and I was like maybe he lost his balance and he just like like had to commit to it cuz it'd be chewy really excited and then I was like maybe he was worried I was gonna speak or because I am the gracious one maybe he just wanted to stop me from talking I don't know what it was but this did not happen in my 20s and I was broke well in the face in your face that's dark yes was it a broke on its but you're French now actually is he wealthy yes hmm maybe more wealthy than you maybe here's the thing here's the thing here's the thing about my by this nebulous wealth that I have everyone thinks I have way more than I have and it's been in the press that I have all this money so I think guys that do have more money than me think I have more money than that which I sort of yes I see so maybe it was he thought I had more than I saw you want to spend yeah yeah he went to let go just so you know bitch with the Tesla you think you're so cute with your TV shows I'm about to fuckin treat you like a Thai hooker there are people that like that tho that's where it gets weird and if you date someone who likes weird shit yes and then you go to someone else didn't like you that was relatively sexually perverse and then dated someone who is very not and I was like way over shop tomorrow I'm gonna be single forever after this I guess I did have a guy one time cuz here's what you do now I need more coffee Jesus crazy when you the - graphic no um I feel like I'm covering a lot of the stuff that Neil deGrasse Tyson covered on this podcast are we being are we just let's talk about the moon landing you have to gag on dicks now no you don't yeah well if you don't you will be exorcised yes you will be your head will be pushed down yeah guys push your head down and your Tesla two blocks away why are you jamming my head on it and then so I just thought that's how you did it and then I dated this guy and I did that okay and he goes oh no no no oh my god I'm actually not turned on by girls hurting themselves because I remember like when 30 rock was going on I'd go out on a date with the girl and then like 30 minutes in the date she starts talking about her boyfriend I don't like why I'm like what are you talking about and and she's like oh I thought we were just you know going out for dinner on like friends and I'm like I'm like I asked you out it's Saturday night and I'm like so I go to her like are you like are you are you cheating on your boyfriend he not in him anymore and like he is he out of town or you guys have an open relationship she's like no he's here I'm like well where is he she's like over there why I got the apartment I'm like well fucking going here what the fuck you doing all here with me you know how many times this happened I have it a few times we're like really where girls would like want to like go out with me just to take pictures so they can like tell their Facebook friends I'm sure oh so they became friends with you because you were on telly so that romantically was I think when that stuff was happening that's awesome I'm just guessing here I don't have the exact answers I'm just thinking out loud but I think that's maybe he's sort of around the same time when I started worrying about like bloggers and shit like shitting on you know my friend Eddie has this theory about Bill Cosby about Bill Cosby when he started doing that to women uh-huh and he thinks that that might have been the similar type of situation where these women wanted to be around him but they are turning him down Oh gotcha and he started drugging them then he started raping him yeah yeah yeah that I just left yeah you're much better man than him but you know I mean that can happen where someone's attracted to you simply because you're a famous person right think well hey this is a girl that I'm romantically interested in they say yeah then you're at dinner so what the fuck man so you're talking to this girl you go hey you want to go out to dinner and she's like yeah that sounds good yeah yeah yeah and then all sudden you're on a date yeah it's telling you about her boy ed Saturday it's 10 o'clock yeah and you're thinking yeah look at you yeah yeah yeah this is gonna get some all right and she's like yeah my boyfriend's waiting for me yeah no she just casually mentioned him about something oh yeah my boyfriend's too this time like what yeah and this happens more than once yeah gonna go into movies and is gonna you know take off and become this she's fine either way but is she because do people want to see those movies the same way they wanted to see those movies when she was smashing Alexis Davis and armbar and Miesha Tate knocking out bitch go heya dude is there that same draw well I'll say this I don't think people are going to Rhonda movies cuz she's a phenomenal actress that make sense like I'm not going to see Ron's movie you got to see her you got to see her act and this she is amazing she is because she's amazing because she's supposedly the baddest woman on the planet yes now holly holm shut her down yeah so now holly is thought to be the baddest woman on the plan correct right correct if unless she fights cyborg if they figure out a catchweight fight you know and in MMA that's really the big scary fight for her for sure you know and she said she would fight her yeah she's fought at 152 in boxing you know Holly Holm she's she's gangster but I mean I think other than what would you do if you were if you were the promoter let me ask you this what would you do if I'm Dana White yes scrooge mcduck I fire Reebok right now by the way I say McDuck ice-crazy scrooge mcduck like three or four times a week now strictly because of you yeah he sent me this text the other day with a picture of Scrooge McDuck sitting on a pile of gold and I was just laughing laughing my I love that character the fight like you did with Chad then we got the biggest fight you know we aspire of all-time wild shit but the thing is is if you look at the if I found my businessman I'm not as much wrong I'm a businessman Conor winning is the golden ticket yeah I'm sorry one play to cuz Josie you know he's gonna be around that much longer right but there's never been a guy like Connor before the UFC's been fine like you don't need none necessarily the best thing before I'm Dana still scrooge mcduck son I'm not I'm not saying he goes broke but I don't even think it's just talked about the new heights I don't think so a sea of gold I can love that guy I just never thought about it till you started bringing up Scrooge McDuck I never thought about that cartoon it's random as whatever you talk about money like I ain't Scrooge McDuck watch that's right Scrooge McDuck you a lot of money ball and son
