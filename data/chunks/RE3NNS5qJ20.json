the girag and experience this may transition into a tsa r and i apologize if it does because it's still fresh yeah well we are talking about that and the biggest fucking government works program that's really going on right now our tax dollars going to create a system to create jobs to demean us and make us feel like criminals for wanting to take a flight yeah a program that is inefficient ineffectual by thousands of not thousands that's hyperbole by hundreds of sordid papers that is inefficient ineffectual that demeans us that leads to lobbyists and government kickbacks for these corporations that make machines that scan us and take nude photos essentially for the focus is we all did do it for the folks that do the TSA it is a shit job you're dealing with people that don't want to be there absolutely dealing with people that don't want to comply and in their defense look there's that fucking classic Stanford study that we brought up over and over again of what happened when they just had college students have one person in charge or the war the other person is yeah the prisoner when they when you do that people abuse petrie radiation it to me is is a moot point like yeah I don't think I deserve it if I don't rights violation it's a rights violation plus the rapid scan corporation which is one of the two big corporations that had like you know the 70 million dollar contracts to install these machines they were funding Chertoff who was the ex-head of the Homeland Security Administration like they've increased their lobbying 55 buy like fifty percent or something since 2008-2010 that was the last study i read so lord knows how much money they're spending now to kick to give kickbacks to people in power to do these no-bid contracts to put in these machines which by the way most most security and defense experts tell you that it can't actually detect the plastic explosives that could blow up at 747 like they can't actually detect it plus there was a case in Florida just not only black probably two years ago where hundreds of thousands of the photos from people going through those machines because it does store photos even though it doesn't display them those photos were hacked and it was they said we don't store these photos they don't get taken but they have a nude picture of you somewhere around I think metal detectors are good I do I think the idea of checking your barracks is good there's too many cons there are certainly there are certainly there should be a standard of protection you know how do you want to scan the baggage that's fine but I think we've drawn the line way too far we've drop the x-ray machine in the austin airport it's right next to one of those rapid scan body scanning machines right and there is a long line for the rapid scan machine corn that's when they say oh that lines get long come on through the x-rays so right away I'm like you know what if this is integral to my safety you're now chucking my safety out the window for the convenience factor of cycling people through security well they really sang that it's not safe means I relive it Aang the rapid scan thing or the no no no they're serious about safe talk about if we need those those body scanning machines because they can detect a whole bunch of stuff that a traditional x-ray can't oh is that when it gets too inconvenient because the line is too long you're now throwing my safety out the window that seems inconsistent sounds wrong right crazy but I'm in line to go through the x-ray and then randomly they do that you need to go through the rapids game machine so I said can I just go through the x-ray no you can't now they're angry with me because they even ask that so I opted out as I normally do my belongings go through the machine now I can't see them I say hey I can't see my laptop I can't see my phone I can't seem to that stuff it's over there your love your belongings are fine how do I know that I can't see them they didn't give anybody to do it so I'm already on edge right I always it it always feel like whenever I take a fucking JetBlue flight this is gonna be my occupy moment it's gonna end with pepper spray to the face and I'm gonna get handcuffed even though miss polite as can be right and I just I just want someone to watch my shit right I get stuck in a glass box where I'm next to a girl that could have been more than six years old she has a handicap she's in a wheelchair and there was something mentally wrong with her she was stemming she was rocking she was pulling her hair and crying because there were three TSA agents trying to tell her to lift her arms so they can swab her clothes swab her wheelchair the back pad the tires the wheels everything her dad is there on the brink you can imagine how traumatic it is to try to bring somebody a special needs child through an airport in general but now they've been selected for special screening and he has to try to explain to his daughter who's having a fit rightfully so as strangers are groping her and you know swiping swabbing her seat he's trying to calm her down while we know by holding an ipad in her face and doing whatever he can to get her to relax do I have to lift her out of the CTS yes you do he's trying to lift her up she's fighting it my heart is breaking for this guy the reason I'm sitting in this glass box is because after my pat-down they ran my little piece of cloth or they the gloves and a piece of cloth that they swiped the bottom of my feet with through a machine like by the way machines which we spent more than 30 million dollars on to install in airports and this machine said I tested positive for nitrates I had that happen one yeah and I pulled up of so what's a nitrate well sir it's a you know that could be used it's a chemical okay what does that mean well it's a chemical be used in a lot of things it doesn't this isn't it's not a bad thing it's not a bad thing like this isn't a problem and I go no it is a problem because I have a flight to catch and I want to know like why I'm being detained longer well you tested positive for nitrate so I have to give you an even more thorough screening okay well what what else can test positive for nitrates guy couldn't answer it second person couldn't answer a third person asked you if you had been to a farm no they did not but the third guy finally said well the head of the the security mob there said well if you've walked on grass that has fertilizer on it then you might test positive for nitrates even certain heart medications at seniors taken test positive for nitrates so I'm now stuck in a glass box detached from my valuables watching this poor girl having a meltdown as these three people are you know going all over and I start to cry cuz it just it breaks my heart that this is happening this poor guy is having to go through this and I you know I go to put my hand on his shoulder and tell him like I'm sorry you have to go through this and he looks back and he's choked up I mean he's been in there for a good 15 minutes trying to calm down his daughter so then I start questioning why are you guys doing this and I'm being polite I'm being calm being everything you could possibly be well asking how much longer this is going to take because I have a flight to catch they grabbed my belongings and start walking them away and I go excuse me what are you doing like you're coming here to this private screening room no no I don't want to be in a private screening room I want this enhanced pat-down to happen right here because I want my girlfriend a videotape it but no no no sir you're going by this time my belongings are in the frosted glass private screening room now I'm in the private screening room with them and there's a giant placard that says this is a private security room there is no filming whatsoever if a trenta the TSA employee tells you to stop filming you must seats filming immediately you do have the right to call in a witness to be there and I'm thinking why can't the camera be my witness because if I'm traveling alone I else am I gonna call fucking ghostbusters am I gonna bring TSA in here so I'm in a glass box with two dudes by myself he swabs me down with the gloves and he says I'll be right back i have to test this glove goes puts his hand on the handle of the door with the glove on it that he just wiped me down opens it up and walks out on his merry way so I looked to the other guy who's left in the room I'm like what the fuck was that and it was like the first time I had cursed and he goes what do you mean I'm like he just swab my body down with that glove then grabbed the handle if someone in her earlier did have explosives on them and he grabbed that handle with that glove that's now on my test why isn't he testing right here there's a machine in the room Oh sir that that machine's calibration is off that's why it's here it have it in the room cuz the calibration laughs yeah there's a tag on it that says it needs to be serviced okay so i'm waiting five minutes go by I'd strike up conversation with a guy hate that little girl out there in the wheelchair that's having the fit and I can still hear her having a poor meltdown out there why are they out there well he tested positive for nitrates as well oh he did yeah why is the girl there oh she tested positive for nitrates oh so all three of us have tested positive for nitrates with the one machine that's out there you got another one in here that needs servicing and recalibration and you think there's nothing wrong with this situation guy comes back tells me I'm clear I leave the room and I see the father is still there struggling with his daughter and I'm like I'm again like moved to tears and I asked this guy tell me as a human being do you think this is right do you think this treatment for this poor girl is right and he goes sir she tested positive for nitrates and went right I get that but there are many other countries who deal with terrorism on a far greater level than we do who have far more but swifter and more and more common sense approach to security that doesn't demean their citizenry that doesn't cost them millions of taxpayer dollars do you think that that's right that that girl is having a meltdown your swabbing her wheelchair you really think she's a terrorist I'm just asking as a human being and there was a long pause and he sort of looked down and looked at his shoes and I thought good I'm finally gonna have a moment a real moment here as a human being he's gonna take off that TSA helmet for a second and he looked up and looked me right in the eyes and said she tested positive for nitrates that's when I realized this is it this is a lost cause this is a losing battle you
