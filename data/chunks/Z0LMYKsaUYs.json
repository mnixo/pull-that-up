I got too high for 3:02 one mr. Hannigan you were talking in the background yeah Brian Hannigan is he's worried about the link he's waiting for Oh Joe Rogan's dot live yeah I should tweet it right didn't get we didn't tweet it I'll tweet it while I'm talking to you Douglas Stanhope the mayor of Bisbee Wow you're at becoming the mayor of LA that should be your thing man three hundred square miles of studio space Twitter I knew when I pulled up well what the uber dropped us at the wrong place but then we walked a few buildings down and I saw a pickup truck loading epsom salt into a side door I go yeah that's flotation tank shit right there we get the right door yeah that's exactly that's going live with this I only did flotation tank once for a shoot at your house for the man show and you had the one in the house and we were doing it for a shoot so you can't really sit back and enjoy it but for that 30 seconds they shut the door until they go action yike wow this is fucking weird it's fucking weird it's weird and it never stops being weird like even though I've done it I don't know how many times every time I do it it's fucking weird it just it's a very strange feeling and you could shut it off anytime you want that's the best part about it like I love the fact they could just get out of it like if I if you want to do shrooms or something like that that's a commitment I mean you're in you're in six eight hours you know you should know where you're going or who's gonna call or stop by yeah you can't that you you're not shaking that you're just not it's gonna get you I tweeted it beautiful yeah but the tank you just get out it's awesome just open the door it's over I'm sure there's some kind of upkeep that's necessary that I wouldn't do and I'd forget I'd go on the road and I come back and there's bushes growing in there and you know what you should do you should start a tank center and Bisbee if you nobody has money in Bisbee you know it doesn't have to cost a lot of money you get like one or two tanks and you just rent them out all day long yeah it's again it's people have a disability is the biggest form of income there I bet insurance will pay for it maybe I made that up it's probably check I think that they'll well I think it's a form of therapy for sure still the point is and I'm not good at upkeep I know you don't have to be a buff ground pool that is just nothing but algae for eight months out of the year dude I moved into our house once in Encino and nobody had lived in it for our guests like over a year and they didn't do anything with the pool and the pool had become this green pond and there was schools of mosquito larvae swimming around in the pool like I was like what in the fuck is that like you could see them it was that's weirdest thing man that's a problem with the herd getting rid of the fucking thing it was a real problem like I was looking I was like you've got a like a big stew of life out here there's so many mosquitoes it was crazy there were like little schools of fish I was like this is madness all these little things are blood sucking little vampires they're gonna fly around and find things to bite and where I live there's no other body of water for a hundred miles other than my above grab something crazy those little cunts you can't kill them off they just find a way to just breed and and like back east they're way worse yeah they're way worse than they are here is something about the weather out here I guess that keeps them in check the worst by far is Alaska that I've experienced have you ever experienced yeah holy shit man you get out of the car they just swarm you like huge huge and super aggressive and they only live to be like three months old so when they're going for it they're just fuckin going for it it's like some wolf shit it's like survival the fittest with but it's the weirdest thing ever they're like they're a different thing like we have an idea Oh mosquitoes yeah they're annoying they get you slob oh no no no no no no no no this is a swarm this is hundreds of them in your face in your eyes all over your mouth everywhere instantly yeah we have no seeum say the pool was cool when we got that house it's above ground but it's on a slope so there's a deck on one side so it seems like an above-ground pool because you're above the pool but it's still an above-ground pool and it's only four feet deep or something right but once monsoons hit look at that oh my god that's mosquitoes in Alaska we're looking at what looks like a swarm of birds that's the worst part about naked and afraid if you ever watch that show is the bugs I could go a month without eating I do that anyway I'm a drunk I get my calories from the mixer you do you have to stay naked like can you make clothes I don't know how much they cheat oh no they have made clothes man clothes yeah I don't know how much they yeah the producer says okay you can make the beaver cloth but you can't make a full like hoodie they do it with every one of those shows they'll call those shows reality shows but there's a certain amount of like plotted out ideas and you can see them take place like you can see like the act you see acting in people I have a whole chunk in the book that I'm here to promote I see but about its how I I glued to reality just to find where they're lying alright that's obviously Fame I like the name yeah I don't know who came up with it that's beautiful fuck yeah dude you're an author like a legit author how'd that happen I don't know you know like you've written to like legitimate books that's pretty fucking interesting man that's a you're a different kind of person to do that like that's of us felt like an extra one of the things that I love is you actually wrote this too yeah you wrote wrote this yeah there's no yeah guy yeah what no there's nothing wrong with those guys cuz that's probably the only way you're gonna get a Joey Diaz book right right yeah guys I'm not gonna write it right yeah get a guy get a guy well Joey Diaz could sit and tell you all their stories yeah you could tell them right and if you have a guy I'm just I could never trust anyone to write so hard so hard I've talked to so many authors or writers a journalist even that they'll hand in a piece and then the editor tweaks it changes it and an editor got fired from the Daily News for doing that pretty recently because the guy had attributions in his story the different studies and shit where where he got the information that was in there whatever the verb and then he got to choose plagiarism when he has the original document that he sent to the publisher oh so the editor was the plagiarist the editor just decides we all need to tell people about that they made a weird judgment call and they removed the references well you know when you do interviews how often they fuck up what you said yeah I remember I was the winner of the Montreal comedy couple like there's no winner in 1997 no one wins it's yeah they don't understand what that means but yeah if you if if you read which I don't unprecedented I didn't say that now you're making me look like a dick and other comics are gonna see this interview and I didn't say it like that you're like the only guy that ever won a comedy competition that people don't hate you know cuz you won San Francisco like everybody but that was after that was done like there was you know it wasn't a big deal and it wasn't very nice hook yeah but we were both completely unknown at that right right but still you weren't unknown in the comedy world but the competition itself in the late 70s 80s was a huge deal that's when Robin Williams and Ellen DeGeneres run by the time I did it it was me and an unknown Dane Cook Bryant I think competitions are fucking weird when it comes to comedy like that's a you're changing what it is I like the festival idea festival is nice we don't have to make it fucking Star Search or whatever whatever you know America's Got Talent it's it's it's a show that's what the country wants you know but here's it did introduce a lot of people like when they started doing the the stand-up show the fuck it is Last Comic Standing Last Comic Standing was the introduction a lot of people got to a lot of good comics you know I mean that's how people found out about them yeah but as long as you know going in that this is rigged yeah when your disorder I just did Seattle I played up there while the Seattle competition was going on in a girl I know was in it and I had to like no you first of all play to yourself the judges are gonna be people like fucking morning show hack a.m. Sports Talk DJ whoever they can get it's not real just do your best if it makes you work that's why I liked him back in the day because it made me work it made brevity important I have seven minutes cut out the dead weight in this joke get it you know hit your fucking beats and but I knew that it's bullshit yeah yeah man it's some I'm sure I won because I was way cooler than Dane Cook and I hung out and drunk which drank with the fucking producers and what wait a minute why would you say that I mean wouldn't just win because you did a great job really a funny human beings aren't oh utilizable what at San Francisco aren't they a little bit more open-minded and intelligent in the rest of the country what the people that hire the judges that producer I forget her name that I hung out with the whole three weeks and we drink and have fun it probably helped but they appreciated you before that I was the judge a year or two later when I don't want you being self-deprecating with James Inman one I was a judge but you wanted my audience when James Inman won I was a judge any other question comic Jackson's a funny guy but hey look my point is Last Comic Standing let a lot of people know yeah Alonzo Bodden you know half round Johnny it was the first year he lost to that fan which I said on Twitter is what killed him he couldn't get over the shame even 20 years later 15 his dad fans still around I've looked him up and I every here and again you remember dat fan and you search to see and there's occasionally he'd be playing a casino he was a guy that I felt like there's some really unbalanced hatred towards it was very odd when he won last Comic Standing people were really mad there was a certain percentage of comics that were really mad and let me tell you something I was there when he had a set and he fucking killed he fucking killed whether or not you'd like that kind of material or not there was like he got up a bunch of hatred who was wasn't just he was you know a young guy like wow what was it cuz Eliza beone Last Comic Standing when she was like 3 years in right I think she said did she didn't she say that 3 or 4 years in I hope I don't say the wrong years but I mean that's kind of the same thing along the same lines right like you're getting in like but if you do it you do it sure yet 8 minutes they kill you could break it up and for whatever reason man people are so pissed at him because he was kind of fresh to comedy right here and well it was ridiculous he was as one of those scientists you hate he sat down and he'd graphed the laughs per minute he's getting based on his recordings of his sets and really did that yeah don't on Last Comic Standing he'd have these graphs of laughs mmm that's interesting why do we I hate that I don't know we were talking about this on a podcast yesterday we're like the all the people that you were trained to hate were talking about like carrot top and the 90s how you hated carrot top as a comedian you can add to hate him and then he beat Bill Hicks for some comedy award back when they had Comedy Awards what's also the prop thing for whatever reason a prop comic is a lesser man right but he's the last guy that's gonna interfere with us he no one's flipping a coin between carrot top and Joe Rogan well yeah and but I think there's enough to go around even if they were like why no this shit but I'm saying all that hatred and we were talking about Denis Leary who I listened to on Stern and I really loved the interview and I like Denis Leary and I realize it was just all that he stole Bill Hicks persona thing that I just hated him for that and right you get old and and you go I don't really give a shit yeah and when do you let it go right yeah when do you let it go when we're old and go yeah what the fuck really yeah we were joking around before the show about how to send off an email and you know like he's probably talking to someone on Twitter or no fuck your mother like imagine and that guy that's just still doing that all the time like god damn man that'll rot you I talked to Owen Benjamin he's like dude sometimes I don't sleep I'm like listen to me man you got to stop doing that because Owen will fucking go to war on Twitter all day and Jamie kills Dean Jamie kills teen was on and he was pretty open about like how he would be when he was all social justice warrior doubt he'd get crazy with his phone in these arguments where he couldn't think of anything but who's constantly pulling he's going out checking and what did they say what they say well fuck them you fucking cisgender piece of shit or whatever the fuck would be you get mad with it you get obsessed I just say don't do it folks avoid arguments in real life especially when you're arguing down you might be you know you might be like going to war with someone who's on your own level yeah argue I there's a couple of recent things where friends of mine are arguing you know that you look like a fucking open mic er when you when you have these arguments in business with people who are far your underlings yeah well just I mean I just really feel like we should try for meaningful discussion with friendly people and just figure out what the fuck we disagree on but that's where I get trapped is I'm the guy that when the jehovah's witness comes to my door started to find in the mood I'm gonna I'm gonna prove them wrong and the less sense they make the harder that fucking wood is to knock on dude a store they used to be my thing I'd always want to argue with people about especially about like if someone like I had some ridiculous religious belief I would always argue with them about it and now I'm like I don't I don't care like as long as I'm nice I think it's I think it helps a lot of people I really do and even if they're not right here's the thing if you live like it's true it is right while you're alive if you live like it's true like we look at it like almost from two dimensions when there's like multiple dimensions to the idea of religion because even though it probably there was never a time where a guy came back from the dead there's probably never a time I walked on water but if you buy the idea of this person and this person's goal for Humanity and move towards the directions like moving towards love and compassion and treating each other as equals I mean that's like the whole Jesus thing so even if it's it never really took a weird superstition that was the catalyst to make you a decent person yeah I think like all human things it gets poisoned along the way but the idea behind it if even if you don't think it's true if you treat it like it's true it is true like you really will make a better world it sounds like super hippy no that's twisty watches if you have a some mental illness that makes you believe that you're driving a Cadillac you're driving a fucking Cadillac but you know how we have laws and we have like certain ways that we behave and we have just like agreements with how we dress and the words we use the phrases if there was a religion that was all super positive that we just all agreed to adopt just the same way we adopt all the other things that we do in our lives all the other normal shit we do with like the way we decide to dress or cars we drive just adopt that in there too like this is this is just how we behave we behave as this we as if we are souls in a vessel created by the great one who knows everything and has a plan for us all and we should be kind to each other and move in the direction of love and harmony that's basically what all religions there be some cocksucker that says oh yeah that great entity just spoke to me directly in my bedroom and we're gonna have a different sect of this perfect religion there's a fucking funny show on Netflix about that the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt that was a woman who was in a sex cult it was in a like a backyard like trapped in a basement for like months with some I don't know I don't know how this years I think it was supposed to be it's a really funny show though have you seen it wait is it a show a show it's a sitcom on Netflix it's called the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt I think Tina Fey is one of the people the creative people honey fucking funny show man like really fine I'm so overdue to get caught up on Netflix binges oh man yeah I seems I got it's been two years of just as something I got to do I need new ones I need to catch up on old ones plug Nathan for you have you watched Nathan for you on Comedy Central no what is it is one of the funniest fucking shows ever completely underrated you have to understand what it is going in it's basically like a bar rescue but a fake it's basically a hidden-camera show but open hidden camera it's like a bar rescue Kitchen Nightmares Nathan what's God damn it google it Nathan something Jewish Nathan fielder Nathan Fielder and he's a yes he does like it's for small business he he helps small businesses this guy it's he's so uncomfortable to watch I can't do it justice you have to watch Nathan for you so these people with small businesses think it's a real show and they they come on and he helps them with their problems and it's it's it's so amazingly layered in watch the one with the the guy that has the TV shop that can't compete with Best Buy and there's so many layers I put it on my phone all right trust you implicitly please watch it and then tweet about it because it's fucking brilliant and I'll just embarrass it by trying to explain it if there's anything any problem that I have with Netflix is that sometimes I don't know what I'm looking for you know like there's a lot of shows that turned out like whoa there's four seasons of this and you never heard of it like maybe it's just me maybe I'm that and it's totally possible because there's always some fucking new musical artist and I go who the fuck is that and I'll go to their Instagram page they have 14 million followers and I'm like oh it's me I'm that old man I'm that old man who doesn't know jack shit we had a the uber coming here was this old probably Armenian guy probably 60s racist Chandra that's got the show he he's listening to what I assume he thinks people want to listen to and it's all this shit I couldn't name you a fucking jay-z from that kind of shit I don't know any of it and I'm about to say hey you don't have to play this for us but then I uh I saw him lip-synching to the lyrics and tapping his fingers Oh on the steering wheel I'm like wow how out of the loop am I if fucking 60-year old foreign opened uber drivers know all the words to these fucking songs but you've never been a music guy no you don't like music no it's not something that's not possible I mean I have songs I like you know what's a great song like Doug Stanhope here's your little oh yeah sits back most of the new songs that I've learned I've either heard playing in a store or on a commercial that's catchy cha-cha-cha-cha don't you know that I love you yeah cha-cha-cha by a Jimmy luxury yeah it's from like 1997 it was on the soundtrack of the movie go and then they disappeared you can't even find where the band is now but it was on a corona commercial and why I love it and I use it as intro music all the time it pumps me up there you go sing a song well it give me some volume see I'm just seeing the video on mute on into this song this is great this is great don't you know that I love you now always thinking of you I like how these gals are dress like they're 1950's cover girls what is about that look right that like cover you know pin-up girl that's what's called 1950s pin-up girl type of look what is it about that feeling maybe it makes fat chicks look good how dare you Doug Stanhope do you not realize it was a different day and age you can't say that anymore those days are done what what's wrong with a fat girl looking good what's wrong with you you latest I just found out what ablest means do you know ablest I side read I saw someone write a bus I'm like do I really want to go in and they say it's gotta be a handi-capable exactly you are a person that doesn't mention the words yeah if you are mocking someone who is like literally stupider know what gege in a high back chair exactly you're you're an ableist if you call people idiots you're an ableist yeah what about that was my last special I did a whole bit about it's called the euphemism treadmill where you can't say retarded because but retarded was the clinical term because before that they were called imbeciles and morons or they were called mongoloid idiots yeah and then it was for kids with downstate kept changing and then we kept making fun of them with the new name said they had to change the new name to something else and then we'd make fun of with the new name under the punchline to the entire long bit was you know if you went straight clinical definition American Medical Association and you said oh and you made that stick that's what I'm gonna make fun of you for when you slip on a banana peel oh you exhibited some of the atlanta axial instability usually associated with the trisomy 21 genetic disorder your fucking stooge that's not funny by said was bored with the trisomy 21 chromosomal imbalance yeah there's certain things you can make fun of though right yeah white people white people are failing fair game you can be racist as fuk sure especially if you're a white guy he's like making fun of lawyers they laugh along with you cuz they own everything yeah lawyers are a good one to make fun of but you can't make fun of Jews well yeah a Jew is just one of those words where it's all in the inflection as to whether or not you fucking Jew whoa right it's all pay no you know the Jews are people that that's right but if you say Joe yeah like you say if you say I'm all about Jews that's ok yeah I'm all about Jews I just like hanging out with Jews that's it only Jews people go you're in the right town like you'd be ok like that's alright people accept that but it feel like god I'm tired all these Jews unacceptable unacceptable why I overdosed on Jews I was just around nothing but Jews for like months and so many I wanted Armenian in my life for a few days I don't talk to somebody I never do sets if I come to town and I'm hanging at the Comedy Store it's to talk to you and drinking the back bar and hang out hey do you want to do a set no fucking way wow do I ever want to do a set for normal people i I paid my fucking dues I made my bones to have a small niche fanbase that are unoffending Doug I Got News for you ok I hate to do this to you again but they're here like your fans are here yeah your fans are if you fans are in LA they would love it if you did a set they're like it's not like they wouldn't go there they're like you have a lot of fans you fuckhead I know I got the way to sell like a wall niche group that's horseshit people know you're funny I'm tired of this I'm talking about when it's just a mixed bill scatter shot this 400 people I bet 320 of them are your fans first of all you know this well you still do some shit I saw you last time I saw you you were doing one of those weird shows where people just called out premises yeah stand up on the spot and you fucking destroyed it and you told me afterwards none of that was planned you had none of that in your holster all of that was off the top of your head which is fantastic it was high as a kite I barely knew what I was saying it's like for me to do material I can't do 15 minutes I don't have I have one bitch give me a mental hug just coming to the embrace of the comedy store just stop this is this why is why what I do is outside of my own comfort zone I don't you aren't your comfort zone your comfort zone is everywhere if I went up on stage if I came to town which I rarely do I get to see you in a million people I never see all in one room and everybody loves to see you too but if I went on stage then I would have this whole anxiety well that sucked and I then I'd be apologizing for my set oh great set says Greg Proops or someone and then you're like it wasn't good I forgot this tag in that tag and I rather than just hanging out and enjoying myself so fuck it fuck it so here's the thing though and this is I'm going to say this with all sincerity there's more understanding and camaraderie at the store right now than any place I've ever been at any time and even when we have bad sets like people out some of them have a bad set like how was it dude I could did not connect with those people like someone will say you know will rather do it Phil Arkansas than the Comedy Store somewhere no one will see it you talk about it and you learn something from it and you it's like it's a weird environment but it fosters new shit it fosters new ideas and taglines and which i was going to say about twitter battles i got so much good material out of fighting these whatever it was at the time myspace Twitter Facebook before that news groups and getting into these angry ugly arguments what I'm writing I'm writing paragraphs in defensive and guess what oh I have 15 minutes because some stooge annoyed me on a alt dot comedy dots and news group and I spent all night fighting accidentally wrote a new Act that's actually probably a good use of it if you could see you and I are very different in that regard I would rather just not talk to those people but if you did want to go to war which I used to do you can get some material out of that for sure because you're forcing yourself to think like any time you're forced yourself to like I found it like the best shit that I ever write I write completely free form where I don't know I just like like I'll I'll just start thinking about any subject and just start writing I'm not specifically trying to write jokes and on the way I can like kind of suck those jokes out of there do you do that like how well it depends on the the premise but the best premises I have I write like a defense attorney so in the jokes after once the justice has left yes the courtroom all rise then you put in the fist fuck jokes yeah there's there's a gut it's super important to have a balance right and you got to find out where that balance is like when you can get away with a premise you know you got to stack it just right like you just stack it the wrong way one way and you look like you're patronizing and you're full of shit stack it the wrong way the other way you look at your sexist you have a Republican and secret oh man do I have notes the new current current climate yeah I'm sure right imagine working for a television show I wanted to bring this up I'm glad we just got to talking about this Sam cedar got fired yesterday I missed this so Chloe I just saw someone Sam cedar who's a heavy left-wing fellow who was apparently in some sort of a dispute with the alt-right I don't know what was going on I think it was about Roy more like just one of those things and they pulled up a tweet of his and took it out of context from 2009 yeah sweet was I'm gonna paraphrase it I don't wanna fuck it up Jamie actually Jamie pull it up so we can find the exact tweet you know that if you paraphrase it you're gonna sound funnier than he would if I was gonna edit your act this is how it said did you find it here's essentially what it is if you can't find the hook you got to find it you got to find the cuz I don't want to count this up I can't tell you how many times I've told Hennigan about now this comic you got to see this is a great comic they do this bit and I do the bit for him and he's like oh that's funny and and then he sees that me oh you do it so much better those other guys go too many words he's usin too many words I was Irish and that melted into retarded distracting you with the middle premise but anyway MSNBC got a swarm of emails like these people like attacked you know these alt right fellows attacked and started saying that this guy had tweeted a which essentially a rape joke and that we would never sponsor you and we're gonna like contact your sponsors this would he said you got a thing covering over the it's that picture of it don't care oh I don't care re Polanski but I hope if my daughter is ever raped by an older truly talented man with a great set oh hi but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man with a great sense of me Sons is all seen MS own scenes that's what it is is this here's the part here's part of the problem he deleted this which he regrets doing but it's a part of a series of tweets all of them that criticized people support of Roman Polanski because Roman Polanski had raped kids but he did really good films and he was like y'all fucking disgusting that is he was essentially saying this is a horrific way to look at this like this guy raped a baby right here ape like a third ten-year-old yeah right so this was a part of a series of tweets all expressing this and that was clearly satire and MSNBC capitulated and they fired him and I you know I don't know him I know people who do know him some that like him you know and it's uh I just is not I don't have a dog in this fight but that's crazy that's crazy if you look at what this the joke was and then the fact that he deleted it and then on top of that via is he apologizing for it no he's not he's good he's not what he did was he made a video explaining what the joke was why said it and the the fact that it was a part of a series of tweets that he said but it doesn't matter once that fucking outrage machine I was just asked if I regret my tweet from 2009 I regret laziness led me to delete it I would never regret criticizing rape apologists and I agree with that fantastic I don't know Sam cedar I don't either but I know that he could probably start a podcast and make a decent living and not have to work for someone yeah I was gonna fire him well yeah I think he has his own show Minority Report right isn't that his own show is that his own internet show cuz that's what he log it yeah and you know and here's the other thing he isn't he had a dispute more than once I believe with my good friend Sam Harris and he accused Sam Harris of being a name sounds familiar Sam Harris and neuroscientists some people don't like that term they don't he's an author's runs has a podcast he's essentially an intellectual very very very smart guy one of the smartest guys ever have my podcast so what was their beef Sam Harris believes that all ideologies are inherently dangerous in Islam is very problematic and many people on the Left think that when you criticize Islam that you are some sort of a racist you're akin to a racist whereas if you criticize Christianity here someone is just not a rube right against that weird thing because of brown skin and people's desire to not be perceived as racist so they go way overboard with it and which is what's happening with the me too thing where you go I see all the benefits of people coming out and it's putting the fear in a fuck in everybody who let me know I fucked twenty years ago no but I just wanted to just for Sam's sake like he's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination he doesn't like ideologies he doesn't like something that makes you think that God wants you to kill people he doesn't want I mean whether or not you interpret that the way the Christians do I mean there's not a lot of people killing people over some shit from the fuckin Old Testament you know there's no one out there in the acting the rate the rate of God for people wearing two different types of cloth right because Christians are generally better off and what you get yeah once you get a lot of fuckin toys and yeah you dismiss a lot of that I should kill myself in the name of blank that's a fucking good point you know and I've always wondered if you look at like the Middle East you're not looking at like rush lush tropical forests and beautiful beaches like Brazil you know where everybody's happy and they want to play fucking volleyball on the beach and do jujitsu everybody's having a party no it's not Saudi princes yeah they wear that garb but then once they get behind the gold-plated palace doors yeah there's dicks is swinging and fucking champagne flowing but outside it's all just sand right more people yeah that have nothing better that's why jesus works in the Mideast I mean Midwest where you're in fucking Indiana and you have fields to plow and it's gonna be shitty gray angry weather and yeah maybe Jesus is the only thing getting you through another year another harvest and you put a marble on the highway and it just sits there you thump it it doesn't keep rolling there's no hills bitch there's no hell that's fucking worst Indiana is the worst state in the country but even in Indiana if they found gold then it became like Qatar some shit they just you know they found oil they felt like some crazy new patch of oil and all of a sudden they started building the world's tallest building there and all the same kind of shit they do and Dubai we Dubai apparently is insane now they have indoor surfing things and Dubai they know they're out you get a surfboard and you're indoor surfing you could ski indoors they have indoor skiing DUPLO and you're gonna have that here in the compound do you have a name for this new oil establishment it's kind of worn yeah and but plus I think Anthony Cunha Anthony Cunha who I have to give his props to he's probably the reason why I started a podcast it was first of all cuz he's a part of Opie and Anthony which was the first time I ever thought like I really like doing radio the way Opie and Anthony ended it it was great we would come in you have doing it too right yeah I remember first doing it going wow am I the shitty episode because no one really talked a lot we just had fun I know why it took me a minute yeah oh they just decided to do what they wanted to do with radio I just thought I was boring because there's no bells and whistles and fake laughs and to this day I don't think Opie and Anthony got the credit that I deserved because I think that they led us they led us like they're the best show they were the best show ever they don't exist anymore unfortunately but they were the best show ever to go on is it did they exist in their own world they do I know that he does know still has he was recently fired I don't I don't know what I just know as they started his own thing know if he kind of Norton's still doing his thing with Sam Norton is Lauren still doing this thing with Sam and Norton does a thing with the UFC - does UFC uncensored with Matt Serra which is hilarious and Norton also does the chip chip person podcast he does all that on his own now yeah I've never listened to it but I've been tweeted about it enough to know that it's a character it's hilarious it's so uncomfortable it's so good it's one of my favorite things that he does it's fucking amazing you want to see a video of it right now we're in a live broadcast no but I'll pull it up somehow I hated making people listen to 30 seconds of cha-cha-cha it was good I liked it good let people know a lot of people don't know there's a lot of shit people don't know you know there's only one way to find out someone else to tell you I find out from commercials that will help that work you know I know Corona still sucks as a beer but I like the song that you use Thank You Dario are they smiling to Carano with lime from in subtropical climate and I want a beer but I don't really want a beer yeah I want a soda but I want to stay drunk you know what a Moscow Mule is yeah what is that it's some drink they there was a surplus of copper at the time so the guy in order to get rid of copper said oh you have to drink it out of a copper cup and it was just a big ruse and now copper it's gonna be in a copper cup and I don't know how they did that with Corona and a lime oh no you put a lime in this beer yeah that's true right why does it have a lime and every now and then someone sticks a la minute Dos Equis you know like what what is this wow you've become judgmental yeah drinking years yeah I get weird you know I'll get weird when it comes to drinks but Corona is not a bad beer it's just not a strong beer it's it's fine when I'm in a place that's dark I like to drink real shit I like to drink like an IPA or Guinness or Jack Daniels that's what I like to drink in a darkened I like a dark wood environment this is shitty neon lights this your studio is a great dark this is a bar that I would go to I would go dark hardwood bar it's a little bright I feel like it's kind of annoying in this place it's like if you know cameras weren't on well it considerably drinking this is know if you came out of that bright sunlight oh yeah yeah this we came into this yeah yeah brick especially outside which by the way might get hot here any minute now there is a fucking fire in Ventura and the winds are insane right now and the fire through Ventura is just tearing things apart we've got the alert on my phone in the uber drive over be careful warning warnings bad man I mean it's bad and it scares the shit out of me because I did some where yes there's that for sure but what it scares the shit out of me is that in the short term I think most people are gonna get out of there if they prepare and move accordingly but you got to you got to realize what this is like this is something that when you get a fire of this size it's burned back that up a little bit so you get the numbers just in today it's burned 45,000 acres destroyed at least 150 structures and forced 20,000 people 27,000 people to evacuate and they can't stop it they don't have enough manpower when something is this big and it's this strong and the winds are this fucking crazy you look at how those trees are blowing over sideways and these fucking houses are up in flames and it's how do they even have enough water I don't have no idea I live City Hall just burned down the City Hall building and just them putting the fire out everyone's water went out this is not enough water you couldn't turn on your taps because they used it all to put out City Hall I wonder if there's like a chart where you could see we could go back to 911 and in post 9/11 how many women got impregnated by firefighters like how many because remember when firefighters like after 9/11 remember they were real heroes yeah no people have kind of like taking them for granted until they do something to actually save your house I used to do that bit about they've after 9/11 firefighters and cops were getting so much hero pussy they were launching it like rotted octopus out of out of luck what do you call those slingshot slingshot strocker they'd have to swat him down with tennis rackets I had this whole bit about Europe was easy so true right yeah no not well then the war came and then all the that was I think the bit was all the troops are getting the hero pussy that 9/11 first responders used to get and now they're just hanging around bars going remember me yeah man do you know Google has this crazy thing on his phone when I was paying attention to recently where you you say something like hello my name is Doug Stanhope and then it translates it out loud to someone else like through your phone they talk to your phone and they'll say you know me hablo Pedro I and gopanna anime and they go through their thing it translates it and then it changes it in your ear to what English is not English version that Babel Fish what's it called Babel Fish yeah okay so Apple Fish yeah I saw this it's a new feature on this phone called the Google pixel and I said I don't think people and you have to have these pixel earbuds that do it or you can actually do it through the phone I think without the earbuds but I don't think people understand how crazy this is like if they're just starting this thing out like you you couldn't really talk to your phone now you could like you could do a Google search by just pressing that speaker button say who was Brian Hanigan and then it'll Boop in like seconds it'll pull up your Wikipedia who is Doug Stanhope in seconds like what it's gonna if they can do this thing right we're gonna have a thing in our ear like a little earbud and you're gonna be able to talk to people all over the fucking planet it's gonna get super strange people that speak Arabic languages it's people in in South America you're gonna get I still every so many of these technological advances I think about you and your bits back in the day why do they have all these things on the cell phone that replace what a cell phone is yeah well why you making me read yeah it takes me four buttons to make an and s call me just call me back then I would have never thought that text messaging would become popular like there's a bit that you could never do today I could only do that bit in 2005 yeah when it was real like people were starting to send you text message like what the fuck is this you'd get on your phone you go why don't you just call me stupid well you making me reply with my thumb well that's because awkward shows how much you don't really want to talk to your friends I don't want to have to say hey how you been what's going on how's the kids how's your sister I just need one simple response I respect Joey Diaz for that Joey Diaz will not do that with you and I think he's right I'm thinking about it more and more lately are these weird text message conversations of people in like why am i doing it I need to look at you you need to know I like you like they're friends if we're gonna sterilize don't stop text me hey how's it going that's a bar conversation you can see me in a bar I don't want to sit and catch up via text hey how about that one been a long time hey yeah how about just hey yeah hey fuck is this we need 12 you can't get my phone you kids got my phone number motherfucker what's going on hey see me in a bar and then sit down and say hey let go of what hey hi you could say that your friend like hey hey yeah yeah but I usually that's the extent of what I have to say anyway hey high five yeah we had high five on text but you probably have an emoji you can't hate on text no you definitely can't do you can't yo you lazy fuck you want to talk you ain't got shit to say yo I need affirmation that we're still friends just you it's kind of part of the business we're not gonna be close friends over a quarter of a century just because of text messaging I don't live in your town you gonna lose brownie points if you just type yo you're gonna have to have like yo are we still having lunch yo are we going to the game yeah it takes to do a week ago hey what time are we doing that podcast because he's supposed to set up other shit around it but and I've said in parenthesis that I don't want to do so I'm glad you didn't get back to me I'm so glad I helped you yes you did like a Rogen's podcast or like nine hours and we're not gonna be able in it's unfortunate but what is fortune is this is not famous available right now ladies and gentlemen Joe Rogan stories are in there all beautiful it has an index I do have I have a lot of fucking name drops in there we have we had some good times you know that the the story that we were talking about in question you have to read about in the book but it involves Doug Stanhope and I in the desert the the day I'm sure we've talked about it I guess yeah too many times then afterwards going to that Lakers game a few days later yeah that was a weird one right yeah in the height of 9/11 patriotic fever it was like this is nuts you guys are going crazy when you standing up for a basketball game this is I remember when you pick me up at curse on for that game you I I don't know an SUV of some kind as probably a suburban was that happened Denali you've got a white Yukon Denali and you were pissing out the door while we were high on mushrooms going 65 miles an hour down the highway door open and he's like pissing out the dope I piss all over my truck but this is as the war is kicking off that's mm I believe large saw the war we saw the war kickoff like it was the Superbowl like it was planned I spell all this out mm-hmm and you said it I remember you said it you you said oh my god there's a kickoff we were this is how ahead of the curve Joe Rogan was with technology because when you pick me up in that that's the first time I heard GPS say in 400 feet take a right onto the 101 and also you had cell phone video because you videotaped me pissing out your door yes 2003 those 2003 now you know the best picture I ever took on my cell phone this is like affirm the need to have a camera on you at all times I was in downtown LA and there was this overweight black hooker with a crazy wig on and sunglasses and she was eating a meatball sub and I looked over and she goes hey baby and she pulls her tit out and she's got her tit in one hand and I took a picture of this see if you can find that it's I know it's out there I know it's out there I couldn't it looked so amazing I could I couldn't believe it and I took it with one of those Motorola flip phones back 2000 because we were filming Fear Factor downtown LA and this lady was walking around with her tit I was like this is a lair she was smiling at me like laughing and I took a picture of her with her tit out and to me to this day is like now I know why they wouldn't even know that you're taking a picture nobody knew anything nobody knew anything it was like to think that just a few years later the iPhone would come out you know 2007 the iPhone comes out and now you can't imagine anybody not having anything if you if you if you're around someone and they don't have a smartphone you look at it like there's some kind of freak becquer is the only one Matt Becker my oldest best friend from forever still doesn't have a cell phone yeah my friend Steve doesn't have a phone his wife fucking hates date it is that's the picture that's a real picture please take a screenshot of that and save it for me because I keep losing it why do you say that so happy but come on son look at that picture she's enormous she's got a meatball sub in her hand it's the perfect picture Jamie I want you to order up a large HD version of this have some scientist convert that we're gonna make a poster out of that that needs to be on the wall 100% release that I mean don't you have nothing else um no don't put it on YouTube but Dad I know but we got to remind me of this get the crew on it we need of that photo on our wall that's Mike one of my happiest moments I swear to God I went back to work I was fuckin how old and laughing because that lady was funny she looked at me she went when you want some of this and she pulled her tit out and then she smiles and starts laughing at me all the while she's eating a meatball sub that's a great picture palming that sub like it's a 45 in a Old West shoot-out and God helped her tit the way she's got a death grip on that Ted I was like she's got some sort of a Cobra choke oh that's yeah that's that's how I have to choke my dick to keep it up when I'm drunk almost like your whole cock rank you yeah fight the boobs fight the booze mr. penis yeah that's a great picture though that's an important moment for me because I'm like okay now I know why I'm into this stuff it was so I could capture that picture I was happy for days I remember looking at it going that's real like I always see those you see those crazy pictures online like who took that what happened but I took that I was there like that was real I was real I didn't pay that lady it was just happened to be I said hi to her I had my phone out and she looked at me a pull her tit out and I hit the camera button and I got it it's like it it's it wasn't supposed to happen that is your sailor kissing the girl in Times Square thank you thank you mr. Hannigan you're right planting the flag at Iwo Jima thank you thank you except that I feel like it's my magnum opus I'm not joking it might be I'm a gross thing I've ever done he needs a cocktail yeah I get ice right here I do like that that lady is doing that for a living who's not doing I wish are living anymore probably dead but I wish her prosperity and happiness and I hope she found Jesus the next moment after I took that picture and then but you can't fix everybody but sometimes you just gotta let people be crazy I remember well several people that are women of a certain age or look where they go yeah what what about what else am I gonna do I'm gonna suck dicks for a living I'm gonna go out on the street and you go you couldn't like no one but then you watch like cops or something when you see a lady like that that's getting caught in a pickup truck sucking some old dude's dick and you go I guess you could because she could you could so you could she's empowering to women is what I'm saying it entirely depends with the male about on how horny you are because if you're crazy horny I've done some bad things will do some terrible things we're monsters things bad bad animals it's a bad design the design where you have to get rid of come all the time as a terrible design it would be a lot it's a old bit of yours that I quote a lot is your post come depression is that how it goes post not depression yeah that feeling that which is so like I I really believed I liked her yes it wasn't until and as the semen is rifling out of you you go oh oh I'd mislead her I know oh my god I misled myself which you know that's where you get scared with the me to thing hmm I know I didn't rape anyone but how many times might I have led a woman astray with promises of everlasting love and harmony just because I was drunk and wanted to fuck her and then didn't call I was inappropriate afterwards I didn't do the hey I don't think we're right for each other I and she's stewing about it somewhere and wants you can't me to me it yeah they can happen like that right it's like you got a reat leave room for all possibilities because I think that to trust everyone that comes forward with a story like you you shouldn't but you should build the minded about all the points of view like I would I'd hate to see someone get in trouble for something they didn't do because they dated a gal and she hated them and so she made up some stuff and this has happened before all absolutely people you gotta be let me give you an example ease do how many we should clarify because this is a touchy subject no wouldn't I know you're not a sexist by an occasional imagination in support of the alleged witch-hunt because it is making people who are serious abuses and there's one I fuckin want to out but I don't have to but no you're not going to but you know that it's real and then you know the people in positions of power like that who have people working under them or dependent upon them in that way they will prey on them and do weird shit to them and they've been doing it forever because they can get away with it and that seems to be like that seems to be how this town in a lot of ways was designed so how the whole porn industry was set up hmm but you have to there's a willingness on both sides hopefully well I think there's a lot of girls that will fuck you for a part I don't think it's that see that's not the thing it's not like again there's a million the me to in cap you encapsulate a lot of different stages of sexual abuse variances all thrown them I always like to think of it I have a sister mother rule especially as I've gotten older like I've thought about this for so long and I feel like you have to treat every like if you're any you have to look at every situation like what would that be like if I found out that happened to my mother what would that be like if I found out that happened to my sister if you go to children then it gets really crazy and you get super psychotic and because you're protective as well well although I'm very protective of my sister you yeah that you got to almost look at it like that and I don't think we get taught that enough you know I think it takes us a long time of living as an adult to sort of figure out like who's the dick here is it me or is it them was a my making bad choices am i arguing with people and getting these weird relationships with people that I really don't belong with in the first place maybe I need to figure out who the fuck I am before I do this like there's all these different things that happen in a relationship and a lot of times along the way people get into some you know some weird spaces in their life you know man show the secretary that we had mm-hmm you weren't around for a lot of it because you were doing unfortunately where it's 14 hours a day then man chill for four hours then you do an hour at the comedy story kind of sleep for 30 minutes utter but no we know you're gonna say I'm just that like the the amount that we abused her on what we would think is a comedy level me and Andy not you you weren't there but but do it back to you guys - yeah yeah we're but if it was on paper but if she had a change of heart right now and said I want to be part of the me to thing and here's my story cuz I want to be noticed you can't do it to me cuz I'm not famous fortunately do you think this is one of those like swing one way and then swing back and normalize things or do you think that's but I think it might be but as time goes on I wonder if I just this is and this is not this is not saying anything like in any way I don't wanna be judgmental but I have a weird idea that men women when they're working together in small boxes for long periods of time year on year that becomes their environment and that becomes the way they think about the outside world this has it does with us that this is really important because in comedy even the man show remember we had to do sexual harassment training yeah for a show that's basically about sexual harassment and it was but in comedy yeah we think that we can get away with all this shit so I find myself extrapolating that on a people that are in a workplace I don't know what it's like to work in an office where the boss says hey you can move up to assist Regional Director if you watch me jerk off that's a different is another thing and it's that's a real problem the man show is the only time I've kind of hit like the corporate world cross corners of comedy meets corporate where it yes someone might-- you know in the story I haven't hear that I couldn't have known when we turned this book in final draft that this current climate would exist so so there's a bunch of stories where do you remember man dick what was the man dick waves I get a assistant producer director guy he was one that we all fucking hated he was just a ruthless douche and then when we went up to this is the story that's in the book at the bunnyranch and Dennis HOF tells us both hey you can have one of my girls on the house Carrot Top has fucked my girls so-and-so has fucked my girls and rogue is like first of all not only am i married but I wouldn't want to be in that litany of names that you dropped that of other celebrities that have fucked your hookers he's like no no I wouldn't drop your name we played pretty women remember that pretty woman for those the ladies that worked there remember that Oh what that was the gag we yeah no I don't remember anything we did the match it was weird it bummed me out because like they were crying and some of them montage yeah that they wish that that that had been the case and that someone would come and rescue them I was like god dammit like this isn't funny yeah turn now I I remember it now that you say it dude for me man I was like oh god you almost like i I've adopted a lot of dogs in my life you know and I've taken on a lot of friend projects especially when I was young that enough things have happened that lead me to believe that I have a lot of like rescue and parenting type feelings about nurturing people that feel like they're in danger by themselves and I'm very vulnerable so when I see something like that I'm like oh Christ you know I just you realize you don't you don't really realize because you know you don't see their lives on a daily basis but you realize in that moment you oh this isn't funny at all and you know there's no way to like you think things are funny on paper like you think ha this is gonna be funny we'll show a bunch of prostitutes a video about lady who's prostitution going well guy and it's the perfect guy and they fell in love and and it worked out and he rescued her man dick I don't remember that he was a an assistant he was in charge enough that he had absolute power corrupts absolutely well he wasn't absolutely powerful but he was absolutely fuckin annoying and we didn't like him but we I still have this offer on the table they're wrapping up the shoot the last night they're picking up all the equipment I'm talking to Air Force Amy who's this veteran hilarious hookers who's been there yes she fucking carried me through that whole thing we just sit and drink at the bar and laugh at everything in appropriate and talk shit and I go hey we get this freebie from Dennis HOF I know he's gonna have to pay you so how about I just jerk off in front of you while you dildo yourself you get paid we come back to the bar yeah great she's dildo it herself a jerk-off come back to I come out of the room which is right around the corner from the bar I'm covered in a t-shirt with my own jizz all I need to do is wait to find wardrobe I get a new t-shirt I walk out this guy that we hate is wrapping up he's walking up the stairs as I'm walking down the few stairs to the bar and I go man did great shoot good fucking hug it in and I hug him in front of all these people at the bar who know I just jerked and I'm probably illegal yeah that's in me too that guy's from the corporate world I smeared him with jizz to humiliate him oh my god how fucking wrong could it's terrible I should she came into the outage made this up it's in the book but I hope you selling the whole book of hashtag me first not me too interesting I say that this last piece by mr. Douglas Stanhope was fiction and well I still change his name it was a nickname man he was telling me that Trump's lawyer said that he tweeted for Trump Trump said something that was fucked up Trump so I was like don't know I tweeted that one for him oh all right I've been getting a lot of tweets that say hey my lawyer wrote that I didn't know what it is come on how fucking funny is that I have a whole chapter about pulling my dick out I used to do that all the time I'd go on stage naked or pull my dick out of my balls days yeah the dark days ever I was I was I was thinner than Zoey I just have a different meaning I gave him a bunch of pictures Hennigan here the the The Scotsman I pulled out I pulled my dick out in front of Bert Kreischer on a podcast two nights ago I remember I can't remember why we were so fucked I've been begging him not to air it because I don't know what I said but I'd seen Ari's dick about a hundred times well so for the book I sent a bunch of pictures with Hennigan to pick and choose and then they took all these dick pics of me in public like you can't have all the picture sections just my dick so I had to decide so this one I decided on this not having any idea it could be so perfectly timed the top one is me with my dick out in a kilt in front of a blind guy at karaoke while he's singing having no idea but the one below it is me starting to pull my dick out in front of Louie CK oh my jerk off in front of the abusers wow did you fight in crime I didn't have to block the door he didn't block the door folks by the way that's not that's not real apparently that's like something that like gets passed on like an urban myth that juices up the story I'm saving this for tomorrow I'm doing dork forest with Jackie Kashian and Laurie Kilmartin so I'm saving the bulk of my Laurie kill my louis c.k for that just because they're ladies i want their organs solid opinion but I I mean I have to make this so spacious timewise because I don't want to out the person but I was doing comedy and I was a comedian I knew back in the day when we were young in another millennium just blaming Rafi she said you're never gonna guess what I just did I just watched louis c.k jerk off in the ladies room and I went wow she goes yeah I said hey would you she's like I don't care and as we've caught up many many years later she goes yeah I just did it because it was funny I really I did it because it was a story to tell right and I said are you coming forward cuz afterwards when she said what she told me that I go you never watch me jerk off you know watch me jerk um I pulled my dick out put on poor did she watch you know she just said yeah I don't care whatever she like it's no fun if you don't watch the way I remembered is that she remembers me saying if you don't like it don't look either way it was just a goof you were I think you have to stand up to I think what we should do to normalize this whole Louis hang on this is the important part of this is when I said are you gonna come out she can't because she just did it cuz it was funny right of course and she would almost be put in a place where she would be as it's people like you that made him into a monster like right it was we're just kind of a goof back that it no one cared it's only weird and it was very polite so when I heard the louis c.k stories later on i just assumed it was like that he was very polite hey would you watch me jerk off well I had heard from someone else that had talked to someone had gotten like the story from Louie and their version of it through the grapevine so don't take this as like verbatim was something along the lines of no it was just he thought it was silly to like pull his dick out and take pictures with them and that I had heard that he was saying that it wasn't he didn't actually masturbate in front of them that was like one version of it so I was like okay well maybe that was what and then the full story came out and I was like okay and then someone had said yeah buddy asked them first boy with this this is another important beat is me my story happened before he was in any position of power other than comics looked up to him he was still writing for comics that might have had some power and at bad I don't think it was a power thing necessarily so if you're a man and you have a you're alone in a room with a woman and this is my perception of it it's always a power thing because it's fucking weird cuz you can kill them it's different like have you ever been around like a UFC athlete some big giant this was a place where you go if you if this was a tinder date this happened in a place where you'd go I want to meet you in public I don't want to be so yeah it was completely safe yeah but if you know other times if you're alone in a room with the man it's like being and you know that a man has like some sexual urges directed towards you and you're a woman it becomes a vulnerable situation and if there's some weird shit where someone if let's just say someone was blocking the door because I had heard that Louis didn't block any doors then it becomes really crazy like what do you do well first of all you're hearing yes yeah well it's also like I think the thing that people have the hardest time with all of this is you never want to think that it's possible that someone would do something horrible to somebody if you like them yeah right like with all of this with anything whether it's Kevin Spacey or any these people like maybe you like him as an actor I like that guy he's great on house of cards wait a minute she really just terrorizing people and grabbing dicks everywhere shit yeah people time I do too I do too I come grab asses and dicks oh that's not what I do but I know I think about it that way at my house woman oh when you guys yeah we had a party the other night I go who have I not groped inappropriately there okay wait Gil I haven't done it to you and I grabbed his dick just to make sure we're all fuckin good never groped me I'm starting to feel a little left out I don't think nothing I don't even think you've ever gone for my but I might have no gold it from afar I think you - Bank me once but the point being it's like come on we got it just people have to figure out some way to interface with each other 100% of the time as equal and just work on your own bullshit but what the way you talk to people like somebody this up once that they an issue with a lot of this stuff is that it's someone in the same business that's in this like position of being like a great artist like a Kevin Spacey type character or whatever and then the other person is like a PA or something like that he preys on them yeah and it's his show and he they can't get away and he's like attacking them and they're straight he's gay absolutely I know that 100% I think that's some weird almost like reptilian instinct that human I can't tell you how many times we've had to because you know my audience mm-hmm over-served quite a bit of the time and when it's a girl that's alone you can see the packs of guys oh I'll get you you I'll give you a ride where do you live exactly all right let's get her in uber because I know that's gonna go poorly you know it's fucked up about that here's what's really fucked up not only is the woman the like the vulnerable one when it comes to like the possibility of violence right she's also the vulnerable one when it comes to her reputation because like if you and like child yeah right if you and and Bert Kreischer and five dudes and a girl hops in a car with you and she decided to suck everybody off and then you tell the world and someone leaks her name and they're like it hurts her but if you get picked up if you're hitchhiking and you get picked up by six chicks who decide to blow you and film it and put it on the internet and you're cracking jokes and pitch in your book you're a king you're a goddamn king that will worship you they'll throw a red carpet down in front of your van as you get out and bow to you as you climb out it's another huge issue is how we treat women being able to guide their own sexuality yeah a hundred that's a big part of what's going on you raise your daughters in a different way than you raise your sons and that's why it's okay for a teacher to fuck a boy kid right exactly and it is by the way what a word should be treated the same you should raise your kids to know about sex you know what if you raised your daughters like it's a woman I should say this as long as it's a woman if you raised your daughter with the same openness that you raise your son she'd know not to fuck a 35 year old soccer coach when she's 15 because you were open you told her here's the pitfalls of life this is what it's about guys are gonna try to fuck you you don't you coddle women and I believe it's as much a parenting problem as anything else it really is fucking fascinating that you would have no problem if a really hot teacher fucked your sixteen-year-old son for a really hot woman teacher like built like Pamela Anderson back in the Baywatch days if somehow but if it was a hot one you have no problem with it some Pamela Anderson like gal is having sex with your 17 year old boy and he's got a six-pack yeah fuck yeah Tommy you were a winner yeah but if you reverse the genders it's a horrific offense like some handsome man has seduced your beautiful little daughter who's only 17 fuck that the guy needs to be in a cage I heard that that alone is like this is where I can't extend the argument because I've never been a woman that's true and that's why I mean to talk to you about the saving a lot of this for when I have hosts that can come back do you remember we were gonna get married yeah that was the last call I'm gonna get married I don't know if that's in the book or not the last call I made when we knew the man show is gonna get canceled isn't they wouldn't that might be in the book I think it is they the last call I made they wouldn't tell us it's canceled they leave you hanging on the vine but I was at the Atlanta punchline and I would remember being in the parking lot and Massachusetts had just passed gay marriage for civil unions I called Zoe Freedman first Zoe Freedman Zoe before you checked on me maybe I called you first but she's the one that counted because she was our go-to person at Comedy Central and I said listen before you cancel us give us one last episode where Joe and I get gay-married and it just goes into this my but it's the opposite of every marriage cliche where we're fishing together and no one's arguing no one's fighting over the remote we're all happy - who are both happy to be watching the same thing and it's just a perfect life together - imagine people decide to do that imagine if they had best friends get married as best friends like it's nothing sexual in the contract zero sexual obligation it's not sex it's like you were getting married as best friends like for real that bros before hos stop and think about how many not you know obviously not the current relationships were involved in we would never go so far but if you go back to like your 20s just imagine being stuck with some gal when you're both goddamn wreck right you're both crazy you're both 21 or whatever the fuck you are you're both completely out of your mind you're basically babies alone in the world you don't know what the fuck you're doing imagine living with that gal for the rest of your life versus your friend from back then I'm still friends with my buddies from when I was 21 Jimmy lawless I talked to that dude all the time we text each other back and forth all the time I've been friends with him since I was 15 or 14 I might have been 14 when I met him hey Doug I hate your cigarette smoke during the podcast like it okay I'll put in a air purifier and that's the beef that's our marriage beef this is our meat this is something I really did I call it the Dice Clay option because die every time dice is here he changed smokes more than you and dice just hammers it we got an air cleaner that we would sit right behind him and turn that thing on just to suck out the cigarette smoke the air purifiers belching sewage by the second hour is just brown tar he's a guy that to this day I still fanboy in front of I can't believe I'm friends with Dice Clay I could really can't every time I see him I'm like he's up and do you feel like you're friends with him yeah I've heard them I've only met him a few times but I never saw like a human side to him he's always well he's in character you can get there with him I don't wanna I don't wanna see him like that he's a good guy man I don't want to see labor with no clothes no nice clothes are still on I'm telling you it's all right he's just a guy that's like you know Dice Clay was gigantic and he got hit with the first wave of comedy haters like people don't remember when I was 19 it was me and my girlfriend Marta and we were parked out in front of my house and we were listening to a Dice Clay cassette in my car and we were fucking crying I mean tears are coming down my face I was 19 I think she was 19 - we were both like ah I had never even considered doing stand-up at this point just I was dying laughing he's the reason I got into standing he was a monster he was a monster and he was selling arenas he was coming off the whole wave of Paul Reiser oh yes yes there's no backlash yes we already noticed thanks jarred notice what fuck you Paul Reiser is amazing on stranger things he's amazing you should fucking chaos not demagogue ins what exactly I don't know you have no demagoguing knowledge about the fucker talking out your ass I tried to talk about stranger things i watch the five minutes of the first one and I'm like I can't watch kids in fuck it look like it gets better it gets so good it's such a good show how dare you sorry I don't agree tried I fail I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hey can you see I hate to use my Scotsman as a errand boy is there a Coke in there I would have tried to find one man I don't think so there's my purse there might be it never my hands azavea go in there motherfucker vivia sounds like it's gone looking something in it no it's okay Brian you left that's right I think there's like one kanizsa via he what is he via it sounds like it has stevia yeah no way um first cans of coke I just assume oh no I brought whiskey cuz I assumed you wouldn't have club soda so I thought if I'm gonna have a vodka drink I'll just drink mimosas I'm that's a good move vine that's a good move we can have some God form no no I don't need I know I just assumed everyone has we're trying to work our way through this whole experience here at this new spot we're not totally locked in place devious if you want some unhealthy options I'll have some gluten-free pasta I have plenty of emotion I was gonna change up I'm not going to here's what we'll do next time you come here I will have my non-existent assistant send you an eager with like a ride you don't want to run yeah like a rider like white Eminem no no no this gets devious dude good telling you just give it a chance awful no no that sugar is fake sure it's not it's a priority for most of us I know bingo takes the stevia all the fucking time but these sodas are good man I'm telling you they're really good sugar leaves such a bad taste in your mouth and I can't taste anything after 35 years of smoke some plant extracts it's a sweet thing that doesn't jack up your glycemic index it's good for you bro to stay alive Hennigan did you send me just so you could talk about me one penny has been dealing with subterfuge it's no fun talking behind your back when we can do it to your face penny can enjoy he's one of the only things I enjoy about you is you were very self-deprecating fellow who is you are oh you could take a good joke yeah yeah yeah and you give one back yes cheers to that thank you is that a Scottish thing seemed it seems a little bit more fun over there I would say the scouts are good at being self-deprecating and calling a comic-con yeah and you're Billy Connolly yeah who's like the main guy over there as far as stand-up and you know that was his whole thing yeah I did that yeah just happy do you think there's a big thing in Scottish society which means of the few one of the few good things I'll say about Scottish society is its kind of egalitarian and we enjoy knocking people down who think they're better than other people including yourself Australians do that shit too yeah they called the tall poppy syndrome and Japan yeah I think it's good man good you know I mean I think that's one of the things we're all watching should always be yeah a hundred percent and it goes back to your thing about punching up not down occasionally but here's the thing about this whole punching up punch and down thing I always bring up Sam kinnison's bit about the Ethiopian kids that were starving to death it's one of the fucking greatest all-time bits and it's a hundred percent punching down he's got to in my opinion I mean if you have a list of the greatest of all time bits two of them in my mind or Sam Kinison and one of them was the Ethiopian kids he's like you know you're sitting at home you got a dinner you made it all yourself you know you're sitting in front of TV feeling good about life and all of a sudden this fucking kid this starving kid okay and there's a guy right next to him like could you please just give a couple dollars a month or this guy's gonna say hey and you're like hey what why don't you feed him you're right next to him I forgot I all I remember from that bit is send a moving trucks you all's America do we don't live in a mass ho-oh it was chaos because it was the most punching down bit of all time starving children and Ethiopia I don't think that's punching down and you're not you're punching at the people that are selling you this but you're grabbing the little Ethiopian punching down I was talking about specifically Twitter fights where like Christine Levine who's that see the mamoo she's a friend of mine she opens for me her name Amazonia that's oh that was her nickname when I met her online I know so many people based on their screen name face back in the day you know well before that where I CQ what does that strike you she's a she's that what does that fucking text is it I see you I remember that shit I I was I was doing the alt dot comedy dot stand-up didn't find the ICQ but there's something freeing about being able to talk to someone you don't know what the fuck they look like they don't know what the fuck you look like you can just chat with each other online something freeing about that yeah you know you like you get to know people just for the information yes sir I just know that you're annoying there's nothing to do with your sexuality your race your religion I just know you're annoying as a human being and I realize that I judged you for no other reason than you and some people will trick you but some people you meet them online and they turn out to be the exact same thing when you meet her in person and they're really cool I've met some of the funniest people funny online funny that when you meet them biggest social retards they they can't have like can't make eye contact can't deliver the light they can write if they're on the keyboard they're the funniest person they just have no social skills they can't present themselves right this guy's funnier than me a weight in real life no he's not he could never do what we do but he could write in a darkroom this is chick that is unbelievably hilarious on Twitter and I found her recently what is it nacho Sarah what is what is there abt yes what how do you not just Sarah bTW I think that's her Twitter handle dude she's fucking hilarious like I'll go to her like every two three days I'll just go and check her Twitter page just to see what ridiculous shit she posts she's really fucking funny I'm like are you a stand-up like and she's like wow I tried it once but you know you know who I because my right there nacho Sarah Oh see that said this is the same problem I have with my Twitter crush is Laura duck the one-arm girl okay yeah she made kind of national news Twitter at national news because she put on her tinder she's an arms dealer she had just lost her arm Laura or Lauren duck its duck fan is the Twitter account duck fan something and she yes she she got her arm lopped off by a train and she posts also it's a smutty ship but she also posts really funny shit and I said I wish when I come to San Diego that you had a set because you're hot you have one arm and it's already in your favor you're already naturally funny yeah there's some fucking funny people on to it there's some funny people that work at the post office they just don't get a chance to like the idea that we have figured out a way to monetize the way we look at things is so offensive it's so fast there's so many people and so many jobs that are just as funny as us they or maybe way more like my friend Dave Dolan rest in peace who was one of my bosses back when I was first starting doing stand-up who's a private investigator funniest person I've ever met in my life right next to Joey Diaz he's like right up there he was hilarious he was a private investigator and I've worked for him because he got caught in a DUI needed a driver so he put in an ad in for an assistant for a private investigator and I was looking for a day job while I was doing stand-up at night I was like perfect assistant for a private investigator this like a goddamn comic book I start working for this guy and he's this crazy Irish private investigator wild man I mean he's a fuckin wild man he was so funny and he would just tell me stories about nutty shit he did and crazy fucking girls he knew and you know and just just the I would be in my car crying laughing waiting for this person to like come up we'd be like 5 o'clock in the morning parked like doing like surveillance on someone's house like waiting for them to leave their house 5 o'clock in the morning someone's like doing like some sort of insurance scam most of it was insurance and he would just I would be crying and I was thinking I'm trying to be a comic this guy's five six years older than me at least like maybe nine years old in May I think I was 20 I was like 30 is it an eternity eternity he was an animal I mean he was so fucking funny and I was like I'll never be as funny as him I just will never be as funny as him like this is depressing I loved working for the guy and I worked for him for the entire six months and he needs to have no license after he got arrested for a DUI stayed friends with him he died I love that guy in the book I talk about Becker and Andy like two guys that are way funnier than me and fuck him they never could put it together onstage I to be as much as they say they're trying to be like you I'm trying to be like them right you know those funny people you know yeah I want I want to steal that essence because I know how to put it on stage right I'll never be naturally off-the-cuff as funny as the funniest people I've met but I can do it on stage and you can't so fuck you that's ruthless I can I can break it down the organization is some sort of writer correspondent you know you should have you should have a policy that sexual harassment is mandatory and everybody works inside the Doug Stanhope information collection organization like anybody's trying to help you with like creation of your act idea gathering what-have-you well it's it was until now that was kind of the thing and that's why we were talking about no one's me to enroll bands like they're not pulling Led Zeppelin's library off of iTunes cuz they fucked fucked a girl with a fish rapid here's my view when you walk into the backstage area at a rock and roll concert there's an unwritten rule yeah the the roadie tapped you on the shoulder for a reason and you know what the reason is mm I was made to feel uncomfortable he pulled out his dick out of sweaty leather pants oh my god after the show underwear or no underwear and then girls were doing bumps off of it no they were Gummer's mostly because of the ball sweat oh I understand there's a difference between that and what happens with fucking Harvey Weinstein that's oh he's in rapist you know yes a hundred percent and here's the part part of the problem is that what we were talking about earlier that if you got in a car with seven women and they all fucked you you're a hero but if a gal gets in the car with seven Jason Momoa 'he's that the guy from The Game of Thrones that fucking beautiful handsome man that gigantic handsome man he's so huge and so beautiful like if seven of those were in a car and it was a gal and she's just like ravage me ravage and she's some sort of a damaged thing we know those we know those girls the shell of like that no no we know the ones and they're like yeah yeah I fucked that guy I we know a few yeah for sure that are just like dudes you should be like that for everybody it's a suppression issue it's the same reason why Catholics feel guilty it's not a matter of like what's wrong or what's right it's a matter of what you enjoy and what you don't enjoy because other people gonna judge you for it and then you got to get to the root of why these people judging you for a giant percentage of the men that judge women for their sexual activity it's 100% out of jealousy it's 100 percent out of the idea that this woman would not want to do that with them and they cast a judgement on her and they decide that her needs are different than our than that a man's needs but the bottom line is all these things were established back when was really difficult to have children and you had to protect your children and most were gonna die and you were literally concerned about the population of your village well though those instincts there they still exist the problem is that's not a concern anymore and then this fucking birth control in whatever 1960 or whatever that chick came out when did that come out when did chicks start being super hoes was a early 70s when a Roe vs. Wade and yes controlling all that yeah it should be even you know there's this there's got to be some sort of a way to make it even easier than all this has got to be a way where you let the natural hormones we'll think what has happened is 60 more ardent and nailed it die Neela I think it did 1960 mmm I thought were give me an argument for bringing back villages well it's not a bad idea man here's the thing I think cities are amazing but I don't think we're designed for it and I think we will be ready for it in a couple hundred years it's gonna take some sort of an adaptation to like the human psyche and the way we interact with each other but I think it's totally doable if people like us can do it this is how I've always felt if the entire world was the four of us in this room we would be fine like what if we were the only people with what if we were immortal we didn't have to worry about dying and it was just the four of us and they're just a bunch of food and shit to do do you think we would have any problem at all yeah we would miss the fact that we're any chicks that'd be kind of a bummer but we would probably have a good time we just had unlimited resources roaming around which we do yeah well essentially the the world like it wildfires in Ventura spreads across the world Valle this podcast goes on and on and then we walk out there like Oh naked zombie apocalypse without the zombies what if the zombies kick in well yeah Monsanto zombies you have the grill don't show us how to use it yeah press buttons I'm gonna have to drink stevia I'll I'll get irritated by that just do me a favor little sip no no I've missed your racist just try it I don't know it's hot in here but I'm actually sweating from the ears and I thought it's because Joe Rogan's bellowing so much I'm bleeding out of my earphones sorry but it's actually sweat I'm sweating on your earphones and whoever sits here next that's my hope he's OCD cuz are you want just a little swept up you little fired up I'm trying to am I too loud no no don't give any shit I know just never know when you're being real no no I am sweating from my earphones and I think that's gross that I'm sweating on your earphone so I had to say it I don't give a fuck dude I don't give a fuck about period blood I've never seen people do bother me because I am everything I would assume that they find to be a problem I'm a filthy I think you should eat meat with dirty hands that's what I think I think you should eat meat with dirty if I know someone's OCD I'm afraid to be around them Hanabusa I'm probably comfortable I have a friend who went to look at a house and they were looking at the house and there's a nice house like was house beautiful and they got to this one closet and the closet was filled with Purell with hand sanitizer and they went fuck this like this house is haunted my friends a dude the fucking thing was filled it was a closet it was filled from the floor all the way to the top of Purell they were like new Stern and ona I don't know if both ona but one of them at least they were all Purell touching everything if I get a cold and I my guttural smoker Coffee is enough that you're gonna not want me here yeah I'm off off-mike I tried to but I know he's gonna hear it and go about how many people you interact with and shake hands with I think the more people you share your biome with like Paul Stamets the mushroom guy generally is yeah it's a pretty famous mycologist who's on my podcast recently had some amazing stories but one of the things that he said is like if you come in contact with someone their biome interacts with your biome and you there's a some sort of a residual amount of their DNA that you're taking it to your own biome like like you if you meet somebody you become part of them and some very bizarre way I was like what he's like entry introduced in like you know welcome to my biome and I was like this is crazy welcome to my nightmare he's a scientist so he's not like just bullshitting he's not like some crazy dude who doesn't believe in birds you told me something on a podcast years ago and it's one of those things that comes up late at night where I go I want to call Rogan but I'm not gonna call you at 11:30 at night - what was the thing that you said listen call me anytime you call me you want to call me call me please I don't bother you you can call DC love do you see a quote I brought you on the back of this book no no I called people that if they said no we're not friends anyway I would never Chris Rock said no well I don't know him anyway he's a nice guy I know he is fucking he wrote me a better quote he then I would I would love to quote your book man don't ever ask me I mean don't ever worry about asking me I don't want to put anyone on the spot put me on the spot I love you you you had one of my favorite people if I have a top 20 people that survives and everybody dies you're in like if there was like some sort of work on the side you get like five-year free so I got five of mine family whoever need you know they're still alive you told me something about over the course of I think 20 years the amount of cells you're not even the same person you were system you tell it with your smart wait okay by the way this is like third hand smart way cuz I'm clearly a retard but if you go back to like seven years ago and then today you literally don't have the same cells in most of your body the only thing that doesn't regenerate is the neurons the neurons do not regenerate but every cell in your body is different than the cells in your body from seven years ago so when your memories remain and this is part of the problem it's become you become a victim to the momentum of your past behavior there's nothing you could do about it so if you're Kevin Spacey and you decide six months ago I am NOT grabbing any more dicks I'm fucking done with this I'm gonna be a better person like you are attached the momentum of your past behavior you know no matter what even if you're not even that guy anymore like seven years later you wake up like you wake up in the morning oh shit what did I grab goddammit oh so drunk that's a no you're stuck with that idea like we have we have to get past that we have to figure out a way I think PI they have to take those electric things and fucking change your brain like shock therapy and then we let you ride when you don't account for growth and that this is my huge thing if I had a charity that I was behind if I was on Dancing with the Stars which i think might be don't you kill Doug Stanhope I had a fucking Deena since my scene before man inane easing he wants to die by the cha-cha Innocence Project let me let me let me get this point out and then let's go back to dancing with Joe Innocence Project that's my thing and it's I don't I've never been locked up you know when I was innocent it's just it's my fear and when you cetera fear the entire prison system the justice system the prison doesn't work whatsoever and when you lock someone up at ten years old for some shit you you four you grow out of these things like you're not accepting that as you age you rethink things and you're it's well it's a totally ineffective way to reform people as well most prisons some prisons are trying to be more progressive with the Naevia yes mostly outside of America America has a real problem and one of the real problems is there's not all of it but a cert on that of the prison yes for profit and these private prison systems anytime something's for profit the system benefits from these laws being uniform or increasing in in their severity and it's in it's like so if you have like a way where people can profit like this is the issue that I had with marijuana well you would find out that prison guard unions would be lobbying against marijuana for jobs yes I'm like police you've done so well and what are we at like hour 45 now not stepping on my new bits because that's all I have but we kind of stuff but all of the things we're talking about I was talking about Bryan with Bryan Callen the other day we were talking about something and he was like you know I've been talking about this in my act I'm like of course you have because this is like what's really relevant today and I think that all of us have this weird thing like we don't want to step on each other's material and but of course you're gonna see some of the same things that I'm saying and I want to see your take on it as much as I want to see my take on oh I'm just I'm trying not to do your punchlines let's keep to the discourse and not go into bit I have to I know what you mean yeah those bits are good but you don't wanna give them up yet no no and this honestly this one bit that goes with the entire rape thing I have been missing just one ceiling chunk of this bit that's sometimes goes 25 minutes of too long and I just trying to get the point across and all this current climate as I keep calling it has made like that's what I was missing now I have specific examples of this guy versus this guy now that made the entire bit come together and now on off the road till March motherfucker now I actually want to go out and do more dates just because this a year and a half I think I've been working on this bucking one stupid bit that happens you know Chris Rock said that he was working on that I love black people I hate niggers I remember that bill fuck yeah he says it he what white man doesn't do is it is in my estimation one of the all-time greatest most significant stand-up comedy bits ever and when it hit I remember I was just kind of starting out when that bit was like popular when that bit was like on CDs and people would play it back and you'd see it on television you like I was like oh my god this is like a perfect bit like he had it boiled down the punchlines were so succinct it was just bam bam bam and then I read that he had bombed with that bit for months and months before he figured out how to get it to work I got hate mail from fan it's not like egregious actually well-thought-out hey I saw you I agree with most of what you say but what you were saying are you saying like no that's not what I'm saying that's what I'm trying to not say but yeah I'm having such a hard time alliterated this and everything that's happened in the last month or two has oh now I can exactly point out what I'm saying right and I actually reverse engineered it where I go oh I should be starting from where I was ending and then go the other way rather than apologizing and yeah yeah well it's but I've warned it out right when I get off the road fuck it assholes but you it doesn't matter I mean isn't it always kind of like fucking it's it keeps going oh yeah yeah done that a new branch pops out of the tree and like oh this is what this that gonna bear fruit every for I was doing these shitty gigs fuckin months and every night I hated going onstage and now I want to go on stage but I don't have a gig well what I like go what I found pretty recently like within the last year I mean is that that is all like some shit that I internalized and then if I can just like it Express or or respond to that the least amount like all the weird shit I know it exists I have a weird set it's too long it's to this to that I don't like it I know it exists don't don't freak out but but understand what that is and then you know what that is that's it didn't work now let's figure out how to fucking never let that happen again because this is a big difference of the swing between like the audience having a fucking amazing time or it was really good for 45 minutes then it sucked for 10 like shit there is no better learning experience that happens for decades then eating shit nothing will ever make you no come back stronger than actually dying on your ass but I'd rather be mediocre but even mediocre requires like eating shit dude I ate shit after Jim Breuer in some weird suburb outside of the city in New York I ate shit so hard it changed my life probably not recently no it was like 93 maybe 93 and Breuer and I were just starting out and I was fine like I really shouldn't have been headlining there's no way I should have been headlining I had maybe 45 minutes that was mediocre at best and Breuer and I had a great time all weekend Friday two shows everything worked out great but although if I'm being honest I want to say that he had better sets at least two of the three shows at least two of the three shows he had better sets but I had good sets it wasn't embarrassing and then the second show Saturday night he made me eat a busload of shit I bombed like the one of the worst bombings ever of my career ever where was like everything that came out of my mouth was a dry brick and he destroyed in front of me I mean destroyed the program like fucking crumbs were breaking up off of the fucking low-hanging ceiling you know that who's you know those wanna say that actually I think that's I think I coined that there's a brick the the words came out of my mouth like a brick through a funnel it feels like you have a mouthful of dirt the one who knows I Incheon following and I where I can blame the the middle act like sometimes they just don't like you yeah the middle act can take credit but no they just hated you the one I couldn't follow for a week in Miami was Chris Porter Chris Porter Chris Porter you know Chris Porter yeah fucking stoner fucking yeah thin curly hair he's very funny but where Miami improv at the time this is probably 2000 and it was an urban room 60% black well no no because there was a lot of Cuban too so but yeah maybe five white people that are scared Sammy Sosa Cuban 1993 a Sammy Sosa Cuban 2007 to Miami Miami okay not Fort Lauderdale dark not West pucker my wild girls over the first night I I assumed I'm getting fired so I just go crazy took on no no that I went there throwing fucking empty cigarette packs at me on stage following Chris Porter who knew all the fucking recent hip hoppy things he had all the fart aren't urban trends in his act and he fucking destroyed and I'm up there like kind of new with my anti-authoritarian kind of point of view and fuck Vice cops and brothers and fuck Nash and he closed it was right after this we'll probably dated won it because he was it was when France wouldn't let us fly over their airspace yeah if we hadn't saved this point that's the point being years later I got one of my best bits ever about nationalism out of that cuz he closed on fuck France if we hadn't to save their ass and two world wars and I turned that eventually into one of my best bits ever because I would go up and I'd follow him going yes that's right Chris port there that was the French calling you yes Chris Porter these are an outdoor please help us you and have turned into that bit I did about nationalism if we hadn't saved the French was at us was at us garrotting Krauts and the trenches in Verdun was that you and me I remember last night we were hammered I don't remember saving the French I remember we went through the drive-through without a car we we did a lot of things but we didn't save the French you're talking about other people that did shit and you're taking credit for it nationalism does nothing but teach you how to take credit for other people's accomplishments but the same can be said for rooting for the Raiders right yeah sure we're fucking war bro right yeah it's a very bizarre thing that we love to do and I think it's it's all connected to the why does home field advantage work nice fucking best iced tea comfortable it's uncomfortable in that arena for all those other people it's my best idea that no Billy ball kind of people and the professional sports leagues are picking up on field a team of sociopaths because home-field advantage is one of the biggest things in sports home-field advantage if you feel the team of sociopaths that don't care about cheers or boos yeah there's no home-field advantage anymore because these are psychopaths that don't care about Cheers they just want to win and kill alright that's not sustainable you got to shoot them after a couple of years as soon as they start wearing diamonds in their watches you gotta shoot them in the locker room like what happened what happened how did he die like what Aaron Hernandez that guy was a tinder may be eliminating the home team advantage for NBA players tinder I want you to consider the fact that a giant percentages of NBA players are people of color you racist fucks they're swooping in to these white towns and banging all these white chicks and you got a problem tinder home-field advantage let's make it easier for them then I'll go do work they just sorry I'm sorry eyes what I say come to the hotel instead of having to go under tinder tinder tinder I'm sorry I was just doing that for comedy oh my god if I was still a actual bean man is a sexual being that's a Bernie Mac in Bad Santa Bernie Mac is actually hilarious stand up you ever see Bernie Mac alive no I saw Bernie Mac live at the comedy connection in Boston once and I was like holy shit he was he was powerful man it's a I mean his material was really funny but shit his delivery was like like electric boom boom his name a black comedian where you go his material is great but his deliveries undersold um don't say good deliver get his thing going on he's my buddy Franklin enjoy Oh Franklin enjoy thank of a guy super low-key with his delivery hilarious ideas and met him at the greenroom Paul Provenza I wish that show was still on let's do the greenroom with Doug Stanhope well podcasting is basically that it is that but let's get on Showtime for the fuck of it we can call our moms Showtime mommy my mom's dad I forgot I said that right I was I was like man I feel guilty oh it's Dan home feel bad I will call my grandma my grandma's dead bro fucking chad shank you just came back from Thanksgiving he's like yeah I had to go to my grandparents house is he work for you does he know he's it's December 5th kind of fucking bullshit is this does that mean Thanksgiving a long time ago motherfucker this work be done know the point of the story was he was talking about being at Thanksgiving at his grandparents house who he revered and then how he brought his kid and his kids kids to globe Arizona cuz he's not a Family Guy right but then I started doing the math like you have grandchildren and grandparents that means the kids are going to meet their great great grandparents did you ever meet your great great grandparents oh my almost all my last grandparent died when I was 13 both of my grand fathers were dead before I was born my Giri great-grandfather on my you were alive at the start yeah yeah holy shit I barely remember though I was super young really your great great parent great-great grandparents are the people that built the stone that built this town before it was a town and this was all waste water well my great great grandfather decided to take his family from Italy to America in the 1900 that's right your mom's a Guinea yeah better yeah she's full-on lop sorry yeah she's full-on Guinea and my father was half Italian and half Irish that everybody was immigrants though from my mom's side a hundred percent my mother my my mother her her mother and her father both from the old country they see we don't realize it because we're living in this weird fucking semi gentrified Starbucks era of 2017 but just during my parents time people got on boats and they drifted from Europe across America on these shitty engines and they landed I mean it was like fucking decades after the Titanic sank these crazy fucks they took the wildest chance ever they floated across the goddamn Atlantic Ocean to look for a better wedding and got here on coach he fucking flew from southwestern he almost had a middle seat but he finagled his way out of it to an aisle I was in the boarding group a 15 through 30 I mean this shit just happened our families all just got here even if you're third generation that's fucking three generations that ain't shit that's nothing fourth generation fifth shut the fuck my parents have been here since the 1900s who know that's just you just got here everybody just got here I live in one of those towns where they love to say I'm a native like that that makes you better because you never left and decided you wanted to be here as a functioning free thinking adult know how natives are the first people you'd discount I was born here oh you just moved here well yeah because I was an adult and I decided I wanted to live here you just didn't have the courage to leave and come back yeah sons of bitches fuck natives it's none of it it is it's not even that honestly that was a Bisbee native not Native Americans I know it's me they don't know well they're drunk the Bisbee people don't know where to go you don't have to go anywhere just make the place better but Vegas Vegas is one of those any city that is only alive and thriving because of tourism but then they take a stand because I was born here well if Vegas isn't Vegas Hawaii Hawaii does it with white people a little bit but annoying why they hate tourists but if it wasn't for tourists you're fuckin farming pineapples are you fun farming pineapples or are you selling Crocs somewhere in a beach resort are you doing massage therapy are you doing chakra healing or are you farming pineapples because without tourists your farming pineapples and hoping Captain Cook's descendants come back and offer you some Guinea or you're eating fish that you just caught with a stick and you're trading money in the form of shells on a string right that's okay too likewise Bitcoin okay but shells aren't good how can we can't treat you just paid me in shells to be here yeah that's why I'm gonna give you lumps of salt tooth there were the lumps of salt and chocolate in the gift package chocolate gold coins and ketogenic cookies and stevia drinks stevia drinks okay over there let's do some ad con happening what's up okay Joe Rogan this is this was just in right before I shut off my phone oh yeah please order the book you know what let's take a minute so people can go online and order Doug Stanhope this is not Fame it's got awful stories that in the current climate if the publisher read it right now they go we should probably pull this because yeah so if you find it folks everyone else is getting fired for what I'm celebrating having done worse copy it copy it down and make sure these monsters out there don't take it off the internet I end the the you have the new beautiful space here think endless yards and yards of space the wolf you have the giant wolf out there when you walk in the door the the is that a Patrick Magee yes haha ghost ride you know Chaney remember when I used to pit my tour manager against your red band Greg Chile's yeah he's my guy yeah love him on your podcast he him and his twin brother do that for a living they have their own ghost ride productions which is a huge haunts they make this shit Patrick Magee that did your wolf works for Greg Chile's twin brother that's a layer so ghost ride productions if you want weird shit like that Joe Rogan I hope you're a loyal sponsor now I have only ghost ride productions they do all this shit chaley does the he does a haunted house at the in the front yard in Bisbee he does haunted front yard and he brings all this shit down every Halloween he's so geeked up to do it it's the only thing in Bisbee I wanted to be one of these guys when I was a kid dude I was a huge Star Wars fan to the point where I wanted to be like a Rick Baker I wanted to do that for a living and Pat Magee was on the podcast we're both huge fans of an American that's in London that's that's right there right there he was on the podcast a few years back and I found the American Werewolf in London that caught what it is is a it's a replica of the the thing that's in the movie and Pat sells it you can order it online and he he builds it but it's like the real exact scales like one and a half times the size the real werewolf the werewolf was smaller my werewolf is bigger I just texted when we got here today I texted a picture that that to chaley yeah and he goes that looks like yeah I go hey how's this for Halloween 2018 for his haunted yard he doesn't Bisbee and he goes that looks like a Patrick McGee he's done work for my brother I go wow if you called that and Joe Rogan you fuckin that's amazing he nailed it I think I had to correct myself I said it's a one and a half times larger I don't think that's right I think it's more like 40% larger or something now that I think about it I think I'm confusing it with something else but the the copy that he makes is definitely larger so he could work on the like the finer details there's like blood on the teeth and the hairs it's all yak hair around the head and it's all synthetic shit in the back but that's that's his work but if you look like the blood around the teeth dude here's the thing man fucking amazing I get great pleasure every time I come to work and I look at that werewolf I fucking love it I love it I love looking at that thing I love the fact that I'm a fucking grown up baby you single or anymore I smile all the time yeah yeah oh you're showing us some shit and you just smiled like wow that's a fucking rare smile you used to be a lot a griot I like I got out of that I think you know it's like we were talking about before it's like what are you using your energy on are you using your energy on being upset at things and being this constant sort of like momentum of being upset from the past that you never stop or do you figure out a way to like hit the brakes and go okay why are we angry what are we getting upset at why don't we just like take all that caveman shit and just go smash some punching bag and then come back to reality and be like really relaxed about it but do it purposely like you have some sort of intent behind it to eliminate the demons and I figured out how to do that somewhere along the line aging helps helps a lot but it's not there's just that it's it's not aging as far as like decay its aging as far as information right like I was talking about like if you're if people figure out a way to make humans live to be like 900 years old would it be fucked up if you had sex with 50 year old well people like you fucking asshole she doesn't even know any better she's only 50 she's basically a baby if you treat him like that until they're 50 and say you're not an adult I know I know you're 12 you can have a baby right now nature said you are ready to actually procreate but we've legislated that you can't be an adult till you're 18 so for the next six years we're just gonna treat you like a baby that's an unnecessary burden for the boy and the girl and the lack of training you're excelling them every feeling that you have naturally is wrong we're not gonna explain that to you Brian because we want to give you a good childhood right you shouldn't have to deal with all these adult well that's what their fuckin body's telling him so you better be honest or all of a sudden your kids fucking a 38 year old producer well it's also the problem with like looking at children as being different than a person it's like no this is mine I made them you are not gonna like boys Michael you're gonna like girls cuz you're a boy and you're gonna carry on the Harris name okay I'm sorry if I could have a kid I would I would have a kid just for the long-term practical joke of raising him gay you saw gorillas on YouTube and say I was just trying to just had a kid and I was trying to pitch him this Brendon Walsh like just go and just act like you're raising your kid gay and you know when you get older two men meet each other and just say this to a baby I think you could easily and this is gonna sound fucked up I think you can easily convince a young kid that like sex with males is normal if everyone's doing it no no the idea was you have to still sex shame the kid it's only okay to be gay once you're married after you're 18 but you're gay so the way you're married to a girl or a guy the end game is the kid has to eventually when he's 18 come out as straight to his parents and that's a problem if you have really progressive parents like dude we got super street cred for you being gay piece of shit do you think you should be straight but trans you think you're willing to go there let's negotiate they'll sit down the table of progressive brownie points hmm we were really happy about you being gay Michael and you being straight frankly it's a big bummer to our social system it's like they're gonna think here's what the word we're gonna work at the law firm they're gonna think we shamed you out of being gay and it's simply not the case we have it so easy Joan where we can sit here with white privilege yeah we have we're not with Sam cedar Comedy privilege which we have in droves which is way more that's way better diamond delete status than just white privilege we have Comedy privilege it's true oh they're just kidding no we're not but it says comic okay if you're gonna get kunti about it I was just kidding and then it's all golden well yours clearly kidding because you're not saying it's specifically in a form where they're trying to disseminate information you're trying to be funny as well so you'll say extreme things that don't necessarily represent your actual viewpoint just because you want it to be more hilarious if Sam cedar will funny all the time rather than that one tweet he'd be fun sorry Sam right more but we have the luxury of having a social circle that is very tolerant like to the N word degree tolerant in a green wait a minute you can't say nigger word degree oh that was yesterday that doesn't even make sense those little gratuitous used to the N word no I was saying that in a green room when it's just comics nigger retard cunt Dyke fucking everything flies yes and when it doesn't you get super upset like if someone says she's a cunt and someone goes hey man you really shouldn't no I'm saying you say you're a cunt right to a feminist comedian in the confines of a greenroom right everyone's free and clear at least the green rooms I've been part of nobody has a problem with you calling a mannequin no but not in the UK but it means even in America you know that if the guy really is a cunt right like sorry you looked absolutely Hannegan when you saw he's looking at me he's nodding and I'm just trying to bring him into the conversation like if you were you mean pull him out of his fucking loud a little bit but he knows we're all talking we're friends like Sodom was saying was a cunt heard his kid we're cunts his kids I heard they were cunts those sons nobody cares you could say that the - I don't know he might have had other sons I don't know if their hunch there were two cunts Judy was a load cunts yeah they apparently like would find people when they were getting married they would take the bride raper and then they would feed her two dogs well that's a little Caligula they were off the top evil over the top whoa yeah I read that and I had to stop reading I was like okay I can't go on with this it's another thing about aging not giving a fuck but also giving more of a fuck yeah we were kids were the same age we would watch all that faces of death oh yeah couldn't get enough of it now I don't want to know no I can't watch that shit you try that stevia no of course looking at how much he cracked it he's never gonna drink it never gonna drink it bingos all sugar-free and she uh she she used to like get a diet coke we're going through a drive-through Diet Coke well and they press the little thing on the top of the to show you which one's diet which one's regular well check this to make sure cuz she knows how much I hate artificial sweeteners okay I don't want to know cuz I don't drink that for the aftertaste never leaves your fucking mouth Stevie is no different Splenda what's the sucralose it's awful sugar so try this for me if you're thirsty diabetic can you pull up to the Windies drive through it 1:45 a.m. what percentage of the time do you get a giant vat of sugar if you like it's like the extra-large Diet Coke that's it okay don't at least one out of 100 you're getting a vat of sugar water right at least one I mean I'm assuming it's kind of like Strong's they don't brew anything other than decaf after eight o'clock I think the dude who's monitoring that thing is gonna slip on a puddle of his own drool and slam his head into the regular coke and it's gonna fill your shit up but something's gonna give you a seizure that's what I think I'm gonna fill that fucking thing up to the top very little eyes to use my machine oh this is where I was going I fucking had a thing I was going to oh this is about hennequin yeah last year huh a year ago a little bit over a year ago end of the world podcast oh yeah I don't know if I've seen you once since then I think we saw each other once came to the store once you've beaten back on here I think maybe maybe either way end of the world podcast I was not in a good place yes it's a nice yeah but I will tell you one thing that I said to all my friends I said I admire the fact that you pushed through it and even though you were like a little bit like flustered you were still gregarious I can't watch the video I'm sure you were in a weird place we tell everybody whines right my gal bingo had just gone into possibly terminal she had a seizure fell down smashed her head on the cement life-flighted in a coma she might not make it if she does make it it might be worse than not making it at all and I said I didn't know how to handle that fuck I didn't know either but I made the decision since it happened during her 40th birthday party so all of her friends and family were at the house and Bisby it happened so she's surrounded by all these people who took a week off to be there for a five-day party they're there I can't help her she's in a coma me standing with the family staring at a half corpse it's not going to help bucket I'm gonna do this thing this is a big deal and it was a huge like damn epic Douglas fucking amazing we were there when Doug Donald Trump was elected president and Bill burr might have had the greatest podcast appearance of all time you know it was like it was like one of them Michael Jordan things that you would watch in your kid like what the fuck it's it's how he his whole heckler YouTube thing in Philly yeah that's him and now he won upped it by doing the end of the world pod PETA's fire he was on fire I mean he was on fire with the Palmer everybody step back except who was the gal that had a different because of Brian Hannigan exactly this is where we're going yeah cuz I wanted to name-drop Olivia grace she's hilarious fucking funny she was like 17 yeah she's like she said she started when she's 18 now she's 22 she just did a show up my house they were just on tour their land god dammit I can't remember something Jewish with a first name Jimmy Choos teen Oh know it they're on tour fuck I'm sorry jewy guy jewy jewy they were both funny they showed up goddamn find it somehow Olivia Grace's Twitter's she's more point being Olivia grace so they come through they had a night off and they stayed at the house and we forced him to do a show oh it sounds like great that was Thanksgiving or what you force him do a show yeah well she's not to watch me jerk off in 20 years doing a show for see someone do a show is gonna be the new rape Eric Friedman Eric Friedman Joey the first names not Chu anyway they they went up so you have original rock can he go up and do rap first so we have a little stage in our little fun house where we do our podcast right we we can make it a show like that and it's always the best audiences never as a show failed there they're always great because in my house JIP what might the people that come to my house don't right they couldn't name their favorite comedian because they don't know they'd go oh Jim Belushi Ziya comedian still they don't they're great they killed she fucking crushed who what she told me let's get back to end of the world podcast I had told Hennigan yeah we should probably have some kind of diversity this is before that night gentlemen deal well I know were planning it out what it should be that night I'm fucked my head is as my lady gonna live or die why am I here I shouldn't have done this let's make the best of it I go in the bathroom and the fucking the shower some for some reason they have a shower the back of the Comedy Store little gradient at once yeah so stupid I would go back there and I'd fucking fall apart crying and then I come back out on stage and try to keep it together well Hennigan is still thinking I told one we need women on this it's hard white men so he's just mmm he has no discretion he's just getting any woman and forcing her a stage and you're going what the fuck why wasn't i don't--that's I was no no you didn't know you you were saying okay I see I go it's probably my fault I probably why did your manager say we need women well that's probably I probably said it but it here's the thing that's important most of the people that you had on that dais that that stage whether it's Bill burr or that's Bert Kreischer or Doug or me Jeffrey showed up with his kid that was the weirdest yeah that was weird he came onstage with a little kid and we were like hey man you can't you like literally can't do this legally like legally can't do this I can't say it's okay to do this we can't talk about the same things that we were going to talk in front of your kite and creep like if you have your kid onstage and Doug wants to talk about anal vibrators and like it's the the hardest he's ever come and you know and you know the the the the the guy was drowning and gagging but it felt so good he's like how long does it take before you can resuscitate someone with no brain damage what if she blacked out from all the comments coming out because there's that well let's get back to this because that in front of his kid I don't want to let me get the point and let's go back to this please because Olivia Grace when she was down in Bisbee she said she was there that night when Brian Hennigan was scouring the audience for female comics on her own she's lost she's very boyish she has a very short haircut she's very boyish and he said no we need two female kameez comedians and he tapped her and he went not you hear us piece of shit Olivia if I did that at this credit if there's a better story should have broader alcohol you're fired anyway you're fired from the production of the end of the world part two let's do another one when you want to do it we have to find I've been looking for it since you said that mmm let's do in January in January and some random Tuesday how dare you giant penises doesn't matter funny they are come on we got a criticism at all costs I again I take credit I was Polly the one who said it no I'd say it's my fault I fucked up I should talk to everybody beforehand there's no Tasha to talk to the security guards and said it don't let anybody back here no one gets on stage unless Doug and I say yes tell Hannigan I know only from hearing secondhand even though I was there I knew there was whatever that girl was there was a Gianna Morgan Murphy was on he's amazing he was there looking I'd like Sarah Tiana to I wasn't there when the issue happened but she apparently had some issue and it was it was an on it was John in it it was all not a humorous discussion it was like a sincere discussion know how bad it was the Donald Trump was going to win and how bad it was for women because it was it right after they grabbed him by the pussy video and so or audio so there was a lot of shit going on you know no I wasn't there I'd gone to the other room I did a set in the o.r and I came back and maybe was like oh man you missed his crazy blowout between bill birnes yeah that's my point is that is not a negative or deficit if there's huge blown-up conflict whenever odd cast people actually that's not what we planned you're right people will click on it because they heard at some point there's a big blowout as long as we can keep Sarah Tiana off Twitter for a couple weeks I don't know I don't know where I don't remember her but I mean reading the people that commented on it well some of the people were like particularly fucking mean when they comment and I'm like okay okay everybody relax bingo put out a book it's not a book it's a she went her first mental institution stay when she was 51 52 against her will like when she was hardcore crazy before we get together she wrote like a Anne Frank diary in the moment of what's going on and she put that out as a book or and Frank diary and you know bingo she's a soft touch yeah can't read comments oh yeah you're not strong enough people on the internet there's gonna be someone who's a fuckin asshole so just don't go there she does eventually someone's gonna be a fuckin cocksucker and you're not gonna be able to handle it you're not like us I have a hard time I won't look at fucking YouTube comments I don't want to know you know well it's just not here's the thing I wish everybody was cool and there's a there's an absolute reality when you do you put out as much content as you or I or a lot of us there's gonna be some stuff you and stuff they don't like and there's just gonna be styles you like there's certain people that don't like someone someone in the other day online I showed a picture of me and Dave Attell and they were like fuck that guy he's never funny I'm like oh my god okay I'm you can exist yeah I don't think you should die but I can't talk to you I just can't I just don't I don't there's no I just I got done watching David towel for 20 minutes The Improv with a half a crowd and I was fucking literally crying it's me and you I want to do comedy again it was wonderful it was a break I got to be an audience member it was amazing with somebody out there was like fuck that guy does he would he say fuck that guy he's sitting next to me in that room that night man there's no way there's no way there was only like I'm there might have been 60 people in that room ANATEL was destroying I mean destroying I was like you can't say fuck that guy if you watched that it was so funny I know isn't it often the case that lists definitely with Doug's audience to hate headphones that they're hurting my fucking ear that you guys can swap odd fucking what is it the case that there's somebody who's like one of Doug's fans feels like I'm helping Joe by saying get rid of that guy cuz I just like it's your competition problem with Last Comic Standing people are oh you're way better than so-and-so it's not a competition and should they do that in your face yeah they'll do it to you they'll walk right up to you and go you are so much funnier than that guy the guy that you brought out of your own pocket because you thought that this guy should be known to your audience they act like this opening act was forced upon you no I brought him out of my own pocket because I thought you would enjoy him and he needs to be seen right and your fucking I like that you do that you do that like I do that I think that's super important you know bring guys like Brendon Walsh out on the road and all these dudes you bring out and tell people about them but that's a that's a big part about this era as opposed to the old errors is that I think this era is more supportive there's more opportunities don't feel famine you know no feel like Oh only one guy could be the host of tonight's show but that's not a thing anymore no no like if somebody offered me the Tonight Show I'd be like what do you want me to do you want me to go and fucking talk about shit I don't want to talk about for like how how what do you think happens if you make more money we did Ferguson last night Ferguson Ferguson is uh I meant where the riots took place no no Craig Ferguson we did his podcast last night and I told him I go I hated you when I first saw you because I don't watch late-night but if I was flipping channels and I saw you for a minute with your accent and getting your face into that like fisheye lens thing he would do in his monologue I didn't like you until I heard you on Stern and I all of a sudden he was a human being for an hour and 20 minutes he's a guy with good stories and he hated he's like no one would accept the fact that he did not want to do anything else they're offering him other projects he's like no I'm good I'm done well you know Hollywood I know it I mean that thing that's the greatest thing about his decision-making like he's like I don't want to do this anymore and now he just stand up and he just did a Netflix special yeah and he's doing a podcast cuz he goes I got to do something they want to talk but I don't want to do it by their rules and they no one believes when you don't have that's kind of half the through line of the book is when you I want to do what I do but I no one buys that you don't need to be more famous right don't I I love eggplant eggplant and I don't like it I know I don't want more eggplants delicious Oh what's Navy on it parmesan one time my mother tried to make it and it was so grotesque that when she's saying you got to eat it and then she tried it she goes alright give give me all your plates this came out bad sorry well maybe that's what it was maybe if you look like a real Italian a strong kurz or something like that if you don't like a little bit of Fame you know you're not gonna like a lot yes so it's not like wait I think you like a little bit let's be a little bit great a little bit and I think a little bit is good I think it's all good as long as the numbers of manageable and you can stay yourself I think the real problems when you go look here's the best example Michael Jackson there's never been a better example in the world of toxicity due to celebrity status like you hit critical levels you hit some Three Mile Island shit you hit some Chernobyl shit it's impossible to maintain the amount of energy that's coming your way as a normal human being I mean you don't have any unique DNA that allows you to deal with the idea that 300 million people know who you are or more if you want Jackson swath of your clothes put in a petri dish make a fucking clone and frame it and get in their man cave there's a bunch of people to think that maybe you're molesting kids and you got a fucking amusement park in your backyard and you're literally losing your mind and you tell a guy hey man I can't sleep I want you to anise anesthetize me every night and a fucking tube just public put me in some fucking crazy hyperbaric chamber and pumping the gas I mean this guy was off the fucking reservation there had never been anybody that famous before he was literally the the guy with the candle at the end of the universe going oh my god I think there's keep this more room there's no one's ever been here before he's no one's ever been that famous of what happened he went crazy he went completely insane and died young and no and nowhere between 1990 and 2017 does it look like any of what's happened to him is manageable it's like he's running down a hill like tumbling down a hill and he's okay for the first decade maybe the first two decades but after a while he's just getting chewed the fuck up psychologically physically he keeps getting more plants Reiki I don't think he was ever very stable psychologically there I don't know but if you ever seen that document around him it's fucking abyss isn't that love that that documentary is the first time this is it this is it yeah it's amazing what early again I don't know music to watch that you go oh this guy really didn't know what the fuck he was doing I just don't get it he was really brilliant think the songs suck well they suck but my intern wasn't like what you want to hear right now like everything he requires context right I give you world you remember when I was a kid and I remember this really clearly because I was in high school and I was living at home and I was listening to W coz and embossed it no W FNX no no W coz that was right BB coz in Boston it was a radio station in Boston in 1980s rock-and-roll station and the guy came on who's a DJ I wish I could remember it wasn't Marc perentie who's like the big one in the morning but the guy came on he played Michael Jackson he played a Michael Jackson song I think it was beating and he said look I know this no he said he played Billie Jean he goes I know this isn't rock and roll because it's so good I have to play and he played it and he played Billie Jean and I remember there was no Twitter back then book with this Tiger music well not only that this guy was a real DJ he was like one of the last of the real DJ's that could literally decide hey I just heard man Jack a mate yeah this Lou Reed record the fuckers have to hear from the beginning to the end I want you to listen from the beginning to the end so I'm gonna play this you know you hear Bruce Springsteen when he was like 30 you know like beginning to the end you know like those days to do that used to sit there and listen and you'd be that doesn't exist anymore like that and there's too many this is one of the problems with money right there's problems with trademarks and the ability to put things on YouTube and whether or not you can get credit for this or put that over that up like a radio station if it just wanted to appear right now and put and do like that kind of a thing they've probably almost impossible how many radio stations are there in the world where they would let you just play a whole briefs Bruce Springsteen album from the beginning to the end well terrestrial radio at this point could probably play child porn just soundtracks and no one's listening anymore do you still do like no goober in the morning when you have to promote a gig I don't have I don't but I miss some people I missed Kevin and being Johnny dare in Cannes city miss that guy you didn't have to do it but Johnny dare and I have enough of the history so when I went to Kansas City I got there the night before I said all right if I wake up at 6 a.m. which I did and we went down just for fun and we took over morning radio and Johnny Dare in passing he's like he knows my house is all weird so he's showing me pictures of his house and he's got all sorts of fucked-up weird kind of things and what's his name Patrick Magee oh no I go my tour manager Greg chaley does ghost ride he goes all this shit came from ghost ride I go to the st. Louis yeah that's the second time now that a morning radio guy like Joe Rogan and morning raining our meanwhile Hennessey's over there reading Hennessy for the record Hennigan is not technically a guest his name is Hennessy but when his Imus alone when Hennessy where he's a guest on my podcast he does the same thing he'll sit there like you can fucking read your laptop while you're a guest you can't do that close that shit bitch I just wanted to look at these are you fine he's not weeding me I was looking at the because I remember noticing this before somebody to edit it out the best of Bill burr on the podcast election night as a standalone video yeah it's got nine hundred thousand views just the best of building smashed it he smashed it like it was so perfect for him because he has he fuckin held it up it was awesome but it was great to have coming in no dude do you were great listen you got it you and I have been friends for so long I knew what you were going through I was like I just don't know what to do I didn't know how to handle it I didn't know to joke around with you I was trying to bail out of it before the coma I was saying I don't think I'm the guy for the job you're like fuck you you're coming to LA so then when the seizure happened I go he's gonna think that her coma is an excuse didn't I but I was in a about Marilyn Manson backstage with a golf shirt on or something like God he showed up he showed up like the end of the movie flight which is the best ending to a movie ever that's the Denzel Washington where he crashes the plane but he saves the entire crew like Sully like Sully right yeah but he was he was jacked and fucked in the movie and at the end he's drunk as shit and John Goodman his drug dealer comes in and fixes him with cocaine so he can testify whoa it's the best ending of the movie watch the beginning and then fast forward through the fluff in the middle and get to the end and it's one of the best Madsen showed up where I there's a me take notes beginning the middle there's an art owed art wad art there's a giant picture in Johnny's house where I'm staring at this it looks like Manson and I fuck Manson as weird and unstable as he is is the only guy I can think of that would understand where I am right now why I'm here how fucked I am what's going on and I called him and he answered his phone which he never answers his phone at 5:30 at night which is morning for him and I told him what's going on he said I'll be there in 30 minutes and he showed up with Krispy Kremes and cocaine and eats the problem and then he showed up in he sat backstage he wouldn't come out on stage and once where I was beckoning for him to come out that's when his management people caught wind of the fact that he's about to go out and his handler had to drag him away but he saved my fucking life that night whereas fucking handlers who knows we need to talk to them that um they'll be relaxed they're there right look right now relax settle down you're you're handling Marilyn motherfucking man okay all right there you go it's not Jim Nabors okay you just lose one of you guys that are actually still doing knocking roll guys really doing it oh my god they just want to what do they want to do keep them out of legal trouble keep them alive get the fuck out of here you need like a secondary version you need like like guys who are lawyers who are on adderall and they report to the lawyers who are sober like you have like two filters you have dudes like understand people on coke cuz they're basically on like some sort of the synthetic coke and then you have they report like they have to wear like police body cameras and they report to the lawyers or sober get drug tested every day I think okay what exactly was going on everybody like everybody has a say and they they've been count together and they go well we handle this by the fact that were handling Marilyn fucking Manson let him do it let's go give him the gun give him the rubber gloves bind the robber club he's such a sweet dude yeah he's a very nice guy I met him a couple of times he's always been very friendly like genuinely friendly sorry I turned that on I've gotta show you a picture I can't wait to tweet this but I like the fact that you shut off your phone like a gentleman plus I like the fact that your phone makes us starting noise from 2006 what does I want them sound Samsung Galaxy broken used to bust my balls cuz I was the last guy with a flip phone so depressing and you'd have all the new gadget tree and I was so proud to have a flip phone but when we started working the UK nobody calls everyone only texts because I guess phone calls cost of fucking thousand pounds a minute or something so I had to actually get a smartphone but I still long for the flip phone days well Samsung just came out with a new phone that's a hybrid it's a combination of a smartphone and a flip phone and you open it up and you can get an actual keyboard and you talk to people just like a regular flip phone and when you're done you hang it up and the front of the phone is a bezel this smartphone it's the front of the phone that's all this yeah like you do text messages you could view the internet and then when you want to open it up and make phone calls it acts like a regular old-school flip phone and people really like it in terms like press and physical buttons yes yeah have you seen you watch a movie on your fucking smartphone I know people that owe half of Bisbee they don't have cable that's why football is popular at my house cuz no one has TV so they can't watch it unless they come to my house but I know people that watch they'll just sit and watch an entire movie on a phone right I can't watch it on a 32 inch screen I need a big fucking screen to watch a movie yeah I think a hundred percent I go the only time that there's that phone the only time is like when you're on a plane or something you're trapped and all you have is your phone look at that phone Doug look at that screen so the front of it is 60 inches no that would be an awkward phone call you can't carry that around pearl you don't even understand inches bro that's a the size of like an iPhone 6 or some shit actually there's a little bigger than that doesn't it Jamie how big is it this is when I had to decide which picture goes in the book in which doesn't cuz there's too many dick pics right I deleted this and put in the me pulling my dick out in front of louis c.k but I can't wait to tweet this yeah I have to apologize I was wrong you touched it wrong I didn't touch it Jesus Christ sometimes he's angry touch Roget got a ramp this thing out there yeah we are we out we going towards it you know I pulled my dick out in front of her but what about the three or four people in between everybody seems okay with it yeah that was back when I was kind of my thing Sarah Silverman's there she's mono that's the Beach ask did you ask first no no I was flying she's telling the picture I was fluffing but are you prepared for shame and I'm ready for it you might get it you might have to get this is your place where people can view this or is it getting snow it's gonna tweet it hmm let me talk to you about this all right let's wait let's wait I've already said Sarah Silverman well Sarah Silverman is a friend and a wonderful comedian and a colleague and I think you and I both respect her I do think I didn't want her to get into any trouble cuz she rota is okay to love louis c.k thing calm okay to love me here's me with my dick out front here's the thing it might not be anymore this is why we need to burn that you need to burn your whole phone you can get a modern phone that allows you to take photos and get online and then you need to burn that thing because you can't you can't have those pictures you can't have those pictures floating around it's important man I'm sorry I was the guy that put it out so sad those are those are developed pictures from a fotomat I think it's gonna take a little time but once once we get through this we're gonna find some sort of a reasonable agreement where when you can and cannot pull your dick out because what we need to do when people are young boys and girls install a small like some sort of a sexual equivalent to a turkey tester or something like like a green light you know like work ding it goes off okay you can pull your dick out now sir like I'm 23 years old I've been going to college but that's you should pull your dick out it's 1:00 on you're our age that's inappropriate unless they're our age to which you know what there's no 50-year old comics hitting on 50-year old women MMA which is maybe but like what if like it's a woman like Christie Brinkley she's like 63 she's still hot as fuck well then you go oh my god I'm your age so I know who you are unlike young men you're just happy to be there you don't pull your dick out I wish I did this years ago when it was erect how many people would be mad if a woman pulled her vagina out almost zero right like who'd feel threatened that's the real problem the real problem is the physical violence potential and the number of people that have been raped that's the real problem because it was just about weird sex things like well this is and which is the bit you're working on is the difference between hot as fuck take it or leave it mm yeah come on bitch Christie Brinkley does not live a human life in perfect lighting with perfect makeup you don't need that Justices dark ones with no at some all she's hunched over like I am with this posture reading glasses thicker than ours trying to focus on something on a laptop and that spill belly is hanging over our cunt because eight kids came out of it that's when you both put on mascot masks like you or the squirrel and she's the raccoon and you guys just fucked by the firelight just get right in front of that kind damn fireplace and go to town my advice is so overrated because it leads to all these problems it certainly can it certainly can lead to like a weird unofficial bond with people right like like if everybody imagine this if everyone it's like hugging people if like committing to hugging people was like as intimate as committing to having sex with people well hugging people is really quick right and no one says oh he hugged too soon he I was I was I was hoping it was gonna be a long hug but his hug was done like in seconds like he was a teenager and his first hug like them the man does not have the right to pull out of the hug before the woman wants to end the hug like the period we all know this can you hug this lice in the night no no don't do it because the second hug will be unenthusiastic and not representative of your soul who you are as a spiritual being you need to only hug fucking once a week when someone you love porn has changed the game porn has ruined fucking and it's continuing to ruin fucking like that it's just setting you up for robot fuck dolls have you seen that stripper robot that gyrates on the strip down the pole there's a robot that goes in the stripper pole and the RO it's it clearly a robot you see all the mechanical parts but it's moving his ass like some beautiful woman like a perfect ass you okay okay like we are so close to not being able to tell like I don't know if we understand like exponential increases in technology our look at this leave this robot she's gyrating on this pole so she's holding this pole okay well right now you could see her joints and all that stuff and I know she's not a human even though she's where high-heeled shoes how many more years do we have before that is fixed but how how often did you need that you went to see strippers because you wanted the threat of getting pussy you didn't need her to spin around a brass pole if she was just there vacant robotic and a sleigh and a Kimbo you just fuck her you wouldn't go I need you to dance I need to want it more all that does is make you want it when you didn't want it to begin with I didn't think about fucking till she did all that thing on the brass pole now I have a boner now I'm using that as my leader do you know what I'm saying not particularly duh yeah if you were thinking about fucking Brian and then there's a girl dancing around a brass pole sort of shaking her ass so no so now I have a boner now I'm thinking about fucking where I would have just talked to you well if a girl is just sitting outside reading a book not thinking about fucking and Jason Momoa shows up and he's in an open shirt like some sis guy that you put him on and his he's chopping were us with his name Travis Jamie Jamie trot is chopping wood with a giant axe and the girls get

Jason Tyler Jason's listen it's just a matter of like what do you want to do do you want more action or do you want to live on the beach and raise your kids in the sand can't gotta pick your poison I have no idea I guess my moas like he came over on a fucking raft like he's like some kind of Polynesian God he's from Hawaii it's like why it's kind of the most expensive state to live in a refuge for white people you ain't paying attention to me ions are on Hawaii Pro so racist five sorry is this a bonus question do you smell like smoke enough that you're gonna get in trouble when you get home how old are your kids now I've got a daddy smells like cigarette smoke I've got shirts here that I could change but it's good that you did this you changed smoke through this because we realized this system sucks yeah I noticed that making the system I've been breathing it I've definitely got a secondhand nicotine high it should be called the Stanhope it's good yeah we before you show you get think like a bar thinking a bar don't think like your grandma smoking occasional in the bathroom I said didn't Rogan put this system in specifically for me and he goes I think so definitely for you and Dice Clay tell ya Anna tell ya he's another one I can't live without the cigarettes we were outside he just keeps going just did five days off of them coming into this did you really for five day quit everything for five days except medicinal drinking do a couple shots of whiskey because at this point can't quit cold-turkey very dangerous broadly understand so now when you what was harder like what does it feel like to take five days off cigarettes when I do it my way perfect fantastic because I no one can come around me if I don't have to do a phoner or write a thing write a book do when you write you like this well that's the hardest thing of everything I suppose to doing stand-up writing is that's where it's integral to the process chain-smoking nan that tab smokes tap-tap-tap smoke whiskey drink tap tap tap you know everything else I get over writing was the only you know when I find like sometimes some of my best bits have been me drunk on an airplane I I have the exact opposite where I talk about I get off an airplane drunk and I have stacks of cocktail napkins I say if it says Delta on the napkin this judge side and they're not even jokes they're pontificating what about this Ned maybe twice in 20 years I've gotten good bits off of a drunk airplane twice in 20 years a good number though if you could find one thing where you could do a 300 times you get 20 great bits or twice yeah - great even to like you like to think about how many days you spend trying to write to get to great bits it's a the amount of bad bits though where yeah I'm embarrassed to have the napkin in my pocket like what the fuck does is you have no saved oh no that's a great show he's doing where he has you pull out your old notebooks Brian Hannigan you lazy bitch researchers man am i doing it for a while my first notebook where you have to go and read the shit you wrote in 1990 that you thought was brilliant yes well here's the thing we're trying to sell this as a show why tweet about it why does this have to be isolated useful and individual how come you can't do it as well see how he just shut the fuck up cuz he knows he's wrong actually Joe just made my point you are just thinking is anything wrong with you over your your notebook but going into other people's notebooks then you're gonna like if you decide like hey I'm Doug Stanhope I wanna break out my notebook and
