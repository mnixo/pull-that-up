hello freak bitches but what they're essentially doing is just piecing together what they think is like an argument based on these predetermined patterns that they've picked up exactly you know as you as a white male wouldn't understand a woman of color what fucking color are you well like what you're white I mean you're you're Asian but I mean when you're talking about the color of your skin you can't say color you just can't you might want to say ethnicity you might want to say you know whatever the background and I mean let me clarify there is I completely concede that there is a lived experience of being a certain being a minority ethnicity especially in America or in Australia new countries that is different from being a white man and I'm much like I absolutely concede that the thing is why can't we talk about the actual details of the experience without assuming that there's a homogeneity between that experience as well like not every Asian experience in America is the same they have certain commonalities in that they're subject to racism in a way that you and I aren't but they're so wildly different let's talk about the details of the experience and what's acceptable and how we how we want to converse with one another let's not assume that because a person has a particular set bunch of labels attached to them gay straight Asian white man woman whatever that that immediately disqualifies them from having a conversation about these things it's weird when you look at people from that era and you consider that was him that fucking groovy mustache my stash backs wouldn't you love to go back in time and hang out with John O'Sullivan he's the fucking heavyweight champ in the world yeah do you imagine some of the old-school pussy that got you imagine what it must have been like just a funny saying in Sullivan zone in Sullivan's era no formal boxing titles existed he became a champion after defeating paddy Ryan in Mississippi city near Gulfport Mississippi on February 7th 1882 modern authorities have retro actively labeled Ryan the heavyweight champion of America but any claim to Ryan being a world champion would have been dubious he had never contended internationally as Sullivan had I could lick paddy Ryan not crazy Sullivan was first considered the world heavyweight champion after either 1888 when he fought Charlie Mitchell in France or the following year when he knocked out Jake Kilrain in a ready for this round 75 yeah I told you of a schedule of 80 round I had a schedule schedule I didn't know they had an end to the fuck round 75 that hurts my head just how long was each round though was each round like two seconds no I think that's three minutes I think it was just like it is today fuckin'-a what is that in in time what is that in what the fuck is 75 times that I have two hours to 925 minutes so it's a oh my god that's insane they think they're doing a podcast that's insane you imagine bare-knuckle boxing a guy for three hours how much do you believe in whether it is DNA or a soul or something like something that's purely uniquely about that person when they are born and that's part of how they are or how much is culture you know the famous North Shore emergent culture debate what what's your take on what's more important in this I don't know well they have done studies where they've taken twins that were separated at birth and they were adopted and they get them together after not seeing each other entire life they find out they like the same kind of music really yeah they they have very similar likes and dislikes their personalities are very similar there's a strong argument for nature over nurture but there's no denying that nurture plays a huge role as well I don't think it's either/or right I think we live in a soup of possibilities and I think that you can get super lucky with the amount of exposure that you have to positive and even to negative things like there's an expression hard times make good people you know and I do believe that in a certain sense that there's some experiences that children and adults even have they get through and it makes them more empathetic it makes them kinder make some more understanding and it makes them stronger like more more character even that's why it's funny because you're right I mean there's part of that argument that's totally true and you do see that happen a lot and then you see somebody who's through the exact same thing and it makes them ten times more of an asshole yes it's like I got hurt so I'm gonna learn everybody else in the process and I'm and it's like though that's where you think like what is the make this one person make a right turn and go in a direction where they become kinder and nicer because they felt what it is to get hurt and what is the other one make the complete opposite turn and go in a direction of I got hurt so I don't care for anybody else's feeling everybody has to pay for the fact that I got hurt once yeah that's weird right it's like there's that moment where you can really make a 90-degree turn one way or another what is the make people make the choices they make and I think hormones have a stigma in this country because of Barry Bonds and fucking Sammy Sosa and all this crazy shit where everybody's like oh those fucking cheaters in baseball they've ruined everything and sports and everyone is so concerned with what we hear about with cheating and steroids and athletic performance that men you're missing out on a core essential aspect of being a human being being a man especially the lack of testosterone directly related to depression directly related to these these people that start hitting age regardless of traumatic brain injury they start getting older and they feel like fucking shit they feel like shit and I've talked to a lot of them to get on testosterone also and their glow again they have energy they want to start doing things they're active and someone I've talked to guys who are on testosterone that don't like to talk about it because they're worried that someone is gonna look at them first of all as being inferior because they need to add you know artificial testosterone to their system and that they might be a roid head now they might be a cheater and some like what do you fucking plan you're 55 years old you play major league baseball behind my back what the she didn't life your life cheater you're doing - good with these new meanwhile you'll take aspirin if you have a fucking headache gonna take ibuprofen you'll take medication if you're sick like why won't you take testosterone why won't you get your hormone levels change I have a very good friend that it won't do it because he's afraid of all these other thing I'm like bro you look like shit tired all the time right like wow but the end the difference to me is like us being there and these guys who like I sat down with a guy two weeks ago wrote a script about him met him for the first time lovely guy like their sweetest sweetest nicest guy loves to fish and all this and I'm like so how is it like we really get down to basics he's like it's good man it's good but some days I just have to find a reason to go on living yeah sure yeah and you're just like you understand at that point how different it is for these guys like how much more drastic it is how much more important it is to reach out to these guys and and somebody's got to do it what about panda bears are they vicious vicious rapists okay horrible racists okay pandas are the worst koala bears very lot of sexually transmitted disease chlamydia like for real koala bears transmitted sexually transmitted diseases to each other or they die people I think - where'd you get the clap it was so cute and then he starts fucking with it's weird koala bears yeah it's the it's killing them though like hey it's threatening like like funny to take them out the midea the STD threatening an Australian icon yeah I'm just gonna take him down to Planned Parenthood what lady's gonna here's the thing man we're so funny with what we want to keep around you know we have this idea that we are in charge somehow or another makes for the animals don't go extinct and the like koala bear needs to stay around right does it really I mean I don't think we should go kill them all okay I don't think that but if they all died because of fucking herpes yeah I think maybe we should concentrate on poor people before we concentrate on herpes ridden koala bears yeah that's just me dude you're right I'm crazy sensible when it comes to that shit you can accidentally get an STD from a club okay that's what you should have you should have koala bears in your house pole that way you always have a built-in excuse you should
