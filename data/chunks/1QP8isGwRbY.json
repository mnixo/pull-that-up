cool place for our friends to go and do stand-up and the guys that you'll see we're all gonna be really funny guys because we don't hang out with any scrubs yo you know I'm saying the German experience Oh hiya primate my higher primate t-shirts are in - if you go - higher - primate calm people have been asked I finally got all that shit taken care of look I'm a fucking terrible businessman lady tell me that I thought I got some dope t-shirts for sale I supposed to do my taxes today whoops I was like I'll just take that whatever that you get like fined or something like yeah money right it's not like you go to prison immediately right no yeah yeah the type of brain that you know is like really organized that's not the type of brain it does a silly podcast it's a totally different type of brain I'm convinced of that you know I fight with my illogical tendencies and my procrastination and in impulsiveness and craziness but I think that's the only way comedians brains work I don't think yeah I think it's just a constant struggle to try to mend into society with that fucking whack down noodle on your head Brian Redman anyway higher - primary calm that's the t-shirt company it's all like monkeys and mushrooms and shit and there's a really cool Joey Diaz shirt and they're very soft shirts yeah high quality series you're not regular like fucking normal shirts no it's it's like the highest quality we can get we got really high quality soft t-shirt so it's like a fashion t-shirt you know that was the options the options were spend a lot of money on like really expensive t-shirts or sell cheap ones but I think they come out cool this way it's they're expensive they're not cheap but they're really well-made so that's what it is on it calms our other sponsor if you go to oh and and I tea and use the codename rogen you will save 10% of any of the supplements the explanations for all these supplements are also at on it I do a terrible job explaining these things perhaps Steve Asprey could help us because he's far smarter than I and these things I don't really know what's going on I just don't want to use it it's awesome and there's a bunch of studies that say the stuff inside of his awesome alpha brain is my favorite supplement period it's the one thing that I make sure I don't go anywhere without if I'm doing a podcast to bring it with me I'm doing a comedy show of bringing with me I take it before every UFC it's not gonna turn a genius or moron into a genius but I really definitely feel it gives me a mental boost if that makes any sense and there's been shut studies have shown that the the ingredients in the doses that we use it have had positive effects and studies so we're doing our own studies right now it takes 10 to 12 months for a double-blind placebo study from this University in Boston and when they're done they take it and you know process all the information figure out whether or not it's legit so we'll we'll have actual studies but the ingredients that are in the study or the ingredients rather that are in alpha brain in the doses that we use have shown positive results it's just no one's ever proven that there's a synergistic effect of all the ingredients together that's the controversial aspect of it here's the deal though the way we have it set up at on it you get 100% money back from the first 30 pills if you don't think it works if it's not your thing everybody's body is different I don't know what you feel me I know some people can't drink I know some people can't smoke pot some people can't eat peanuts the bodies are different if it's not if you don't feel it I don't know what your sensitivity is if you don't think it's worth it you get a high percent money back you don't have to return the product nobody's trying to rip you off we're trying to sell you shit that I use everything we sell it on it whether it's vitamins or the Blendtec blenders that are coming in tomorrow we start selling those because kale shakes bitches you got to get your morning started off correct I'm telling you it's a way to live life it's it's a healthier way to get out of bed that's my new phrase by the way I say that all to my friends kale shake bitches his fucking guy on the Underground said I went to the supermarket there was no kale damn you Joe Rogan I noticed like restaurants all have like kale everything like kale sees salads now kale yeah when we're in Fianna I have kale Caesar salad yeah I think kale is becoming more popular now it's just one people it's a superfood I mean people are realizing how it's it's really it's got a lot of protein in kale is crazy good for you it's really fucking good for you and when you have it in this massive dose the way I do it I take that the recipe is available on it calm my recipe my recipe is pretty extreme it's got a lot of garlic in it it's got a lot of ginger in it and it's got a fucking wall up like it hit you boom it's it's intense but whoo you feel good afterwards god damn everything just feels just it's alive anyway we also sell kettlebells battle ropes like I said we have the Blendtec blenders coming in and the supplements there's new mood which is a great 5-htp and l-tryptophan supplement that it enhances your your brains production of serotonin and l-tryptophan converts into 5-htp and 5-htp converts into serotonin right so correct yep yeah and this is all done there's all scientific studies behind all this stuff and all the information available like is not just on our comm but at Google if you google nootropics you'll get a better idea whether or not you're interested in anything the most important thing to worry - to have on mind though is you don't have to worry about it so you they're just nutrients it's not drugs you're not going to test positive for anything at work including the hemp horse protein that's a big question that comes up all the time if you have the hemp horse protein no you will there's no way you can taste positive or rather test positive for marijuana hemp is completely non psychoactive it's just a protein it's just plants it's just it's not it's like a cousin to pot and it's illegal unfortunately you could grow it and you can buy it and you can sell it but you can't grow it which is fucking crazy it just shows you what a silly silly silly government we have because it's an awesome plant it's got all the amino acids in it you can make fuel out of it Henry Ford made one of his first cars out of it and the the fiber of the hemp plant is so durable it's really like an alien planet the fact that we don't use it just the hemp forget about the pot smoking pot forget about all that completely pretend that pot didn't exist it was never invented no one ever had it the hemp itself making something like hemp illegal is one of the dumbest things a human being can do it's it's almost like making apples illegal it's it's worse than making apples illegal because you can't make a house out of apples you make a fucking house at a hemp you can construct cars out of it that are stronger than steel it's insane how strong the fibers of this shit is it makes a far superior paper it makes far superior clothing things that don't rip but the reason why it's illegal is because way back in the 1930s they invented a machine called a décor Decatur and the décor Decatur takes hemp fiber and breaks it down and it turns it into something that's useful it's a long and lengthy process that they used to use slaves for then when slavery became it legal it's much easier to get cotton and use cotton than it is to use hemp so that's why it's illegal they all conspired all these people that didn't want to lose out to the hemp industry in the cotton industry in the paper industry especially William Randolph Hearst he read newspapers and he printed stories about Mexican smoking marijuana and raping white women it was all like just craziness to get this one plant illegal and it was actually for its use as a commodity that's what they were trying to squash had nothing to do with it being psychoactive it's amazing that that hustle has lasted so long anyway we have hemp protein that we buy from Canada and it's the shit it's called hemp horse what are you doing I can't handle the truth either I can't heal the truth cuz even I say it when I say that like that story that I just told I know that to be a fact I've read it everywhere it sounds so dumb it sounds so ridiculous it makes me angry it's like people are people are just beyond stupid Brian yes anyway enough of me go to Anna calm that's oh and and I T ooh I almost forgot the tang I've got a lot of fucking commercials man if I was on an Internet I would be complaining about me right now I don't have a lot of commercials you just always go really long on the on it one well you don't hear here's the thing I go along on anything that I absolutely believe it's because you're on it I am on it and it also is because I I do in the middle I don't know how everybody else is doing them but I think a lot of people are sticking them in the conversations now I know that that's what Adam Carolla does he does like podcasts and then he does commercials like radio show they take a little I think that fucks with me maybe that's why the fleshlight was pretty fun because I can always bring the fleshlight up it's like the Olive Garden yes you always could I don't think we should keep it as a sponsor just for that reason ting is an excellent product though and everything we sell in this podcast I guess we're selling things everything we promote there we go everything we're paid to promote is is things that we believe in 100% you don't ever have to worry about us trying to rip you off if there's anything that's being talked about on this podcast it's always going to be 100% to the best of my knowledge and if I'm ever incorrect I will definitely know that it fucked up and everything that we're selling whether it's through on it or through audible.com or even ting is what are you doing with the ting that's not what is ting all right ting is a cell phone service that you you sign up for and they use Sprint's backbone and they sell cool phones they sell like Android phones like the galaxy s3 is big fucking cool ass one that you see in the commercials every day lately and they have it set up so that you can quit at any time you don't have to have contracts your minutes can pile on to like more than one phone like you can share minutes with like you know your wife and you also if you don't use a certain amount of minutes every month if you're allotted a certain many minutes and you don't use them your drop-down and credited to the lower level of payment plant so they actually give you money back I mean it's a really it's a really it's like it's a really fair company it's like I love the the ethical way in which they're choosing to do business there they're saying we make plenty of money let's just do this really fair let's sell people a product but all these killer Android phones they have regular phones - if you're into flip phones but what they decide to do is use this big companies network use Sprint's backbone which is a huge and we can't come up with your own but then you know use it in a way that they feel is fair and so they provide an excellent service and they give you cool phones and you can quit at any time I mean there's no contracts it's it's really it's a beautiful situation and that's really what I think it should be with every cell phone company it's crazy that you get locked in these contracts and they rope you in by giving you some crazy discount on his phone and it's all bananas but the bottom line is if you want to leave because your service sucks it costs a lot of money well not with tang Tang you just you just bail that's it go to Rogan ting calm and you will save 50 bucks off your first digital cellular device for talking to people through the air and you two could be on ting all right bitches Dave Asprey is here we're gonna get to the bottom of things we're gonna get educated we're gonna get experienced whoo that's my new that's my new tagline of being in a very show as cheesy as it gets experience dude we're getting experienced we just got out of it from being on it and now we're getting back in it we're experienced dude that's how I'm feeling that right now Dave thanks for coming man really appreciate it tape Fletcher is your number one fan boys would you please give taint a big shout out the beginners podcast Tate you rock man see it as bulletproof everything every fucking Tweedy sensed a bulletproof my friends it's like he's like the most interesting man in the world but it's about bulletproof you know instead of stay thirsty he totally rocks he loves you man he's got a fucking serious man crush on your ideas homeboy came in with a jug I love tape me and tape both have the coffee addiction I love him for a bunch of reasons but that's one of them we both have the coffee addiction and take comes in with this fucking ridiculous like camping for a month mug filled with bulletproof coffee I said he poured besom it was pretty badass man I was the first my first experience with bulletproof coffee and this is your creation yep and for folks who don't understand what bulletproof coffee is what it consists of what's what's in it exactly it's low toxin coffee which has a different mental effect than the normal stuff this will you can just buy on any street corner you blend it with grass-fed butter that has certain fatty acids short chain fatty acids your brain needs for anti-inflammatory purposes and you blend it with either coconut oil or MCT oil which is a extract of coconut oil that's six times stronger and you blend it it gets foamy and frothy just like the best latte you ever had it doesn't taste gross it doesn't taste buttery and oily and when you drink it you are full for eight hours and you have this incredible focus this mental focus that's it's just insane whoa how's that possible what is it doing it's just it's it's it's causing it's like a synergistic effect with the butter and the the oil of the coffee it makes the the stimulant lasts longer that what it is well the hunger part happens because your butt is getting the short and medium chain fatty acids that are really hard to get in your diet so because you're doing that you're already getting a big boost there and then we believe that it probably helps to escort the terpenes that are inside coffee like kapha stronk alcohol that the psychoactive compounds that are not caffeine we think it helps those go into the brain and the other reason that I'm theorizing that it gives you this kind of boost is because the small drops of fat that are formed when you blend it are called micelles and they absorb better into the body and your body can burn MCT for energy without any digestive process required at all this is a thing that like bodybuilders use to get lean and ripped when they're in the shedding phase it also happens to cure Alzheimer's disease and it makes you feel really good I put it in my kale shakes I put four big teaspoons tablespoons of coconut oil and it tastes good yeah we got a good taste to it everyone should be eating coconut oil unless they're allergic to coconuts it's that straightforward do you remember when they were saying that coconut oil was bad for you when we were kids it's like the American soil sociation got one in there is that what it was yeah they did a like a six-week study of hydrogenated coconut oil versus their crap oil and then what do you know it raised cholesterol and to this day you ask the average like 40 50 year-old American you say coconut oil they say cholesterol there's not in there like it's cholesterol free not that it's a problem if it has cholesterol but salt that's another one people are so silly with salt salt gives you high blood pressure something no salt is a fucking mineral you dummies it's as an essential mineral and you can have too little of it salt is not making you fat that is so crazy that that thought that salt is making you fat has always driven me fucking bananas it's gonna give you high blood pressure with all that salt do you know that the that it raises your blood pressure within the error margin of a blood pressure cuff that's it but it's meaningless why does everybody connect salt to high blood pressure it has to do with the marketing of an anti blood pressure drugs so they found out back in about 1960 that that was how that that was a way to lower blood pressure well if you get people to basically pee more water out their blood gets thicker so then their blood pressure goes down so they started looking at salts effect on that and they went down this path and get this in 1997 The Lancet medical journal which is kind of a badass one they published a whole thing about how the salt myth didn't work how there was scientific fraud how people probably should have gone to jail for spending taxpayer money and making up data and yet to this day you still hear government campaigns to lower salt consumption knowing full well that it makes your adrenals break when you don't get enough salt I do 10 grams a day I have for 10 years I carry a vial of it around with me I wouldn't think of starting the morning without a teaspoon of salt whoa every morning Jordan shakes yeah okay there's a reason for it okay what kind of salt what's the best I like the Himalayan crystal salt it's dope just cuz it comes from the Himalayas yeah bringing back some fucking Himalayan salt Sun and you know and there's other kinds any kind of sea salts gonna do it but there's less pollution in the Himalayan stuff and I like the idea that it's aren't that it's mined by one-armed monks it's just is it really no that's all the only way to get a job there's you know chop off one of your arms does it do it there's enough people out there that would do it probably we're fucking crazy man I guarantee you they would do it so what is the benefit of putting the salt in your body every morning here's what happens when you wake up at morning when you first wake up your body says and this is like your reptilian brain the low-level parts of your operating system you don't pay any attention to you oh that mean the whole thing exactly so you wake up and it says hmm this this body is gonna stand up in a minute and when it stands up I've got to have enough blood pressure in the brain if I don't have enough blood pressure in the brain he's gonna pass out and a Tigers gonna eat him so this is like a survival level imperative inside your body so what does it do it goes your adrenal glands and says hey buddy could you crank up some cortisol and could you change the sodium to potassium ratio I need you to find sodium which is hard for people to do that's why we used to pay our soldiers in salt instead of in gold and then it says crank down a potassium crank up on sodium if in the morning you take your sodium and you drink it soon after you wake up your adrenal glands don't have to do all that work so then you have that adrenal function for the rest of the day to feel good just okay how you pulled it out so anyhow what what's happening here all right folks your your adrenal glands are more relaxed I actually recommend this especially for women when they're pregnant because they have enough stress already I have a book coming out in January about like how to have better jeans and bigger brains in your kids starting even before you get pregnant knowing this having this knowledge in your head does it infuriate you when you see these lower salt you know campaigns and you hear people talking about it like you know lower low salt foods like what is that it used to infuriate me but to be honest I've done enough of the meditation the brain hacking like I don't get mad at stuff like that because it's not worth the cost of getting mad but what I do is I do something about it like that's why I started the bulletproof exactly 300 pounds I was profoundly unhealthy for the first half of my life and no one taught me any of the things that my body can do it's just the knowledge wasn't out there and now it is but there's credibility problems and like look I'm a pretty successful guy and I wouldn't have been this successful if I hadn't learned all this stuff so here it is and it's free I just give it to people I've got seven people working for me now doing this Wow so you were 300 pounds of how old were you when this was going let's see I hit a 23 years old I hit the runner pounds 297 yeah holy shit that big what was that like I mean it sucked I was fat as a teenager terrible diet well I thought I was eating the right stuff you know in fact during that time I worked out six days a week for an hour and a half a day and I ate 1,800 calories you know what if your hormones are jacked you're not gonna lose weight I did eat less than my thin friends I just couldn't lose the weight I was tired all the time too and you have thyroid anything with your thighs I did have some thyroid issues but it wasn't just the I ride like there's all kinds of toxin and even like swelling that happens in the body if you have chronic inflammation turned on you're gonna be storing a third of your fat maybe it's not even fat it's just like tissue inflammation so for me I had to figure out what was causing my inflammation and what's your cortisol levels so there's all these delicate hormones that you manipulate through your food and through your environment and the idea that calories in calories out matters I run this experiment it was a little crazy I know that the calorie thing is completely broken because we're not robots you know we're not like a car you put gas in you get so many miles as long as the wind resistance is the same so I thought I would eat 4,000 calories a day I'd sleep five hours a night or less and I'd stop exercising and I thought maybe I'll gain you know a couple pounds in a month or two and I'll say look I should've gained 10 pounds I gained 2 pounds I went for two years I posted a picture of a six-pack that grew during that time I should weight 616 pounds after two years of this program not counting the sleep deficit and I weighed 210 at the end of it and actually was more muscular than I was before of course I was drinking bulletproof coffee I was doing bulletproof intermittent fasting which I developed during that time which is intermittent fasting but you have only fat in the morning which gives you this huge boost the one that taya was talking about when he was here with you so you can do all these crazy things with the body but I'll tell you flat out like fat doesn't make you fat and calories don't make you fat calories fuel your brain though they're useful but they're not a very good way of measuring your intake of food so what is what how does someone get fat then it turns out things like leptin resistance things like inflammation in the gut and things like insulin all play a role there what happens is your mitochondria and your cells also can get weak you actually get used to having to eat every two hours this idea of frequent snacking to keep your energy up what you do is you're teaching the body to actually like need to not be able to store to not be resilience not be able to store any kind of calories at all what I do is I teach my body to fad and I keep my calories at at least 50% of my calories are coming from fat and most of that is saturated fat with some omega-3s mixed in and what happens there is I can eat pretty much as much as I can stand and I won't gain any weight that way so it's it's simply what causes obesity isn't one single thing but I will tell you one of the unknown things that is a major contributor is synthetic estrogen in the environment a lot of that comes from mold in our food supply it's called Zarrella known we actually purify it and feed it to industrial beef we put it in a little waxy pellet in the cow's ear and here's an example of how much this stuff works user a low note it can increase what they call feed efficiency for livestock by 30 percent feed efficiency means if I don't give them this drug and I give them a pound of food they gain you know however many ounces of fat or or meat that the cow is going to gain you put this pellet in their area changed or hormonal function they gain 30 percent more weight on the same amount of food that stuff is fat soluble and it bioaccumulates you do not want to be eating hormone treated beef that was treated to get fat really really quickly so we know flat out just because in animal husbandry if we can change the calories in calories out equation by 30 percent why couldn't we do it in humans and the answer is we can and that's why every time someone tells me measure how much you eat and measure how much you exercise and you lose weight it's the biggest myth I have the whole a whole big like research like 30 references and blog post about that it's just not true it never was so when someone drops their calories down and exercises and starts losing fat well what what are they doing you can do it for a little while but here's what happens and I can tell you this because I did that lots of times you lose 25 pounds you gain 25 pounds to lose 25 pounds so it's a slingshot sort of a thing yeah and there's something called epigenetics and epigenetics is like one of the main subjects of this book that I wrote and it's it's awesome because epigenetics shows how the environment changes the expression of your genes and you get signals from the environment all the time and two of the biggest signals that you can ever send your body that change the way you actually methylate your DNA are there's a threat there's something chasing me it won't stop and you do this by going for a run every single day without rest instead of practicing high intensity interval training or instead of giving yourself some recovery time there's a lot of athletes and even non athletes who were just playing overtrained they don't get enough recovery time to actually build the muscle up that they should build because that he'll rip it down again by lifting the next day so that's one signal which is that like there's a threat to my species because I keep getting injured on a daily basis I keep having to run the other signal you can send is there's a famine and you tell your body there's a famine by eating low calories or low fat diets when you do that it changes your gene expression and we know that people who went through a famine that their grandkids have a two to three times higher chance of getting type 2 diabetes this stuff passes down through the generations so I'll tell you flat out like if you're going on especially a low-fat vegan diet and you're planning to reproduce your kids are going to be weaker than they would have been before and the evidence there is pretty darn strong it's a multiple generation effect Wow so a vegan diet is lacking and what it's lacking in saturated fat for one things you're a pilot way to make up for it and with a vegan diet if you're conscious about it you can get some in coconut oil but coconut oil does not have conjugated linoleic acid it doesn't have a lot of the micronutrients that are present in animal products you can probably get by on a vegetarian a very careful vegetarian buy it but diet but in terms of being like fully optimal as in kicking ass at the maximum level of what the human body can do it's going to take more than just a yoke it's going to take some steak and it's gonna take some lamb and it's gonna take some cod liver oil and things like that if you're gonna be a hundred percent vegan I honestly I know enough people now who posted on my blogs even some close personal friends one of them was a black belt in Aikido he went vegan and 18 months later he's allergic to everything like he had to go back but he did it seriously just decimated his health so it's it's a careful thing to do but I know people who do it then they're very healthy guys like Mac Danzig he's very healthy and he's he's been a vegan for years there definitely are some very healthy vegans I'm friends with some Aaron Simpson one of the guys who fights in the UFC very healthy guy he's a vegan how old are these guys Aaron I think it's 36 37 so I'm really curious most he's younger what their blood work looks like I'd love to see like an anti-aging panel from one of those guys I don't know if any of them has ever posted it but I'd love to just go through it and look at their triglycerides from all the fructose they eat and that's one serious thing with c-reactive protein every anti-aging physician I've worked with when I say that I've run an anti-aging nonprofit group called Silicon Valley Health Institute svh i.com or org we've been around for 19 years bringing guys in like Aubrey de Grey and other like big-time anti-aging people to give lectures and to a tea every single one of them except one has said flat-out I won't take a vegan patient because I cannot make them age less quickly like it just doesn't work and these are guys who like see 10 patients a day with carefully demonstrated panels the bottom line is it it's I would love it if the vegan diet was was safe and effective I was a raw vegan for about four months and after that I became a raw omnivore for another six or seven months before I went off to Tibet in China I'm not eating raw yak and in Tibet no no I just said I was kind of hanging out from the mud wall I'm like you better cook that yeah yak huh was the active life it's actually awesome some of the best meat I've ever had it really it's better than grass-fed beef even like the best primo grass-fed really yeah yeah huh well you would think people would know about that well the problem is it only eats some kind of weird moss that grows at high altitude and it dies when you bring it to low altitude so it's kind of a constrained supply oh wow that's fascinating it's it's a really tough animal though yaks yeah I mean they're they're ginormous like most of the things you see are only half yak half cow but the real ones are bigger than I can take they taste good I would think they'd be like real game yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah la manana oh yeah so this is an incredibly fascinating subject to me because I've always wondered like what it is about certain people they store so much fat and and certain people just stay lean no matter what some of that obviously is genetics yep but what is wrong with their diet that takes a person and just it blows them up to 350 400 pounds I mean what it's there's got to be a there's a critical issue right is it sugar is it what is it is it pastas and carbs that turn to sugar it's actually sugar plus inflammation so it's that combination of omega-6 like excess omega-6 oils plus sugar ORN syrup and things like that what you're doing is you're basically just just completely wrecking the metabolism when you do that Omega 6 oils have lots of poly unsaturated bonds I'm talking corn oil canola oil stuff like that and vegetable oil what happens there soy oil is another one every unsaturated bond in that oil can oxidize and what oxidizes it is oxygen heat and light so most of these oils get oxidized before you even eat them but in the body you try and make cell walls out of them and when that happens you end up with less flexible cell walls that aren't able to express the insulin receptors very well right so we end up with lots of problems like that because we end up getting these oils that oxidize easily when they're oxidized inside the body they make free radicals so you get general systemic inflammation and you can measure these levels like if you take a vegan and you look at their omega-6 to omega-3 ratio it can be 30 40 to one the average American on a crap industrial meat diet is at forty to one right now my blood levels are one point two eight to one of my omega-6 to omega-3 ratios and that helps me to crank my inflammation way down and it helps me to express healthy insulin receptor receptors so I don't get insulin resistance I don't get leptin resistance and that lets me even now I can god I can eat a relatively heavy sugar meal I don't get a coma from it even though I used to get a comma from it when I weighed 280 pounds or 300 pounds I can also go 18 hours without eating and it doesn't bother me in the slightest and that's a pretty big difference from I used to be the guy I'm like it's 11:45 I got a I got we gotta end this meeting right now because I have to eat because if I don't eat I'm gonna kill someone but you can go 18 hours yeah I did it yesterday yeah I had my last meal at 4 p.m. last night and then again at 2:00 today I guess that was 122 hours now what do you say about people that say they you should have like some sort of a post-workout sugary meal some like a lot of glucose high glucose a little bit of protein what do you think about that I've looked at that and what you're trying to do there is you're trying to spike your insulin afterwards because insulin what we have insulin-like growth factor igf-1 which is cause you'd build muscles it's insulin light because as the same effects as insulin so you eat a lot of sugar spike your insulin allegedly lay down more muscle there's a couple studies I've seen and I can't cite sources from memory right now but what what I recall from seeing them is that it looks like that the effect and igf-1 probably isn't as good as you'd like it to be what I do after I work out is I typically have a good amount of protein a good amount of fat and some starch not a lot and I choose low toxin starches which is kind of hard to do I've got the bulletproof diet up on the site where it's a free but it's an infographic that basically ranks foods based on 3criteria and if you get a bulletproof starch like a white rice that's properly rinsed and cooked or sweet potatoes butternut squash things like that what you're doing is you're getting your carbs up enough that you can still even stay in a state of ketosis maybe maybe not but what you can do there is you can reduce your stress hormone levels and that eating right after you workout drops your cortisol and if your quarters old doesn't get dropped in that post-workout window you get a cortisol spike that lasts for 48 hours and so you're not gonna get as much muscle so it's absolutely critical to eat but do you need sugar or do you need protein and fat I would tend towards protein and fat with a small amount of starch so how did it get started that people learned how to drink chocolate milk that was like the big thing for a while it was like chocolate milk is the best post-workout drink you know there's effects from milk on igf-1 as well like milk will cause you to put on weight it'll cause you to put on fat too if you want to bulk up you know milk works for bulking up white chocolate milk because someone said oh let's raise the insulin some more but kinda like what's in chocolate milk at least make your own with real chocolate what is in chocolate it's usually high fructose corn syrup like what is terrible for you yeah and plus you've got problems with when you homogenized milk you take those fat droplets that you bought it really needs and you put them through a super fine screen under pressure which makes these extremely fine fat droplets that you bought it doesn't know how to handle that can actually enter cells so a modernization can increase inflammation and it causes weird fat reactions that that your body is not ready for and also when they pasteurize the milk you may get casein and casein is an inflammatory compound depending on how its processed but it's a very careful protein I don't need any case and I know lots of people who are just plain allergic to it and I mean you've probably had people in here talking about the China Study mmm that was an incredibly misrepresented book but one of the key points at the very beginning was that casein can increase inflammation and be linked to liver cancer and that's actually true so and in order to get some protein you're getting casein which has been pasteurized you're getting fat in the wrong form you're getting high-fructose corn syrup I could probably formulate a better post-workout drink using MCT oil like bulletproof low toxin chocolate maybe you could use honey even like raw honey has a different effect than say normal sugar does and normal cigarettes a different effect on high-fructose corn syrup what is the deal with corn why why do we use so much corns high fructose corn syrup and corns and so many difference everywhere is that a lobby thing is that yeah corn and soy our lobby things and also farm subsidies right you know you grow corn and soy you get extra money from the government for growing this stuff we've got the whole Monsanto connection there which is just beyond evil from my perspective it's confusing it's very confusing that it's real it's very confusing that there's a company out there that's trying to make these genetically modified food then force farmers to grow them and when you see the suicide rates in India they're they're absolutely stunning I mean it's like they're having suicides there every day all day long people are killing themselves cuz of monsanto there's been hundreds of thousands of suicides in India linked to Monsanto it's it's really crazy these poor farmers well there's even more profound evil going on and one of my pet peeves things I talk about and I've studied it extensively is called mycotoxins and these are toxins that form from fungus in the environment and the combination of dupont plus monsanto is a shocking story like 30 years ago dupont made this pesticide called bento mill and what been a mill did is it killed all fungus like 98% of fungus a touch which is died unfortunately the other 2% would get like x-men mutation turned on so whole plasmid level mutation it's called what this means is that instead of one gene mutating like nature does whole groups or jeans would mutate and get this a fungus can change plaid MIT plasmids like baseball cards with other fungus so what's going on here is we created x-men fungus that reproduce every 20 minutes 30 years ago and some of these new toxic molds that are like uber vicious you know that poison people in their houses and all and I've had that happen to me you know stachybotrys and Aspergillus in your kitchen will mess your head up sometimes permanently and what's going on is been a meal made these toxic but then you spray roundup on soil roundup completely the soil microbes these are like the probiotics of the planet like our soil health is really important so now you get mutated eczema and stuff growing in the soil and then you piss it off with Roundup you get 500 times more toxins and then that mold that's left loose arrium grows in the corn in fact it's a major pest it's a major pest for corn in the US you get dried corn with toxic mold forming foo sorry a minute it a majorly large percentage I don't know for this year some years it's up to 98 percent of corn has this toxic mold growing in it what it's crazy stuff and this is not like any kind of weird you know conspiracy theory thing this is documented in agricultural science just known in biochemistry that I know of tends to read the studies on mycotoxins because they're all like often agricultural land instead of in health land so you're saying that 98% of corn has this micro toxin in it and it's not killed by any production process in turning into bread or turning it into corn bread or tortillas or anything like that it's a Maiko not micro my CEO like as in Micah like 1x it arrived yeah like micelles right and some of it is killed we've heard of these micro toxins before aflatoxin everyone knows that's a bad one in peanuts or penicillin like a tiny little little capsule of penicillin which is just mold extract has this profound effect on your body right well there's other stuff out there that has a profound effect on your body at a parts per million level and I don't know if this year 98% of corn is that's the maximum I found in my data but at least a third almost every year in the u.s. of corn of dried corn product that's out there like animal feed like masa like corn tortillas has stuff in it and for sorry makes three classes of toxins that mess with your brain and with your hormones and with your protein formation and that's why on the bulletproof diet I look first at macronutrients and then I look at anti-nutrients like mycotoxins and heterocyclic amines and all the others and you got to be a little careful on your food if you want to like really kick ass and be mentally focused all the time these are the things that get in there and muck with your head some people are more sensitive than others but if you reduce the level these things in your diet you think better and that's one reason you do the bulletproof diet in the morning all you're drinking with bulletproof intermittent fasting is low toxin coffee low toxin butter and toxin free MCT oil you do that you've got nothing messing with your head only good stuff no bad stuff that is absolutely fascinating so everyone's being poisoned essentially everyone who's eating all these corn products is being poisoned yep at low levels they are and the links between heart disease and cancer and mycotoxins are very well-established in fact the w-h-o researcher who's written the most research of anyone on mycotoxins has a whole book this thick called fungal bionics where he cites 900 different studies about the links between atherosclerosis and cancer that's heart disease direct quote from this author he says there was a known cause of atherosclerosis and it is mycotoxins pig farmers know this they know that if they get great these grains that have mold growing in them they have test kits they can buy where they test the grain because they know they feed too much grain to the to the pigs the pigs will get lesions in their arteries or the pigs will lose their litter before they can deliver it but what they do is they wait till the pigs are far enough along then they feed the cheaper toxic grain to the pigs or the cows and that fatten them up faster and it costs less money and the fact that some of that stuff is still in the meat your problem Wow so when you're getting pork chops you're getting it because they eat grain it all depends on who fed the pig Jesus Christ so when you're getting steak you're getting that sure if you're not eating grass-fed steak you're making a mistake and that's one of the reasons you go on a vegan diet if you're eating really good quality non mouldy vegan food you're gonna get less toxins like you compare vegan or vegetarian versus standard industrial meat based you know meat and hydrogenated fat and msg diet man I would rather be a vegan than a standard American diet any day of the week the problem is that if I want to for many many years have the highest energy levels the most focus with the least amount of effort you're not gonna be able to achieve that in the vegan diet and I don't think you'll hit your very top level of performance as a hundred percent vegan you could probably be mostly vegan but you're gonna be missing out on some things over time like it's there's pretty good research on my side about that this is it's it's unbelievable that you you sound so convincing but I'm too stupid to know if you're right there's a lot of convincing vegans out there too yes there are well you know there's a lot of people that tell you how much it changed their life but my point with a lot of those people is that generally it's not all but generally they come from a really bad diet and then they starting a vegetable and they feel better of course you didn't feel better but I think your point really does make a lot of sense to what is what is the optimum way to do it this is all stuff I had never heard before I had never heard that all meat has some sort of low level mic Michael Michael Michael toxin Michael toxin but it's only industrial meat like the I have half a cow in my fridge it grew up three miles from my house it costs three dollars and fifty cents a pound and it's grass-fed it would never ate any grain it was well treated it was butchered humanely and it tastes awesome like he's really good meat so what'd he do you have a big freezer yeah I just have a they cost 300 Costco it's not even that hard to do is by the freezer toss it in the back of the car bring it home throw it in the basement and you've got meat that costs a third of what its gonna cost her or 20% of what it would cost at Whole Foods I've got links on my site you can order a hundred pounds at a time just have it shipped to your house Jesus Christ but doesn't it taste funky because it's frozen you know this is a funny thing about me when they hang meat to let it age mmm what they're doing is they're letting basically mold and bacteria in the environment like work on the meat right well the links between that those molds and human health are not so good think about it this is a mold that likes to eat meat and Jo you and me are made out of meat so the incidence of low-level fungal infections like I don't need dry aged meat that's cooked really rare because there's still active fungus that likes to eat what I'm made out of in there fuck it man how do I not know about that's how I burn calories Jose this banette that's it you snorted yeah norton mold so it turns out you want the freshest of anything as soon as you kill it and you drain the blood throw it in the freezer and when you're ready to eat it take it out how many hours from the time its killed is it butchered and then frozen the stuff that I have I actually specially requested it was about two days two days yeah so just meat lays around for two days yeah what they do is they hang it in a climate-controlled environment which lets all the blood come out but typical like high-end steak 21 days sometimes up to like 64 days dry-aged yeah and then you know drives me tastes amazing I'm not gonna even say that it's bad but the difference in how dry aged meat makes your brain feel versus fresh meat that's been frozen right away and then defrosted and cooked you will feel like a different human being when you eat that stuff what is killed during the freezing process is there anything that's killed it's not about the killing although it and kill parasites like they used that in sushi now you freeze sushi for a while at very low temperatures to kill parasites what's going on is you're preventing the formation of these basically psychoactive compounds that form in addition to those nice yummy flavors that come from the yeast and the fungus sending tendrils into the meat so that nice kind of soft mushy dry aged meat even if it's grass fed it has health impacts including cardiovascular impacts that are not present for fresh meat that was frozen Wow but yet so delicious nature's fucked us again man I still eat bacon no problems there's the thing why does Drake cuz dry-aged does taste pretty damn good here's how we discovered diet right how long we really had good freezers right not that long that's right so you're gonna kill a giant cow a hundred years ago you're gonna hang it in the coolest place you can find and you're gonna whack off pieces of an eat it like kind of cow on the cob right yeah I guess so I mean back then there must have eaten a lot of rotten meat just check it yeah keep it going now did that have anything to do with the this appendix or was the appendix for processing fiber was the appendix for processing I don't think that there's a scientific consensus there I've heard it it's a store for for probiotics potentially like the healthy bacteria like that's like the the little storehouse for them but I have never heard a definitive this is why we had an appendix that everyone agreed with so humans for a long time had to be able to deal with a certain amount of fungus and bacteria but we still daily in fact Wired magazine just published this whole thing like oh we've been focusing on the genome of the bacteria in the gut and we just noticed there's just as much fungus growing in your gut as there is bacteria and we don't know anything about it Jesus Christ how weird is it that we have organisms that are essential to human survival and they live inside of our intestinal tract they're essential if you don't have them you will die the question is are they apart from I mean that's a part of being human right if you're dead without him and they're just like part of your repair system yeah they're the soldiers they're your little soldiers that's what I when I tell people about probiotics I used to get sick a lot when I went on the road until I really started getting into kombucha is my favorite because it's easy I like the way it tastes and I'll drink a couple of those a day and I'm covered and it's made a huge significant impact on how many colds if I get I'm it just they stopped they just stopped I love it and the way I explain to people I go it's like how when you eat healthy bacteria it's like sending soldiers you have healthy soldiers they're gonna go out and whack all the shitty things that you touch like it really does work that yeah but now think about this if you do that do you drink your kombucha and then you go have a normal you know rib eye that was fed industrial meat it's got antibiotics in that meat they use antibiotics as they make animals fatter faster so that it's it's not that they're using it to keep them from getting sick they just want the the muscle striations they want the fat to marbled through the muscle so now you're eating that you just waxed those nice bacteria that you put in your gut and that's why I'm kind of militant when I go out I'll eat fish like non farmed fish wild caught fish long before I'm an eat steak at a normal steak house if they say oh it's grass-fed grass-finished steak I'm like double you know load me up I'll have two pounds of it but the rest of the time when I'm on the road I'm you know you'll see my backpack I've got you know smoked sockeye salmon that stuff is as clean as it gets so when you go to a restaurant what we're kind of still you're you'd rather but it's hard to even get wild fish man a lot of fish is farmed fish like that weird salmon where they actually changed the color of the flesh to try yeah that's that's not right you get these prison bitch salmon the ones that you buy in the supermarket they have like this pale flesh it's like they just like fuck it and it's mushy it's gross it doesn't they feeding in pellets you know and the pellets are like soy and corn and antibiotics plus ground-up sardines it's they're environmentally destructive like you shouldn't buy farmed fish on principle yeah cuz it's bad for the world like our oceans are already screwed up enough we don't need that it's also like it seems fucked up I mean it's it's it's fucked up enough to catch them with Nets you know just swoop through an entire environment kill everything and rope it up and that's fucked up enough but at least those are wild exact wild until that moment and they got jacked but to just live in this fucking Kitty pond while they throw this bullshit and on top you know that's all you have to eat so it seems fucking stupid I think with there's certain things that people do to animals that are really airing it zoos are one of them ah you know it's kind of break my heart even though the real natural ones but I've been to zoos like in Cambodia and all and like you see the stress behavior now it's just horrible it shouldn't be allowed didn't look I got my hypocrite because I go cuz I want my kids to see what animals look like because it's interesting but if I had my choice I would say don't let these and bring me back to the woods man let them live in the jungle let the liver they live this is nonsense like you either either want to get rid of them because they're dangerous or you know leave them the fuck alone those are those are two options the idea that you can take them and just lock them in this little environment so people can stare at them as they pace in circles that's torture that's craziness and even let them kill anything and you know it's bad look what they feed those animals they'll die like in a third the amount of time they live in the wild and it's not just stress for me in captivity and you know having people throw cigarette butts at you it's because they feed them crap yeah and they're sort of figuring that out oh look they keep dying and we keep you know having surgery and doing all this weird stuff to keep them alive kind of like they do for people now yeah they're giving them prison food poor fuckin gorillas so sad it was it admins watch them piece around that thing I was like wow you know my two-year-old thinks it's awesome but you know to to mates it's it's kind of trippy Eagles at Eagles in this net the Eagles couldn't fly it was crazy there I like a little bit and then land and fly a little bit you're like oh my god they must be doing nuts that fucking bald eagles yeah and they can't just soar like they could soar man and float around and they were gonna like kill rabbits and things like that pretty sure they're not getting much of that going on you know it'll even go pellet it's they're giving them dog shit in a can you know it's like it's terrible what are they feeding them they push a little tray of meat and the eagle eats it's ridiculous we would that we would take away the one thing that nature must have them set up for a massive reward of endorphins and of you know Sara whatever the fuck they're little brains produce a little lizard that's good questions evil eyes you know look at the eyes of an eagle what a creepy fucking eyeball those things that eagle is just representing our country very well to fly have you ever heard of that video where that crazy dude that used john ashcroft remember john yeah super crazy super crazy but he has a song remember did we play on the podcast once yeah we won't play it again just look up john ashcroft let the eagle soar oh my god or let the eagle fly what is it something like that was an ADD dubstep at the end of its probably better it's it's it's amazingly crazy have you seen it a long time ago yeah it's amazingly crazy did you watch that skydiver yes that was amazing did you see that that's awesome I was hoping that a UFO was gonna snatch him out of the sky on his way down how does she not faint because doesn't that something like you know like scaring a bunny rabbit that that just your body can't take falling from space she almost did he said he was spinning and he said that if he spends fun anymore he could pass out and die and so he was like do I pull the ripcord and slow down and I hit the record and he said I'm just gonna do it anyway and he didn't pass out Wow yeah he was flipping yeah and then he leveled out somehow or another I don't know how he leveled out guess he had the flying squirrel thing just oh yeah he it was really weird to watch him step off of it though that was really weird to be right behind him with the camera and watch him just drop out of sight that's pretty epic that dude was in a balloon I didn't know you could take a balloon to space that's ridiculous no no who'd want to take a balloon to space why haven't we done this already one of their trips to go to space in a balloon hair Richard Branson should check this guy out what's up rich and if you're right here's another question is it possible you hit by a satellite cuz don't satellites whip around the earth sure it would be going like five hundred miles an hour somewhere but they're usually probably like the you know like states off you know millions of miles off like oh that almost hit me like a satellite it's the space junk so we didn't talk about this but like I I'm a geek like I I'm a vice president at a computer a net security company like Silicon Valley guy and yeah we have like problems with space junk serious problems where they map it all out and there's like storms were like little nuts from like a Chinese rocket from 40 years ago or whatever is spinning around to putting up holy ears and they're like bullets I mean there's our hypersonic and they poke holes in satellites they can kill people in Space Station so it's getting to be like my gosh yeah it's kind of dangerous up there Jesus Christ did you imagine sitting in the fucking Space Station and you hear like bolts yeah you're dinging and you're like that just punched the hole as a hole right through the other side and you look down your leg is bleeding they track all that stuff now so they know if it's coming oh my god they track the bolts that are flying in space because how many of them are there like hundreds of thousands now oh and you have like whole like you know leftover fuel capsules and all this stuff astronaut poop that they just serious like frozen you know things they'd like beaned by a frozen turd when you're out on a spacewalk a kicking ow I've had it semi frozen turd beamed at me and it's still hurt I can't believe that I can't believe this hundreds of thousands of piece of junk up there that's insane yeah no one's gonna clean that either it's not like you can put a net up there and scoop it all up yes guess where most of it came from military exercises let's blow up a satellite in orbit and see what happens like oh it scatters crap all over orbit yeah it's just an environmental problem just like we have in our oceans or somewhere else the military so crazy that in the 60s when they first started like thinking about going to the moon they did that a thing called Operation starfish prime where they shot a nuclear bomb up into the atmosphere and blew it up they blew it up in the radiation belts just let's see what happened what will happen they're crazy nobody knows nobody they had to go hey hey hey what are you doing just fucking do it to see what happens you guys crazy yeah what's the benefit of shooting a nuclear bomb into space you crazy fucks there's the gun nuts on that stuff it's interesting my grandparents met on the Manhattan Project like in love in Chicago before Los Alamos my my grandmother's a master's degree in nuclear engineering and one like a lifetime achievement reward for a nuclear engineering like one of two women ever it's like I grew up in a nuclear family like this but even they're like could we stop blowing those things up everywhere like they're kind of useful in a war but like maybe blowing up a few hundred of them around the planet isn't a good idea well have you ever seen the there's an animated gif file or it's maybe it's a video that shows all of the on the globe shows you a map of the world and shows all of the nuclear explosions in their correct order that have taken place all the tests and it's like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom the union's boomp boomp boomp what have you you should link to that hold that up video of all of the nuclear explosions just try to you'll you'll find it but I've seen it it's fast there's been like more than a hundred yeah yeah a hundred nuclear explosions I did not know that it's really scary and some of the things that happen there we have a kind of a rise in thyroid cancer and g-get radioactive iodine out there and if these have an environmental impact yeah and some of the stuff we don't even understand like low-frequency vibrations on Earth's crust from those things there's biological effects from the reverberation of the Earth's crust here to the Schumann residence when Thunder strikes you get this reflection between the ionosphere and the Earth's crust and it creates a basically a Brown to 10 Hertz I forget the exact 9 point something Hertz frequency and if we don't have this like we don't work very well as humans in fact in the Russian space program they actually figured out that they were not doing well at all they actually replicate this inside the spacecraft now they make a rumble it just sound you don't hear it it's in it like an electrical thing it's a super low frequency EMF so this OH this EMF that's given out by thunder and lightning it actually has a positive effect on human beings yeah it's like a timing signal if we don't get it we don't do so well it's right in the Alpha brainwave spectrum oh yeah in fact I have a human way of resonance creation thing in my in my house like it's one of things that lowers biological stress when you have a Schumann resonance that your low level biological like electrical systems can sink to uh-huh it lowers the stress if you have like Wi-Fi routers and things like that all over the place your body tries to like find a signal and it doesn't get one very well and when it doesn't get one very well it just raises your course all levels your body's trying to find a signal what do you mean by that so there's an electromagnetic signal on the earth and it sounds kind of goofy to be honest but one of the ways you can do this is with an earthing Matt and I kind of went out on a limb and I started for promoting these as like this thing rocks and what this is is is a mat it's made out of electrically conductive fibers it's just silver woven into a sheet and you plug it into the round part of the electro outlet at your house so just the grounding part or you stick it into the earth drop it out the window on a wire and stick it into the ground you do this and it normalizes your cortisol excretion at night your sleep improves really dramatically especially for jet lag I absolutely will not travel without my earthing mat because I don't get jet lag at all anymore like it's just a non-issue what this is racing this Lance Armstrong uses this on the Tour de France in order to recover faster like you recover from injuries faster when you're grounded and there's an electrical thing you can measure that's happening there there's two effects one is you build up a charge on your body and you can just pick this up with a meter you we're walking around indoors or wearing shoes like rubber shoes all the time so we basically just the error over our skin builds up a static charge when you get you know spark you're like in the desert you know you touch the most static electricity that's an extreme example of it but our bodies kind of work like big batteries like we have different electrical fields and different electrical potentials inside the body so when you spend about 20 minutes walking in in grass barefoot or laying on earthing mats being on the beach what you're doing is you're dropping the extra charge that's built up over time and when you do that you heal faster you you really do recover faster it's profoundly amazing how well it works there's cardiologists recommending this there's a whole book written about this I might have heard about people lying in the grass sleeping in the grass that's why to help them heal I thought this was such BS but like I used to fly to Cambridge England every six weeks I was a vice president of a company based out there and I'd fly from from the Bay Area out there and that's like the worst commute ever in terms of time zones like you're flying East and I would go tonight say all right in the morning when I land I've been exercise to raise my body temperature and that's gonna be how I hacked my jet my jet lag and one day I did yoga in the park because like the only day of the year it was not rainy in England and that time I had no gel I can like yes my exercise works and the next time I do it no tell her I'm the same exact thing and had horrible jetlag like what is it and I finally like like understood years later what would had really been the variable that I didn't know to look for so this is one of things it's like a $70 little item and you try it and you just know it works I wish marijuana was legal to grow because I went to grow room once and this dude had this and he was legal was a legal setup I go into this back room and he's got this room larger than this room and it's filled with these really happy cannabis plants and they have there have been taken care of with the perfect fertilizer and the perfect soil composition there's misters or going on constantly and they're a really healthy and vibrant and you walk in that room and you feel them and it sounds like hippie bullshit but I wasn't even high I walked in that room stone-cold sober and I was like whoa this this this is like like they have a frequency like there's like it's an intangible thing that I sense I can feel it but I wouldn't know how to describe what it's doing I do a lot of work at that level with the biohacking I'd talk about so you have this reptilian brain that's responsible for low level systems in the body it's the same thing a salamander has and its senses stuff but it does it so fast that you don't even know what happened like if you put your hand on a hot stove you'll pull your hand away before you know the stove is hot that's an example of this thing in action so what it does is it picks up all kinds of stuff from the environment a lot of stuff we don't even understand yet but it does it and it matches patterns so fast that you might just get like a wisp of an intuition from it but what's going on there is like the animal part of you is totally picking up all these things and you can train yourself to basically be more sensitive to what it what it's telling you and you can train yourself and train it to behave better because that reptilian brain is what gets us in a lot of trouble it's all how you know when someone's upset at you you know when someone's upset at you even if they're trying to pretend they're not you know there's something wrong they're giving you a certain feel now I'm gonna sound like a total hippie wacko it's which I'm not too late time so you're on this show I'll take that so I'm an adviser to this company called the hard math Institute and heart math makes a heart rate variability training device these guys are Silicon Valley geeks they spent 20 years looking at like meditation and how you quantify meditation like what's going on in the body and it turns out by looking at the spacing between your heartbeats you can totally change the way your brain works in the way your body works and in the course of the research they went out and they did some really heavy-duty science and there's actually a magnetic field around your heart it's tipped at like a 12 degree angle this way it's shaped like a tourist like a doughnut and they know which direction the fields move on it and everything so it's the most electrically active part of your bodies or higher and get this when a human walks into a stall with a horse before they touch the horse the horses heart rate variability will change to match the humans we have a field effect on the people around us and it's an electromagnetic field that's heart based and like we can measure it people get pissed off when they hear this and then they just think everything I say is crap it's not like hey I know the scientists are behind this and B I'm a certified a heart math executive coach like I use this to take people who are super high performers who are tweaking because of their stress and to teach them to consciously basically use their prefrontal cortex they're human most evolved part of the brain to to train and take control of the reptilian brain and when you do that there's measurable changes in the spacing of your heartbeats and there's a change in the field or on your heart as well when you do that that's what you're that's what you're feeling there someone's pissed off of you they could not say a word and you might not even see their face when you just have a feeling yeah yeah we also know bodies letting you know some shit might be going down cats yeah that smells and in fact one of my buddies is a special forces guy and he actually wasn't technically trained special force guys he was a long-range patrol officer guy and he told me one day he said Dave what we learned out in the field he said if you're in someone's sights you can feel it he said someone's got a gun pointing at you like your body heats up like literally how the heck it could this be possible but the bottom line is we have all sorts of weird senses we also know if we hook you up Joe to like weird galvanic skin response sensors and then you're sitting there if someone's staring at you we'll be able to measure your body responding to the stare even if they're staring on your back like there's all kinds of crazy stuff in our bodies we haven't even really explored yet do you think those are evolving senses or do you think those are just like really sort of intangible senses that we haven't quite defined they're not evolving senses their old senses those were there long before I'm dead you know what makes the the frog move before the eagle jumped before the eagle dives for it right it's those kind of senses it's a very very low-level survival oriented senses you sure they're not evolving they're not getting better maybe I think what's happening is that our ability to access them from our prefrontal cortex is evolving and that's one of things I spend a lot of my own time on I spent twenty thousand dollars and seven days hooked up to an EEG machine to learn how to do like advances and meditation that takes 40 years I did in seven days and what you're really doing there is you're just learning how to have the prefrontal cortex your human brain talk to the low-level systems and when you do that like you can unleash creativity and intelligence and intuition in ways that you know most people aren't that familiar with what do you think is going on when you see people that are kids usually that are autistic but that are super genius in one area like there was one kid that was making he was composing like a symphony every nine days or something yeah I like that and they were really good it was really good music and then as a kid who can look out a window and out of an airplane and draw the entire skyline as he sees it perfectly like do you think that that's evolving possibilities in the brain that are just starting to sort of pop up I don't you don't and I say that I had all the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome till I was in my mid-20s like obsessive-compulsive disorder oppositional defiant disorder I didn't know anyone's name like I wouldn't make eye contact all that kind of stuff I stuttered a little bit and I've done a lot of work with the autism community in fact one of my goals in this book that I'm writing the better baby book that comes out in January is to have less kids with autism because you can handle neurological inflammation even in the womb so there's less likelihood of it happening later what we can do though is we can take a fully functioning neurologically functioning adult and we can hit them with really strong magnets in their head and we can turn on autistic skills and non-autistic people so you can suddenly draw the most amazing thing ever when you have a 10-ton magnet focused on your head whoa oh yeah so this is some serious brain action so it's like that fucking dude from the X button that magneto dude it is him a goddamn genius yeah with that magnet helmet on remember yeah and they're doing this like in in neuroscience laboratories right now like they have this really focused thing that that shines a magnet and it activates a specific part of your brain you could even do it to some extent with the stuff I have in my backpack like the cerebral electrical stimulation or the tDCS you can run a current through part your brain and on it wasn't turned on before and as long as there's electricity there it's turned on so I think what's going on here is the wiring and autistic kids they have chronic neurological inflammation that's environmentally mediated and these you have problems with the biology and their gut - so what we can do those we can learn okay these autistic kids have these skills all of us have these skills - they're just not trained and they're not turned on if you use technology you can train your brain did you crazy stuff in very short periods of time so you can gain these kind of powers without having to give up the ability to socialize for instance but a kid looking out a window and and being able to capture the exact skyline and then put that to paper as he you know I don't know things a classically trained artist I think he just does it that is a really special skill a special skill but I'll bet you that if we took six months and we used those magnets and things like that we can we can explore how his brain works and teach your brain to do the same thing there's a lot of things out there that are way teachable that you wouldn't think are it's all just about an interfacing with the brain the way we do it now is really inefficient if I have a gigantic magnet on my head low I play better pool I think it depends on how much the magnet weighs probably well I mean as far as like the frequent eat something it's not something you'd wear it's not something you wear I mean when I say 10 tons I mean like this is a 10 ton thing that that changes it and there's various like articles from neuroscientist they went in they did the test and they drew like the most amazing artwork or in the military they do other things like that with more with the electricity but they'll say oh look this person got a stimulation here and they went through the shooting simulation and they killed everyone completely whereas the last time they had no skills at all really oh yeah so like your brain is like such an amazing toy you can completely change it but here's the thing you want you want to maximize this performance you need to myelinate the nerves in your brain myelination makes a nerve Kari electoral signals 3,000 times faster than an online later nerve so first you have to form the synapse which is called synaptogenesis and you do that through relatively short amounts of practice you know the first time you learned addition well the first time is going to balance on your bike right like you you've learned how to do it it doesn't take long from then on though to get so it's just automatic that's what repetition does and you've had a lot of pro sports guys in here they talk about ten thousand times repetitions the reason 10,000 times works is because your myelinating but here's the thing what's milan made out of fat cholesterol choline so what you need to do is you need to be cranking up on those kinds of foods and if you're gonna be on a low-fat or a vegan diet that doesn't have any of the saturated fats and his loan choline you're probably gonna have a harder time myelinating it's gonna be harder for your brain to do what it was meant to do so synaptically speaking it's harder to learn things yep if you don't have enough fat you got out fat for your brain to function I mean your brain's made out of fat that's but you don't want the wrong fat you don't want fat from a stupid cow that I eat corn no you down they're all stupid yeah and you don't want fat that's been impregnated with toxins so you've got to have grass-fed meat you got to have it from some sort of a reputable source where you know that they're not feeding there any antibiotics as you put the magnets on the cows job magnet fed beef it's no sorry the cow start walking up to the fence going I think we can get through just knock one of these fucking things over helmet with the horns on cow started figuring out they could just fuck us up the corn just grows there just let it grow it'll grow by itself I found that video if you wanted to watch the nuclear explosion yes yeah this is this is crazy nice this is by the way just America there's one of the world oh this is the whole world oh here goes yeah that would be like Nagasaki or Hiroshima yeah this is so creepy we're so nuts one here has a crazy statistic that we figured out on the podcast yeah I'm from the invention of the airplane to someone using it to drop a nuclear bomb on someone took less than 50 years that's pretty impressive it's the same think about that as like a world-changing yeah it makes Moore's law look kind of sissy that's pretty amazing you know 50 years later they're dropping nuclear bombs out of them Russia starts jacking some off air boom Sun there we go it starts just getting crazier and crazier after this right now we're up to eight from America one from Russia how long is this video cuz for the folks at home eight minutes of explosions but a lot of them are in there's a lot of Soviet yeah there we go look at those ones in Nevada it just goes crazy Nevada just lights up like a Christmas tree they're all in Nevada look look at all Nevada Britain how dare you sons of bitches in the ocean yeah you cowards dropping them in the ocean look at Nevada oh my god so scary they're all Nevada that explains Nevada doesn't it fuck yeah it does Las Vegas right it explains the reason why it's allowed to exist yeah I mean they do nuclear tests it explains the airport they also bury they bury a lot of nuclear waste out there and yes look at Russia it's still going scary shit man oh my god more Nevada look at that and it's only 1955 look at how many of them are going off in Nevada that is fucking bananas and you can learn that more compare that's like the recent nuclear reactor leak in Japan yeah I don't know this might be worse I don't know I think I don't know which one more and I think 30 brutal but they also have shit buried out there too they're storing nuclear waste out there yeah spent nuclear rods and all kinds of other shit that they think will be toxic to the end of time yeah we're just so ridiculous it's just so weird that we would have something like that just fucking start leave this Wow it kind of sounds like music look how many bombs have gone off 300 bombs and we're still in the 1960 like we haven't even gone into the modern times it's so 1959 and there's been 300 bombs wow this is really hard to watch but no kidding a total downer they were so stupid back you have any Justin Bieber videos we could watch us dead yeah I think you should show that Brad what are you concerned about like the the toxic shit that's gonna happen from Fukushima is that gonna affect people that live here on the west coast yeah it is I mean the the plume so to speak is making its way over here now you know what does that mean we're actually finding a huge amounts of wreckage that are hitting the shore now in fact up where I live in British Columbia like it it's a big thing and they're finding like motorcycles yeah and like hundred ton like cement docks that's or walk wash up and like how do I get rid of this like it's indestructible oh my god a cement fucking dock that was taken from Japan yeah it broke free and it floated all the way over here and and it's like on the beach what's amazing is that's a little baby tsunami that ain't shit compared to what could happen oh yeah so so that's happening but they say that the stuff that's radioactive hasn't reached there yet so oh god they're starting to they're starting to have Geiger counters on the beach like for the drunk cleanup crews to see if they're finding this stuff so the question is what's it gonna do to fish out here I sure hope that my sockeye salmon is radioactive free and that said you know I I think taking some iodine yeah is a good idea I do what is how is potassium iodine protect you well if the form of radioactivity that you're getting is radioactive iodine it protects you from getting fibroid cancer years later the problem is that some of the radioactive stuff coming out Fukushima may not be in an iodide form so iodine may not do much for you there's some evidence that astaxanthin which comes from krill is pretty protective as well so that's probably a good thing too so krill like krill oil so you take a hat for him I prefer krill oil to fish oil I take krill oil and I put and since I put I buy a form that has asked as Anthon in it which naturally occurs in the krill it's the stuff that makes krill red it's just a really potent antioxidant that has a good effect on radioactive stuff this is a podcast that is gonna test your writing shit down abilities ladies and gentleman this is a podcast we're gonna have to go back I use young salt by the way yak salts a lot bet it'll make yak salt you liar you're a fucking pillar how dare you yeah I gotta get some I'm gonna go right to full Whole Foods right from here and get some fucking Siberian salt yeah or Tibetan salt either ones good it tastes pretty good like I like taking friends who are not into health and you're like just try the salt and like why do you carry white viola powder over international borders with you yeah do you ever get tweaked on never it's weird I mean I have like my upgraded whey protein and collagen powder and and like all kinds of stuff that I mean I should look like I'm carrying kilos of random stuff but no one ever asked you to chest it or they never actually one time I've had my whey protein tested more often they check my coffee because I don't drink Hotel coffee it makes me feel crappy I just really my coffee so I bring it with me just like you know beans or ground-up coffee every time that well what's that and then they open it and they seems like they just want to smell it maybe I don't know well it is that also the people hot drugs in college because it does yeah it stops the dogs from smelling the marijuana you know it's funny I have a little I heard yeah so so we've heard I have a little canister I put in there that that's got a DES again that like absorbs moisture so I mean it looks like I've got a little canister of drugs inside my coffee and twice I've had people say what's in there and like it keeps the coffee dry and they just don't stop me and I fly like a hundred times a year like very often Wow I drink a treinta of coffee every single day and then I eat my first meal about eight o'clock at night all right now does this seem like I should put butter in my coffee now is that what you would recommend try it I seriously would if you're eating nothing else yeah yeah I would try just some fat no sugar no protein but when you do it even just a tablespoon you may find that you have a lot more energy throughout the day and splendas okay like artificial sugar or just stay away from it just do stevia if you're gonna do any things do ya you can do sila tall to a little bit of xylitol won't raise your insulin enough to matter but if you do a lot of salad tall and you're not used to it you'll get the runs like you'll tape made the bulletproof coffee with stevia and it was fuckin delicious really I was addicted to it it's really good but the problem is you're a lazy bitch and you're not gonna let's be honest yeah you're not gonna fucking get some breast fed butter and melted and blended you don't have to melt it and just like sauce the butter in the blender pour the hot coffee right in there and hit blend for 2030 to slave I might do that need to get one of you I'll get butter get Yuliya butter yeah you get since your coconut oil to you know you know you could get groceries now just delivered to your house it's amazing and it's not that much money like you just go online and pick out what you want and then and it's just like alright we'll see you in an hour like a pizza dough he's pretty sweet yeah wow that's amazing I didn't know that yeah and puts butter keeps forever you can buy like 20 sticks of it and toss it in the freezer and you'll have butter coming out of your eyes like so you want to make sure when you go to like organically raised beef is not good enough it has to be grass-fed organically raised you can take organic corn organic soy and organic Twinkies and feed them to an organic cow and still sells organic meat like the standards are very lucky Twinkies can be organic if they make one you can feed it to an organic count is still organic there's no standards for what the cows eat it's just whether or not what they ate was sprayed oh I say okay um so for a lot of folks it's kind of difficult to find grass-fed meat in your area isn't it like a lot of additional supermarkets it is if you're you know in the middle of nowhere but here's the thing like FedEx and UPS deliver everywhere it's cheaper to buy grass-fed meat online that it is to buy like a decent cut of meat in your grocery store like if you're gonna buy grass-fed hamburger from some of the best places on earth like I've like tested different places on my site like I've whole series about grass-fed beef mm-hmm you can get it for five bucks a pound like for grass-fed perfectly treated animals Wow that's fucking really good yeah so like even if you're on a budget like okay eat a lot of eggs because they're cheap and you know supplement with grass-fed beef you eat a half a pound a day it's gonna cost you two dollars and fifty cents do you ever buy just fat do you say like send me some fat I've bought beef tallow the problem is what's called yeah beefed I was just rendered beef fat the problem is that the rendering process is really finicky +15 finicky well if you're gonna render fat you need to have enough water in it in order to render it so it doesn't oxidize one of the problems especially in the paleo community and drives me nuts if you like bacon like okay I love my bacon I'm a bacon snob like I make my own bacon but what you've got to do though is not overcook the oils if you if it's spitting all over the place and there's smoke coming off the pan and your Bacon's all crispy you've oxidized the fat and one of the things on the bulletproof diet I'm really focused on is like how do I get inflammation down so if you fry the crap out of your food then what you're getting is inflammatory oils even if they came from a good cow you're also getting delicious bacon that's a problem you're getting delicious bacon but here's the thing you put your stove on like three or four and you cook the bacon for longer all the fat melts out of the bacon the bacon doesn't not gonna get all super crispy but it's a chewy your bacon right it's a little chewier but it's not like like as if you like uncooked bacon still awesome I like chewy bacon yeah but I do like that fucked up crispy bacon you know totally and like it's like we're like fried mozzarella too but like any god I like to use where you go on the spectrum what is it about fried things it's so horrible for you what does it is about it's mostly the damaged fats they come in your bodies like what do I do with its fat I can't process it because it's overcooked yeah it's like how do i how do i detoxify this so it's basically spitting out free radicals and then you try and build cell walls and hormones out of this fat and your body's like how do I do that I don't have the raw ingredients why is it so fucking delicious that I would love to know I think what happens there for real right like Kentucky Fried Chicken god damn well that shit's good that's msg and gluten and so whatever it is I like it yeah there's really msg and gluten oh yeah God is cheesin like everything yeah what it's goddamn wonderful yeah don't change the thing Kentucky Fried Chicken we don't even talk about msg you know after that yeah but let's talk about how to think about food in general whether it's a vegan or not cuz please explain though what about it what it does okay like so when your body takes in like just like Kentucky Fried Chicken right yeah I think that's something with hydrogenated fried oil fried french fries and chips so we don't make healthy cell walls hormones or anything else in our body made out of fat we don't even burn hydrogenated fat very well for for fuel so basically the liver has to detoxify it so it goes to the liver it livers like God what I do this stuff so it starts using up the glutathione in your liver which is the main detoxing enzyme it starts trying to figure out how to break down these oils like we're designed to take basically a raw animal in and process it and to break all those fats down and to reassemble them into our body we're not we're not meant to take those things in so what you get is actually a big rush of white blood cells when you eat like heavily cooked meat and the oxidized fried fats and it actually it looks like an immune response and your body's like okay I got to do something about this so it does what it can to build healthy cell walls but you get hungry after you eat fried food if you ever notice that like you feel full for a while and afterwards like I want like sugar or something mm-hmm the the craving that you want for sugar there either comes from the MSG or it comes from your livers like could I have some more fuel to use to oxidize this stuff so I can excrete it now instead of building it in wow I never noticed that I usually feel like it's such a fat loser oh yes you don't get like hungry like your next meal you're like I don't like it my savings okay myself just just be on some more child fried chicken yeah but I do like it like you know when I like it I like it like cold with hot sauce I'm watching stupid something stupid on TV it's a good snack Kentucky Fried Chicken you know the stuff tastes good I don't eat that stuff anymore I'm a delicate flower I guess because I weighed 300 pounds like I just feel like crap I eat it now yeah I feel like crap on 82 but I don't feel like crap while I'm eating it that's the problem that's a fair well I mean it I'm loving it I'm loving the crispy outside mmm mixed with the hot sauce so if they had Kentucky fried kale would you try that Mykel all the time I mean I well I eat kale chips I'm like a lot of kale chips a Bonita knows lately for snacks but I don't know what they're making the cheese out of you know because it's some weird vegan it's usually it's usually nutritional yeast which is I don't want to talk about what that does to you how they add yeah it's bad god damn it's so fucking kill chips are bad nosey kale chips don't have to be bad it's just what they used to make them cheesy don't leave motherfucker so cheesy kale chips are bad if they're using vinegar to make the cheesy flavor they're fine but most time they use nutritional yeast and they see it I could I have sown any studies that's solely cases how come I knew they tasted too fucking good yeah I knew it while these cheesy kale chips are wonderful do you think they're so addictive of your heart really you fucking god damn it vegan people how dare you how dare you get me to eat your shit that's bad for you but yet delicious there's gonna be a huge storm on Twitter about people saying nutritional yeast has B vitamins and I'm like yeah and look at the if just go to PubMed and Google cancer and nutritional yeast and see what you find so the cheese is not a cheese's it's actually a clump of organisms that's what the yeast is yep it's like it's like bakers and brewers yeast yeah Wow and then how they make it like a cheese it's just you actually kind of has a cheesy flavor on its own so they take that and they mix it with some other usually like a nut like a ricotta like a like a vegan ricotta thing I mean I've been like a I still eat a lot of like vegan dishes just under the weird soy and crab really if it's made out of raw vegetables chopped up finely with enough good fat in them like avocados that's some of the healthier food out there mm-hmm right so I'm a pretty good in the kitchen like with raw food and the problem is you add a nutritional yeast to it it makes it inflammatory it's just not very good for you just so that's just those kale chips yeah the regular kale chips yeah there aren't quite as goddamn delicious I'm sorry Joe mother fuckers I knew I knew it couldn't possibly be fine if you die from cheesy kale chips you're he's not concentrating on dying right yeah thank you maximizing your potentially that's why I think this is so here's the spectrum like okay if you eat cheesy kale chips every day for the rest your life compared to potato chips you fucking rocked it okay that's why everything on the bulletproof diet is a spectrum it's like this is better than this but like this is a lot better than this so you don't have to be perfect if you you know if you want to identify a goalpost for perfection just kind of move in that direction you'll be way better off and most people fail in their diets because they feel like oh I did it wrong now I lose I'm like get into it wrong you could have done a lot worse you could have done it better but like you're somewhere in the middle and the truth of the matter is I'm always in the middle to like okay at a grass-fed cow but you know was it slaughtered by you know an ordained minister if I know but like like there's probably some way of making it slightly more perfect it wasn't massage every day I I wouldn't want a minister to kill my cow I don't know if I mic out dummy I actually tend to discount tinder girthy like my cow blessed by yeah I'm sure you've blessed before but there has to be like some bizarre thing you could do that's better like then again if someone really believed in the blessing maybe they had impart some sort of an energy into the thing that sounds ridiculous but what we're talking about before about people literally having some sort of an environmental effect some sort of an effect on all the people around them how do these look you don't want some asshole killing your cow I'll tell you flat-out I do not want a cow that was tortured before I was killed it changes the hormones it I think it changes the taste and there's an energy thing there I mean call me a a psycho hippie or whatever but I've done a lot of intuitive like training of my my my heart and of other parts of my body with electronics and like I don't know there's something not right about like you know some sadistic asshole you know torturing your cow killing it and then feeding it to you like rot its face it's wrong well it is and have you ever seen the way they do kosher cow's spirit old machines it's crazy well it's supposed to be done by a rabbi it's supposed to be done by a rabbi rabbi supposed to slice the neck of the cow but you're you're supposed to do it that way that's how you kill the cow you slice its neck it takes a while for him to die and it's not fucking pretty there's videos of them trying to get up and falling down trying to get up and you should see the kosher machines they do have kosher machines yeah as long as it's as long as as long as it's been blessed like it's approved for kosher but it's even worse because it's like like the cows go in and they just like rip their throat out with a rod and it's it's one of the things where people think that oh you know Dave's the opposite of a vegan I'm like no I care a lot about the quality of the animals I eat and the quality of the food I eat but I also care about the quality of my life and wanted to do with it and if I'm slowing myself down by eating inappropriate foods there's also another thing we got to talk about talk about animal suffering I'm in Tibet all right I spent like a couple months actually three months walking on edge of visiting monasteries and stuff and I went to this monastery I had the vegan vegetarian diet for mush was vegan for like 10 days I'm farting like a machine the whole time and then afterwards I go to another monster in Lhasa and there's this giant yak skin on the prayer pole in the middle of the monastery and so I asked the head Lama guy and I said okay like you're a hypocrite I'm like you say no killing and you've got a dead animal lying on your prayer pole like what's the deal and he just looked at me neat you know the way like Buddhist monks kind of dude laughed and he said oh one death feeds everyone and then he walked away like that was this whole thing and I thought about that if I eat two pounds of grass-fed beef every day for a year I kill 0.7 animals in the entire food chain if I'm vegan and I eat soy nuggets every bowl of soy nuggets is killing hundreds of animals because the tractor goes through and cuts down the soy the soy not even talked about what it did to the soil microbes but it cuts down all the soy it chops up the bunnies and their cute little faces and the turtles and the grasshoppers and the worms and all the other stuff there and basically you look at the number of animals killed to bring you a bowl of grain it's way in excess of what grass-fed beef does the vegan argument is well there is enough grass-fed beef for everyone I'm like yeah that's cuz people don't ask for it you asked for it will turn the golf courses into basically grass-fed beef manufacturing plants there's plenty of them out there to do that by the way like there's people have done the math but it would be a bit it would be a smaller cow you wouldn't have nearly as much fat and the taste is different its taste is different mrs. Rogan doesn't like the grass-fed beef I try to cook the grass-fed oh man can we just say this podcast is grass-fed now by how many struggles the grass-fed is in it just matters it's stamped I would need a bowl of gravel if I could perform well on it like I have no Dogma about this like I don't I don't care like food for me is like optimal fuel for a human potential that's it not just delicious is what I mean I love the deliciousness I have a cookbook out for God's sake oh do you yes let's go the upgraded chef it's like how do you cook stuff fast to produce the least toxin so you perform better on it this is this is so far it was this a long journey for you dude yeah for 15 years I mean I spent a quarter million dollars upgrading myself and I started like tracking how I felt and how I was performing was a gaining weight or losing weight and did my joints hurt and all this stuff and I came to this conclusion that you can't change just one variable and expect something to work you got to change a lot of variables at once and then start adding things back in because let's say you're allergic to just like milk and wheat which so many people are oh this week I'll eat no wheat nothing changed this week I'll eat no dairy nothing changed so you assume nothing happened the problem is there's many things that cause inflammation at its core the bulletproof diet is about reducing inflammation and here's the secret when you look at a food there's three ways of looking at it the first one you does it have the right macronutrients it's like if I need to eat some protein or I need to eat some some fat yeah is it in there but here's the funny thing people don't think about so much you know if we said you look you need to get 200 grams of protein today we generally say yeah that's good but wait a minute okay this little vial of protein is the active protein that's in black widow spider venom and this is an egg okay how many grams of protein you want to eat today okay the bottom line is different proteins do different things to your body so you've got to pick the right protein in there and then the fats do you want hydrogenated vegetable oil or do you want coconut oil they're totally different on what they do in your body so first you got to get those sorted out and then second way you look at your food is something called anti nutrients and this is something that most modern nutritionists just don't pay attention to paleo people know about some but not others and what's going on there is food has a defense mechanism built in if you're a grain your job is to reproduce and that means you coat yourself in pesticide to keep the bugs from eating you so you can reproduce its natural pesticide is called phytic acid and it inhibits whatever eats you and inhibits their ability to absorb minerals from their food so now what would I do when I look at food does it have the right macronutrients does it have poison in it if so then I don't want to eat it and finally does it have a lot of other stuff like B vitamins and minerals and the other micronutrients you guys like this Andy guy the aggregate nutrient index guy at Whole Foods Fuhrman who by the way think scales you know basically next to God he puts liver like a a very low number on there yet liver has a lot more nutrients in it than kale does the problem is he decided to divide by calories for reasons that I don't quite understand what's going on there is a focus on micronutrients ignoring anti nutrients and ignoring the function of food as fuel and they're also doing that because they have a pro animal sort of an agenda oh yeah there's definitely agenda behind that there's a lot of be like I've had conversations with people who are vegans and they'll tell you that it's only for health purposes and then I bring up fish oil and most of them they don't take fish oil yeah and I say well why if it's just for health reasons fish oil has been shown to be very very beneficial but it gets squirrely they started talking about eating flax seeds and shit you know if you're gonna eat flax seeds flax seed oil oxidizes the second it sees air like it's incredibly stable even in Ayurvedic medicine they tell you flex seed oils a drying oil and your body can convert that to the healthy omega-3s at a ratio of 40 to 1 you need 40 grams of flax oil you get one gram of the good stuff and you got to dispose of the other 39 grams that cause inflammation in the body whoa yeah that's why I don't reckon flexo us between fish oil it actually counteracts that and bites inflammation rays why it's so great for grapplers oh it's huge yeah yeah guys are always a lot of guys who are into CrossFit as well and heavy doses of fish oil yes an anti-inflammatory right it's good stuff but I tell you if you use krill it's gonna work better because krill has the same epa and DHA but it's phosphorylated it's bound to phospholipids which means your brain can use it directly fish oil has got to be phosphorylated means you need to get extra phosphatidyl serine or choline to do that in your diet so you have to take choline supplements if you take fish oil to get the optimum maybe just eat eggs okay except choline yeah because here's the thing some of the like super strong calling supplements like if there's no question they have a really beneficial effect in like most people in some people too much Colleen has like a reverse effect and it's probably like maybe a third of people so it this is one of those things where if you get it in your food you're good and if the calling supplements make you feel really good which they do for the vast majority people like I I'm a fan of choline supplements in general I recommend them on the blog like you've got that ingredient in alpha in alpha brain and like by the way that's just a killer list of nootropic ingredients I fully a fully approved that like gospel of proof level supplement for sure awesome thank you and the thing is though if you're one of those coing sensitive people you might not want a ton of choline like you want to limit yourself to a certain amount yeah we've had issues with that with people getting really sensitive they get like anxious and headaches yeah yeah and those are the people who are calling dominant but here's the kicker you get those people to take aniracetam like the stuff I've got on my site and our asset am use up extra choline so that's an interesting way of using a smart drug and this is actually a drug not it not a natural substance but it's one that I'll bring your coloring levels down which means you can benefit from the other stuff that's in alpha brain but you also get this boost from the other type of nootropic how many different things do you take a day I take probably on an average day about 40 pills see I told you I'm not crazy I know here's there's a crazy number when I was really focused on like like getting my health all the way where I wanted it before I was all the way where am i did 187 pills a day for several months now what about the actual capsule itself what are those made out gelatin is that no big deal for you out of the process you actually need gelatin our diets are gelatin deficient right now oh really yeah and you know we eat all the muscles in animal but in the old days your mom would boil the chicken and eat all the cartilage and all that yeah so I actually carry gelatin and collagen on the site because when people eat that stuff their joints get healthier and there's another thing this whole electrical part of the bodies is not well known but you know those acupuncture meridian points and things like that mm-hmm well electricity flows through your skin not just in your nerves and you need collagen in your skin in order to bring the water into the skin so you can carry electricity efficiently so when you eat enough collagen in the form of gelatin knocks blocks whatever I have grass fed gelatin that I use whoa but you do that you actually you function better on many levels including on the inflammation level a lot of fighters are starting to take jello oh yeah I noticed it in they did this like sort of cribs thing with Minotauro Nogueira just fought recently and yeah FC this past weekend and they went to tossing a stack of jell-o he said he had this is make me feel good you know I mean it works even for sleep sometimes it helps hello I did not know the problem is like I mean industrial jello is disgusting like give me want to know what's in there what is in there like they're taking hoes and like snouts and like all these like office it's like the Bologna of protein powder like it's not good well I mean it it's better than no collagen like what's most what's the best made no the best is made out of the skin of the animal the skin yeah so like that's the sort of stuff that that I use typically in fact like next week I'll have I'll have a listing for the the best kind of it I've been exploring collagen for years so you can take straight collagen you could take straight gelatin and it's just a question of basically how you want it to taste and how you want it to be absorbed in your food but the old days we would make like soup from bones it's too much work what you do now is you take a couple scoops of collagen powder and you just put it in your smoothie or put it in your soup and you've got all the benefits of bone broth with none of the trouble it's just it's 200 work to make all that broth no it's just a process they just take the the leather they take the outside and turn it into take the outside and they expose it to enzymes and breaks antacid yeah and that breaks it down and it's kind of a useful food it's one of those things that that we used to like fight for a hundred years ago because you had to get enough of it and it was one of the ways of using an all-animal and now we just toss it in mostly so in your opinion and with with all those things that you've researched what you found is that you can't even just not even like eggs is not good enough fish is not good enough like you need animals you need mammals you need you need cows and shit at least some of the time I absolutely believe that I also believe let's face it you kill a chicken did one meal to kill that animal and chickens have the worst lives ever unless they're like super pastured crazy expensive chickens so like you wanna see a tortured animal modern chickens can't even stand up on their own because their breasts are so big like like they're one of the most weak species yeah they're pretty tweaked it's pretty fucked up and you see one of those gigantic chicken farms and they're all just stacked on top of each other and it just scrapping on each other and also so I see these I could never eat red meat I'm like dude one animal will feed two people basically for two years yeah if they're eating normal amounts of it that's less death yeah that's but it's a big death it's like nobody has a problem with killing ants people are not like making a protest in front of stores that sell raid and killing they don't give a fuck about the ants cuz they're sooo small it's like we have like a thing you could take an ant like you find any on your counter could do with your finger and yeah that you just flick it on the ground like you went away you can't do that to a rat you can't hit a rat with a hammer and then just throw it on the floor now you got to clean that thing up you can deal with the snail remember when it made that snail video and everyone got pissed off at me yeah you can't kill snail kid snails big enough but he stomped on an ant no one would've given a shit but you killed a snail no like this son of a bitch I put a snail on a Listerine stripping solarizing the thing about the thing about cows is good by the way he's almost 40 the the thing about cows though is that they're big and like you know an ants tiny and it doesn't really bug it so you can buy poison for ants anywhere as you can sell cow poison at the store people would freak out because you can't just kill cows like that they you know that you can't buy rat poison yeah the cunts but then these people have rats for pets like man and there's a lot of people that actually lived off rats and what was it I forget Peru I believe where no yeah guinea pigs I like super Colin I've you think anything was it like in in Peru yeah I went down there to do ayahuasca with the shaman and oh and they have guinea pig food yeah it's native there yeah they are let me see the technical term for it fucking disgusting there's like no meat on him and they stuff them with rice and vegetables it don't taste good there's like five bites of meat on a whole guinea pig and it doesn't taste very good the bites you can get and the rest was just like bones and skin like it was the little soundly gross those people are just trying to get by yeah that's some tough times they what I saw was this Anthony Bourdain show and they went over this guy's house and they had guinea pigs running around the kitchen like constantly right they were everywhere they just pick one up take them over snap kill them got them and start cooking them and all these other dumb fucks are just running around they're like their pets practically until they get killed but they have a constant you say it's awful but they have a constant supply of meat yeah and your point of view from Burbank you know is very different than their point of view living in Peru or there are two adorable that yeah these houses don't even have windows dude I used to have them as pets they are kind of cute but if I was hungry I do you want you have children and your children are hungry you're gonna eat the fuck out of some guinea pigs and they're everywhere dude they have like 30 of have you had cat not on purpose but I've been to a lot of taco trucks so I'm not sure whoa do you think taco trucks really sorry yeah really depends on where you are in I have a theory tell me if this theory makes any sense at all but I have a theory that things that are difficult to catch or good for you like wild fish wild game things that run quick like deer deer very good for you because they run fast to try to get the fuck away because they know they're delicious they know they're like highly sought after and then things like cows it just kind of stand around probably not as good does anything to that theory I don't buy it by either here's why humming dirty larvae the things that can run really fast and sprint don't have enough fat on them like when the Indians would kill a buffalo like the first thing you eat is like the big fatty hump on the back and that's like that's a solid fat is that like for storing food for the episode in fact if you take a real grass-fed Buffalo that fat is orange it's actually like almost like a salmon color and most of the Buffalo you can buy they finish on Grand cuz no one wants to buy orange fat I'm like man give me a big old like two-pound hunk of orange fat like that most of it finishes on grain or all of it can you turn it that finishes on I've asked a few like butchers that really high-end markets about that and they're like yeah we one of the guys said and we tried it one time on orange we got to throw it out no one will buy it that's so weird you probably don line just to get it like hundreds in CrossFit I need to get that I need to get that just a fun and what it would taste like it's pretty delicious when you get like real fat in fact Bisons good even if you take like just the fats and good quality butter versus you know it's crap butter I've had like vegetarian friends I'm like come on over let me make one of my soups for you and it's you know butter and I use the MCT oil in fact next week I've got my bulletproof MCT oil like like on the shelves I'm super stoked on that what is it it's a six times stronger extract of coconut oil so it's two of the medium change the ones that are most responsible for losing weight and for cognitive function and where that's all that's in there and has no flavor so you can like make mayonnaise out of it how does that created they take coconut oil and processes and centrifuge yeah so we spin it and then we pull out just those ones and I have the only brand I've don't work how does that send a future work so it's basically you just spin it really fast anyway they do like your blood tubes to separate out the plasma and yeah and those cells when you spin it the different weights of fat line up so we pull out the two most precious ones right in the middle band there and then we take the rest of it and we give that to other people yeah that's ridiculous and this is coming out right now it's like it should be on the side right now you order it I just put it out the bulletproof or bulletproof exactly it's below proof exact com bulletproof lexan calm and you have your whole story is up there of how you if so for poked folks that don't have the patience to go and listen to this podcast again there's a fuckload of information on this site as well as not just the upgraded mct oil you've got upgraded coffee everything's upgraded yogurt chef and here's what it means when it's upgraded like I'm looking at the whole process of making something and how do you make that process as good as it can be like my background I really am a computer hacker like I have studied computer science I work in computer security I'm not an actively a hacker like I'm an executive but like I understand the mindset of changing a system to get the outcome you want right it turns out like to make the coffee the problem was actually how the beans get turned into green coffee that's where most of the problems happen so I went through I learned all about all the stuff from multiple disciplines pulled it all together and said what if I created this new process for making coffee that didn't have the toxins in it and you look at that like we're about done with a study where we're getting advice from Stanford University on the cognitive function of this coffee so we're comparing normal coffee versus this upgraded coffee to show what it does to your response time and your attention and like we don't have enough results to be statistically significant yet we're still recruiting people the results I have say yeah it works so it's like this is real stuff and every step of the way when you create a food tells you how the food is gonna make you perform and what I'm trying to do is help people understand like if for one day they can just have the best day ever we're like their energy and their focus and everything is super clear and they just like feel like a great golden god if you do that one time you know you're capable of it and you can start working towards that but most people I know have felt like crap without knowing it most of their life they've never had a wonderful day once you have that day you can learn how to kick more ass repeatedly so it's like get all the crap out that I just do it right for a week and just see what can happen you look at the comments on my blog like people they do this it takes like six weeks it's not that hard to do and all the sudden like you know you have twice the energy I had before like that's what I'm looking to do for people and when you have twice the energy you get twice the shit done I tell you I'm inst I'm a full-time executive I wrote this book Wiley's my publisher Gary Taubes introduced me to my agent in New York like it's a Tier one book with 1300 references I started the bulletproof executive blog which is in the top 25 thousand blogs now 150,000 people a month see it and I'm a dad I have two young kids and I see them on a very regular basis like for me to be able to do all the stuff I could have never done this in my mid-20s it's because I trained my brain because I got my mitochondria functioning and I got my hormones functioning you looked at the body like a computer system absolutely and you were you the first kind of do that you know there's there aren't that many computer guys like I'm 40 and the four oldest computer guys are like 65 right right so certainly we've talked for years about this and there's you know the whole cyberpunk thing which I admit admit I was a part of you know mirrored sunglasses and stuff like that but I'm one of the early guys like a lot of the Russians the Russian space program did a lot of this stuff like this is a device this is called a is an older one but it's the only one you can get that does that does programming where you can pick the frequency but I'll run a current across my brain this is actively the same thing you do to a computer when you do that you can put yourself in the Gamma state that's really hard to get into you just stick the electrodes on your head and that puts you in a gamma state and what's the benefit of that gamma state is actually a state where the Dalai Lama just announced a cash reward for anyone who could help him get into a gamma State in less than four hours because that's how long it takes him he's looking for a neuroscience ways to do it so literally you stick these things on your forehead as a Dali Lama try the isolation tanks I don't know but it wouldn't surprise me he's pretty open with his neuro neuroscience stuff but you hook this thing up you turn it on like that and now it's running yesterday it sounded good it sounds like your it sounds just like a Frankenstein or something what are you doing what I'm doing now running running it is a somatic and grass-fed drink this is what you do is I'm like that is literally like you are changing the waves in your brain like a computer and what is the benefit of that again like when you put that on what does it actively do to you it depends on what setting you put it on if I'm gonna be writing like a lot I'll put it on a gamma state and you're just in this like focused amazing kind of flow state although alpha is also something that's more recognized as a flow state so you can control what state your brain is in you want to get like rapid recovery during sleep if I'm only gonna sleep two hours I put that on and I put it on 1.5 Hertz which is associated with deep sleep and when I wake up I feel really good I didn't get all the benefits of memory consolidation and dreaming do you sell this thing no you can just buy it do you explain it on your website or anywhere yeah I have a top 10 brain hacks video as a talk I gave it South by Southwest on this I would love to try that and so if it's giving a low-level electrical signal yep and what does that do exactly in fact I have a touching the head so it's yeah sending electrical waves just right it's running a slight current back and forth I try they're gonna go sure I got one you got me one a while ago yeah that we were trying to get you to quit smoking yeah it worked no I used it a lot it just it shocked they stick those things on your forehead yeah I'd like clips to your ears right yeah yeah this one used to have your clips but I use the yeah I use the temple things just because they're a little easier and this is actually like a ten year old device the problem is most of the new ones have only one frequency and this one lets you adjust the frequencies which is which is helpful okay I'm putting it on my head and hit the power button on there or just having the controls if you want okay how are you up state postally all right all right that feels weird there's a volume control right here it's dinging my head feels like there's a turn now turn that volume control until it doesn't stain well just it feels like a bee who's like trying to like say he's playing a game with just the tip they're got bees playing just the tip with a stinger he's not quite saying that come on yeah turn it turn it down so it doesn't hurt that's for sure what is it uh no I turned it up okay is that bad that hurts no it's not bad but it'll still work if you just have a little tiny team do you don't want to get really smart if I have to fucking stuff it through a little bit of pain I'm down so if you do this for 15-20 minutes for the next several hours the alpha and the front half of your brain will be up much higher than it was before why doesn't everybody know about this this is ridiculous how it's not how are this could be an app it well I mean you'd have to set the iPhone up to do that but this whole quantified self thing I do like there's a whole bunch of people looking at this stuff how long before the government arrests you for all those you know I didn't create super PD the only thing that I've invented that's that's like new some of the training techniques are different but like I didn't invent cerebral electrical stimulation the Russians did in their space program the reason that this came about is they said it costs a lot of money to send a cosmonaut up into space what if we didn't have if they didn't sleep we could send one third less cosmonauts so they built this well I have a one of those turbo sonic machines I know that you've talked very highly of those things - yeah I mean what those do so somebody told me when I bought it and I forgot but I use it all the time oh yeah awesome those things rock so I'll totally flat out you know if you can afford 12 or 15 grand buy the turbo sonic I've used one for almost a year it's the most programmable and it's the quietest but does the same thing that these other ones do any of the ones that vibrate you up and down only are gonna have the same effect there's a whole bunch of cheap ones that do like a side-to-side rocking that messes up your low back so and also they tend to break I've broken welds on a couple of it's cheap units it's some sort of an Soundwave okay what speaker mechanism it's not really a sound wave with turbo sonic but it is a speaker mechanism you've seen like a woofer like a heavy-duty subwoofer when it goes to noon do you know right what's going on there is they took the sound baffles off but they left the speaker coils so it moves you up using that really efficient way of moving the speaker uses it's very precise the one that I have that cost 10% is much to make it like within reach for the normal person it uses a motor so it's louder but it has exactly the same up-and-down vibration that the turbo sonic would have and there's another brand called power plate out there and they're all based on very similar principles and that's that when you vibrate the body like that you're triggering something called piezo electric signals in the bone so it increases bone density your muscles have to keep tensing and releasing tensing and releasing so you actually can build muscle on those especially if you know you hold a kettlebell you know just hold out like this like all of a sudden 30 times a second you know you're doing this and and I hate to say that this is like the adult version of the shake weight but it's powered and it seriously works in the final thing you get from this has to do with lymphatic circulation in the body so we have this whole wasted waste elimination system called your lymph system and the way the lymph moves is you have to move your body and this is why people say oh you have to move movement is so important for you movement is important because it moves lymph it's not because it burns calories or doesn't burn calories that's a distraction movement doesn't burn calories but yeah burns calories but that doesn't make you lose weight like compared to say a short high-intensity interval will make you lose more weight than going for a walk that burns more calories in the end the high-intensity interval it's a hormonal effect you're getting this is like dr. Doug McDowell Fork so I Macduff's work from body by science like there's definitely like enormous loads of research there about caloric consumption from exercise and diet and they don't line up for weight loss they just in fact yeah I have a really good blog post about that whoa in fact the blog post is called it's not the calories stupid and it was in response to a New York Times piece where they actually wrote it's the calorie stupid even though the study that they'd written about just showed it wasn't the calories like different people ate the same amount of calories and gain different amounts of fat like how did that happen but on the vibration plate you're of course you're burning energy but you're moving all the lymphatic fluids in the body and your micro capillaries are getting stimulated to like parts of you gets shaken that might not normally get circulation so you typically feel like a burst of energy when you're done with it yeah and you tend to slim down like I noticed like especially few have the inflammation going on I'm still because of my health background I still I get inflamed he's I eat the wrong stuff I puff up you do that and it helps you to dump the extra inflammation so it's amazing detox plus exercise plus general stimulation of your body all at once like for 15 minutes a day it's it's a total bargain just in terms of time spent whether it's on a turbo sonic or the bulletproof vibe they they both achieve the same kind of goals but I'll tell you flat-out you've got the Cadillac like or the Mercedes of them the turbo Sonic's the best made anywhere yeah I do 10 minutes of it before I workout yeah I do a 10 minute like shakedown like you really look and it feels good doesn't that feels amazing I love that feeling amazing and then when it really goes what's really going fast for folks who've never tried it before if you if you're anywhere near Venice whoops I lost one of my fuckin Frankenstein no lobes if you're anywhere near Venice the float lab has it crash is the one who sold me mine he's the fucking mad scientist ladies and gentlemen they're giving me an updated tank ladies and gentlemen there's a new tank that crash was created inside he's a mad scientist he's a crazy man but he he runs the float lab the best isolation tents bar none in the world I might get one I'm looking at one how the fuck do you not have one I've been looking at building one but I'm because I moved up to BC a couple years ago and look at it by a ranch so as soon as I get the ranch I'm getting a good tank I don't want to move it into something I should have it right in this crash we'll set it up and do everything for you I should right now especially you how many times have you used but I've used a flow tank once like 10 years I'll dare you sir hooking up these fucking electrodes to your brain you're not even taking advantage of one of the craziest pieces of oh I have machine I love so I love it it's it's a huge thing he only did it once how was it once it's a question of where you live right if there's not a floating area but yeah it it's on my list not for me it wasn't I did it once and I was looking to buy a house and one of the prerequisites for buying the house was having a room for the time yep my the house I'm looking to buy right now same thing it's gotta have space I have to have space for a pool table I have to have space for the tank that's non-negotiable everything else I can lift weights at a gym but I need a tank in the house it's hard to find a tank you know if you don't live near Venice the tank for me is something that anyone who's thinking about improving must have for creativity it is in it's a fascinating tool itself introspective yakking and you know it's just it's amazing it in fact it's one of those technologies and there's a whole bunch of them out there that allows the prefrontal cortex like the human part of your brain that you think of as you to become aware of the that really fast reptilian brain that runs circles around you like you can't even see it happening until you get rid of all the noise right and when you get into that flow tank all the sudden like you do that personal exploration you can you can do amazing things there you can do amazing things and you learn amazing things out about yourself you start making these drastic improvements and the way you look at things in there because it's so self analytical it's so it's so self observational yeah when you're in there you just you're not you don't have anything going on with your body so you're just alone with your thoughts and you have to address them you can't get confused and separated with busy work you just you're you're not gonna within 20 minutes anything that's really fucking with you will come to the surface and have you ever played with neurofeedback what is that this is when you hook electrodes up to your head and you get the signal from your brain oh this is profound stuff it's on par with the flow tank in fact I've had my own EEG since 1998 whoa be like at home because it's that impactful and what you do there is your brain it's unable to see itself like your brain can see the whole world around you but it doesn't have nerves inside itself that's why I like you see brain surgery they can take the top off your head and like poke at your brain and doesn't there's no nerves in there there's nerves on your arm like you cut your arm then what's gonna happen is well there's nerves there and in the arm heals relatively quickly we get these traumatic brain injuries they don't heal very well because the brain doesn't even know it's broken so it's incredibly good at the world an incredibly bad at itself so what you do is you get the signal from the brain you'd play it through an amplifier it turns into music and it plays the music back to you and when you think about something the music gets louder when you think about something else the music gets quieter so you can teach the brain to think in a new way so I've done an extensive neurofeedback training in literally seven days was the equipment of 40 years of daily Zen practice this was really really hardcore intense seven days it was the hardest thing I've ever done it cost me 20 grand and I was hooked up to like an 11 million dollar EEG machine for at least half that time but I mean you want introspection when you look at a when you hear a sound your brain can't help but optimize itself like it tells you when you're doing it wrong you think of like the meditation path that people are on they're like oh I meditate this way oh I did it wrong for five years sorry and then they do it over here and they sort of meander and then you know their teachers tell them try meditating this way well what if there was a computer and it lit up the path so like on either side of the path there's like what you know the sounds get quiet on either side of the path all of a sudden you can do meditative type of things to yourself that would take you years of focus practice you can do it in days and because synaptogenesis this part of the brain that makes new synapses happens within like 20 days you can totally rewire your head in short short amounts of time like unbelievably short so you rewire your head by use of electrical frequencies so you can literally program it to do exactly what you wanted to do right but we're not putting the frequencies into the head all we're doing is reasoning like a mirror because the brain doesn't have any nerves inside itself the brain will on its own figure out oh my god that sound that's me and it'll start doing things to like adjust how it works like for things like a DD people have like been hit on the head these guys they get improved very dramatically but the kind I did is correlated with a 12 IQ point boost that's stable you're later and like 50% more creativity Wow wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what do we have to do how do I get in on this oh well I will I'll hook you up with a guy who does it he runs a private facility how much time a Germany takes seven full days and takes 15 grand plus travel expenses sounds like don't get in Rob this is a behind the 7-eleven today Ali nonsense the guy the guy's an ex he's an ex faculty member from UCSF yeah it's been doing this for 35 years and runs a private facility by the way you're getting robbed this should be available in every street corner and it should be in every school and it should cost about 300 bucks it would transform society the fact that it's 15 grand pisses me off every day which is why I'm not telling you his name right now because we shut his website down anyway but yeah we will crush your website son that sounds like really for seven days though it actually doesn't sound like a ripoff if it turns you in a super genius it sounds like it does it was I mean I'd already done a lot of work on my cell phone but I came out of there and like that voice in your head that thing that gets in your way like it's your bitch when you're done like yeah that's so you can go there and it just completely rewires your brain in seven days it is hard work don't get me wrong you have to do what is the hard work you sit there in a dark room with the speaker on either side your head and eight electrodes glued to your head and then you do whatever you have to do to make the sound louder and make your score go higher and the first three days you just like your brain just doing this thing and then after that you have to dig in on like your most in like it's just like in a flow tank my ultimate fantasy would be that I go there and I'm like super gifted at this and I break the whole bill yeah we're getting we're getting to that point do this I want I want you to do this I think it's all I'll do it with you I've actually been thing about going back really yeah sure wait man can you get the super what if you're like a fucking intellectual vampire and I get dumber and you get smarter what if he hacks you I'd like to remind you you've got my electrodes on your forehead right now it's already been done no I have to build this shit son you gotta need some little stronger for this Fathead what what is this thing I think I saw it on your Twitter about you paying to get hacked what was that all about paying for what maybe hold on nevermind you mean biohacking how much you spent by Ohio the quarter million dollars yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so over the last 15 years I spend a quarter million dollars on everything I can think of that improves human performance I'm like I'm just gonna do it so I'm 20 grand actually I did it a couple times I so 20 grand in 25 grand whatever there I've taken ungodly numbers of supplements and smart drugs I've tried all kinds of electronics like I have like a whole mat biohacker laboratory at home like I've got my my vibrating plate I've got an ozone generator I've got a couple different EEG machine that's an ozone generator in my tank set up the guys crash uses yeah purify the water it's the best way to purify water powerful crash are you are you sponsored by grass to pay for all this section BC bud have you ever looked into eating cannabis as a food yeah I've looked at eating hemp not you mean you have actually cannabis cannabis is when you don't cook it it's not psychoactive oh yeah the psychoactive plant of cannabis if I eat it does not make you high justjust by but it's incredibly healthy no interesting beneficial yeah I've never tried it but it sounds kind of cool it's what's really great to juice as well interesting that's really cool well if it was legal it'd be so easy and cheap to grow that you could literally eat it that way for health smoke it do whatever you want wouldn't be such a the reason why it's such a commodity is because it's illegal so yeah you could throw seeds out the window its famous people have been driving their car they throw joints out the window they drive by six months later the fucking giant bunch of marijuana grow in there I mean it really is a super hardy plant and like the protein in there is really high in IgG it's it's great protein it's a bit high in omega-6 fats if it's all you're gonna eat but certainly eat some of it it's fine but but if you get those protein it's one of in fact I would say it's the best plant source protein that I know of yeah you need a plan it's very digestible - yes my favorite part is it is like it's one of the few things hemp with coconut juice and coconut oil but I use it with C - Oh baby C - Oh coconut juice because it is my favorite if I got it raw Roz Roz awesome rust have to fuck with if you can get raw but it only lasts for like a little while you can't really keep it in the fridge Li can but that hem stuff hemp force protein part of the stuff that I used you could you could take it and go to the gym an hour later it's the only thing that I could do jiu-jitsu an hour later cuz it's so easy about it digest it's just not taxing at all the stuff we use to is the most expensive because it has the highest ratio of protein to like like some of our more coarse yeah the hearts or more coarse they don't have as high a ratio pretty that's what you want to do yeah yeah it's it's really super easily digestible but illegal to grow but not illegal to have or sell Michael Thank You Canada right yeah well thank you the United States for fuckin saying that it's illegal to grow a plant you dunces it's just such you know we had on it we could have had a farm we were thinking about like Vermont we looked into Vermont cuz Vermont passed laws but the federal government has clearly said we will lock you in jail if you try to grow this way out here's here's how to get past all this I just figured it out Oh Monsanto needs to make genetically modified pot and then we'll be legal to go everywhere listen yeah but then they'll probably fuck with a pot of Nazi to turn you into an octopus or something yeah it's gonna do something to you it's gonna ruin you I I hope they don't do that and guess you know when there's listen yeah please Monsanto leave weed alone concentrate on sweet potatoes whatever the fuck you're doing it's this scary ask company now somebody needs to get those people some mushrooms amen get those people some mushrooms and understand the impact of your decisions just to put ones and zeros there's some serious therapeutic value to medicinal mushrooms oh fuck yeah that's John Hopkins University showed you no significant improvements in people's personalities years later how many how many kilobytes is Joe's brain being downloaded like is it like that's like a thirty two megabyte file pretty small right now Brian he's taking he just copied and pasted okay yeah I don't even know what my own memories I'm actually on my iPad here I'm looking at what he's thinking about it I feel dirty oh I'm dirty boy that's you that's a flashback flashback to the past son how dare you how dare you are you doing anything from the electrodes I don't know you know it's hard to say you know thinking bad it can be pretty subtle and just you know to see if you're in the zone for the next few hours after this yeah I think it's it feels cool I like it I like the fact that I think it does something for me but this other thing this fucking seven-day jamming that sounds how many hours a day pretty much most of them like like you when you get there you check in your watch in your cell phone and and you just like do it until you're done you you don't even pay attention to time like it's just like time goes away and all how many people have done this ten thousand ten thousand people have done this and they've all reported more results US Army Special Forces have this guy trained them for seven months straight so it's like a Jason Bourne type thing really so there's a way you can go and you sit down this fucking place for seven days and there's a permanent change in your IQ and your creativity yep that started kick-started for you Joe we're gonna make a movie about this that I don't need I don't need that man John I'm telling you man it for you you talk about like you know a DD I you know just like like kinda have in your brain that's a comedian brains all over the place you know you don't losing that creativity but it becomes malleable for you like my performance I did this in like 2008 or 2007 I think mm no anyway in mid 2000s and I don't know I came back I Drive fast I've always driven fast I'm a very safe driver but when someone in a Prius cuts me off it pisses me off right it's always the priest is it cut you up so I you know like you son of a bitch and when I'm done with this I came back I'm like oh someone oprius cut me off but zero emotional like costs all the energy that I used to waste on like getting pissed off about stuff that didn't matter right completely went back to productivity and like just kicking more ass it's amazing what happens when you just teach your brain that you're the boss and you tell you the little reptile brain in there to shut the hell up and to do its job to keep you from burning yourself to death or falling off a cliff but to not be freaking you out the rest of the time for no reason is it possible to do that without sitting in the room for seven days getting blasted with sounds you can do do some sounds can we give me a feeling of simulation what you think this could be black there yes I'm like that it's kind of like that and then you try to make it louder
