hello freak bitches and I'm not trying to I'm just trying to like like in the high school I was like you know the wiseass kid who had awful grades I was on ritalin I was a mess and so ritalin in high school I was on ritalin since like like right out of preschool oh look at the early government documentation on on Ritalin this is not a joke oh there's these big books my mom had them there's photos of me they tried ritalin out I was at part of a test group home and we would get little orange tablets and then we get little yellow tablets and we have triangular orange tablets for a while and my I went to a place called the National Research Center and I was a hyperactive kid and they said here we're trying this stuff out my mom had me on ritalin from like preschool all the way to 12th grade holy and in the summertime summer vacation I wouldn't take it and within a day that's of kicking yourself out of your system man your appetite comes back and in ninth or 10th grade I started weightlifting and I started like throwing the pills out because it's it's a nap at that speed and so it suppresses your appetite and so I'm going through puberty my hormones are raging and I stopped using the tablet and all of a sudden I'm that guy at lunch we're like the the the the line of milk on the outer edge of the tray because I'm eating like you know tons of food I'm a locust I'm going to the gym and I'm just getting really my frustration is now being informed by a physicality that I'm getting by lifting weights so also I'm putting muscle on and I'm angry at the world and I'm a spaz and so by 12th grade I was kind of a maniac and then I got into punk rock and you know just got got into that slugfest and just kind of went into the world just kind of wildly swinging away why'd they put you on ritalin at such a young age because it's what they were doing in America with a lot of young people who talk too much or you know had that so my skills well what energy I had attention deficit and I couldn't concentrate and I got thrown out of the DC public school system for being you know he's yelling he's doing this and I we read a couple of teachers reports about me years later and I said I had no memory I said I did all that my mom went yeah that's why they kicked you out they kicked you out of school yeah and I got kicked out of a few schools until they put me in a in a prep school where the the advertising is like oh your kid has problems with studying will cool him out and I the first few days of school some kids spoke out of class and I watched this one teacher picked this one kid up and just kind of toss him into a blackboard on one right in his class he shut up and so I I didn't want to get you know a thrashing by a teacher so I was really careful but having that difficulty sitting down and I was fine with topics I liked I didn't you know I didn't groove on math or any of that but at lunchtime I'd go to the library and start memorizing the Latin nomenclature of every North American snake I had to learn them all and by like tenth grade I had and I have most of it's still in my head but I'm always very confused at these medical distinctions whether it's ADHD or hyperactive or a DD whatever the fuck it is like is is that real or do people just do some people just have a different composition a different passion inside of them and they resist doing things they don't want to do and they don't want to be a part of any structured school curriculum I think all of it but yeah and is that a disease or is that or do you just have more fucking than looking right now if you have any pills you're not on anything and yeah well it's passion for life you have all this isn't that the same shit that you had when you were six yeah it's just it was undisciplined and unfocused but that's not a disease right I don't know I mean I wouldn't call it a disease I think is this wiring right but why the fuck is it named why is it ADH so this is it so they can sell you a pill I know but isn't that crazy well you look back at your own life the fact that you were on that shit for I mean what how many a lot of years eight years nine years and it really screws with you because you can feel it when you take the Tet that pill you can you're basically you're a propeller that spins so fast it looks like they're like oh spokes of a wheel like the wheels still there's actually going really fast that's how it felt like on the outside I'm like this pay skinny like yeah but inside I'm like the last few minutes of Dave in 2001 he's coming to the space-time continuum and everything is flying by that was like 10th grade for me I just kind of held onto my desk and fairly flew through classes like not being able to retain much because I was a speeding my brains out and then the pill would wear off around dinner and all of a sudden you're like eating two meals and the next morning you take the pill and you don't eat again for hours that is fucking crazy it was it was nuts and scares the shit out of me too because my parents didn't put me on anything like that but I know I would have I know I would have been diagnosed I know I would have been put on something if I had the wrong parents yeah they put me on like my mom put me on this stuff probably cuz my doctor said you know hey iris this helps a lot of kids right I was in these classes and I'll never forget one day I'm going through my mom's books and it's just this big honkin hardcover book and I opened it up and I saw these like a contact sheet of me like wait a minute that's that place and then I saw the camera angle and I realized there were these mirrors on the wall there observation rooms I'll never forget one day I'm looking at that mirror and a door open from the side and my mom walked out and they would we were being observed and the camera angle was from that observation room and there's me playing with like blocks and stuff I'm like I remember that sweater oh man I'm like four and that was part of that research group Wow and maybe because my mom was a government employee I don't know but I was uh I went to a place called it like for two years called the National Research Center I got thrown out of there Wow for wounding a kid what'd you do to him through a bunch of powdered cement in his face [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
