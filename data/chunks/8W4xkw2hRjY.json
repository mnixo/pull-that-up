lucrative marry I get what it's really good to find yourself with people who inspire you because they they talk about having a cognitive model for behavior change like if you're trying to get better in some way if you can Vigil if you know somebody who's already done it or doing positive things in their lives it's it requires less energy for your brain to imagine yourself doing it look if you're if you don't if you're not surrounded by anybody who's trying to get healthy or trying to get fit or whatever it is you're it's like it's literally harder to imagine and so it's more exhausting for you to try to imagine yourself getting better whereas if you're surrounded by people who are doing it it becomes familiar to your brain there's all sorts of examples that your brain can call on it literally takes less energy for you to imagine yourself actually doing it and weirdly they found at Stanford University using like avatars if you can see an avatar that is designed to look like you like doing the sort of things you want to do like you know being really physically fit like working out in the game world if you just watch an avatar custom design until the hewed doing that it lowers the cognitive threshold for you to do it and then you will do more in real life you know you will work out more you'll spend more time committed to those goals just by having watched the sort of mirror version of yourself having done it but he's that guy now that really is who he is he's like all the time 24 hours you call him up in the middle of the night he's dice man yeah he came that guy
