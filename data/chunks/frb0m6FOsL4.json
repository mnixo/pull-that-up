hello freak bitches but back to the original question of why am I thinking about simplifying and all this kind of stuff I am a pretty light positive person very optimistic very I kind of live in that world but when I just started reading the book I'm like are things really pissing me off am i stressed do I have anxiety because I live in this house because I'm trying to do these things with my career because I'm trying to always do this because I'm carrying children and parents and all of this stuff I'm trying to make everybody happy I don't know maybe just realizing that and thinking about it no heavy meditation on it no just being aware that maybe that's where it's coming from I'm telling you over a month and a half the pain slowly went away and I don't have it hmm yeah that is interesting so what like what was bothering you before like I know that you're you know you're successful and you had a television show for a while and you've got a bunch of projects going on you're always doing stand-up in specials so you've had a lot of success you've got a lot of great stuff going on what was what was kind of chewing at you I don't know I'm not really a hundred percent sure of what the source is but I do feel like I have a lot of people on my back and it's all up it's all quiet it's all in my head you know what I mean a lot of people on your back yeah I've got a wife I've gotten I've got kids I've got pets I've got family I've got in the in that you feel that there's a weird a weird way to bring bring this up but is that how much of that like having a wife and having kids obviously there's is gonna be compromises and there's going to be stress that comes along with any sort of relationship but do you feel like it was tipping more towards the negative then towards the positive I don't think it was I think I just the whole experience to me seems positive my relationship with my wife is great the kids I adore I feel like it's all but I do carry the burden of everybody's worries and everybody's well-being all the time I was working on this act this joke in my act before I started thinking about all this stuff I had this moment when I was standing in this house I moved to this bigger house it's a really nice house to bigger a bigger home and I was shutting off all the lights this is what I was working through on stage I was turning off all the lights one night and locking the doors for all the bad people that are coming to get us and everyone's in their beds and the cats asleep and the dogs asleep and everybody the lizard's asleep and it just all my responsibilities washed over me like everybody every living thing here is is depending on my success if I don't keep going if I don't keep succeeding this everything here changes everybody's little life everybody's perfect little existence it's all washing her me and I can't tell anyone about it I can tell you the audience but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed at 2:00 in the morning when I have that feeling honey Scheffer you ever feel like you just can't do it anymore you ever feel like you can't you just want to stop you just want to take a break my daughter with my fears I can't do that I don't tell my wife that stuff I don't tell my kids that I just carry it so when I started reading this book I'm like maybe I'm just taking all this really seriously and feeling like mmm yeah I used to have to deal with a lot more I used to choose to deal with it a lot more and now it's just like I'm 46 like I don't know what to tell you like there was a person who came to one of the screenings on the road we had the screening at I want to say New Orleans and of yoga hosers I was doing Q&A afterwards and you know ones getting up and oh my god it's fun fucking stupid and asking questions and then one guy gets up and he is like tight dude he's very serious and he's just like okay you told the big long story before that movie began and I did it was a big intro for the movie and again told like an hour-long story of how we got there and he goes that story did not match the movie I just watched and I said no and he goes not at all and he goes why did you make that movie he's gone I found that unwatchable Isaac and I've won the Audience he's gone oh and I was like now many he paid like he overpaid to see this movie if I'm sitting here talking so yeah let him say what do you want like I'm a big boy I'm fine and so he goes I just don't think you ever should have made it it's terrible and I said well you understand that subjective right like you're surrounded by a bunch of people that feel like the opposite way so you know people were plotting a chip and then some guy behind him in line jumps in front of the mic and goes you want me to kick his ass and I was like fuck no I was like everyone's entitled to opinion I said but his opinion is I never should have done this and you know my answer to that is like that's ridiculous like if I wanted to make it like that's the only reason we're here I just want to see it like you could choose not to see it and in this instance I'm really sorry that like you didn't our taste didn't coincide but every time I go to do one of these things I'd do it the same way whether it was clerks or up to the most recent one I just make the movie I want to see and hopefully others like it and sometimes they do and that's amazing it feels great you're like holy shit my fingers on the pulse and sometimes you're fucking alone but at least you're like I'm happy with the thing that I made I said but I feel heartbroken that you came out of here looking for something I didn't give you so I said I'm gonna give me your money back then I get pulled up 40 bucks and I was like put it on the there's like a riser speaker and he goes I don't want that and I was like no me and honestly take it's not a trick it's not like Jason Mewes gonna come out hit you with a hammer just take it like I feel bad I want you to have a good time and shit like that because no I don't want that and I was like dude it makes for an excellent story like be like I told him it's movie fucking blue to his face and I fucking took his money and walked out and he goes no and he went and sat down and crossed his arms and just stayed there for another like half-hour during the Q&A so for him it was worth the 40 bucks just say it I'm gonna vision I'm verbals like just sit here and fucking hate on this and let you know and then sit down again so you know you deal with that but that's the memorable one because that never happens generally speaking like when we toured the movie you're touring in it you're in a safe zone dog I ate an old edible about a month ago I found in the back of my draw that thing fucked me up for 12 hours that's like an expired vicodin you ever take an expired vicodin you won't have pain for a week I don't care how many root canals they give you one time with expired biking with my pants and I watched my watch I pop that bubble are you gonna have to wash those pants again I got a point and I go in the pants and there they are she washed it right before oh my god I just a half on stage and I blacked out like the first 30 minutes I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel room feed the other radio oh my god black the fucker I didn't know what came out of my mouth when you're on radio did you start swearing no no no I'm headed to poor Thursday night I'm important I'm getting dressed when I was pulling pants on oh boy these pants are darker than my usual jeans and then warm I didn't want well last time I warm was probably when I had the surgery and that's why I found the pill in that they were clean I wasn't in the detergent have worn the numbers down shit could've been anything I just I said let me not be an asshole eat the whole thing people give me crazy shit all the time let me break this and maybe somebody gave it to me and I washed over it I know it's like a vicodin for the vicodin I'm saying brother-in-law something for the vicodin Oh pop tonight took a half and what the poor walked up those stairs and when I sat down on top of things I got fucked up I smoked dogs I tell you I set the fire alarm off in Berlin on Friday night the final plane never come the dressing room and the fuck - fire department had to come because the whole club blacks out all the lights go on the power Felicia what up means Felicia's thank you I mean yeah like oh yeah that's how much of a Comedy Store chase she is like somebody else's said well what's [Music]
