here we go Liam and Vinny my savage friends from mother England thank you for the yen man what's happening has been all sorts of things are going on Joe all sorts of things as well 50 today happy birthday so he sent me over 49 and a half I feel I pulled a muscle in me like bowling last night oh no bad news man your world kickboxing champion to pull a muscle just said to myself remember this morning when I got before you are a loser man doing worse neck injuries I ever got was in the shower I mean my famous shampoo it's like that knocked over Rory MacDonald and Bruce Lee with my antics yeah that's a bummer man bowling balding man yeah fingers well I felt left up to myself in here but I can't lose the game and I carried on we still won the game well imagine if like you had a workout in the trainer it's like okay we're gonna do some bowling you look hot this isn't even an effort I won't mind yesterday morning it's my around sparring I got back i from instead of clinching ruining fine no problem so lean well maybe it was like some residual stiffness you know what we've been driving around a lot we've been missed Emma as scheduled with hectic so about seminars I'm still going over we've been signing the car a lot so my hips have been stiff so I think it was to do a lot to be honest he's right there yeah man that's legit that's a big deal like when I come out of here like when I just get up after sitting in the chair for five hours I'm I everything feels weird you know I hope so stretch how I could have been fucking bail I don't know what what's that about I don't know what are you doing like Matt Damon I said what do you been up to I don't know I'm asleep what's that I've been asleep so I don't sleep no every time I wake up I'm like fuck it now in the morning so it on what goes on pop me feed me hips whatever yeah but you're 50 I get it with him I don't get it yeah you're supposed to be not about 300 fights on the craziest fucking record ever is probably low mischenko right because didn't you only have one loss and the amateurs France 309 a wins faces something crazy ninety-seven three hundred ninety seven wins one loss which we've achieved first yes and then one loss and the pros yeah he's obviously not taking too much damage a because every style but even making way three hundred twelve eight times fringe of ninety eight times making it so that takes it oh yeah yeah yeah be on a diet for that long and just been that strict for that long it's impressive that well as he's moving up he's not cutting it's not yeah third weight class this is third weight class right yeah there aren't about him moving down as well what is this he's going up and down yeah that's what about Byron said what is um so but his last fight against the Englishman what is his name Connelly Luke combo cam how was that it was a great fight yeah that kids good it was really good account of myself get most people in England and brought him off before even offline you find to be fair the second time he went down as well he didn't have to get my cup because he'd already put a really good account being billed by that point yeah and to get back up finishing the might have any strong that were you're impressive now he's unquestionable in their kids warrior I was impressed with his use of distance I mean he gave lomachenko some problems until lomachenko figured out the timing and how to get inside of them and they did he's big for that way as well and Andy knows how to box he was a gold medalist himself so he it was impressive I was there and then lomachenko turned who saw it looked like he looks at me did you feel like that you know I'm like hello yeah I bet he wasn't looking at you in my world it wasn't like that does it help you it was a four hour it was a four hour car ride and I was in the ane that morning cuz I injured myself to go to the A&E in the accident emergency oh okay that's something so yeah so we had to go there and but all the way there I think I can't not how did you get England injured I'm doing weights doing some weights yet and would you do the groin here mmm I was like hopping about and then this then there so at the gym at four corners I was gonna train that morning she said you back out to a knee so did so what was wrong which can go I just strain my groin here one wasn't fun wasn't wasn't fun at all but you're better now yes so it could have been that big a deal but in my I'm not eight-time world champion I'm a natural coward so any little poll yes one thing about socialized medicine that you guys have free health care you don't have to worry you just go show up yeah okay I'll tell you what last time though when you were running you told me to do a bit of rahat yogi said yes I did it yeah drift slightly recently my girlfriend started doing it I just started doing a bit with her me fuck me that is like the hardest shit I've ever done in my life I knew that I will have a joint and go do it it's amazing I had a few but blossom vape last night and I just melted into the bed I couldn't do that and then go do that no way yeah you could once you get in there that you actually it's crazy it seems like you can't but I love to get high and do it because it's like I feel everything I know I'm on in tune I get like a hundred percent transmission from all muscle fibers mother fing you know whatever like the beginners all go out the back so I went in the back and there's some little old game if I'll be fucking cool next to these guys all right what humiliate myself and he's bending around doing it all perfect and I'm it's not good balance I don't know 15 fight so if I should have good balance I'm stood there shaking on one leg as if I couldn't don't stop don't stop and so you don't stop until he stops me it took about 45 minutes saying I would you like checking all over man it's fucking hard Ariel's old ladies make you feel it's one of those things where people look at it like it's some relaxing thing it's one of the most underestimated activities you can do in terms of like the amount of stress and strain and it's required it's fucking hard no I've never sweat like in my life either even when I've been in a sauna to lose weight for a fly so if I've never sweat like that I went must have gone for about five of them easily yeah yeah and I bring a 64 gallon gallon 64 what is it leaders no it doesn't mean any sense what would it be bounces ounces that it yeah yeah 64 ounces of water yeah like a hydro flask I bring a big one and I just fill it up with ice and water and I just fucking drink the thing the entire time and I make sure I drink a shitload of water on the way over there too you're just pouring more but they did a study recently a Harvard study there's one of them they're doing right now where they're trying to see if the same FEX from hot yoga you get from sauna like if it's it's very similar because sauna does you know it's like 40% decrease across all causes of mortality heart attacks strokes with people that regularly do the song I think they consider it four days a week they have like incredible results like health-wise because of the the reduction of inflammation because when you're in that heat it just really reduces inflammation across your whole body they think that that's going on when you're doing yoga because your body heats up so much because even though it's only 104 degrees in there here when you're fucking sweating and 140 degrees yeah and those poses and shaking like your body temperature has got to be through the roof yeah 100% yeah the only thing that saved me on that day my friend came with me as well it needs a big guys like six foot five so I knew that every time I was drugged there I looked across any evil folks oh yeah big giant people you guys how badly how to balance your body is if you're a weightlifter until you do yoga like especially those dudes with little toothpick legs and a big meatball line those guys yeah that's a fucked up body man fall for got no chance yeah it's like a like a car with a giant engine and skinny back tires you just slide all over them it's it's just but I think for athletes it's one of the very best things to keep your entire body balanced to keep it in tune I was speaking as someone who was saying how long doing the fight for and I said I want at least in over three four years on myself yeah I said I still feel good a minute he said bicep I'm getting injured more so he said serious I know I you've been told it to a said you to do it said you will get another four or five years out maybe elope just so much and I walked out the room or dead but I felt amazing about 10 minutes after yeah no it's great for you and it's also for for a kickboxer like your coordination and your your ability to have a full range of motion fortunately everything yeah head kicks you know you want that flexibility want it to be looser so you can let those babies fly yeah I'd kick try already my speciality my mother leg kicked I'm surprised a few people ever known how was your knee I know you had a knee surgery oh yeah they all good now that was in I did it in Thailand in December not alowed you got surgery in Thailand no no the injury in December and my leg slide lock in all time and I had a fight no way so I did the injury in December just before training for a fight and ended January and my leg slightly lock-in so I didn't really know what you wore so far I'll get the fire over the way then I'll go see my specialist get an MRI see what's what did the fight got through the fight won the fight didn't from a left leg once and a farm it's all right now I went back to the gym through one kick and then meniscus tore it got stuck him a knee joint so my leg locked my totally been so I couldn't walk I've had that exact oh my god it was crazy fucking hell they were honestly the one of the worst things I've ever felt I'll rolling on a floor like I've been shot you know I went to the hospital and I thought because it was so bad and I'm just a right it's my job they're my fast-track me a little bit when tada spill oh no we'll let you see I'll let you go for an MRI we'll give you will bring you with an appointment tried to go almost I don't like four days four they'd even rang what fuck this I'm going private so I went private by the time I done an MRI which Tommy were at war and had the surgery I'd only just got a letter to govern him I arrived from the hospital so they were going to leave me there for fucking however long I was something watching over my leg turning to a toothpick while muscle wasting away in everything so that's the downside of socialized medicine reign big whines canidates rough I had a friend she had a weight over a year to get a litany surgery yes yeah over a year with a bad knee just hobbling around one you know that's bad right it's yeah that's bad yeah I feel I feel all ashamed now that I went in with my pulled groin and you industry I fought with that I had the surgery and they said ah door probably after 12 weeks she'll be back to full strength you better fight training again I had a fight after ten weeks so I did like a full month just reuptake me back to where it wore and then a train for like six weeks or a fight and a four-on-one championship I had that exact same injury it's called a bucket handle tear yeah yes yes yes god damn it so honestly I've never felt like you or her end this one now when they removed the chunk is your knee okay now did it feel unstable at all or does it feel sore it we took it gets a bit salty stroking on board now I'm guessing there's no I'm sure there's something in here well that's why he's now the absolutely ill thing out but they just trimmed away no it helps man is if you get some stem-cell shot in there yes make your way down the Panama I know you told me that before you message me I said get down there yeah I was having real problems with my left knee cuz that's the one that I had the meniscus tear and anytime I had to do anything rigorous it would start swelling and it would hurt and then I got one stem-cell shy like five years ago it's never bothered really never bothered me since yeah well my lad one session BP the BP C 1 5 7 as well that's like a new that's for yeah I don't think that's for see the difference between meniscus in ligaments is that that's more of something that they think is really good for tendons and right right yeah but that's there's some real promising Road like people Raven my glammo just telling me about it then like one of my friends from ami uses the only tendinitis that is amazing yeah dr. Mark Gordon is using that in his protocols he's that guy that does a lot of work with traumatic brain injuries and different you know people would like pretty significant injuries and he's found there's some great papers that are being published right now on BBC one five seven they go straight yeah it's a peptide shoot into the old groin area so well I've got a internal rotation on my left leg anyway confirm kickin so limited in limits can't internal rotate come from what from kicking from kicking from left Kotori went Alric doing Crossfit I caught at all I've got a physio Darren heinlen and Irish guy top guy he's been working on it but this was like 5% that this was like 5% this term for that so that was 5% is fucked so this one's a hundred this one's five yeah this was absolutely fucked I had like five percent of that so what's the words the actual injury um actually don't know I've got a tight hip capsule and I tore I ruptured my hip flexor that was doing thrusters but I didn't realize I had one leg shorter than the other so I've got one one leg shorter than the other like a pirate how much difference about that much can you put like that much in your shoe I said basically I'm disabled once you get your leg pulled on when I didn't know what it was because he's like is it the Sun or is it because the capsule doctor why I'm asking I just go and see him and he twists about cause it's loads of pain thought at this progressively got better sir so how is fighting in one Fc you enjoy sick man is it absolutely I love it I'm just I'm going that it didn't come around earlier and now I'm from my favorite free now so I'm gonna cuz I have undergone like three or four years left a hundred percent want to finish my my career like with those guys and putting a good room with them I need a little granite here it's amazing so seriously I've fought all over the world and stuff and like the production and everything there it's absolutely unbelievable like your cherries it's a top guy as well how do they make the rule sets because some fights or with kick boxing gloves some fights with MMA gloves yeah I'm not too sure to be honest I think when they send you the contract over you can say oh well I don't want to fight in MMA will you find in the kickboxing no scoffing it's the manic the team the management team that get a say in it like my manager Richard he's always said no no dangerous fighting men well if you break around just showing your career and alright now fuck that I jump on do it up for it I said I'm all to shit anyway now for fight wise I'm coming towards the end I said I want to do it and I remember when I went out well first round when bang with a job before fucking hell I felt amazing and any at me and I went whoa a glove you're like in home alone man how much do gets smashed with iron on his face that's what I felt like how much difference is it with the little guy he's he's weird because obviously the glove spongy so that like it wobbles you read a little bit that was like a sharp clangs like a bare-knuckle basically because those one gloves as well the tiny they're not much not much padding in him whatsoever but but boxing gloves feel more spongy no yeah if that when you get it with a boxing glove it like if you get it on the chin it wobbles like you're all ed because it's such a big surface area to hit right with those little cool beating like 11.0 I got caught like four times on one eye just from I took like three of our right hand and every one of them like cook me so that's how dangerous yeah but I made a stupid mistake in that fight in Muay Thai with the long gloves I'll do long guard a lot because it works with the big Google's on right I can protect myself I did it once in us by got caught when over and write it write my balance went that's technique on a count in my Copen then I were chasing the fight after that and then even though around free I absolutely battered him I caught him bad nearly stopped him my leg kicks it romney free round five I'd lost one round tonight so first from or even second round him tonight I bought him we were too late by then so one mistaking them gloves and it is that's interesting it makes you reassess your defense yeah defense is to pay like you see a lot of guys like butter like butter always fought like this yes like those earmuffs you got the first thing I did as well like when I'm training to do it I respiring move him just to get used to it and I put my fucking hands short like in a glove a wood and they've done and someone kicked me and the fucking knuckle stalking me at La oh my god this is gonna be fucking torture trying to get you know put your hands flat and more red move mr. floud I did I absolutely really looked at I really enjoyed I can't wait to fight for him again what did you think when they had that bare-knuckle boxing event Paulie Malignaggi part Artem Levin LaBeouf y'all gotta say yeah yeah yeah sorry that's a that's one of the more interesting cases because you've got a guy in Paulie Malignaggi who's a legitimate world champion and a world-class boxer you know a few years past this environment has really been fighting yeah but then you see him fight a guy like Artem Lobot who's used to fighting with MMA gloves is not much of a difference fighting bare-knuckle and blows off actually boys oh yeah eating him in a decision which nobody fucking saw Pauly's not a puncher anyway in the cell to go into that against the guy that's naturally bigger as well but you would have still thought stuff I didn't enough yeah that's a bookie known enough you know I could guy like Roy Jones jr. none out boxing him you know I'm saying like if some it's just like a world-class boxer you would imagine even if he's a few little tricks just to get he's gonna fuck you up just he's just gonna make the adjustments yeah how he trained for it God knows no idea you know I mean did he box with bare-knuckle Rocky's I didn't second round as well straightaway and he broke it but because a few weeks ago when he cause he's a pundit for Sky TV and the boxing and a Yeti son still in plaster or whatever it was then so it must be that bad I was many left-handed as well isn't he I think yeah he had a bad right and they never chopped right hands really anyway that he was always left under anyway it wasn't he wasn't a lot of yeah there wasn't a lot of like combination it's exchange but that's the case with most of those bare-knuckle fights it's a totally different thing yeah it's getting big in England not now as well like the BKB thing having big Shores filling out big arenas if I can't look at me down in London or two and stuff now one of my friends fought on it recently and he's like getting a really big name for itself well people like the lease rules violence yeah the lease rules possible they like it you know like left way or you know anything along those lines you know headbutts with left we may need to take it to another level right yeah that's great yeah come over to England did some seminars on that with and he was that boy in panthenol David LaDuke probably yeah yeah he's got him coming on the podcast soon I I was a big proponent of no gloves with MMA I was like well if you don't have gloves on your shins and your knees and your elbows well the fuck do you have money you knuckles yeah yeah yeah that that's what the two worst things I got caught four times on one eye and me hands after the fight yeah because we had like a bit of a war and I just died swinging all over the place in around free track I owe him I don't really pick him my shots probably like I should have been I've got bad problems with this one I've got a metal plate with this one the day after I flew back to England I went to gym I put the girls on just to try and hit the pads and I couldn't even make a fist properly for about a week and half two weeks just swell and currently yeah it felt like all me wrist like tendon sense around here wouldn't squeeze a fist properly we're all full but not my own stupid fault for like when I was chasing the fight I won't pick him myself properly I'll just swing around in top of his head and trying to ko him and it was fucking good yeah I loved in there doing it you're just there but yeah it is exciting we will miss they actually it's gonna change the fight and I mean which is I've learned that now as well so well we've seen that with you know MMA fighters really top-flight kick boxers like gokhan Saki when Okazaki fought Khalil Roundtree and Khalil just cracked him with one left hand and dropped him it's like it's a hundred percent I mean you thought gokon sake man he is one of the lead of the elite in kickboxing he's in MMA if anybody's gonna beat him it's gonna be on the ground yeah yeah yeah anybody can get caught with this little gloves like I said well they'd like longer which we are very stupid I trained the old time as well not to do that and instinct yeah exactly did you go back to what feels come to it cost me that's one of the craziest things about fighting right is that you've you trained for years and years and years and then you have this style and you try to make adjustments during the fight but as soon as things get crazy you go back to where you go right back here that's why I always felt like it's it's it's almost not almost it's definitely worse to learn things wrong and then relearn them then to not learn anything at all I'm gonna start with a blank slate yeah like if you could teach someone and there were 25 and they had no martial arts experience whatsoever versus teach someone and they have 5 years of some bullshit yeah that 5 years of some bullshit is gonna that's gonna be in their head yeah muscle memory you gotta liven you sunny why we get a lot of people come with gym as well of doing karate for years yeah and then you're trying to teach my kick like the Thai way and he just can't do it he checked over and over and over yeah because I've been taught that way for so long it's just so difficult to get him out of that hold of it you know some guys were effective even with the karate way like that like the cuts amount of power they could generate like crow cop was a great example yeah he kicked karate yeah but in the fucking power that cock could generate yeah when I had cake yeah oh my gosh grace filled my body kicks you may remember that there's a fucking picture when he kicked Heath Herring it is to this day one of the most to this day there's a shot of cro cop with his shin halfway in the Heath herrings body look at this picture this picture oh dude that's a big old leg to be stripping four years old oh my god that fucking body shit only let go who's that Jesus Christ I don't know who that is but that's horrific it's a head kick as well that is London he's it yeah I don't think that's the one with Heath Herring the one with Heath Herring is if see that's an upper left-hand corner that's it that's oh that's full yeah look at that whoa look at that one oh my god go full screen on that look at the fuck King penetration that is horrific and that's all livers lemma oh my god that guy could generate so much force with that left kick it's insane but that one right there I mean fucking a yeah the most the most horrific body shot I've ever seen in all of MMA yeah it's not leaving for its full shit as well bullshit for perfect just it's like a textbook but he again karate style yeah yeah well when you've got it down on out to fight like that as well he can mix and match with the styles gifted is evil as well knockdown karate isn't it I don't know if he had a key occasion background I know he had a traditional martial art background when he got into kickboxing but see he has a good example of a guy who made that transition well into MMA because he was so explosive whereas there's other guys like like if you've had a guy like Peter Aerts who wasn't as explosive he wasn't like he was more of a technician and methodical or nesto and I still hoost they probably wouldn't have had the same success in MMA as Marco did yeah definitely like remember when Ernesto fought Bob Sapp yeah oh yeah twice got stopped by couldn't keep him off me we're mark Mirko fucking Merck them and let's go if you're gonna do that in MMA a wrestler try grab hold of him and be done morning I mean yeah yeah exactly you need to have that excel had that explosiveness that those guys didn't have it's interesting how like so many variables change what a fight is no gloves versus gloves changes what a fight is changes your ability to defend yourself and then you know whether or not there's takedowns or grappling like that's one thing about kickboxing versus Muay Thai it's like people say well I like kickboxing because it's more action because you can't clench like yeah yeah well you're not gonna fucking elbow straight knees to the body and from the clinch and trying to escape from the clinch is an art in itself and he depends OS I mean now that when the the generic just ducks touch doll like yeah that's common and Ernesto Hoost now the Dutch Styles changed especially the Moroccans the the guy that's training but a hurry now sayyidil by do a different style altogether um they use more leg kicks and from knees up the middle they're really quickly a lot more that they can be used in yeah you mean the body and the right knee or the middle east it's just a different angle LT it's like the attack with bit more sort of an more of eclectic mix of stuff you know this gentleman who's trained in bara Hari who was he trained before Ilyas belayed he's a fantastic fight yes he's just he's signed for Bellator he's from an infusion he trained Melvin for his last fight Melvin looked good in his last he did look goodness yeah I mean a lot of people thought Melvin was done yeah I really like and he's a good guy as well he's from a lot marnie Jim Northey know what Manny was a good coach as well he's got some good fighters but these these kids that you don't get to seek is that because I'm an infusion do I work for they have like an infusion talents or see all the new kids come in and they are fucking leaf all these Moroccans yeah really Tyson you said you like him wild group of people those Dutch Moroccan yeah you know and that's like Badr Hari that's that's his whole deal you know he's just as wild fighting a guy he look Rico's right Enrique ax r agreement or it's a tough fight for him cuz yeah Enrico is so active yeah Rob how long is that out as well yeah how long he's been out two years four years yeah but but Rico is calling bullshit Rico said he just wanted out of the fight when Rico was on the podcast he's like you look at him he goes he looks at one elbow and their chances really yeah what's that yeah he said he wanted out he said he wanted out he was getting fucked up there and he said he knew that I was tuning him up you know and I don't know I mean that's also Rico trying to fuck with him yeah getting his Hansen but yeah it's like I would have loved to see Badr have a few fights and get real sharp he had like one right yeah you have one did he fight he fought heads E right yeah a four head CT I guess yeah well city fine did you find one of the person thank you for loving me a favor and pull a butter I thought he fought long well you didn't find anybody else just heads he just lets he get in a year before that was a last fight in nonsense II that is stretched on holiday hmm so heads II Rico we hasn't fought since does that say he doesn't fight say oh that's glory glory beginning he did try blow up his with a smile on forgot pull up his Wikipedia record his Wikipedia record he's definitely had at least one fights a long Lundy was yeah I think you said some why I don't know I think he fought heads II again again that make sense why I'd see the first time he fought him I was comments actually kicked him in the face any on the floor that was a long show time okay what does he go okay so you did fight so that was he had a no contest against heads II the last fight what is that says decision anonymous why does it say no contest I thought it's something that's positive Wendy to kick him on floor in a Showtime like look at this it says decision unanimous that says result no contest what the fuck is that in blue as well yeah can you click on that what does it say alright yeah the fighter so why you testing Badr Hari just look at his Instagram that's enough you should just give him a suspension based on his Instagram like listen bro he's jacked okay I mean go to Badr Hari Instagram he's about as shredded as like a professional fighter is everything he's in ridiculous shape in it so the with this Rico far they gonna test him I wonder yeah I mean he's obviously an incredible physical condition but the thing like look at him to look at that fuckin picture get fuckin fuck come on son he's on all the Mexican supplements he should be wearing a sombrero in that day looking good butter I'm really excited about that fire by us them I think it's in descent he some think it's December 12 please don't test them just stop glory stop let it go let it go but Syed is a good coach there's some really good coaches in Holland I see ossama L by L guy OE good really good coaches man and he just it's just different pad style you know old Dutch towers right under the head left to the body leg kick leg kick you know high kick and like kick high kick but these these guys are really so intricate these guys now in pro boxers who've been taught a few kicks and knees before I'm not good with around yeah they're amazing no one's do you think that that is the way to go or but look at the success that a lot of the Tigers have had in glory yeah they are fair yeah I mean yeah I think is because a lot of the time when they do it when they have a class they all train the same I think they lead off the lead hand a lot and I think it's very difficult with a South Pole habakkuk a tie you can step off so anything it's a South paw honestly I think South the South ports style is a completely different game altogether for sure but what about when in South by South paw well yeah I think what the ties are good at is a lot of the duct fight is to fight in rhythms so it's like but the bouncing with the feet in and in and now and then they explode in the combination fighters like CH I in Super Bowl and guys out the so good at breaking your Rivermen timing little off balance in stuffy he's putting them out their rhythm then they're scoring their shots stepping off and stuff are out yeah so they're so good like even someone like a little T that front leg not just stop him sort of Lee for a minute they'll kick him out score and move and you know it's going to reset the self which often the doctor used to really because when the fighting over dojo Moroccans is standing in front of each other right you go I go you go I go and least I'm in a complete war like so much sort of like that while the Thais are doing this why'd you break in their rhythm and they were able to score the trouble is as well though there's a flip side to it because a lot of ties start very slowly you can't do that with these kids Moroccans fight like you've nicked something often though the final week as well they get 23 100 fights and the spar is just fucking ridiculous yeah this is crazy you've seen onions just not fuck out of each other what they did ever to fight in 16-ounce gloves twice a week that's this seems like they're limiting their future they are a lot of them they don't get past five twenty six twenty seven a lot of really just from impact just impacting yeah yeah just coming for it have you seen that with so many fighters there's a different sort of thing ever a more ingrained especially the Moroccans ever more ingrained so uh they refuse to lose anything I think even I think it's sort of massive pride things like a problem is like they love fighting right well you're fucking yourself over and you're gonna limit your ability to fight for a long periods of time yeah yeah about to dive done that like the older I've got have changed my training of what we used to spar out quite a lot of the bad company we don't do that well I door myself maybe once a week head guards on just hard box inspiring but I thought doing any hard kicks bearing at all anymore realized it now okay I just want to save myself don't wind you my selfies you worried about your knees yeah a little bit and even you're picking up knocks now the order I've got it side let's check off I don't think I need do any out kick sparring now I can play a spar and I still gets me eyes working as long as I've done some good box inspiring hard box inspiring with the head guards on with James France was one of our top fighters and he's a really good boxer if I can hold my own with him I know I'm ready to fight what is the difference in the amount of damage you take with hard kick sparring versus hard boxing spine the thing is you just the way when you start going hard inspiring especially with comp a we all are my gym because lots of top-level fighters with the a stock went hard and the tighter you get so he gets around 67 you miss a kick you kick an elbow you kick your knee your stupid shit then you give out your foot and then bang need your class needs and stuff like when I was younger you check them injuries off them I'll just power again tomorrow but the older I've got I don't want to even put myself in a position where I need to do that I don't feel like I need to anymore anyway I've worked out that place barring like not 50% power he's just as good he still gets us working he's still doing all same things and I'm not getting hurt well the tires really have that yeah yeah they did it's so such a wise thing that they learned you know and when you see guys like Sancho yeah when he's sparring it's like he's just slapping but when I buy lunging I train with him at the same gym and that's all they this ones I get their comment ring nor shame pads to play spa you know fucking humanely I mean but I learned so much in about three minutes off him and so far like to learn don't know think you do that as well the Cubans when they box punch for car of each other either well that's also jiu-jitsu I mean Hannah Gracie his whole thing was always keep it playful we have to tell people you want to learn jujitsu want to get really good be playful don't be fucking stuff yeah that's flow you get caught you get caught it's play you plan to give it yeah if you're playing basketball in someone scores in you it's not the end of the world they know about ball goes in the egg flock but if you get caught in an armbar it's like dude life is over it's not you got caught mmm you know if you don't if you don't think the guy who's your sparring with Ken can't you your sparring with the wrong people yeah don't rip it off your fucking tapping everybody either your hips and Gracie and you just so good you're better than everybody else or your sparring with people that are not challenging you yeah it's early that simple yeah definitely and the fingers is well like what up and he's like on a Friday our gym like the whole gym will not be changing partners and stuff so if I come across someone who's a bit a bit less experienced and stuff and they're going out and they're not too sure about what they're doing and againa like yeah so that's why just took myself out of that I'm not really do it anymore you know that's a wise thing man it's wise and I really wish more young fighters would appreciate that early in their career because I think so many of them are compromised by the time they get to the big leagues yeah you know by the time they get to Bellator MMA and with the UFC or you know even kickboxing guys by the time they get to big fights they've already been dinged up too much they can't take a shot yeah 100% I've seen that load recently as well like fighters were like 27 28 should be just starting the prime now for the next four or five years and they're already punchy as fuck you know I mean thank you so interesting thing sorry you sec Alexander rusev yeah but you know I'm boring and I'm always watching thought fights even if it seemed you know Russian and Rip Trainer reading the subtitles and there's one about Alexander he's boring no I'm boring and just sit there watching fights all the time it's just what I do but and there's a video of ASEC and he was saying about now people aren't moving the feet he said you watched American styles and the British they're all like doing this and the Philly shell and stuff like that they're not moving the feet anymore which I found was really interesting because if you look that the footwork is their footwork he's so superior women in llama when he way for Tony Bell you papa great performance against him but he just put him in a position and the end of it he was fucked yeah not many people realized what he'd actually don't evil as well he'd put him there and they were waiting I'm waiting away and when he got him they knew a conk out and bang it would have been amazing if we got a chance to see Floyd versus Loma when thought I was in his prime yeah that would have been fucking incredible to see which style superior yeah Lloyd would move towards you like this you just get right up on you and they'll be trying like me on the back of it like I think you think it was one that we use that he was talking to someone where he was Mayweather floor Pretty Boy Floyd and money Mayweather it's like to dip is money Mayweather yes the pretty body flight was better on it was more on his feet sharper on his right hands when he fought Phillip and doing it in would like six right hands like yeah why did he got into the fight was that was a horrific on there I remember watching now only young as well when I watched I remember fucking LT right being bad yeah and he was executing them yeah well no desire I mean no business being in there no of him yeah well just show you how good Floyd really is yes sir you know I mean people just because the fact that he's won decisions by you know playing it safe people just don't get excited about I'm gonna recognize him with the all-time greats he's the best lately schooled Immunization just absolutely change canals dominate it you look at the way to nullify the Daniel Jacobs friends so much head movement and somewhat so elusive now yeah he learned yeah you know what do you think about canal going up and fighting kovalev and crazy you know you know I don't big you know I don't think I'm rubbish it for protecting fights I am I agents that means he's not no I'm really bad at predicting fights we're in a bot we have a boxing group and what's up the boxing team gets called and I always get it wrong you guys use what's out that is such a fuckin British thing no one knows what the fuck that and I think I think that the key for kovalev is his job I think the thing is everyone thinks that he's easy to hit to the body but Andre Ward was amazing and slipping underneath that Jaime was so good at that if this is just a game amongst normal people but he was tested in his last fight without any yard in round eight you were gone in round eight well to recover from a fucking tap it looked bad like he was a couple punches away yeah being stopped yeah saved by belly but 20 more seconds he might have gone I think it said getting him at the right time you think what cover left still in it with his job he's better now with buddy McGirt because he'd be Alvarez after that if they've got lost to Alvarez and he fought Alvarez again he look great and but against yard young hate Yardies massive as well yeah doesn't have enough experience yeah that's really what a team fights 18 knockouts yeah just whitefall of everyone never mean it not deep war and never being at world level and they put in a good account of himself like but like dangerous as fuck after that fight yes gonna win that experience and understand like wow his conditioning is probably a little off yet maybe needs to lose a little bit of muscle mass yeh needs to put in more running but goddamn he's good this is very powerful kid yeah really powerful powerful you know I meaning even crusher said it afterwards like this guy's a future champion I'm sure and I felt I felt sorry for his coach because he's coach he's not you know a lot of people they find him unsavory in many ways because he's what he says and still cuz he said a few things about he said the skill level was better than and rewards which is nonsense no way he said yard skill he said that Ward was like what there's fuckin two between them but um I do think it's a little bit unfair that he got it got so much shit but then again if you say stuff people are gonna hear it and want to give it your back so but I think yards yeah definitely a future champion but it's a hard division oh yeah matter VF what's the other guy called this is another Russian it's and that fighting and unification fight soon it's all Russian it's a Russian division though poor Don and we were talking about it a look at the division it's fucking Russian it's crazy and then you suck is going up to having a heavyweight fight find spawn yeah very interesting very interesting it's like probably yeah it's gonna be a bit too smart I reckon you thick book spawn will be afraid to fucking fraud a Melissa he's danger yeah yeah Bank I saw it left hook especially as I left them that they won't be afraid to fucking go am either so yeah well he won he won his last fight by split decision though in a Suriname all right yeah so I don't know who we fought thank you for again yeah only a couple of weeks ago yeah yeah because he said I think it was the based on cuz I message huge and I saying third he's Tyrone Spong in that and then he I think he might another fighter yes sharp yeah but I think I liked I Ron I remember years ago It's Showtime Sauron was saying that it's a day man I want to fight this David day yeah I fighting no profits and sort of I don't think the Dutch really have got much respect for boxers because every year the kick boxers and the boxers fight you know yeah I'll never know what so yeah they fight and that kick boxers always win really yeah the fight boxing rules and and the kick foot and the boxers and the box that's why I like what you're saying about before the kick box is there now row boxes will be showing some kicks ending yeah basically and I can fight that sort that southpaw off and oxy just not big they just Chuck stuff about I'm sorry I gotta make a text that I forgot about don't keep talking anyway about me buddy I'm thinking that with Tyrone Spong what's interesting is that you know he had this really big career as a kickboxer he was one of the best yes and he has that fight with gokon sake and snaps his leg worst thing I've ever seen yeah still gives me nightmares but I've seen that in person twice yes fi Anderson and there was another gentleman that also Quarry Hill was a quarry Hill the thing was Quarry Hill it's just a rough fuckin break man that's that's a terrible injury because then you're always gonna be thinking now throw it you know hundred percent and then they also say that when you have those metal plates a lot like Paige Vanzant is dealing with that like the area where the metal meets the bone sometimes it compromises that bone and so it snaps but where it's like she's had like I think three different surgeries on her forearm she broke her forearm throwing a spinning back fist and hit somebody in the forehead fucking hell that's the way that's the way Paul Felder broke his two through it and you know you land like this like with your forearm instead of your fist yeah you know and just your arm snaps thank you welcome to saw us Michael Sava I got if I am one and they fought Lucilla and he go he's like car and he lifted him up and swept him and he's mine put one down and he's elbow dislocates wist it over well horrendous he's a good kid a great fighter but back home in Cyprus now recuperating it's a shame that as well because the kids 20 years old he's a massive star in Thailand they're gonna give him a stadium title shot he's just making a name for himself on one it smashed his first fight so I think they were in line for a woman title shot as well which is fucking big money when you're gonna be 20 years old mm-hmm and then that happened to employ is it the elbow joint though is it just the joint I'm not sure not to him for a while yeah I spoke to him a lot long back in arena rehab nah just like doing some like really light exercise he's trying to get but it look like in his life it's the same thing gonna yeah it looked like the elbow is armoured like it's wasted he drowned horrendous I was in Utah recently I was in Park City and my family and I were driving down the street we saw this lady fall down on her bike she was on the other side street and she was crossing and something happened she slipped and she fell and she was just yelling for help and so we we looped around parked the car I get out in her fucking elbow I was like it was like the bone went like this and the elbow went like that and I'm like stop trying to go there yeah just can't do shit am i and they were like take let's take your backpack off yeah I'm like don't touch her yeah don't touch her back but I'm like grab my hand I'm gonna help you up we're not gonna move your arm your arm is broken I've never had a broken bone she was like freaking out she's 50 Meriter broken bone never had a broken bone I like and then you know the lucky thing for her the cops are there but it's like seeing your of a bone of a person that's just clearly snapped and seeing the elbow just kind of hanging loose makes you realize how fucking fragile we are but when when I used to play football soccer I seen it all the time you know like in 5050 challenges we're used to oh anything oh so much while the leg day I need that you don't look but and you do looky all fuck you know uh yeah it's bad man it's just we're so fragile but then you think about look what we enjoy like words that are designed to break your friends out body like that fucking thing with Mirko in Heath Herring what who would ever engage in an activity with that's possible where someone can do that your ribbon shit like that but we find the way to fucking persevere it four ways is weird right like the enjoyment of watching god damn it's so enjoyable enjoyable when you're in bed actually doing it yeah I've had the most fun in some fights I've lost as well even when I've lost and I've been getting out myself I've had some of the most fun in those fights they've been some of the best fights that I'll take away with me like the second time I fought sunshine we absolutely buttered each other that fight I caught him really bad of an elbow and he hit me with a body shot in round three and I remember thinking oh my god I didn't think he could punch the heart and I was just I took about four more on the phone when a second ear and then you run it do it again and I elbowed him and then caught him and I thought well this is amazing now I remember at the time thinking this is fucking amazing looking at a man you were bleeding I can't breathe and I remember thinking fucking yes because you have that sort of lust for combat you know it's like that you either have that or you do not you know some people they look for a way out and some people look for a way in yeah you know I mean that really is the difference between people who win lose or draw love a real epic scrap yeah and I think that was not the the end of my career now when I were younger a few times I'd gone back for and try and point score and not get hurt and stuff and now I'm just seeing it down I'm an entertainer now do you not I mean we they're hard money the go out and work and if the banner ticket to come watch me fight they're gonna get fucking fight and I mean win lose or draw I will go out on my shield and I'll give them what they want to see that's why I look at it now and even my last couple of fights Vinny said don't fight like that no I'm gonna and they're from all these things that he comes and trains at the boxing club right near my house for cornice jumpers great where have you gonna john kerry's down there yeah and he's like yeah I've got him just slip and he's doing all this and he looks great on partly just cold you know it's interesting I wonder how many fighters careers could be extended if they took a different approach to the way they recuperated between fights because I think so many fighters they'll have a fight they recuperate a little bit then they have another fight and they've recuperator a little bit and there's a lot of benefits of that in terms of your timing and then your relaxation inside the ring because you're so used to competing it's like you get that mo but then your body I feel gets compromised after a while you see like they're throwing punches different there's not a lot of fluidity to it you wonder like if they did a lot of physical rehab or preparation in terms of like weightlifting and stretching and yoga and maybe even Pilates and chin ups and push ups and just strengthen their body more and you know it's like everyone's concentrating on fighting techniques it's fighting techniques sparring getting in condition making the weight but physical training that's not I've only just realized this now towards back into my career and stuff as well that's why all ties a lot member retired by time - 25 26 yeah but - 300 fights the body - just ruined yeah and none of them are lit when I lived there not no one did shrimper condition in essence he that wasn't even a thing there now the mall the gym is especially the the mainstream gyms are being an SNC coaching you know them are doing a lot more stretching and stuff like that and they're all they're all getting smart about it now and you'll see that's why Thai fighters now we're getting into the thirties and they're all lasting longer will your Sancho yes that's a for now now 39 for and he's the best yeah I mean he's still currently Weiss a week try twice a month sorry yes a month and he's still destroying everyone I know he was like Benny smiling he puts it on his Instagram page I fight tonight like dynamite and then you know afterwards big smile you know I won because she wanted it didn't be warrant idiots versus a paper I God made in Italy was her yeah we got a friend called Warren brown he's an axe a geek a he's a it was a two-time world champion himself and we had we played scissor paper stone at the after-party yucca when sunshine for and Warren Beatty me fucking well I'm not sure that night so we entered after play if you lose you gotta take a shot your beer alone but there in a beer that fucking wine so we were drinking pints of wine and born may you should see I didn't they have beer where were you Italy in Italy Annette beer everybody run out like all the time fight is as with all drunk come out one and all we had left for wine to that plane boxing is big there too right yes I mean you know obviously Giorgio Petrosyan it was uh you mean he's probably the most popular ever for me yeah yeah and definitely yeah yes they still doing big he's fighting for a million dollars next moment from one championship is really yeah we're in the 170 kilo tournament he's fine what do you think about that fight where he lost and they reversed a decision what do you think about they split with this lame thinks the Jojo lost I think you want I mean but because of the punch in making because of the the scoring where you're not allowed to clinch that long I think it's very unfair though that if you lose you lose not saying I don't think you should have been reversed well I watched the the thing where they're saying that you clinch too long I didn't see it yeah yeah well it seemed like a normal fight yeah I mean yeah but I still think you landed more punches but nevertheless this opens a conjecture but I honestly think we should not even yeah it depends on sorry for the tie yeah and then they fought again and George you want to pre-clear yeah yeah what do you think was the adjustment let kicks yeah he did he smile the first thing he's died like the first 10 seconds it's smashed his leg about three solid cakes like straightaway and obviously might even your legs like starting to go a little bit he's your sta games going out window well it was interesting majority though because he was really jumping in with his right hook so he obviously obviously wanted it he's obviously wound up about it I've seen him like that before clinically I think you probably realized that it was a reverse - yeah he had I mean he you know he put it to bed with the second fight but when you're Giorgio Petrosyan you know you really kind of have this I mean the one knockout that he lost in glory to Christie he just hit so fucking hard man yeah but that was very shocking yeah you know it took a while for him to rebound from that right he didn't see insane I hated like Liam was saying about the long guard if you watch he got caught with an uppercut with his arms out long and all that his arm was fractured in that as well it was chin wasn't but you know his hand was fractured going into that you should see old scars all over it when sees we saw about God but once they put the bolts in there and the fucking plates doesn't it just strengthen up no I thought that how's yours I'm fine I've got glare there it's absolutely mind stronger than in this one when I brought this one before I brought this probably three or four times and twice we're in Thailand and I think go hospitals I didn't trust what they do of it let's fucking like you like an idiot so now I've got this big like claw okay bow so was broken and you never even never when I stand alone yeah so this one I broke it and I went straight to hospital playing stronger than ever this one's just all that but you see a big lump on it yeah fucked and it still hurts when you punch people all time at the to get all of it in training I would imagine it's probably jagged in there right big gun glean on it and stuff I try to take lots of CBD tumeric stuff are not footing for inflammation and stuff ah does it help a little bit boy it's just one of them things chop anything do you you know if your old putts for him it doesn't exciting to watch but I always wonder about your joints like Jesus Christ his shoulders like it's like so much torque you know you that's but that's the thing about strength and conditioning that I like how many guys are over using their body by just continuing to throw you know like full power kicks at full power punches at the pads at the bag you know and sparring whereas like maybe you could extend your career and extend and maybe your body would work more efficiently if you have a go a really good strength and conditioning coach who actually understands combat sports and that the rigors well the one I use in lead Steve Campbell Maui recently but because he's training a lot of fighters he took himself off on a scrimp and conditioning spike seminar so like he's learned a lot more about that now I've got another one as well done mate and all Vinnie uses might be more of a movement and agility coach doing stuff with him has been fucking amazing off like shoulders hips everything like that so real art to it Danza I trained me done twice a week sometimes for two hours in the session and Deer Lodge gymnastic rings now because of my hip I can't really I can't run I'll do much like that but if they fix your hip there's something it's a very very slow process so it's gonna take a while but I don't think I'll ever be it's weird because I can't seem to get it into me head out to run because of learn to walk in such a different way because one leg is shorter maybe probably hop better off doing something that's like low-impact yeah have you seen that zero runner thing that I have out there it's a very interesting it's weird like you got to learn the gait of it but once you learn the gait of it it's like it mimics running but there's no impact at all right it's rigged because it's real where it's most people when they get on it their legs just start swinging and you're like this is stupid then I'm like like I had to show my wife I was like no no don't swing like lift your legs up like bounce like you're running and then once you do that you're okay and then you get a swing of it gliding yeah and you could run but it's actually harder than just running so it's like it it's like have you got one air yeah yeah yeah it's it's interesting I've used it a few times and I'm you know it's it's kind of a torturous you know you don't look convinced I do but I use everything you know like I have a big gang shit out there right I have a rower I have that echo bike from Rome have the versaclock fucking yeah that bikes and then the the self-powering trail trail treadmill thing from air runner it's a runner without major sprint on it no yeah you're but you're powering it and it's a that's the best for running for real running because it's actually 13% something like that harder than actual running because you are propelling the treadmill as you're running so when you do that and then you go to regular run like you have more pep in your step because you're used to like running at a disadvantage because of that thing but it's actually therapeutic it actually and it's also got a bounce to it so it's not a lot of pounding you know it gives and you're running on this thing and you're actually pushing it with your feet as you're you're almost like pulling it as you're running just try it that's another thing I've stopped doing as well I don't run outside anymore no really yeah just for just saving me knees and stuff at the wall running on the treadmill like 15-minute high intensity sprint work and obviously when you fight you're not like running like fighting a slower pace like wow when you go for a long jog right is what they've always had to do in Thailand right get up girl run 10k slow round Park on the concrete you fighting in bursts so it's more sports specific really to be to be well yeah like interval stuff there's a lot of fighters that they ruin their knees and yeah I can't run anymore and they have to figure out what to do it like Camaro Oman the UFC welterweight champion he's got some of the most incredible cardio of anybody and he can't run yes destroyed oh my god he said his knees were so fucked up that he has to walk on grass like when he's waiting he walks on grass rather than concrete because his knees are hurting my cousin Andy I wasn't even like one of the most insane fighters like to ever come from England he's got massive rep for like being a warmonger finance lord of war he didn't run cuz he couldn't he just refused to run when I'm around him I don't like it doing it and some of the fights he had were absolutely insane and he he never blow I never seen bloody Joe no never never never never gasps never it's totally possible there yet in amazing shape without running but running helps oh yeah I believe so I believe I used to like it to be honest I used to love it it was a Miss fun Oh perfect examples kobe covington kobe Cummington is he's got insane cardio mean that robbie lawler fight his fucking cardio's in santa and he trains with my friend cam haynes who was an ultra marathon runner and they run mount pizza in oregon that like when you you if you run with a person who's like a real runner like someone who does like mike cam does 240 mile races they last three days yeah yeah you sleep for like 14 minutes in three days I'm not just a bleep yeah the woman who run who wanted Cortney dough Walter she slept one time she slept for a minute one minute they woke her up she said she felt amazing after that one minutes Lily yeah she's my savage that lady that lady is the mental strength of someone like that like cuz she can't she's not tough she's not like a tough girl like she's trying her ass like she's all smiley and happy but the real strength like when when the fucking rubber hits the road like are you gonna quit yeah that lady ain't quittin yeah shit you ain't getting her to quit she won a race when she was blind she was having some sort of bleeding in her retinas and she couldn't fucking say fucking pussy all of a sudden so do I wait yeah 205 miles in one run Cortney doe Walter is an ultra addict that's her this one I can erase it of course she did she's a savage man this lady's a savage she beat she won that 240 mile race and she beat the second-place person by 10 hours whoa 10 noda fucking animal dude she just doesn't she just she can push through things that other people can't so kind of fucking human s abusive even when you're that far affront to still push and push and push yes she could have taken an 80-hour and still won by two hours yeah exactly which is madness is there mad that's a special person that yeah yeah and again like she eats fuckin candy and drinks beer and nachos and shit like her die is not like it's not like she's drago from rocky gotta strapped up nope just tough going out to the flick Ariane stuff though like the MMA guys I think a lot of that from like wrestling and grappling and stuff out there cardio he's like really fucking someone else I did a bit of work with Brown Ortega the over there he was just hitting putts for an hour non-stop non-stop not getting tired crazy yeah and but but it like nearly 2 hours a mount of work and he was still one tired by the end of it they are they're fit fit guys well I also think he's really ramped it up since the max how's that fire yeah started bad it was saying it's like he's not firing for a couple of month we still doing all the work now and yeah yeah well you know that's what happens with you know Brian is a championship-caliber writer we never won a title but he was beating world champions like Frankie Edgar like really elite guys and you know he just ran into the best guy in the fucking business yeah at 145 the fingers well he was telling is what I did to his body and not fire I think he fractured both his sons was the case false to be a ligaments find any knee and it was a crazy fight honest I'm surprised there were no best fights I've seen man well to me Brian Ortega's got great stand-up for sure but his best skill for sure is his ground game yeah and well in it yeah and for him to not emphasize that as his strategy in the fight to me just seems I feel like it's short-sighted because I think he could tap anybody in the world at 148 pounds I really fucking masti I couldn't believe it he's big felt big for that wage compared to me similar way it's like I couldn't believe it he's coming down on Monday he's gonna do some hypnosis and Liam's gonna wear this oh yeah nice well his fucking triangles I mean that's his nickname T City yeah he throws triangles up like a fucking world beater it's crazy when you're a nice guy man sharp sharp technique man but you know again guys fall in love with their hands yeah you know they fall in love with the ability to punch people I just think that jiu-jitsu and MMA I mean one of the things about MMA in general is that there's so many different ways to win yeah and when you do win by knockout a few times you kind of get into that and you kind of look to do that all the time whether the crowd saw up expect that man you wanna fuck him that's the scary thing about MMA is like you said there's so many ways to women there's so many ways to fucking lose - yeah you see these guys stand up lighting someone up and all of a sudden I just go not say you fuck yeah well so so dangerous man it happened to Gaston bolaños you know got caught with a guillotine his last fight yeah we're doing a seminar see coaches clinic on Saturday spinning elbow oh my god there's crazy Carians a good coach man every time you see any one of these G from each team yeah the qualifiers yeah they really go girl foiler in a Stephanie frost and that's another gym that really emphasizes strength and conditioning and they have a whole class fit gym yeah they can catch to it yeah they do yeah yeah after we don't he like like I said earlier that even the ties are doing it now because they don't want to start getting left behind anymore mm-hmm has to be done like what kind of shit do you do um what are a bit younger I used to like absolutely smash yeah I do a lot more like flexibility mobility stuff now no one like the exercise buns and stuff like that instead of just smashing my body with heavy weights and stuff I still do like the the odd set of my high intensity explosive lifts not a high pause and then deadlift mr. flat but I do a lot more on on the buns know like activate my glutes and workouts like that really how many times you do strain conditioning a week twice twice and is that when you're in camp for a fight as well or just normally no I mean fight for in fight camp I'll do it twice when I'm not probably once once yeah just to conserve you just yeah just keep losing my mind if I don't drink right I'll teach but I can't sit around doing no even when I'm fucking into this my own that's my one of my worst dress I cannot do nothing yeah but that's also one of your best friends yeah yeah truth why you're so exciting because you have this Drive yeah to succeed if there's the interesting thing about strength conditioning to me is that there's no clear blueprint it's no there's no like to you yeah it's no there's no established protocol like you have to do this and then you do this and that and then two days a week you do this it's not everybody does differently yep and then you've got like the NIC curse on school of thought like the Marva renovage school of thought which was those guys just concentrated almost entirely on strength and conditioning and their thought was that strength and conditioning is everything you already know how to fight yeah so when you're in camp you should just be doing box jumps and rope skips and all these fucking explosive things with balls and medicine balls and shit and their ideas like get your end so you have the most incredible gas tank the most powerful engine you already know how to fight and then skill work is secondary while you're in camp and then when you're at a camp then you work on all your skills then you hit the pads you do all these different things you do less of the strength and conditioning but you maintain a base but then when you go in a camp the camp like when BJ Penn was at his best he was training with Marvin Marinovich like when you fought Diego Sanchez when he fought Sean Sherk that was the best BG of him we ever saw and he was in insane shape insane shape it's because they brutalized him I mean they just made him go through these absolutely insane strength and conditioning workouts so they gave him this this cardio base and this conditioning base that was just through the roof that's different yeah my finger that baby I'll be a bit the closer the fight gets I'm one of my main weapons I wanna nose work into my eye so so if I have knots pardon of close to the face mm-hmm and I can tell that as well if I'm get the fight the closer the fights get when I'm spying if I'm getting caught up with stuff I shouldn't be seen I can tell so I'll spar a bit more stuff laughs my only only worry a bit well that was the thing with Anthony yard when he fought Kovalev he didn't spar at all so they say I mean that that's what they say when you're lying no I don't know because I hear the II was sparring but that's all they say so these I don't know like I couldn't I can do if I come in no sparring no I think when you when he watched when he fought Kovalev he was that concerned hear the movies fee mm-hmm Kovalev was just a couple of inches out a couple of smart with his job well that's clearly Cove low was the best fighter he's ever fought yeah it takes a while to understand like as a fighter that you know you know there's levels to the game but when you used to just put knuckles to face and putting people to sleep you just think I'm gonna put this guy to sleep too and when it doesn't work out okay I did that Ayodhya my first twenty eight pro fights unbeaten and my 529 I fought a Thai champion called the well and I dropped him in round two and for fucking easy this and he got up and fucked me up like worse and I have no place in blood and all sorts he absolutely battered me for free rounds and I'm like wow it's not like a difference what would you would he adjust it took me into clinch and our only 18 in he will I'm mid-twenties in first time I'd ever fought a Thai champion he took me in the clinch you could move an elbow you get fro me on floor you fucking knee me around back and my kidneys out pissing blood and stuff after and that's when I far after I know I'm right I need to go to Thailand and and fight all day fight training hour later and do what they do if I'm gonna have a bit because I can punch I can kick acne I need better do they're good at to get on their life what was it like going to Thailand um I loved it like this two years I were there for used to do is I got for six month come on from him for about six month come on for him also stay in Thailand for six months yeah yeah that's what I used to do and he were amazing have got some fucking ridiculous stories I created crazy shit used to stop or not I am there I remember one time I went back I've been this is a bit long-winded this one based a funny one I've been there about three days and some promoter came in gym and my coach Jerry I want you to go fight pro boxing in Cambodia said I've never fought pro ball because I'm not doing that pro boxing yeah I don't want to go to come word here you ain't no knows he's good money I mean no I'm not doing it came about the next day movies camera I said what you're doing is I'm not via said only need your pitch took you gotta go fight and yet he knew that I won't gonna say no he said listen he's doubled the money gonna get the Thai boxing you wanna go do it or not fuck you alright then so this the fighter in about ten days I've never fought any anything over the Muay Thai fighter in ten days I'll start doing a bit of work with the boxing coach in the gym but man this is like ties for you JT said you're not fit Trent I books in his harder you'll be fitter when you fight so he made me kick the pads neither part to do all my clinch in everything like that and so he made me do after that don't know me Thai boxing then I got to work with boxing coach he said you need to be fit so that's what the men we do but because before the fight I went right when we flying to Cambodia J he went I come what do you mean II went I want it to make it look like the flowing you in from England for that in their news and stuff so you're gonna have to go over Westerners I said yeah but none of these like elite level like cornermen or not what I'm going to do so I took my friend with me and we got there we got often it's a little propeller plane from Bangkok to Panama pen and the first thing that went in my head for they think a from from fuckin England on a propeller plane no it's gonna buy this I said yes I do all my fight in as well he said oh you don't have to lose weight could fire at 67 kilo at the time I'll find a one three five so he could buy at one for selling it off to lose weight to the guys rubbish dog worried got off the plane and all the news people were there with the news cameras and also I was fuckin happy this fucking rubbish what news news people they're looking looking pictures and everything got in the back of this pickup thing open the pay up for a big spread of him on the paper got to the weigh-in went to like what you do anyway I'm 67 went least the fights at 69 so it were at 1 5 4 not 1 4 7 this is fucking bullshit this the old thing is absolutely ridiculous first round I got absolutely buttered he was fucking massive he were well bigger than me round 2 of pin me on ropes and I just put my head down and I threw a fucking left Oh get him straight on chin he went down starfish I'm running around the ring jumping on the rope celebrating I'd must have been jumping around about 20 25 seconds I got off the rope and the count will only I'm free so the rest went free for waiting for him I get up and I picked him off the floor behind this arias I've got it all on video as well I'll put it on missile online no I'll put it online I'll send you it is serious I ran back out my pen Deamonte ropes drops him again the ref picked him up because he's no stop bleeding took him to his corner wipes his nose give him a drink restarted the round and the bell the bell rung but luckily it's only a six round fight I dropped him again in round 4 and again in round 6 so they'll know where they couldn't rob me at all I dropped him like four times in six rounds but still they still make it close probably well I'd like to go now I want to get fucking Lynch dear but yeah like really sharpen all time and all living in Thailand just like mad store if I promote coming June you want to fight tomorrow no next thing I'm fine when we hands rub him what the fuck's going on here like vampires got loads of crazy stories and might as well like it and I won't change any of it he's got me to where up where I am today the whole culture of fighting over there the fact that they get those kids to fight and you know they take them from their parents essentially when they're like five six years old and they spend most of their time in the gym and then they have their first fights when they're little tiny kids and then by the time they're 15 16 years old they might have a hundred fights well I I fought a fight called singdam and it were my hundred fight which is a big thing for a westerner and I said to him before the fight wow it's a hundred fights a lot for a West I know what you think of that I went out that one or 15 15 or 15 I don't stop and think about how crazy that is like how meet what what are you doing 25 times a year every week yeah I think tile kills everything don't know what is that tiger balm and liniment what is that liniment what is it doing someone actually told me over there like when it main ingredient city's aspirin awesome at Lila ah yes so great I never know that ever I don't know if it's true or not that's what someone told me I think there's an issue with people using that shit though in the clench because they use it on their body and you clench with you and they get it in your face people of put on the gloves and stuff and I rubbed it with Vaseline to the pouring it'll be Vaseline scoop it in the Ruby on the gloves and I've adapted for it's awful so fucked up that someone would do that did you complain about it yeah I was fighting corner grant I can't fucking see and Richard up to my coach you have to tell them ago over the corner and wipe his gloves down and then they did it at the end of every round and style everyone are wiped Heathcliff used to make sure all that but 100% put some on his plus 100% oh not about 55 by that time and I never ever on it before they're not I mean dirty people yeah that's so dirty the people cheat like that that that makes me so sick like that goes against everything that fighting is supposed to be about it's supposed to be about you're at your best they're at your best touch gloves I saw I was told when Georgia prazosin at ocean for non a sample pramik he's only that's the only loss is risky and oneth on and I heard that Giorgio told me that he was poisoned cause aerobics I'd bet on the on the file you gave him a drink and then he said he fell all dizzy and a lot in Thailand whenever there's a fight with a side bet so like the gyms so the gym I think petrosian's camp and boo cows come like a 20 grunts I'd bet or something like that right so whenever this big big bets I happens regular noise in it stuff I yeah what kind I don't know stuff that they make you feel really poorly now but sometimes he's like your stomach a nice - pew and fucking shitting everywhere and stuff flat but I've seen some times where the most of like overdose them in the fight has ended up getting taken hospital and being in a really bad way and stuff saw the fight just dead trying to get an advantage to win the bet but the fight and even ended up happening because of fucked I'm absorb us there's also fuck are your foot yeah looking after you kids on the island I lived I only go to Koh Samui only I got super Pro when I go over there and it's not really like that overnight it's not as I love the gambling culture though I love the fact that their Lily do you see all the guys in the background like passing money around and things yeah but I used to live there because I was fighting for money if I used to do is if I got shot money I'd bet on myself and I got told I'll fighting this guy would lost to previously before but I was so close to knocking him out I was 100% certain I was gonna be him and over to knock him out so I bet my entire wage about all the money I had everyone in the gym put loads of money or make a win as well and I've eaten the left looking around fries legs when I run it and finish him he bounced off the rope and need me and he didn't drop me a roll wait just hold me power just went and I'll try to finish him I went sat down and around free and Mike on when we fucking do him ie finish a me when I went out round for all my power had gone a lot around for which is the money round then are chasing the fighting around five no money why is round for the money round in Muay Thai in Thailand like round three and four are the big rounds round one and to lose to easing in and it's like basically scored as if it's a marathon not a sprint so even if you win round one and two if you lose round three or four you've lost the fight really yeah all my money everything that matters I get a purse or mail me over money that's fight again three days later cuz I'll find if I'm 180 days three days that's good Jayda put me on playing went down to Phuket and you're an easy a fight but I was still really banged up because he were to fight I just thought I notified three days just to get some morning when you have to fight three days after you fought do you train at all in between those fights cool now if I were injured I'll fucking have to go do it do not mean because I need in my theory for that I'll go on I'll read me one will go move money I had already talked her up a few times I think so yes why today look lay down on the islands in my Phuket where I went to fight this the fights are strong as in Bangkok so I would not fire knocked him out but still what is the difference dream fighters to train in Phuket and fighters too at the time it's in Bangkok they're all that make an effort their self on the elite level stadiums Roger diamond an Olympian at channel 7 um no these are that the elite of the league these are the guys who are gonna get scouted gonna stuff I won't championship we're gonna win titles and get money and become massive names in Phuket is just like the probably is fine for a bit of extra money just to know under to cap off the wages on my end of weeks like you get a lot of them who's gone over job and which might fight at the end of week or there a pod man would be a trainer in a gym the water a and although what bother doing all over them just holding putts all day and I figure I know I can get an extra 10,000 but probably about more $200 into tonight amounts guava fight for that 200 bucks something like that yeah so those who go do that they'll take a few shots and they'll probably fall down for Indian Bangkok where the elite finally that you know you're not gonna get any like you know people there just to like make a name for yourself especially in those stadiums it's a crazy place in the world Bangkok like you have to think where this one place where this one style of fighting became the most popular and it's used as gambling there's like if you think of the rest of the world there's no place where you go where people wrestle for money where everybody's gambling on wrestling right there's no place you know where people throwing money in the air for West guns illegal in Thailand only finger a lot about when he's fighting real yeah he's illegal you can only bet on finally back and fight in the stadiums Wow no I didn't know that the closest casino is on the border in Cambodia so if I don't want to come because you know they go to the border blares oh that makes my yeah but it's just they fucking figured something out that other people didn't figure out I mean what you think about the one part of the world it's an island they figured out about how to kick the legs better than anybody it's really crazy they figured out how to work the clench and needed a body better than anybody to dump people and help them as well yeah drop them sweep them more better than anybody touch the fing when you find the Thais when you that's why I had to go live where because you can't you can not clean tree one of them always been doing this into a five six years old even like the the tall fin no lien ties we've got that like wiry Stremme for still like some of the strongest people we look at him in military and think I'll fuck him up as well they're really nice natured people they seem so but you get him in that ring and you fucked has cinch I able to keep up this high level of skill and performance at forty years old how do you think I think he's I think he's awareness is better than everybody else's I think he's got a sense of awareness that I think special elite people have you know its distance in Georgio patrol so you know Floyd the ably just seems of this ingrained sort of congruence with the self you know he also is very agile in terms of his footwork yeah yeah don't you don't take no damage like so now he that's why he's fighting twice a mom still he's not getting her you don't really train much evil coming to him do a couple around them pods just to make sure he sharp was made on for a few rounds place yeah yeah or a few runs place pile we know she puts on right I'll do do you not mean just to make sure that I didn't try it out no no he does no no no no no really more no when he was in stadiums champion he was trained like no one I've ever seen did I mean but like no no obviously I the gym were we trained his berries so when I'm in Thailand still I I'm training alongside him so I see what he doesn't that that's what's even more impressive about it he'll come in two three rounds of pods or two three rounds placed by an ocean pods nothing strenuous no ice and see it'll only run a little bit before the fact to lose weight as well great sense of humor as well unease quite humorous and quite playful so he how was he able to get away with such little work because I even I think a lot of time like when he's fighting now he's not fine ties among fine Westerners and I think a lot of time but if these guys are fucking out see sunshine they're a bit starstruck before they even get in there I think a lot of time right that makes even when the prime putting on him he saw smart and like do anybody seen his awareness and his footwork and sophis all good he can move off Kiki Scotty lost her clinches then they may need to clinch a zoo people can grab an iam so that was only because what they used to do is make Thai sunshine way in five pounds lighter than them just so it be even for the band so that making like drop down to 130 and in his opponent would be 135 just so it'd be even on the baton because we put him off the same way and Sancho is fresh no one's gonna bet because you know if I couldn't win so they day I'd rated him to bring him down just so I beat other gamblers Blatt right he might be done for interesting about Sanchez Wells that like his his style so he's so light on his feet yeah you know and he doesn't kick full blast you know even when he's hitting the pads like hey hey it's like he's slapping the pads he's not fucking digging in you know like some guys digging and he's got that internal rotation as well it can just whip his leg over you know kinda conflation fake your leg kicking and what you're on a neck yeah yeah question mark kicks off the charts yeah and he also he does stuff like he'll he'll land head kicks at a really close distance by stepping off to the side remember that one time he was like a crazy head yeah yeah against the ropes and he steps off to the side and lands a like up and down just the the ability to land a high kick in that tight it's crazy they see South Pole footwork as well like you woman he's stood in front here the next he's done so many shifted off and then he's dead yes that's when that kicks gonna come off does he is he influencing younger Tie Fighters to fight more light on their feet and to have more movement because you know the Thai fighters it's so common to see guys like standing right in front of each other and exchanging techniques he's not doing any of that not many who can do it like him to be honest it was a special kind of fighter I've never seen anyone was caught the same style as him in Thailand a lot of the gyms in Thailand clinch gyms so they'll be doing more clinching than anything else and even for the ones who are similar to his style they're still nowhere near him to be honest I think it's one of those things always well where you if if you see someone like sunshine you try and mimic it a lot of cold she's put you off it you know like the stuff that lomachenko does you say to a culture an old-school boxing coach I want to start juggling I want to start standing on one leg I want to start doing the the short test all the numbers and they always they seems to like go out shit that you're doing that do you know I mean I think it's sometimes people are stifled from learning because of the way that their mindset is you know yeah I think that coaches always want you to fight the way they know how to teach you how to fight it's a rare talented coach that can see what you can do and move around it yeah you know isn't one of the interesting things to me in coaches is Duane Ludwig cuz Duane Ludwig teaches so different than he ever fought like he realized like at the end of his career like you know what the best way to fight is the best way to fight is like give your opponent so many different looks and overload their brain with possibilities switching stances to all these different and then he put it all down into a system yeah but if you go back to watch the way Dwayne fought Dwayne fought like real standard Dutch kickboxing style that was his style I felt a decade any felt Rahman duck oh yeah he did well Decker late in his career when Decker's ankles were completely shot and you know he's still still looked awesome well I don't want to teach anyone to fight like how I fight really I you gonna work well to what their advantages and see what's gonna work best for their style because everyone's got a different style I can implement parts of my style onto theirs but I won't want to like try and change it and like the are some gyms in England have all got like one generic style if you see a fighter you know the from that gym mm-hmm like a bad company where we train like we've all got all our top-level fighters are all different we've got someone was a box system was a clincher someone was a kicker someone was an idiot you know I mean it's like the oldest styles just totally different yeah that's what makes a good coach is well being able to to bring the hell of a fight and add bits of your style to theirs but mainly like let them flourish with their own style but you would also think like how many people can teach you how to fight like Sanchez yeah I mean how many people even can move like that oh man it does weird shit you know like he's got that sliding push kick that's like a side kick yeah that he does a lot too he's like he like throws it his front leg some rock come saying someone comes in got an elusive sort of loose style yeah and then he moved he said in news Olympic gold medalist one I think it was 1996 I think but he had that elusive style that had movement and stuff like that and then some up high a Quran who's known as the best I ever TIE fighter ever I think super loose yes super elusive moved ahead and stuff like that so yeah I think yeah I just think it's like you say though I think it's that you know it comes you know I'll the strictly are in Thailand fucking fight like that I don't do you think that the guy sends the guys Sanchez fighting now are just like a little lower level if the idea is like everybody knows he's a legend so you could pay him to fight someone rate very much they're paying for Sunshine's named I mean so not like pain to see a fight where it's gonna win this who's gonna bet no one's betting everyone knows what's gonna happen he's earned his stripes he's doing everything that not many people will ever do and that's where it nice looks like over Westerners and still trying to make a name for their self now yes say no I might be the one will be sunshine but unless them I mean was trying to account will kick Nolan if they get a cartwheel kick off its array of one no do you think that like has they gotten an offer to fight and something like 1 because 1 is not gonna let him fight a might have done but guys at the level that he's competing at right they would want him to fight yeah the only people won't have got signed illegal level there's no there's no easy ways or anything on there all the ties were science when we're all elite all the Westerners are the best best Westerners he might got an offer but to be fair he can fight twice um for any fight all over world and he still getting paid good money every time if I so I don't think it really matters to him to be honest even he's done all that already and for all them best guys and beat him all even with the weight disadvantage you mean pulldown and so I don't think he's really have to worry about so he's just right now just sort of getting paid and having fun yeah yeah wonder how much longer he could do it the world a lovely fight you know and if he and if he keeps himself in shape then is that people lose at leat lose when they came with him don't they you know I mean yeah he you know we're gonna make it right yeah is in here doing seminars for how long I think he just gone off to come and break on the day are looking on his Instagram L he's been taking off somewhere else today though so they've drove in a bus from the east coast to the west holy shit I think he's done about 20-25 seminars so far all over play oh my god he's obviously only ridiculous one of them I 100 people in stuff do not mean so oh wow he's earning my money that from other stuff so I don't need to be point yourself in no elite level against young hungry right alert eyes were gonna want heartbeat Sanjaya he's only stripes on this yeah yes yes yes yeah no he certainly has how good is his English it when I first the first time I fought him ten years ago I can't speak a word but obviously like in the gym he's at now in Thailand he can there's lots of Westerners come in there just because they're no eater so and he's doing more seminar so he's learned a lot more now you can have you can even go crack with him no you can have a laugh with him oh that's cool yeah he's a proper cool guy and he spends a lot of time with Spencer as well Spencer's a friend from Normandy yeah that you're Kyle company's a nice kid and they converse a lot guys follow him on Instagram do you think that like with what one is doing is kind of like the future of the sport because they're introducing elite-level muy Thai fighters to the a gigantic Asian audience 100% especially the way they've got the show us out as well we've got top-level MMA Tom level kickboxing top-level Thai the summer for everyone and he's still going out to these massive numbers so yeah I do I even have so grappling competitions yeah yeah yeah I knew that defy everything I love that they do they just do whatever the fuck they want you know they I mean they've got you know really interesting talent yeah he's been saying as well yo Chuck tree that they are we've got some TV deals and American stuff criminal intent so they're gonna try and bring it over this side as well and there could be like some rival taught us see in future hopefully well I certainly saw it was I remember what network it was but one of the more recent events was on television like I was flipping through the cable channels and said one Fc I was like what and it was a recent event it was like right after the event it happened and they were airing yeah well there you go then she's getting out there now because they've already got Asia locked down so if they can get into America and in Europe East and they're giving chances of a paper like from the Philippines and that is love yeah MMA fighters from the Philippines coming through and stuff like that no no but then guys are good as well yeah you'd never see it well then if we've wanted to give him a platform that's it yeah it's um it's cool I mean they're they're taking some of the top or you know top talent from glory as well a lot of those guys are going on some and some from Elias annachi it was with infusion who I work for he's just gone on so on and then one knocks out the tie who did he know how to um I said he'd do that one of these many trains with Sayid Elba doing the same coaches but Australians as well so how do you get kickboxing to be big in America why can't they figure that out um doesn't make any goddamn sense no I think in my I think because MMA I think it's I think because of the college wrestling I think it's stuck as well you know the box in America is always a great box there's no it's at boxing fights but I think it may be because of the college wrestling because it's more of what you used to college wrestling what do you mean well he wrestled on these wrestling's popular you know what I mean in colleges and stuff like that so I think they've kind of taught to that or maybe it's a new sport and they've grabbed onto it and it's they've kind of got it as theirs cuz I'm amazed really the UFC's like if what if won't go over ER though with the MMA and mix sure yeah and then if you're sat there waiting for MMA it come on but in between that you see some fucking crazy Thai fight with two people going out ain't 4-ounce clothes are in a proper war that might help if they did someone like that did not I mean then you got like the average Joes never seen it before thinking whoa what would that and I've never seen that before I like that so maybe someone like that like some mixtures with her like what one do that's why there's someone for everyone on themselves well muy Thai and kickboxing doesn't suck off in England either so it's got its got a lot better a lot of fun that it should be I mean yoko i mean your fight with her seen Bannu he's just crazy you know what I mean or one I see one championship fights you know we're all we're always glue to the soon as if it's on was strapped with our phones and watching it so it's a shame really hey Sam it's a bummer in America yeah you know Dana White had a really interesting point he said we got ruined in the 1980s with PKA karate yeah like these that PK karate and you know there was some guys are really exciting like Rick Rufus yeah but a lot of it was bullshit it was like boring kicks above the waist laughs yeah and they weren't that good they would just throw a couple kicks and then shitty boxing Steve superkick wick he was killed Wallace Wallace but it was some costly pick a quick well don't have any what happened in England oh we got we got some airtime on TV and I don't know it water with Joe's device the chose shit fights to put on a really no one's gonna be interested in watching them if you're gonna like get a spot you need to put out there like pre-recorded shores of the best fights and put them on just to get some interest yeah and then maybe people just start taking a bit more noise but we under like if you like plots on Sky Sports and the put shit face on yeah cuz there's so much great talent you got there then like whenever I watched glory I mean I stop and think I'm like how is this not enormous like there's so many boxing fights that are kind of boring yet true and then you watch this and like Jesus Christ is so much more exciting exactly and I got me a drone did I and even after that fight in Cambodia I had a date for six days I'm after that not only a six round fight that's why I fought and won that were boring I didn't like your head hit and ii got a take for six days I'm never doing this again because you're taking more shots to the hair yeah everybody's it any gloves and stuff it's all like mmm did did not do it for me at all I appreciate boxing I do love watching instead of poor Muay Thai and kickboxing is way better I say the reality is if any elite boxer decided to fight in elite Muay Thai fighter they're getting fucked up you have a couple seconds to close the distance Mike Tyson's time yeah and put that dude away garage get you like blocks you can you like blasted I mean I would like to see I would have loved to see a guy like Mike Tyson in his prime if they if there was a guy like Rico or some level kickboxer who could potentially fuck him up on the way in you know know someone like Rico's got good kicks and good knee so such a big guy as well it became no chance I don't think Mike Tyson comes close that day you never know well did you see when Mike Tyson and John Jones was messing about like play sort of sparring and you could see the right hand a ball money stick and also that's a 50 year old Mike Tyson yeah true yeah yeah it's just when he was young like when remember the Marvis Frazier fight yeah yeah that was like a raving demon then he was flop ex yeah just stepped in and just I was I was thinking like what if someone wasn't gonna leak kickboxer would you be able to hold that guy off like that one like that with the Mike Tyson in his prime when he was storming his way towards the title all true you'd have to clinch yeah yeah I am open elbow Nino is that quick fast and try and grab him that's coming over top but some guys did manage to make it to the final bell with them like there's some guys that managed to survive yet so nice okay yeah Tasha Smith yeah there's a few guys there was a few guys bobbled him as well you know that was a right under the knee just wobble Dipsy Smith as a powerful do yet it was yeah yeah cause he beat Frank Bruno they name is the first person to knock out Frank Bruno front Bruno's it will come another late then yeah Frank Bruno had the most preposterous body ever who's the original Anthony Josh yeah yeah yeah but Joshua's clearly a better fighter yeah who's definitely more talented but what did you think about that Andy Ruiz fight I can't believe it to be honest I I'd seen Ruiz fight Parker and they want like really exciting fighter also I didn't even watch it because I thought it was gonna be a whitewash and in boxing group that we talked about early and I seen what happened I don't like fucking I'll nowhere but I'm not sure what did someone want right there no II just didn't look comfortable from being on the first Bell at all even on his ring mark he didn't look comfortable just rule the the rumor was that he got in kaolin training yeah I already hurt his neck have you seen must I mean it's not makin excuses you've getting there he get be in that safe buddy and he's never said it but when you can see that the corners rubbing his neck and he's it's weird cuz Rob McCracken's trying to talk to him and he's just elsewhere yeah it seemed with this scene with it but you know props ooh Andy rui-zhi ya know and really look amazing but if he had been killed in training if that was the case then it kind of makes sense yeah but even before that though he dropped him around early robberies in round three round two or three and he's a good finisher yeah but didn't have a buddy when he went in the whole style of it was weird but the way he was boxing was weird he was like just it didn't I mean I'm not going to say any excuses for anyone you know what I mean buddy it just didn't look the same but the rematch will say all right yeah well we're just trying to me about Ruiz is how fluid his combinations inside watching odds after that and watching him train his stuff not like fucking hell he's an actually fucking real ID why didn't we look at fucking danger yeah his his efficiency with his punches like everything's so fluid and he throws high volumes drop em coming holler as well whereas Joshua's on the outside he's a one-two big shot yeah it's like Ruiz is you know he's it's a dangerous combination of two styles because if Ruiz gets in tight he's gonna land yeah you know he's gonna land and he's gonna land like a middleweight you know straight weird thing was when when he was in a picture with the belts it gave him Ruiz so old I thought was really weird workers it give these a picture worth is as a press conference from where London may be and they were loving it know it was it was New York wasn't it and they give Ruiz his belt so hot so hold like Joshua's yes and I didn't get that if you for the fuck yeah because lomachenko when he was a picture of Luke Campbell holding the WCB WBC belt the line he grew fucking doing that's mine yeah yeah but you already in his mind was like that's fucking mine it was straight I won't ever do it now how would it know exactly Luke looked like he was having fun with them low Michiko yeah they're being friendly with each other before the fight yeah Luke's a great guy man he's you know he did a great job but got a massive respect for him yeah he heard him with some body shots he really did they did you know and here with a long left hook mm-hmm but lomachenko just had just did it just in that was there that he was looking inside lomachenko I was watching it with my friend and I was saying you can see him looking inside the job he was a gap in Campbell Campbell's hands here and you could see him just dipping all the time you know looking for that gap and then get that and then start a knee through okay like watching L was watching him train is what see what I could see and he was throwing up body shot if your body shot and then he looping left and it was so fast it's interesting also he dropped him with the jab that's the same punch that kovalev drop yard where he stopped its top of it yeah it's kind of crazy I think he was more exhausted but I know maybe I did the damage did the Thomas what Ward used to do the damage without without Jeff Ward had one arm you know that's really crazy I couldn't believe it we were talking on the podcast leaves saying his shoulder was basically they have hanging on yeah you know about him I just watched the fight I watched the most is Koval of him and and Ward the both the fights but but I watch oh I've must have watched it about 15 times now he's whole gay Linares in lomachenko yeah Griffith has a fucking code fight Minogue a linearity is class absolute class act it's very good yeah and the thing about lomachenko with that's so interesting to me is that his father made him take four years off of boxing guest to concentrate on dance training down for his footwork it's like was it like what kind of insight did his father have that's the thing now that when I'm watching him I don't know where to look I don't know ever watch his feet or what are you doing it took the eva is really interesting to watch especially for like a pure wrist who was looking for yeah stuff like this i don't know where to look when I'm watching him and it's not what other interviews he can't interview is that you won't won't know he said I will speak after these careers finished I said I will talk well I mean yeah obviously has a winning formula I mean the guys the the in the shortest amount of time ever has won World titles in three different weight classes yeah means just for themselves ridiculous and you know there's I mean the the argument of who's best pound-for-pound is always an interesting argument it's in my eyes it's him there's Terence Crawford yeah there's a couple other guys that are in the running but those are the two big ones yeah would you agree yeah yeah I would to say Crawford a lot of chanko who six up there now with that because they because he unified the division and he's gone okay so that's a lighter division in terms of talent wise yeah I think I think Crawford's a great fire a man Daryl Spanish just yes that's gonna be the ring that since crowd especially I write fight porn porn actually yeah yeah if I support welcome to yeah yeah buffing spends body shots all over cuz cuz he gets closed poori yeah when he fired Mikey Garcia Garcia was just a little too small yeah you're a lot too small rail yeah it just really wasn't in wasn't in that way class and see Earl Spence is such a Earl is just such a powerful guy and big at that weight class middle a huge banger man hit so hard he's he's southpaw body shots as difficult a fall especially not long if Rosa he's got good such a good heavy job they can get that left body shot in so sweet is just such a good fighter him yeah he's got skill to I mean he's very skillful on top of having that great power in size and he's got so many good attributes the thing about Crawford though is his ability to switch dances yeah well stop if I offer talks and then just switch southpaw and just to stick to stop play it's almost like he's figuring you out he has Orthodox just trying to like you know I give you a different thing to get accustomed to and then all summer yep don't and that he's better as they've got power is from Eva stunts is good just as good because you know chances only to mean spare was the last guy who's really able to do that yes which stances as well and hacker wasn't really effective as an Orthodox it wasn't that as effective that's what they say that the loss of fight we Sugar Ray Leonard because he went off a docks to prove a point in the first six rounds but I think Leonard don't he's had him by them I didn't think he lost that fight I thought yeah I thought how he won that fight I'm a Sugar Ray Leonard fumble yeah are you yeah go to his Instagram yeah change your mind yeah I just just watch him in just the way that he slipped on the shots but only for Hudler in the way just glided about it's just so beautiful he there was a video he posted recently of him when he stopped Floyd Mayweather senior in like man you forget how good Sugar Ray was it was incredible yeah I BMO deny but my god his Instagram is hilarious he does load the most ridiculous workouts like you know he's older guy but is like you know we're working hard like I've seen him fucking download Dimebag not long ago as well and he's still faster than me yeah it does like ladder workouts like he's obviously an older guy yeah you could tell but you know I'm still active see I watched the other day I watched Meldrick Taylor and Shabbos you know the first one oh yeah class but did they fight twice yeah they fought twice and it was at welterweight and was the second one not something round I use he'd already lost sit to at 7:00 that first fight changed his life man it was such a beating now honey and the fact that he made it to that final round he's one of the worst examples ever of a guy being punched drunk if you listen to Meldrick Taylor talk it's so sad I mean you can't understand a word he's saying he and the funny thing was Leonard sat how to beat him how to beat chef as he said if he listens and not get involved in a fight and keeps it on the outside and keeps doing what he can do it win the fight and clearly because he's from Philly Oh apparently he liked to fight you like to scrap and then it was just it was tragic his story's tragic because I was ie was he was my idol at one time well Richard Steele was criticized heavily for stopping that fight with like two seconds to go but he was correct yeah the guy was done the thing is as well do became on the ropes this is the story is Meldrick was getting the count off off richard stay on if you look Meldrick looks to his right and and apparently Lou Dover was on the ropes shout in his name and he looked at him and then Richard Steele went but I mean one punches who lay or you know well it's it was one in his case just there's a referee have an obligation to recognize that this fighter can survive and if he does survive he's probably gonna win indecision who does he have an obligation or if he looks and he says the guy's done the guy's done done me I have seconds to go or two seconds I mean it's but for people watching that wanted Meldrick to win they're like fuck but four people wanted Chavez to win look when he dropped him I mean it looked like mal'chik was done yeah you know and then from that fight on he was never the same never again and then we fought Terry Norris that was horrific yeah smashed him full around the knee well Terry's another one like severely compromised now like you hear Terry talk now it's really hard to listen to him he was trained by a Abel Sanchez wasn't me yes yeah all in Norris and Sara know she had a brother called all in didn't I yes all the Orlan was a heavyweight you know he beat Leonard and I didn't like that I'm sorry noise speech Sugarland they fucked him up yeah beat him up yeah hey sugar I had no business being in there with him no but you know Terry took his knocks man I mean the the really big one well he had quite a few fights where he was hurt you know real bad but Julian Jackson one shot yeah when Julian Jackson Kalin Oh crazy power I mean thinking about golovkin don't they but Julian Johnson one show or golovkin hits hard but it's a volume king julian jackson would thump you one time in the face and your whole body if and I played you see when he knocks out then it's Milton you think it's we're left off banging as he's fall any girls look at the same time girls like to bang yeah hey girl off gonna break your tweet job first yeah all right does all that I own a break you down so early one shot they'll find him they'll come every year I come at you say to Brian Dober a friend from double dose woids i Brian chemicals a big bed all right sure that's the deepest ER can go looking out the window we never ever went to his restaurant where he goes to eople no that's so stocker and no weird that you doin a I'm away it guy have you find him when you're gonna do get a selfie I would just go you said to me you said to me we need to Joe said Andre Ward was coming on I said if he was going on the same side he said fuck you know I'll have to pick you up cuz you'll fail Andrew such a nice guy diamond well he's also one of the only guys ever to walk away at the top yeah undefeated Council does matter in the Olympics two weight classes cos I could get the same yeah cause argued to the same class ah he doesn't get his due night whatever no no he tells Nixon uh why do you think he doesn't get his due I have no idea to be honest because he'd be all big names there fair enough you everybody yeah a few of them at being a little bit past her sell-by said no one and yeah I mean I thought some massive wins you'd be whoever were put in front of him I don't know him I didn't trash talk ever did he know I mean when he beat Jeff Lacy I mean Jeff lacy was like the Tyson of this little ways yeah at the time because I used to my amateur club I stir with the same club as Robin Reed Robin read the WBC super-middleweight title and then he boxed Jeff Lacy got smashed I think it was in seven rounds and he said afterwards Calzada will beat him and then when he was at a me n it was just like I fought fucking all Carl's like he's gonna get smash table no he was he was it's an interesting situation because he's never discussed when you talk about greatest of all time best British a vault well oh yeah sure five six and uh it's worldwide he's not in the conversation I don't understand why what you're supposed to do he retired undefeated you think predominantly though it'd be boxed in England I think he only had two fights in the United States but he was on television II was scared to fly it apparently yeah that's for yeah you should see me out of sight easy yeah it scared of flying but apparently out of the other sports I college as well they used to work within Joe Cosley really before so I'd nothing to do with the flying no bucking the day you stuff a sports I probably one of the first guys to do that yeah possibly yeah I know Tyson did some hypnosis that he told about his spoke about as well oh yeah he did some hypnosis when he was a little kid yeah yeah well the way he would say that you don't exist just the task the task exists you step into that man and you you break his body down and you're like yeah like man when you teach that to a thirteen-year-old a tough okay that's never experienced any lots programming that that's a different thing altogether that it's a different thing it worked yes good did you see if saying you shaking your head like you don't like it as a good note i hypnotherapist she's quite AI some people can't fight I'm not gonna lie some people do come to me they say I want to do this and I know you know I know that it's it's not gonna I don't do it I don't work with everyone because I just think no you know maybe we should do something else you know what kind of new can't you know that what you're right what is the difference though I mean we all know when people can or can't I think it's not just with fighting I know it's with kind of everything difficult I think it's I think it's the thing where it's so glamorous to see someone like him he Celia Morrison he seems too much padding you see him but the actual physicality of the pain of the nerves of all the shit you have to go through I think that as men we want to be like you're fucking all blah blah blah but when you actually got to go through that there's a difference in there's this some your goal whatever people won't go in his mind or it through the pain and stuff like that and I think it's very difficult for people to actually comprehend men especially when they think that being a man is defined by that that's what my opinion is you know it wanting to be the you know that the soldier or everything is you know well it's also the people have physical limitations like well that's one of the reasons why Malignaggi so interesting to me because he's clearly got a physical limitation his body is not the most stout body he doesn't have the best frame he doesn't have you know it's not it doesn't have the best genetics he just doesn't it's never had that last knockout point Jeff no I mean even he doesn't look like an athlete uh you know he just he's just smartest fuck and figured it out you know whereas like yard Jesus Christ you look at him at the way and you're like that guy's a fighter he looks like an animal you know Canelo looks like an athlete well then Danny bill didn't did it honey bill didn't look like an athlete but you his fucking skill level wasn't insane so the other was that some guys that just aren't physically impressive looking like Shabazz knows never physically now isn't working but he break you down oh he was such a beautiful fighter to watch because his style this relentless fucking moved forward style ripped the body and he never gave you any air you didn't hear it was just I never did pots yeah I didn't even know how to hit the fucking speed bag really many pots they had him hit the speed bag once it was hilarious he was going the speed bag like this laughs like this is like no one's heads on a fucking swivel what's missing sparring hit the bags barn at the box never dig putts I only did pads when he went to Emanuel Steward and that was for the rematch against he lose to Frankie London Randall Randall yeah I watched that cuz I don't really smoke weed but I watch that stoned and I was watching acid why I don't know no why did you watch it stones me me mate we smear me mate we stole my father's he's under nose lion always fighting cuz it was before internet and all that sort of business and then when he got dropped what I did know is he got because she has got dropped with her right hand all the Mexicans jump up and go runs or the face went he know he's got a drop me mate when did he fucking then the rest is history well Randall had that timing man with that right hand you really knew how to time it yeah yeah and he just had his number and it was also the perfect storm of shabazz at the end of his rope in a long career like had a lot of wars and that style was so how many fights did he ever as well I think he went 87 on being there we didn't beat Pernell Whitaker even he didn't Pete when I Whitaker that time when no draw no it was thought it was painted yeah that was horseshit but now Whitaker was a special town yeah he was special we talked about awareness oh my god defensively he was just genius well that whole 1984 Olympic team like holy shit think about how good that team was Evander Holyfield Pernell Whitaker Meldrick Taylor mark Breeland Tyrell Biggs yeah I mean that what a what a talented group of people that came out of that Olympian crowd I never realized they were all on the same team like if they say that would say that it was an easier run for him because the Cubans didn't go to the Olympics that year but I mean even sold and beat him in the World Championships anyway but if you watch Taylor Meldrick Taylor he got in the world champ she gets dropped another scrap in that so they were sending him anyway he had none dogging him that oh yeah that dogged well he was so slick you know I mean that guy was as slick as they come hit by a fucking car I know that's what I saw sod I know you'd like a drink household so was he hammered I don't know but I did tear that he did like a drink but I II was I just I remember him watch him Harold brassiere and he swish I decide got round him and slapped him on the ass fuck you do the proper man who can fight properly and he's he was gay with so gifted man yeah there's only a few guys that were capable of humiliating you like he was him and Roy Roy was Smith Roy Jones when in his prime just keep his balance training well I still think against Vinny Pazienza it's the only round in Compu bucks history where the opponent didn't score a single punch which is insane and because he was fighting a world champion yeah but he was someone aggressive like that was gonna throw in as well god damn he was good time then he left topical Ryan poker he steps aside left uppercut and just finished I'm busy Vinny Pazienza was rock hard Nigel bands fighting again I know sorrow he's 80,000 years 55 it's really 554 yeah how is he doing who's he gonna fight um I've heard it's a key Oh Becca really Joe main palace remembering and because how old don't know don't know he's probably in the Jones knocks him out Denis Lill BK yeah back in the day yeah and you know another thing you box him as well Joe calls are gay is there any foot see if this footage of Nigel been training recently like I want to know what his body looks like 55 man he's in shape though I mean well you remember that fight with Gerald McClung way back in the day back when used to have the dreads yeah and that was that was like the defining fight where people realize like oh god a guy who's the elite of the elite like Jeremy Clements era fight of his reign - well that's why I got into hypnosis fruit for boxing and sport is because Nigel Benn after he fought gel on McClellan he said I'd like to thank Paul McKenna for hypnotizing me and like making me believe in myself yeah yeah I went to an EBE Nigel Benner said I got into the job the career that you that I do now through you so your influence well he certainly needed it in that right yeah yeah belief in himself I thought it got stopped in round one when he would fill out real when it's known complain no one know where to come land yeah it could have easily been co-opted McClellan was a murder he was murder is this day one back he posted this on his Instagram let's see oh shit he looks fucking great folks a colleague I really feel like shit man but the honor fingers County Tech it can eat Eckhart County hold his shot that that edge did not mean well he looks fucking great in like when you watch them throw punches you see Ricky Hatton on pots look at the speed man a 55 that's crazy they could punch out as well kkona but it's not pin them shorts which looks like need you to piss into this Cup sir [Laughter] someone who's on t RT yeah that's amazing man that really is another video of him let me see here so they're working on some combinations here but I mean it don't look bad at all like if someone told you that goes dirty yeah someone told you that guy was thirty you'd be buying it yeah I mean that it's crazy that he's able to maintain that speed it's got a son called Connor Bennett boxes as well is it well away he's on p55 is old oh man that's fucking old it's to be fighting another man like like that type of yeah the only thing that I would think is well one thing going forms that he did not fight for a long-ass time you know I want to see what he looks like without a shirt on - that sounded gay but that's not I'm just at purely as a person that analyzed but even back you buddy did you have to fight all these fights were crazy walls yeah so do you don't know about a long time off but do you ever recover from nice right and how much do you recover when you get hit him right back I mean he last fought I want to say 15 years ago how long has it been the last time he fought was against Steve Collins well I lost he lost why 20 years ago more than 20 years ago yeah fuck because he's been in it was in it got into he's overly into the church then him and his wife his name's a named Caroline he live in Australia actually used to be arrived at pi animal Danny buck in there it in his book and I says it he dama fight and then he'd go out on a Friday night and he won't come back until Monday he used to do DJ and her stuff lasso he were popping pills and doing all sorts out all weekend and he won't stop and still until the Primeau rang him and said right go find him ten weeks ya need to smoke 20 cigarettes a day I need to stop and go back in the camper straightaway but his hands are like that I've met him and a big picture with me hands are like that big he's massive his hands a huge that certainly helps yep what I'm seeing there that's so shocking is his speed yeah that at 55 he still got that kind of speed and eats what he wants he says don't be anything it is not a good diet he just he says I eat what I want what I feel like but he trains all the time my runs like ten miles a day in yeah well I'm interested yeah just got me going no kid not like I'm a little confused though when he says he eats what everyone he's not following a good diet like I would imagine that if you're gonna be at like Bernard Hopkins late in his career like he was an anomaly but you attributed it to his discipline yeah we know lived the life yes I don't like anyone else and yes aside I wonder I mean if Nigel's not doing that how the fuck is he able to I mean I mean you might be doing it now but what yeah and say he looked well and look if he's frightened for a fight camp yet he might do it now bought when I was winning at scene interview with are you fishing keep scary I'm not bothered you know eats what he wants honey it's fine you bank what got me there like what boxing that would have been one of the best fights I think I hated you back forever cuz I loved him as well hated him bags it was great far no he was a great fighter you know it's just it's so weird to see a guy come back at 55 it's so confusing I understand what for I mean fucking bored and obviously you can still crack yeah you know that's probably like I could figure I can do this yeah yeah though if I got to my agent I hit the pad fuck you know he's coming back yeah you can see the wheel spinning around who is like the oldest ever guy who came back in my time my fucking cousin Andy Houston he's got about ten comebacks but he's like four you need coming back again but I don't know what this taste it retired about five times how does he look it's for my part man you'll probably see me on Instagram he's the one who's always out in the pod for me and stuff so he's still in good shape because he's always training with me all the time but he's literally retired how many times five he's fucking insane honestly I love to send you all of his fights may have never seen not like I was in Japan with him in he fought against tirado knockdowns in a minute Draft same I was like yeah drops him again and and and and then it got back into the corner and he's I said you're right he went be false broke went jumps all the fights it now fuck it I'll kick him with it anyway geez they went out and then the next round there were five knockdowns in a minute and a half so Andy drop the kid twice running to finish him then got knocked down three times himself and lost did people with body shots only works on his counter left talking it works sweetener and he was a few and fucking words all they were again and again and again and he just got quite to the world too many tears yeah you saw the steep ADC fight steep mu church versus yes Daniel Cormier when was the last time you saw that many beautiful left hooks landed to the body and an enemy never Maggie's honored of Rayleigh and the way he was landing it was so clean yeah just but so short - you know he's no like wind-up and craziest it was just yeah yeah I'll follow I'll follow us when he already tie it as well just my friend was crying over that one I it was hard watched DC get beat up but this guy seems a good guy he's it yeah he's a great guy he's a beautiful person but for me there was also part of me that was very happy for Steve Bay because steep a was denied like they weren't even talking about him fighting again for the title he was the fucking most successful UFC heavyweight champion ever four times defended it over you know four victories in title fights won the fight against for be silver Dumke owed him in Brazil won the title then defending the title three times so we won four world championship bouts nobody had ever done that before in the heavyweight division because it's such a crazy division so easy to get knocked out and then he goes and loses and then no one's talking about a rematch like how are you not talking about a remit they were talking about him fighting Brock Lesnar's like I know there's a lot of money and Brock Lesnar fighting but cut the fucking right to the title yeah when this guy defended the title three times or else at thon he was the man and then he wasn't proved that that was the case and he comes back at beats DC in the rematch like so good for him to get that shot and in the capitalize on it and he's a greatest heavyweight of all time yeah one of my client alliance was just signed for us a chive Mills yeah not shy Mills is a cherry chai chai that big cloud away but you mean try Perry yes yeah chai perilous okay the kickbox one in yeah that's right he's a dangerous man yeah he's you know what he's such a sweet human being they said that by Eddie Alvarez Eddie Alvarez is great guy yeah yeah and I was so up here anyone is so happy because we did some work and I said to him watch rikki-tikki-tavi which is a story about a mongoose fight two snakes and it's a it's a metaphor so really cool matter for anyone to watch it on YouTube since 1975 cartoon it's a story by Rudyard Kipling and he's just lots of metaphors are so not going down certain areas cuz he states were like gonna kill this Mongoose long story people want to watch is good and I told him about that and then did some work with him and stuff like that and it's such a nice guy he's a great guy and you know him going over to one Fc was a gigantic deal you know you at former UFC champion in his problem heads over to one Fc after a win streak in the UFC but that Timothy nasty you can guy is no fucking joke yeah that they don't fuck around that guys straight-up murder he's a murderer I was super impressed with him yeah how many guys like that are out there that the general public maybe is not aware of but their elite world goes out there's a lot on that one roster as well yeah when I look I'm I think fucking hell that's what scary see about going over there yeah because you're going over there like if you're a guy from the UFC if you say literally if you're a Conor McGregor or someone like that and you're a world champion you're known throughout the land everybody knows you guess what they might have somebody over there that can fucking like it yeah new person there's so many of those badass Russians yep yeah he said that as well but he said all he's got is a third world guys got enough in lose you said but yeah but you've got first world experience so you got first world experience he hasn't and when he when he walked when he warned I was a super pro Samui in Thailand where I go training and I went it was about 11:00 at night and all the lightweights with lights come on you know what people a fighters are not looking out the doors I was like all right I was so happy you want because he's such a good guy he's a great guy and that style that he has like holy shit like it has ever been more blood and guts fight yeah you know and the fact that he was able to persevere against just engaging yeah and that fucking crazy war yeah holy shit yeah that kid is hilarious to watch Agee in the best way fuck that kid's violent yeah you gonna find McGregor then double the wreck please please God to fight please like that he's out they don't 1457 McGregor he put some underneath doubling 14 for December didn't a so I thought you know box I it I've gotten McGregor yeah that's gonna box I'm over Irish kid they've got beef with I thought yeah yeah yeah look he might get knocked the fuck out yeah no it's that would ruin everything I think I think a fight versus gate she would be the fight to make right there's two big fights to make in the lightweight division it's just engage vs Conor McGregor which is huge and then it's Norma gamera vs. Tony Ferguson that's the fucking fight that's number one if I had to give all my my blessings to the gods like for one I said yeah he's number one never Tony Ferguson please you know I not really versed in you know MMA sort of you know things that they do and stuff but even I use not educated in any way shape or form boys have been kick books Thai boxing and stuff watch that could be and I'm just out but fucking go wow when he got back to the corner Patsy Scott cigars I like to listen to what he's saying to him and he said I can't keep him off yes I can't get him off me you mean Johnny Ferguson no no it could be my pedis yeah Gaines Pettis no he didn't fight purpose no recently no Tony Ferguson fought Pettis and then could be for a Dustin Poirier which is not often is it boy well could be Plus fights and it called went back to the carny said I can't get him off me yeah he's just he's just like so far there's no fingers were the Ferguson fight those well I asked her out for now because surely I got many left in him doing more IDO surely car he only wants two more fights yeah there you go their name so I think the plan is Tony Ferguson and then George st. Pierre right that's big big big big big big yeah there you go I mean that's the biggest money of all time wait what if I you can get two fifty five one five five well I mean I'm sure I've read some on you know they didn't like a ma quick himself right down and I saw that before anyway yeah you looked in George's smart as fuck he's so intelligent yeah I remember being on here talking about how fast Ennis will change all his life and all these yeah if he thinks he can do it he can do it I mean he wouldn't even be considering you if he didn't and you know he's also training with Kevin Lee now Kevin Lee's up their training at 155 and you know he's decided to go back down to one he's a nice guy he's a great guy right can you work with him a little bit but he was he was bouncing around to find out where he was settling the most so I kept in contact say contacts with him just to keep not really do anything but just keep me eye on him URI how's it going you know you know just encouragement really a future with him but I think if you know if anything trips him up at all it's like he has this belief that he's the best and that belief doesn't get shaken by losses but it also to didn't seem like he makes the proper adjustments that's why I recommended he goes off raza hobby yeah I'm like listen man if there's ever a guy who could put think he could be a world champion I really do but I think for us a hobby is the guy to really hone his skills properly because who did he bring to the world title George st. Pierre yeah who does Kevin Lee fight like George Sierra yeah if there's one guy he fights like he's like you unpredictable weather the attacks gonna be striking a wrestling mixes it up beautifully who does that better than George hey Pierre nobody he's the best ever at it yeah Kevin Lee does that style he's left fights and Pierre he spent his last fight I would expect him just punch his lights out like la yeah how I did it really well this Bing had a bunch he had issues going into that fight he had a real problem with his ribs like he was in the bathroom about to shoot lidocaine into his rib cage or LA and he was gonna have his dog down my face time and he just decided like the problem was if he fucked up the injection he could attempt a punctured his lung okay if he punctures along he was like fuck and what am I doing here you know so he decided not to do it but he in the bathroom had his fucking and he talked about it how does dr. on FaceTime he was gonna like lidocaine his ribs so he decides not to do that and he also the reality is he had one eye is blind he can't see anything and George knew it so George stepped to that side and that's where he caught him with that left hook and blinds night yeah and then literally blunt yeah I mean look Bisping is as tough as a fucking human being has ever been yeah he is a warrior but by that time he got to that fight god damn that guy had been through the way you know through the ringer another one that deserves what he got put the hard work in and took his licks yeah and got that through mental toughness yeah he's as mentally tough as any fucking human because I think when he fought silver as well and that Nate didn't either jump in it oh yeah well cuz everyone fall out were done when is the next round yet there you go yeah I mean look silver walked away like it was a ko mm-hmm you know and that really it was a kind of a cheap shot because his mouthpiece was out and he was saying hey look you put my fucking mouthpiece I was separated and then so was like check this out don't catches them here you know and to come back like I did from that and still we won the fight as well yeah a little bit with him as well might miss been flying knees in MMA is like when one lands you know you're seeing guys land them now like the Maas Vidal fight with Ben aspirins are the best example of all time like god damn that age but in more tied that is so rare it's hard to let me clean my as well and I've tried myself quite a lot of times when I'm being fine he's our tool and a clean one to the face you see like the the Dutch what if anyone about earlier they've got it down because what they do is they unload with the hands make you cover tight right and then drive it straight from Italy guard and they they've great down to an art then but like for actual flying jumping one like right across the ring he's out to London we're told in London wanna back out yeah I did yeah there's just so in in MMA it's like you never know if a guy's gonna shoot and we had wrestlers that that desire to go and dive on your legs and then boom you get caught with that Marva Thomas Conlon versus the other remember watching your reaction don't fingers well but you know when you realize that he planned for that and then he actually set it up by moving to his right to force Ben to definitely lead with your left leg forward I mean he really went to that side and then came at him so Ben's instinct he couldn't avoid it yeah it's like that's his thing is to get a hold of you and like here it's right on I'm and then back he comes right up the middle just gotta go to volume and all this shit talking that went on before that fight that was it just a devastating loss yeah same time and he's coming back really quickly against Demian Maia guy and that's an interesting fight because Demian Maia is a fuck and strangler ko as well just go stop T without really wanna help do bad okay right so they have him fight just four months later it's like mmm brave yeah and maybe not I mean what if Demian Maia decides to stand up bang with them yeah I mean if anybody look Damien mind can take you out his hands no doubt about it and if anybody is capable of stuffing takedowns or reversing position as a grapple or Damien my is a spectacular grappler yeah that's us right shoulder I want it November the second Madison Square Garden is that on the card I don't think Demian Maia Ben Askren is on that card and I feel like it's on a December card should be till till versed yes Liam and Tacoma versus gasps that's a residential fire error over to five no tails going up that's it what are you five yeah we're at my last fight and I said to me you're fucking humongous we've been doing you man to come growing is he still young in a so he's still like feeling out yeah yeah yeah he spent you know I've got a lot of love for sale because I got love this when he said no amongst I would he he stood an old apart oh it's on the white network oh so this is the main event of the fight card yes oh okay interesting Singapore okay yeah and they do bomb body Tilden and he stood for an hour and a five him pictures talk with all the kids and it was wicked man it was brilliant with the people one in Ireland well when he got knocked out by Moscow dog that was shocking yeah and the way shot mastered all did it again he so is a fight IQ is so high he's so clever at figuring out that fight if he stops Diaz then there there can be nothing next except for the way it has to be I'm just very disturbed by this whole colby covington situation cuz I guess you know he just feel like they're giving him a shitty deal and then they're trying to set up someone else to fight Usman next and he's very upset first of all he's he's got a real grief a real grievance because they took his title away he won the interim title and they took it away because he wasn't willing to fight immediately afterwards he's like look I need time I've fought five rounds of fucking war yeah then he comes back and looks incredible against Robbie Lawler so like well surely now he's going to get the next title fight and they offered it to him but they offered it to him as a challenger with like challenger like hey I'm the fucking interim champion I have one loss in the UFC it was a loss early on in my career I fought injured and lost like this is this is I've proven myself he's also puts people fucking hate that guy right but that's a design I mean he's puts he puts asses in seats and he puts eyeballs on the screen yeah I want to see him lose I'll see him when it's just one of those other yes the other isn't like boy like for exactly I mean with Floyd did that's so smart his talk shit show you his money and everybody's like 24/7 would convince you that someone really shit might be 24/7 he's doing this and that well there's also these there was moments like Maidana when he clipped him at the end of that one round yeah maybe maybe my grant Mosley wobbled him a little Vianney as well but then when Maidana farm in the rematch he couldn't even come close and after that when Mosley what we'll do in round two without fight got to school for estefany I'm just taking just very just adjusted like that yeah third round just went out woke up to you know Mike Donna's apparently coming back yeah yeah let's go new I think you stopped and then he stopped together journey to fight and then he stops again when did he stop I don't know but I read that is training justify and then he stops he might Donna's it was room it wasn't training with a Massa called Robert Garcia yeah Robert Garcia Oxnard yes yeah yeah wasn't training with him it was training in Las Vegas somewhere so we're training because it knocks makes it look like it dropped loads away yeah but all that may have a money way under a postive all of his guns and cigars yeah living the dream but anybody'd lost Lord but then I read somewhere as well they'd stop the combat well well that kind of lifestyle when you only have like one chunk of money and it's just sitting there you're chewing through that yeah every day buying Rolexes and Cuban cigars and next thing you know like hey bro about 100 grand shit shit get me sweat suit yeah yeah I mean he's not too old though my Donna's probably 35 36 right now you guys Chino Maidana it's not it's from March it's not recent at all Oh real picture of minam Goh that's his last Instagram post yeah that's why right that's why I remember looking at that eye right after that the commodes don't want bones trying to recently uh American so that's it huh go to let me see what's going on before that March the long ass time we good let me see that that's what I want to see before that but I want to see him hit he looks thin there though that's that's Maidana looking so much better than he looked I mean a year ago he was fast yeah ridiculous like Bert Kreischer fat damn he looks good I don't know why the comebacks been well who knows man who knows it's hard it's I mean when you're out for so long to decide you're a warrior again and you're you know back to being a rational athlete again like the commitment is so significant yeah that go before that it's not that one that right there look at that fat face yeah look at that face he's so fat that's a fat face he's odd you know when you if I'd like to a free week off after a tough fight yeah in that first couple of week back getting self back into eating clean in the gym everyday a game back in a routine urban laughs whoo that that your cursor is on right now look at that that's what he's doing yeah pimping smoking cigars drinkin yeah but I mean how much money did he make enough Lloyd fights million yeah baby talking people demanded a second one yeah he demanded the second one but you know when he beat Barona down though that was good good how many people went yeah that guy is so it's it's so interesting because he had so much potential but for whatever reason he's just like stepped on his deck sometimes you drop down here yeah well we got pretty goddamn slam you got close but what is he doing now it doesn't say that stacks of cash cheesesteaks having a good fucking time but yeah that would great when he when he brought her in that fire and Branagh go round back women fucking didn't done behind in anything after he knocked him down as well yeah later on as well well Broner should have been a superstar yeah but this whole like flashy lifestyle choices they made as well those made us all there dude but shit like fighting industry and middle at Las Vegas strip and still thinking no one's gonna see him he's too much too soon as well I think you get that much money you've still got that immature sort of mindset that it's not really around certain you know that are so talented but there's no one around them - I really don't look no one they don't get looked after or they don't listen so who's looking after them yeah you know he says Shamy okay some parts of it is a shame you know what I mean he said and yet slow fee he's gonna have very quick feet well I think that was his style was that father dead shell style was Pacquiao beat him up Donnie well how crazy after the Pacquiao fight he was trying to say that he got robbed ridiculous if his corner was saying he was it you saying it you got it in the back yeah he's about a terrible corner what do you think that was I don't know because I get that won't close it might be my opinion maybe somebody poison them enjoy Vinny what is like when you've worked with so many different people and there's so many different psychological issues that fighters deal with what do you think is like one of the primary causes one of the primary things that the psychological missteps that fighters make that you maybe could help them correct things from the past I think I think it's it's down to what goes on in our lives before they may become fighters yeah yeah how so um because I don't think you can have only relationship with anxiety unless something's triggered it from the past hmm so I like to go deep than just just the surface I'd like to go back and sorts of about the childhood and stuff like that seems to work but I think is my job Joe it's it's so interesting because everyone's different you know these you know ones got the same DNA or the same fingerprints and everybody's different to work with so to say one thing could be very difficult it's just about keeping them where they are completely at one with the cells or the understand ourselves you know I mean and not go down certain avenues of getting carried away civil example that he told me that we've want before one of his fights in Mexico City I think it was it was like he just praying or he was that nervous it was praying it just I want a girl to sleep because his mind was so fucking overactive and you know and it's things like that I'm that's now working with Cody no love Cody cabron mm-hmm and all that all so different they're all so talented and brilliant at what they do but he's also different Easy's that's just a nail it down to one thing to be difficult but many times it's memories of failure yeah reminder because in the unconscious this is my belief and people might argue with it but I I think that you have to offer a certain connection with something else in the past to get yourself a reference it's like I believe that anxiety is something from the past thought about now projected into the future mmm you know sorry she acted into the future as a zoomit Lee who you are finds you I'm projecting the future as in you're gonna believe you're gonna lose are you gonna do this so what we've done now is just leave it on so what we've both been doing is I've got a new thing called a shaman solution where people can go or interactive website where they can go on videos and it's like quite a lot of videos of difference what's the URL the shaman solution.com yeah it's not out yet so be out released when this comes out let me know so I could send people there but yes please the idea behind it is you can't just do it in one session right you need a bunch of it's like mental training that's what pisses me off about fires yeah they get constantly two weeks before Oh mijo a new don't blah blah blah blah you know and are on the fact day my work with Molly makan about two fights recently she went on but he was I had to stop Starbucks from he kids and the thing you get face time and say blah blah blah but I have worked with Molly anyway well people hire me after they lose hire me before you lose so you can she can you know get the best out your training and stuff but that thing that's the nature of the job I think it makes you question yourself when you lose right so but that can be great yeah it's great for me but I mean no I mean even for them yeah it can be great to lose because it can give you a wake-up call yeah and so many fighters have done their best work after they've lost and made adjustments yes JD Mouse is a great example true when Mighty Mouse well he beat ian mccall but honestly that is a real questionable decision Ian was beating the fuck out of them Ian had his back and he's pounded him in the head I mean it was definitely his worst performance or one of his worst performances and then from then on Mighty Mouse and Matt Hume had a conversation like hey you can't just fucking half-ass this anymore yeah you got to be all in yeah and he became all in and then became the best - yeah I mean if he looked great as well he's amazing he's amazing but he got tested in that first fight yeah by a guy that no one in America again that they're all over that hallway in them guys well they're always like waiting right like all these people look you think about how talent arises right when you get to be an Anderson Silva when you step into the UFC and fight Rich Franklin he's the champion a lot of people didn't know Anderson what Silva was unless you'd followed him outside the US and you go holy fucking shit is this guy good this could be crazy if you saw his cage Wars fights like oh my god like he was incredible if you saw his fights in Pride you're like Jesus Christ I tried five seeds he was amazing yeah I mean Anderson before he got to the UFC I was letting everybody know bet the house on this guy because this is he's on a completely different level but there's a million of those kinds of you know there's so many of those guys out there in these other countries that no one's seen they don't get any press but they've been lighting people up in these amateur competitions and small in a small circuit and then wait for that chance just like a Timothy not seokhun people didn't know yeah yeah yeah you see that guy like Jesus Christ I like that guy against a lot of people yeah he's fucking dangerous dangerous yeah it doesn't play guy yeah you know and that's also the thing about the no weight cuts at one Fc that makes it very interesting yeah that was fucking odd that like the first time I did ever did it at my first fight for one I fought way out me way class I got called in eight days noise and I took a fight at like won 5-4 which and I never fired what are you weighing America so I'm probably about 160 but when I'm training like even not in fight camp out I'm walking around about one five five one five six so I'm a fighter and you will fight one five four what kind of hydration tests do they give you guys so make sure that you're not cutting away so on a if we fight on this at day on the first day on the Wednesday got weighing on the scales just so they can see what way to I was not meaning on it on anything but on the first day I can have your fur with first weight check you have to weigh in on where hydrated because the obviously the pitch test you in light so waiting bang on weight and hydrated if you fail ever then you're gonna have to do it again on the day of the fight so basically you can have to weigh in three times if you do it correctly when you do it again on the Friday waiting hydrated on weight and then on the side that you could then you can pour you a back on our way if you're gonna do and fight do they test your body to make sure that you're not cutting any water no they just make sure that like just check your pace basically just put like a little finger needs to check out hydrated oh if you don't forgive you're under 250 you're good and if you know the 250s to fail interesting so they'll know that you're dehydrated yeah so your weight is not representative of your actual weight of your healthy yeah yeah basically yes so by making you do it several times they're saying like this we know what you are yeah and you're not gonna like go away in an important 25 5 pounds all right and be a giant the next day you know I mean so he's gonna be both gonna be same size yeah and that's nice nice he do that why doesn't everybody do not know it's the grossest thing in fighting is the wake up yeah because it puts guys through horrendous internal damage be a kidney damage the way they MMA guys do it as well like I caught me now but I'm walking around I've only been a little bit 7 8 pounds like less you know they're they're losing 20 pounds like in a week - no flies crazy both grappling it's such a giant advantage yeah exactly you're gonna lay on someone and so big such a huge advantage if you can actually regain your strength and because of the real experts like george lockhart guys are really good at getting eyes and rehydrated and weighing you in sucking all that water out of your body and then putting it back to science wrangling really it really is and if you understand that science mmm but it's just to me it's the most heartbreaking part of MMA so watch those guys like their faces because time don't scale to fly again lifted on the scales I've been like that before in face and I falta myself fuckin I never want to do ever again and ravaged aya and let them be a bit little bit bigger than me but now if I finished my career we won't ever see I never have to worry about that again that's great I just think that's the smartest way to go I really wish everybody would do that I mean I think it's legal cheating yes yes cheating okay if yes like you say if you've got like someone who's lost 5 pounds and it's so much lost 20 pounds in the next day the point four pounds on which is crazy Vinny are you seeing a rise in people that take this mental training seriously and take things like mindset training seriously yeah yeah and in different sports as well yeah because of thank you for having us on air because it does get a lot of attention doesn't it so thank you for that my pleasure thank you brother and thank you for hypnotizing me no I know it's real yeah you know what that's of what worst most nerve-racking atma therapy I've ever done in my fucking life why well imagine it if I named it sighs you didn't work I don't say it for two hours going I was shit it was respect and I treated it with full attention and I didn't go into it skeptically I'm going to do it with an open mind you know and it's real it's like there's it's I tried to explain the state of mind you achieve when you're hypnotized it's very hard to describe you know without experiencing it because it's different than any other state of mind that I've ever had but you are awake that's the other thing that weird spell out they think oh you're in another what you're in dreamland he's gonna take your pass it's not a power over either no and I'm carrying on continuing to learn more I'm learning quantum linguistics and time space matter and energy we call eMac I use an amazing guy with linguistics I train with Bob burns I went down to Scotland when you save linguistics you mean by using special yeah well this is the way words in combination yeah and listening to our peoples language puns are a lot of hypnotherapist now on my Instagram and stuff whether I like sleep Hey look at me and blah blah blah and you're out and I don't like that I can do that but itís more subtle ways of doing it and and I've been working with different people Bob burns okay but what do you mean when you're saying linguistics you mean like people using this negative language and language that to try and get them out of the model of the world so insight to try and move them through their model of the world or their understanding of what they think their problem is so once you think about a problem and then you when they've got a problem and if you linguistically guide them when they go bats away it's not the same when you keep saying linguistically like give me an example like what words I'm so like using like inside a problem outside of your control when you're above it instead of feeling like it's on top of you anymore and it's a it's a so I'm not completely all fait with it yet because I'm still learning advanced linguistic for them and it just you can see the changes in people that they starts a question or consider it and I think a lot of hypnotherapists don't listen I listen intently anything doesn't make sense I mean you do and your your work you have to listen to people and to get what the comment where they're coming from and then ask them questions when you start questioning the belief of what the problem is it changes hmm interesting what what did you experience when you first started doing it well I did it after I'd lost a fight which we were all about earlier and if I were a bit skeptical but I knew Vinny did it and we were good at his job well I've always fought like well I'm much Krong in my own mind I don't have a mean anything like this but then when I were having the rematch with a guy who just beat me and not only beat me smashed me a fucking pieces your first time that never happened and you'll get brought to England and we're fighting him on the biggest stadiums and England in front of everyone so I thought why not go use Vinny and try met my mind as strong as my body's gonna wear can't ever be over-prepared so far I'll just cry and do both what was the different like what was the adjustment so I trained as hard as I always do our trend the same for every fibre I went to see Vinnie and we did we talked about and the last one it will be instilled some chord words into my head like one of them was warrior and my coach and a few over saying that on the corner and Vinnie a comment saying at the time and I remember him saying in round two I heard him I was outside the ring he went Harley Morrison's a warrior and I remember enough flat just like triggering I didn't he stopped me in the first fight he smashed my legs to pieces he hurt me every time he hit me in the second fight I didn't get hurt once he were like I was in a bit of a trance there really because my concentration levels were just like through the roof and everything just worked perfectly for that that fight he was old weird to work to explain how many words but it did clear we did some work recently as well because he felt like he was having a dip in he's and he's whatever way he was thinking so we did some work recently and even said the other day that he's regaining his best performances now cuz you can you can forget it and you know and well mindset is so important to anything that's difficult like you you go into it with like a wishy-washy mindset and you're not gonna have your ultimate performance that the best performance for me yeah yeah you know that's all about where he's going where he's going and not say a body can scream his Instagram is so fucking important for people because you realize that like he's he's saying these gems of wisdom but he's actually doing it yeah you know he's doing it he's not just some there's a lot of these motivational speaker guys out there that can go fuck themselves because all they're doing is like giving you motivational speaking but they're not doing an easel that doing it illuminate infrared camera a fucking class on it yeah I mean he's telling you stories about like mental toughness while he's running there's something undeniably effective about that he's bad in some idiot you stood on the stage say no we'll do this this and this and this will happen and he's there doing it for me ace his evidence yeah yeah people need evidence book is excellent man that I'm the audiobooks good as well fuck the audiobooks even better than it is because you get to hear him talking about each individual chapter like on these real stories in between the chapters like the book is great the audiobook is better remember I'm watching him see 1000 but it's just important to know that there are people like that out there that are gonna take it to the top level of human physical potential you know and that's what he's doing and that's there's a lot of those guys out there like my friend cam Haines like the Courtney do altar there's people that can do shit that like you have this idea of like physical limitations everybody does the lead ways don't they mean roger bannister that it didn't a four-minute mile and then everyone else started it off yeah but what I like about this show and like about you is you you give people understandings of things that you wouldn't really look into like David Sinclair Matthew Walker you know these people that give us information and that is invaluable money so it was into everybody else well - me too man I'm very fortunate that I have this platform these guys are willing to come and tell us about these things because it's just you could learn so much that just was not available to us when we were kids it
