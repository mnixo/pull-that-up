hello freak bitches now I recently that you know these the you know people that want to to fight and then he got lost me fight and blah blah blah and then you find out what they did onto the run op or what did you do oh drunk but two weeks before well hello what fucking surprise you know if you're not living it and if you're not you know get any you know you know really immersing yourself and in every way in the language that you speak to yourself and in the way that you do everything else what you expect your minds not going to support you if you don't support it yeah that was one of the things that I felt when Jon Jones tested positive for cocaine three weeks out of his fight with Daniel Cormier I was like woo like he's not even right look I only was anything wrong with doing I don't know if there's anything wrong with doing cocaine I just I don't think it's a positive drug but some people enjoy it some people enjoy drinking I enjoy drinking I don't think that's a positive drug necessarily either so I don't know because I don't have experience with cocaine but that's not something you're supposed to be doing three weeks outside of a world title fight with one of the best wrestlers in the sport one of the most difficult challenges you've ever faced in your professional career and you're all doing blow just 21 days before that's crazy yeah sometimes the most talented take the gifts that they've been given and just abused them in a way I met John Jonesy's he's different to say the least and what were just he was no he was it was kind of I only met him briefly I was it I made me Russia at the legend there's a show there and yeah he was just he was very sort of it was all over the place bouncing around and just just didn't expect him to be like that expect and what do you mean by all over the place bouncing I just he just said to me hi blue eyes I was like Hello he's my safe from dangerous and I'm not I was like hi I just found it a bit strange maybe I've raged around with you I just found him different let's just say that I just found him different and I I'm trying to read into this I find I'm trying to avoid it badly no I don't know him bunning what I met it was it was different let's put it that way you know but um if if they if someone I don't know you know what's going on in his life yeah you know you don't know what's gone in his life and you could say that about everyone it could say that about a serial killer couldn't yeah well we don't know what's good in his life it's nice full you know really I mean there is some things that you shouldn't do you know you shouldn't be doing it but these reason if you listen to John's coaches they will tell you that John surrounds himself with the wrong people and John is an extremely talented guy amazing like maybe one of the most talented guys to ever compete in the sport and incredibly strong mentally to because despite all of his issues with maybe not preparing as well as you could when the chips are down that guy gets through things he overcomes adversity he's not a front-runner he's the one that broke his toe isn't hey that was horrific so he's coming and he didn't even realize that was happening that that happened actually in the final flurry where he stopped Chael Sonnen a more impressive performance is when he fought Vitor Belfort feet or completely hyper-extended his arm and he would not tap you know it was for his title Vitor came that close was it for the title I believe it was it might have been non-title fight but Vitor came find out that was a title fighter non-title fight either way Vitor came that close to legitimately beating yeah John Jones that close got a lot full e locked in an armbar that would have made 90% of the professional fighters in the world tap well that's what makes him who he is yeah but he but then he couldn't say no to it was a yeah Jamie just he couldn't say no to some blow well we could say no what didn't want some sort of I don't know if it's weakness I don't know there's some sort of weakness but is it whether it is or it's not you should be something you should be doing it's a but it's also indulgence it's like he likes to party you know but then there's isn't there also the issue that fighters in particular especially guys that have a lot of hard gym sessions a lot of hard fights they have impulse control problems yeah and those impulse control problems I'm not a scientist or a doctor but when you talk to neurologists and neuroscientists they will tell you that there are direct correlations between head impacts and poor impulse control all right it is absolutely a direct impact and I you know not looking for a scapegoat in my own life but I've looked back at some of the poor decision-making that I've done in my life particularly in my fighting times like back then and I was like a wonderful lot of that was getting hit in the head a lot like like it can't be good yeah to get kicked in the head it's just never good not the best not good and so if you've been kicked in the head or punched in the face or whatever you know any kind of impact and that's the thing about football players are saying now is it even a shot to the chest even getting tackled like someone Rams at you and slams their shoulders into your chest the brain gets jostle de round you might not have a bruise on your face but your brain is receiving essentially the same impact as a punch yeah especially the safe yes you know it's a shame you know a lot of people might not like this but it is a shame that Jon Jones has gone like that do you mean cuz he's got a lot back on him yeah you know me he's got a look back on him and think the fuck you know he's also got to figure out what it is that he took no they don't even exactly they haven't isolated what he took but the whole lifestyle it's it's certainly an issue and it's almost like one of those things where you say you don't know what you got until it's gone well it was kind of gone for a little while but not really he was always still in the mix and there was always multi-million dollar fights of waiting and then he fought ovince st. Preux so he's back in the mix and everything's looking good he's slated to fight at UFC 200 against Daniel Cormier he's gonna make like 10 million bucks it's gonna be giant and then whoosh it's gone for something that if you talk to people that are experts in performance-enhancing drugs they'll tell you that this clomiphene is what he got popped for which is an anti estrogen supplement that's not even beneficial the only time that stuff's beneficial is the scent of essentially when you're coming off of steroids but yet he didn't test positive for steroids before or after so it could have been a tainted supplement it could have been a mistake it could have been who knows what wacky shit he was taking I mean I don't know I just think that you know people forget that they like that sometimes you've still gotta have guidance mm-hmm you know you've still gotta love a guide and you know to just say look it's not the best thing you should be doing or someone to talk so you know what I mean it's that that's not gonna be high-fiving you because you're gonna you know stick a lot of bugle up you knows isn't it harder though I think for champions because once they like dominate someone to kick someone's ass like say if you fight the the most difficult fight of your career you fight you know whether it's Daniel Cormier whoever it is you dominate them you win in a beautiful fashion and then you know you like goddamn it I am the fucking man yeah and then you just want to do whatever you want to do after that and it's indulgence and chaos and yeah you did this but it comes to bite you on the ass yeah all the time
