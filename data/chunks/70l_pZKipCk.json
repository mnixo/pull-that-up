the gyro can experience a gal that I was dating once said to me never trust a girl doesn't have any girlfriends and I said why do you say that and she goes because okay every girl knows that guys want to fuck them right and I go yeah and I go and the girls don't want to fuck you right and she goes yeah she goes well how come they don't like you the girls don't like that girl she doesn't have any girlfriends so is one or two things have happened either you just moved into town are you fucked everybody's boyfriend shit and I just looked at I'm like this bitch is too smart from I'm 18 at least 18 percent more chimpanzee than dude try to fuck you may kiss you on the cheek mwah and then the chick mom don't hit me I gotta go short series to Joe Rogan's defining moments serious knowledge on me she dropped some serious knowledge on me just she looked me in the eyes when she said it to was so I could really strong move she goes don't ever trust a girl who doesn't have any girlfriends and I remember I mean I've seen him because III remember saying to I go I was like cocky cuz I was like 24 when she said this and I was like why what the fuck you say you know we're gonna go you know some girls are assholes and and then I just you know when she after she said that she's like the girls know who you are they know who you are I just went wow I can't even argue with you the only equivalent I have to that and I hate to use his name twice in one podcast Anthony Bourdain Patrice it was beautiful Maurice said to me one night I was talking to his black dude and we're sitting in the baguette in below the boston comedy club we're sitting down there's a bench in the corner by the window and we're sitting talking we're sitting talking he's watching me the whole time and I'd just recently tried to grow a beard for the first time and we get up the guy gets up and he moves patrice sits down next to me just the fuck you doing talking to him I said what you don't ever talk to a black man that doesn't that facial hair let's just have to do it then he goes man fuck you Eddie black man black man around every black dude I knew it was like the greatest little fuckin but meanwhile Patrice didn't even believe that he was only saying that because it was the funny thing to say at the same time he goes beautiful you gotta learn how to trim your lip cuz I I was white guys will let the hair grow into their lip and black guys don't do that it's up on the lip but yeah these people one of the weird things about psychedelics is people always even if it was one of the most profound experiences ever and all the most amazing experiences ever people will tell you yeah but it was just your mind playing tricks on you like it doesn't matter and you can go OK but it's whether it was whether I really did travel to another dimension and communicate with infinite beings that were made out of love and understanding who told me the secret to life is positive energy and positive if I even if it was just my imagination I still experienced it I experienced it as if it was real so whether it was real or whether it wasn't real I got the exact same result something happened that was unbelievably incredible it took me to some place that was infinitely beautiful and then something happened to me I knew that happen or it didn't happen well definitely happened it doesn't matter if it was imaginary it doesn't matter if it was only inside my head the whole world comes out of the inside of your head the when we were kids I remember when I was a kid they would say like oh he's got such an imagination this one I was talking about kids are liars you know that's how people treated the imagination the kids were just fibbers you know because that's imagination to some people you know some people they didn't think it was something to be encouraged but it's really where everything comes from and that's the weirdest thing about it is the imagination conjures up an idea which becomes a laptop it conjures up an idea which becomes an airplane it all comes from the imagination whether it's artistic whether it's a saw whether it's a joke that's it's the weirdest thing ever it's and everybody wants to pretend that it's so normal it's so normally just thinking shit up out of the middle of fucking nowhere and creating nuclear power you know what did you do you sat down and you wrote some stuff on some a pad and then you figured it out where's this all coming from where's the idea to even do that coming from where's the idea that some some guy wants to be like a fucking bird and put wings on and figure out how to fly and he eventually figures it out now we just travel all over the world we don't think anything of it I mean the imagination is crazy the imagination has done some amazing things for human beings in this world and yet we still don't give her the credit it deserves it's a kind of shocking you know imagination is like the most underrated thing of all time and yet it's the foundation of our advancement in evolution are you hopeful about things when you see like Arab Spring people are rising up and trying to remove dictators and what happened in Egypt getting rid of Mubarak and I am hopeful and I think it's I think it is happening all over the world and I think the Internet has played a part with it and it's happening in America it you know I I come here as a foreigner I'm British I come to I come to America often I have family here in America I feel very closely connected with America and America is a paradox you know it's a huge paradox because on the world stage America is a very dark and malignant force which which does tremendous harm consistently and has done for it for a long time but at the individual level there's a tremendous spirit of awakening in America look just what's happening with cannabis laws in America in the last in the last 10 years that's unimaginable in Britain we can't make changes like that why because we don't have this spirit of Independence we don't have the structure where individual states can make decisions on key issues like that mm-hm and and of course in America there's a conflict between state law and federal law you know the federal government is not always respecting state laws and is seeking to persecute people who are who are using cannabis but you know I think that that in itself the fact that a number of states have decriminalized or even legalized cannabis is a sign of a sea change that is underway at the moment and what it reflects is an awakening of the American people so even though you know huge negative forces are still at work and are still sitting in the seat of power I think I think there's a tremendous hope for the future in America and that comes from the the awakening to consciousness of the American people and maybe it's small right now but it's growing and in that sense far more than any other I believe America is leading the world that there is this this possibility for awakening here maybe it goes back to the you know to the founding fathers and the Frontier Days and just that the sense that that people should be able to make decisions about their own lives without government telling them what to do that's the step we all need to take we need to move ahead we need to set aside our commitment to these large monolithic religions we need to set aside our commitment to large monolithic States we need to run our own lives and make decisions for ourselves and it just happens that that is very close to the heart of what America is all about
