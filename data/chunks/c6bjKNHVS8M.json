again out of Orange County the fucking Road War II and when they killed everybody they'll be fuckin crazy you don't want to be here you want to be in the mountains Montana yeah now you taught him in Colorado and he was too many fucking mumbles okay fucking money came into faith fucking money and bought the hillbillies out the real motherfuckers that you need lived in case you've gotta go like Woody Creek to find those people right you gotta go Woody Creek is that's still fuckin amateurs to really bunch of fucking booze is up there you really you got to go deep deep in the mountains of Gunnison and shit like that you find those Chris Anderson Gunnison Brian you got your volume on we're echoing godless Gunderson Gutterson where's that that's down south what do you think about all that shit about the Denver Airport do you know anything about the conspiracy behind the Denver Airport is it the Denver Airport first of all they moved way more dirt than needed to and so this is all this thought that there's some sort of subterranean tunnels tunnel system it's all based on the end of the world oh the shelters they fucked up Stapleton Airport was a brilliant that what it was like Burbank you could smuggle a fucking dead fucking kilo kokkonen nobody said money and all of a sudden they came up with a bright idea let's fucking make an airport 90 miles farther out by Kansas so when it snows we really get fucking buried we have no protection that's a bunch of cowboys bro making decisions and then trust me they're too stupid to even know what conspiracy theory is the hell the waybill the people that built it maybe but if the government was really truly behind it like all these people think what it is is that they made an airport there but in constructing the airport they also built some sort of underground safeguard threat strongest there so there's got to be some kinky yeah well you know if it's close I mean that would be a move right Nora Hills an airport and then build some shelters I mean that airport is like fucking Kansas when you go to Kansas doing dikkop that's what they call it the it place it was easy man when I lived in Denver or in Boulder it was easy to drive there I'll not win the drive fuck an hour nothing never any traffic I'd be twenty five minutes here's the deal though bro there's no traffic out that don't matter used to be twenty five minutes with no tracker on some fucking tunes crack the window a little bit they built this monster to spend money yeah they'd built this month this monster to to just you know like when I went to fucking Newark to see the fight review did we did knew it they built the soccer stadium right fucking soccer stadium in Newark let's spend the money left and right but they still can't put in a left-hand turning signal so if you got to make a left twenty-nine fucking miles of people got em well they're trying to keep up their reputation as the carjacked capital of the world and if you like some left turn signals you get some outlet people can escape can escape the drama fucking maze that's the thing about that it's like you know they think that's a there's something really going on inside that Denver Airport there's all these documentaries dedicated to it and one of the reasons for it is because there's these crazy murals that they're painted up in the Denver Airport and they're really disturbing man their apocalyptic like one guy's got a fucking gas mask on with a giant sword and there's like pictures of children and coffins and there's fire in the background of you ever seen that shit yeah but yeah we've actually talked about it on this podcast before we did yeah but do you think that has anything to do with with that I think you putting the tea together I don't think that it does definitely but it's interesting you know I mean I don't have a pinion one way or another I've listened to the people talk about how it's some great escape' base and then 2012 there's going to be you know fucking asteroids gonna hit that they're tracking it's going to kill everybody except the people are in this underground bunker I don't know man I watched a TV show on those dudes those dudes that have they've they've bought like fucking condos out in these shelters out in like Death Valley and shit have you seen those people have space in Death Valley and so they have like a condo inside this underground bunker thing it's out in the middle of fucking nowhere you have to drive and you go out there and they had these shows I forget who was the host of the show but they they took you on a tour of these fucking but might have been Jesse Ventura no it wasn't him because they had a sense of humor but they whoever it was was like really and they'd taken his fucking tour of these underground bunkers that they have set up where they can survive a fucking nuclear bomb I mean these guys are like a half a mile deep in fucking earth so you survived the bomb now it's you and eight fucking Momo assholes looking at each other listen just live your fucking life these people that dig into that shit and just live your fucking life we get hit by a bomb the best thing you could do is move on to the fucking next life and pray to God that'll be fucking belly he's at doors music dude yeah what the fuck is wrong with people I'm gonna live in a fucking imagine being living your life consumer what happened when the bomb drops after 1960 those people that shit wore off in the 60s they all moved into buildings with underground drops with little fucking sandwiches that's how pang was fuckin invented we didn't invent the Tang for so when we go in that fucking tunnel of doom and after the Russians fuck everybody in the ass we come out we got vitamin C from the fucking tank that's what Tang was invented for but guess what our fears aren't the Russians anymore it's a lot bigger than that whatever's gonna hit now right now there's a thing going on in

fuck's going on you know what now besides that we're all spread out with Libya were in this fucking plan what the fuck are you lovey and racy are you fucking crazy these guys are just sitting there waiting it's like it's like you're just waiting for us to wear out before you fuck us in the hole and then oh what's that guy we've been looking for for 11 years or something like just sitting there going oh we got him now this ran out like motherfuckers will just light a fire in this Kansas CNN breaking news I get CNN breaking news sent to my phone Paula US intelligence source CIA is operating inside Libya to help us increase military and political understanding what that means though is about to get jack bitch what kind of horseshit quote is that Oh the CIA is there to increase military and political understanding now this is what we want you to do do you understand okay here's the political understanding we got the bombs bitch okay we got fucking robots that we can operate from Nevada okay and you don't even see them because they blend in with the sky and they don't make any noise because they're fucking solar-powered and they can contain hell fire missiles Hellfire that's how I decided to name them not you know the the beautiful flower missile or nose lick my asshole missile no Hellfire Hellfire missiles and they're shooting them from another fucking part of the world imagine the lag they have they must have to really like plan a shot in advance like you're just like playing quake online when you got lag if you have like a 56k connection and there's some asshole you're playing against it's got a cable modem and you know he gets to move quicker than you because his downtime is pain time between connecting to the server and back is much quicker so you're fucked so these guys must have like super lag listen Doug in 1985 we went to see Rambo - and that motherfucker took an arrow out when an explosive at the end mmm and when he shot at all of us lost online nobody liked the black people black people love that Rose was explosive I've seen that movie I was 73 I never seen black people crazy in my life when Rambo came out of the mud in his eyes opened up and black people with but not is there like yelling we should have thought of that what is it about black dudes that love martial art love it they didn't love anything special like a dude doing some crazy shit like oh that motherfucker got a gun in the shoe check that shit out there's something about it dude pulls his shoe off and guns down the bad guy like oh shit no he didn't what is that what does it mean we're just very vocal they're excited yeah the best thing about this that was 20 years ago the shit we got now as bombs and stuff is off to check a lot of the charts we got a bomb that comes out here as a car that follows you to the gas station bro or you're pumping gas it turns into a bomb a guy pops out a shoulder says goodbye that's the shit we got we got shit that comes to your house just look like a cake happy birthday and when you're gonna block the candles it just fucking blows up we got some shit now you know what I saw that was really crazy they got this Rover it's uh this remote-controlled drone Rover that's moving around that can jump in the air it gets up to a fence and I think and go like eight or nine feet in the fucking air Wow and it moves up to the fence and then it just goes blank and flies to the air and lands the other side it looks like it basically looks like like some sort of a flat box you know where all the electronics is with like two tractor two rubber tractor things on the side of it I guess and the fucking thing flies through the air I mean what what's next you know that's the other thing that people are thinking about a lot of the shit that's going down in Afghanistan a lot of the shit that's going down the Middle East period is that the CIA has got all kinds of shit going on all kinds of little kinds of little drones and explosives it blowing up inconvenient spots to spark anger and you know what they do like that so they do spark war and get you know they've always done that but the bottom line of this buddy what do you think is really going on they figure some Libyan doctor figured out a way how to grow 50 kilos of heroin in your bathtub and the United States find out that Jack that motherfucker Gaddafi's got an army and motherfuckers around this guy with missiles and explosives but the United States is jacking this guy's got some dude H it's got something to do with fucking why we're over there in the fucking first place the whole nucleus of this thing people are dying in Detroit from heroin yeah it's fucking war and we're still now would that take over Libya boxes of money bro isn't it amazing how many people who think you're crazy when you start talking about the fact they're in Afghanistan for heroin people go what are you talking about they'll look at you like you just fucking just ate a bowl of shit they look you look you all your ridiculous person yeah we're at war for heroin where do you think that money's going man when he goes what do you know much money we're talking about they can ignore that you're fucking crazy we want to take over a country so we get you better gyros that's what you're telling me sighs go fuck yourself we're taking over a country so we can take over that fucking loop dawg yeah that's the bottom line it's a lot of bottom line there's all sorts of loot over there and this all sorts of looting Libya - I mean it's it's is it a fucking coincidence that for whatever reason we decide to attack Libya instead of going to Mexico and straighten out that bullshit that's right next door but all Mexico's gots burritos well the Fritos and hookers and donkeys and tequila vests it's not a lot of shit to offer Mexicans get ready though but listen that's some crazy motherfuckers down in well they got a they got to clean out their problem they got a big problem and it's because the United States it's a big part of it they wanted to make everything legal they wanted to you know they did do you know that here's a little-known fact Mexico is decriminalized everything small amounts when you're not selling it everything's legal now you could get acid in Mexico you can get mushrooms in Mexico they decriminalized everything just because they had to allocate resources to fight these fucking drug lords I mean that's a that's a gone country that country's gone the country doesn't have a government anymore that's right next door right next door right next door right next door the fucking drug army is it's like going to war with someone who lives in your country it's like if we were fighting al-qaeda but al-qaeda had billions of dollars and was way more armed and they were living here that's what it's like that's what it's like being a fucking Kosciusko and here's the crazy thing Mexico is coming back to get with DES bitch California Texas yeah you're right though you can't take Texas yes it's not gonna can't take a sex pack even the Mexicans will do go around Texas and Jack Wyoming though Jack Dallas Dallas tire can initiate they'll give them a big yeah canta the outskirts of Texas still come out of their hunting blinds and kill us all I don't have a chance here to lives there Ted Nugent lives in Waco now yeah you can't fuck really okay does he's got a high fence I've always admired what I think he's a retard but I think he does a lot of things that I really agree with and one of the things that I agree with his when he lived in Michigan he had this badass compound we like 2,000 acres or something like that and it was all fenced in he had all these animals living inside his compound he was just going Jack him and that's where he got all his food from he got all his food from hunting on his own property and I'm like god damn it that's fucking brilliant that's how I want to live I would love to live like that just eat what you hunt yeah that's one of the reasons why I was into moving to Colorado one of the reasons why I was up there I was like look if the shit hits the fan living in the woods you know there's a lot of animals out here in the spring water that comes out and fucking shooting a pig yeah I cook I'm gonna fucking cave with your kids a cave just give it a more fucking silver way I live in a tent with

people are friendlier like that there's a more relaxed vibe and I think that shit is healthy I think there's something exciting about living in a big city especially if you're you know you're involved in the hustle and bustle and you're really trying to make something happen and muscle I don't know I can't believe that New Yorker realtor again if you got divorce you probably get married after a

the black guys got shoulder shoulder right and he was grabbing their shoulders hmm whoa I mean it was fucking scary they don't know they look bad you know that's one of the weird things about people that are retarded or down syndrome or whatever you don't seem to know you know they just kind of are they just behave they don't they're like good one-month old book it's dubious with more no they're not like that that is themselves right I mean it's like that must be a strange strange existence where you know that's part of being dumb is that you're too dumb to realize you're dumb you know if you I'm not saying dumb like there's like they're lazy like they have an issue there's a mental issues and the mental imbalance whatever the fuck it is but I mean it's impairment they're impaired but they're so impaired they don't know they're impaired like they've lost the ability to see that they're impaired you know what a strange thing what if they all have an inner voice that that's completely normal like but they can't take a to be my you know United mean so the whole time there's just like I can't believe how much they treat me so horrible and I wish I you know but they can't when they try to say it's like murmuring tutor girl well there's probably now though there's probably a lot of that yeah I think there's a bunch of different types of you know being fucked up you know for sure there's that too you know it's not it's not just simple as yeah it'd be good there's some of this varying reader yeah there's varying degrees along the way that are you know means fucking crazy thing man to have your mind impaired you know and look look our minds are impaired in comparison I was watching this fucking twelve-year-old kid his autistic kid with a hundred and seventy IQ doing his take on the theory of relativity and he's writing out equations on this fucking window and I'm watching this kid I'm like this kid might as well be a fucking alien alright I don't know what he's doing have no idea he's explaining this like this is all simple simple shit when this is so far beyond my capacity to him to this autistic kid I'm retarded okay I am this guy who he has to humor because I can't understand a fucking word a letter a single part of his equation I don't know what's going on up there it's chaos to me but to him it's so clear it's a language it's like well quite simply you have to move this and this becomes x equals y equals two we are the retards to that kid hmm you know maybe like that maybe like you know people with Down syndrome they feel bad with people don't have Down syndrome maybe it's just like us we feel bad with people have autism right my gosh poor kids got autism and II can't engage in all the normal emotional things that we do meanwhile this motherfuckers you know count counting to a billion in his head while while he's talking to you about how a television is conduct constructed you know maybe we're retards to them maybe you know they look at us and I go this poor Fox they can't even do math in their head they don't they can't see through walls they can't read people's minds you know but but some people just I had a kidney eighth graders name is Michael alig Retta Sicilian kid he had been fresh off the boat in the fucking sixth grade by the eighth grade this motherfucker spoke three languages why don't we parlay I gotta go do these all that Sicilian shit he picked up Spanish and he picked up English and I just sit and look at him off do you know him saying like he was such a cool motherfucker that I just wanted to hang what if he was so he was a nerd we used to play when you used to play hockey we hit him in the chins with the with the hockey stick so I would die away he was never Grif to the bag when my dog Michael our hilarious and he but this kid knew nothing only came off a boat January in the sixth grade by the 8th grade III fucking language he would talk to me in Spanish talk to you in English like nothing and get A's you know some people work ethic - it's a some people just they have this insane work ethic and people that get a chance to come to America it's so much different than being born in America we don't have any fucking idea you live you know you're living in fucking Guatemala or some shit you know your your opportunities are fucking few and far between you know you live in some place that's impoverished you're kind of fucked man but when you're in America dude holy shit so these guys you know their family gets them together look we're gonna move to America wouldn't have a better life and you realize you're leaving everything behind you're putting all your fucking ship in cargo planes and you're all sitting together crammed in coach and you know eating fruit out of your mom's purse and you know just hoping that when you get there things are gonna be better and you don't know anybody there and how scary is this so when those motherfuckers get to school they come out guns blazing you know they appreciate the fact that holy shit I used to live in Italy now Here I am in the land of the free the home of the brave you know I'm in America and I'm in school and I'm learning English and I'm just gonna go fucking crazy over here they're just so unhappy and you're open that's the one half of it because I didn't leave Cuba crying we moved here I woke up on 89th Street Riverside Drive right I had all the fucking things that a rich kid would have right and here I was walking around this fucking city but I didn't know English and all you want to do in your heart is just fit in and you have no idea this is not trying to fit in when you're in grammar school and you should get a tattoo a long hair all you want to know is for them not to know you came from somewhere else I can't describe it to you I can't even fucking start to tell you like sometimes I have this anger at me and it's because I can't we were so lucky we were so lucky any three of us could have been born one of those black kids and fucking Haiti with flies on you yeah any three of us and we have so many fucking opportunities and sometimes I wake up in the morning this really hits me sometimes I go how fucking lucky am i that my mother came here and Here I am sitting here smoking dope I gotta go mug somebody you ever say like think about that's what an immigrant was like I ever you know I'm telling him for a long time I've been writing this thing and that's how it starts with it you know I don't remember anything I don't remember the plane ride from Cuba I remember nothing all I remember is crossing the fucking Street on 89th and Broadway up to ps1 see 666 and thinking to myself finally I'm gonna be a fucking American what does that mean looking at that flag you really believe in something dawg it's not just a piece of fucking rag looking at that flag and going what the fuck like looking at the wind blowing that flag and going what the fuck that flag is the answer to all my fucking problem that's the answer right there but I even at that age I knew my mother was fucking crazy so I knew I was in the full-fledged American but looking at that when you look at that flag and you just come here that they have a scene in the beginning of Scarface when they're on the boat and they finally see land and they show the American flag and the director whoever the guy is brilliant enough to show he showed it from a different angle what that flag looks like it's not just we overlooked that flag every fucking day we overlooked that flag you don't know what it is to look at that flag when you first come here and to know that that's your fucking that's your a magic carpet it's the highest ideal in the world it's the highest ideal that's why it's so infuriating when politicians are fucking corrupt that's why it's so you know people say you know why do you criticize what America does overseas don't you love America yeah if you love it you want to tell the fucking truth about what it's doing you know if you love it you're supposed to stand up ago what the fuck is going on it's like you don't love it by letting it get away with stupid shit because there's some corrupt kant's at the wheel that's not doesn't mean you don't love the idea of America I fucking love the idea of America for sure I'm always we only see the one side of that flag we never see both sides together gentlemen and that's the point we never we only see that one side of the flag right now you discuss that the CIA is setting up things in Libya what are they setting up that's starting a war they're starting business yeah they're getting things going that's the other side of that flag that we're never able to see we'll see once you put a mirror on the other side of flag you know I'm saying that's the one side of flag that we have since we accept this side of the flag we got to accept that so yeah the only way that side this side is possible where it's easy to drive around is if they're doing all this creepy shit you got to bring unless we bring the whole world together in on everything and that's just not going to happen and we've done creepy fucking shit they're gonna do creepy shit too and they can trust them you know we can't trust people to be cool you know they look the natural instinct if someone can get into a position of power is to be Qaddafi that's the natural instinct the natural instinct is to get Botox when you're 80 I have this big stupid looking rubber face where goofy clothes and just be running shit even though you're this old cunt you know living in some fucking castle with billions of dollars he doing that job can you tell me why is he doing me we put our billions and ours for money and as I left lag his money Joe Rogan that's a lot of people never comprehend but that's the reality of it stand-up is a beautiful thing to do yeah some guys are brilliant some guys aren't billing the millionaires the other for between the crack the other side is stand-up it's a business yeah it really is a fucking business guys and it's like anything else the other side left flag is a business guys and the same way we want social security one with 65 a country has to do sell a couple kilos every once in a while to replenish those fucking funds you don't saying right and that's aside the American public don't want to know that's the site that included Kennedy that's aside the Alex Jones talks about whether it's true or not that's aside we're not supposed to see we're supposed to be focused on the other side on what that machine is supposed to mean to us and for guys like you and I I like looking behind the curtain but I don't I don't because I grew up in a corrupt home town I seen what politics is out of minut level I can't even dream of what it is in a national fuckin level when I'm taking political contributions but I'm gonna pass your fucking bill so you could pass that law that'll make people's hands grow back but they also going to give him cancer in the eyeballs that's part of it it grows it when I grew up in it when it was in the micro process ice now it's in the national level of corruption is in a macro process and it starts with little things and townships where if there's a macro smaller than mine yeah micro macro a little high outside but you understand like I know exactly what you're saying yeah it's very interesting corruption if not checked grows it all just keeps getting bigger it's not like they go hey we got to cut the shit I know we've been making millions dollars on the sneak tip but everybody's got to stop right now and I'm not kidding I think it why are you still making money these Wikileak things are pretty cool for the country I think you change that's why these assholes want to put that guy in jail they want to say it compromises American security no it does and he did exactly what the New York Times was supposed to do if they got that information they should have done that on Twitter though I can imagine if there was just like this Twitter address that everyone followed that everywhere we go tweet later by the way JFK here's pictures of JFK so and cocaine dude WikiLeaks has a Twitter and they really wish the same generator they would be shit later they released some an article about how different parts of the American economy are influenced by genetically modified foods and how we are trying to force them on other countries and then we're like fucking with other countries if they don't go into the genetically modified food they don't start growing like Monsanto corn shell like them you know those that does these giant companies our way to embed it into the political system they're not doing stuff for the greater good of people they're doing stuff for the profitability of giant corporations that moved them into position in the first place the whole thing has been corrupted like to sit down and pretend that that that it's real is insulting it's like it's like a stupid argument it's like people who argue about Pro Wrestling you know it's like what are you arguing about this is a fake nonsense process if you can't not notice that from Obama Obama's gonna pull all the truth out of Ikea oh he's not Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize and then he sent 30,000 more fucking troops to Afghanistan I mean come on man thank you look at all the shit that he's done to allow these cunts to get away with steel and all that fucking money in that bailout I watched that inside job movie dude that shit is disgusting it's disgusting how deep the corruption is the financial the whole financial sector it's scary dude they have the people that are red laterz eventually get jobs with the banks like how the fuck you're telling me you work as a guy who's working for the SEC and you're looking into banks and corruption and shit like that and then when you quit you get a job with the bank how the fuck are you not in jail how the fuck are you not in jail you were the one responsible for looking over these motherfuckers while they were doing all sorts of crazy shit betting on things failing and betting three times more than that a business is worth and speculums and and and betting again and fucking forcing clients to buy shit they knew wasn't good like they did a lot of crazy creepy shit and got away with it I'm the only one who got popped is that Bernie Madoff those motherfuckers should all be in jail this should be a mass jailing and they're not they're not jailing anybody then it's bullshit then it's all bullshit it's all bullshit that they're not you you gotta like hold them them the most accountable you can and it's barely at all people's dreams people's dreams when you steal people's dreams that's the worst thing in the fucking world you're 63 years old or so somebody calls and says you're not gonna get you your money at 66 or 67 all that money you put away that happens those guys a lot too it's happened to a lot of fucking people people at 16 I just watch them but a month ago people 71 getting part-time fucking jobs now the 69 this is fuckin movie showed I believe it was Iceland how they went in and jacked the Icelandic economy in like a couple of years these banks went in and just fuckin just created bubbles and started making crazy money spending in access then it all failed and people are fucked they had like the most stable the most normalized economy like it was a beautiful economy everything was running smooth people were hard workers people got shit done they lived a life of you know relative prosperity now they're fucked everybody lost everything everyone's fucked everyone's pissed you think that kinda states I think already has he has what is this bailout what is this how do you how do these people get money when when their banks failed they well they have bonuses in their contract bonuses how the fuck do you get a bonus when the bank failed like the idea that you have to respect them and that they can't lose that's just there it's so criticized gosta bonuses millions millions of dollars and this is from banks where we would check to pay them we gave them money and they're giving out money either way if your back fucking fail you can't get a bonus you can't get a bonus I'm smelly as a bank fucking failed do you take no personal responsibility like who takes responsibility somebody and it you shouldn't it be the guy that stands to make a bonus if the bank does well that should be the guy who takes personal responsibility so when the bank fucking fails you don't get your bonus cuntface that's it it's that simple why why the fuck can't the president say that is that the studies like we're gonna you know load limit it to half a million dollars half a million fucking dollars for a bonus when your bank fails well you want these motherfuckers are so not living in reality and most people's reality these cunts cost so many fucking people their life savings and they have to get their bonuses and the president's like welp we have to give it to him what the fuck are you talking about you have to give it to him you can't just step in go cut the shit are you fucking crazy no you can't get thirty million dollars after your fucking bank fails no in the middle of a crazy down economy where billions of dollars from taxpayers money's been funneled to the fucking banks to keep them afloat no you can't get a bonus fuckhead you like you have a job you're lucky your head is attached to your fucking shoulder like you're not getting 90 fucking years

having this shit in there lately it's a shit store they all get they were all stealing all five guys are stealing big pool I don't understand how they feel like no one's gonna get caught it's like a good filing trail remember Goodfellas and Robert De Niro how to start killing people because you're spending too much money yeah that's the same goddamn thing man that was a great scene wasn't it well you realize the guy came in his wife had a fucking beautiful fur coat on I put the fuck you doing and then they did they know they have to kill this guy and then it's photos of him and his wife shot in the car what a great goddamn movie that one was on the other and when I walked in the part with there at the mother's house and then borrowing the knife but you got to think of that whole scene they borrowed a knife to stab this guy in the car meanwhile while they're eating the guys in the trunk of the fucking car eat like it's the 4th of July hat dairy bags and bread and fucking telling stories remember the painting yeah baby sighs that was amazing that is such a sick fucking movie right there it's great moving what do one for me there's not that many of those there's very few of those that ever get that good you know it's very few movies that ever like hit that that's like a perfect movie Goodfellas is like a perfect fucking movie everything about it especially you see it 20 years later when she was screaming at Ray Liotta and he run he starts laughing and runs away cos gackt out of his fucking mind she's screaming at him and he's laughing and winning we're packaging up the coke and his girlfriend's getting pissed off you know she's because he's got her just fucking making coke for him now he was banging her on the side still with his wife and he's got her packaging coke for him and you know he leaves laughing and she fucking throws the coke at the door you remember that shit is the craziest thing Christi craziest thing ever when he gets to that scene and I did coke for 30 years when he gets to that scene and he snorts and he pops his head up and his eyes dilate right in front of the camera that scene is when I turn the movie off really it bothers me to know and you know what bothers me because he steals it though he taps into the coat when he's standing there with his arms watch it again when she's weighing it and he's standing there with his arms folded only times you see my arms fold that means your potential energy you're ready to explode you can't even take watching that fill that fucking envelope when he sees the fucking that helicopter you know it's behind you that chinna chatter they have that's paranoid talk why can't we go to your mother's house when they dropped the guns off in your magic Joe what can we go to your mother's house and drop off guns they had this chilly child when he gets out of jail and he's feeling for the coke and he comes home he's trying to tell her that he wants it for money he wants to get high I've been

like they'll be uh what do you call those things a fire hydrant uh-huh but if you mind it becomes a dog could you imagine if you got like Osama bin Laden cooked up did you imagine if you got someone someone like Gaddafi cooked up right now how paranoid he would be they just go like they probably does it do you think he does coke of course you're a fucking terrorist you're probably fuckin fuckin hookers look off he's not a terrorist he's a dick or I mean let me know some he's but I mean yeah he's the same thing there was a bad bad person right enemy bank versa there was a guy called Carlos

Medellin Cartel got this nelly we can't have this when they went and got him and brought him back they stopped those were pictures of him on the plane next to Marina he's just looking around like what

Griselda she made so much money hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in coke money man she was killing people left and right they got this guy who's that her hit man who's in jail and they interview him in jail and he's just telling them all the different times Griselda had made me kill this guy so I had to go do some business and I killed this guy business and I said I wouldn't do that because they wanted me to do a drive-by and there was a baby in the car like whoa let's get in Colombians days to shoot anything well there's a picture if you go on daily news archives 1984 a Colombian family and Brooklyn got slaughtered well the kid the room for the wake was 14 bodies and there was 12 kids oh mighty sound kids down to 212 and put bullets in their fucking forehead oh my god the pictures just they don't show the bodies but they show the funeral parlor and just the role of fucking bodies these Colombians and over nothing this is in the 80s when they were shooting you with two dollars just to make that point you know you always fucking money future that was the big thing about them right the Colombians were always thought to be the most liked Colombian necktie they'd go for a fucking row down pull your tongue out they wanted they wanted an intimidation at the maximum you know the fucking savages that's right next door to us buddy that's that's just like what's going on in Mexico that's happening right now in a bigger even bigger scale you know because the Colombians even though they had like they were selling drugs they were bringing drugs and they weren't getting that much resistance from their government you don't I mean there's kind of crap this was partly right yeah it was kind of corrupt but in Mexico it's not the same man Mexico they get a lot of resistance but it doesn't matter so stealing it they're still doing it so it's scarier cuz it's more like it's more militaristic you know what's the expression in Spanish bloom o Plomo or Plata
