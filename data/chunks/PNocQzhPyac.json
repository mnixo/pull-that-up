boom here we go what's up Glenn how are you man hey Joe nice to meet you person good to come down here good to meet you dude you uh you're one of my favorite characters on that show that was uh it was always weird watching you people don't know where to like below zero it's um this crazy show where people live you know in this very rugged terrain and you you would you had the most interesting life because you when you would live up at the cabin you would live by yourself just you in a very small room just hunting all your food and and then hiking around you didn't use any vehicles and he just kind of had a rifle and a frying pan and a pot and a place to sleep and you seem really happy up there oh yeah I'm having a good time I just wanted to strip everything away that I could dispense with you know I got the idea I wanted to go back to living like a hunter-gatherer back in 97 I just got this idea I was actually living in a tent in the woods down in Vermont having such a good time I thought where could I go with this what could I do with this kind of lifestyle and I decided to move to the Brooks Range of Alaska what was it like so--you what made you go live in a tent in the first place I just always liked the outdoors I just loved nature and you know I was doing other things too but there was this this one summer when I was in my 20s when I found this really cool spot in the woods and I thought hey I'll set up a tepee over there and I'll just hang out there this summer as much as I can and I just had a great time so I started thinking more about you know instead of just living in the woods kind of as a recreational thing I started thinking about hey how could you actually make a life living like this you know get up every morning with the animals around the sky the water I started thinking about I started reading anthropological stuff about hunter-gatherers that summer and I started getting ideas and it it took me seven years to make it to the Brooks Range and to get out to that lake that you've seen on TV and to actually start living that way it took me a few years just to organize my life enough to move up to Alaska and then once I got to Alaska I was kind of in Fairbanks for years before I could really spend long periods of time in the wilderness but once I got it all arranged I just drove up the haul road which is this industrial road that goes up to the North Slope oil fields it's very very unimproved in areas just gravel road for hundreds of miles I drove about 300 miles north of Fairbanks I parked my van and I walked 60 miles off of that road by myself out into the wilderness and started figuring out how to live off the land how did you know where to go oh I had found the spot a few years before I had actually found that Lake flying around in a little bush plane because part of my plan originally when I formulated this idea back in Vermont I thought I'll become a bush pilot that'll be a thing I can do in Alaska you know hmm so I was thinking about starting an air taxi service I had been studying flying for a few years as soon as I got my private license I jumped in the plane to flew to Alaska but then when I got up there I was getting my commercial and all that and in the meantime as much as I could I'd go out and explore look around and I discovered this lake one day when I was flying across part of the Brooks Range and I set up a little tent camp there that summer mm but it took me another 4 years before I could actually walk out there and start living 60 miles walkin yeah that's a long fucking way hey I walked the length of Vermont when I was 13 years old that walk did you really must use this to Canada but the difference is when you're 13 yeah I actually started when I was 12 gave up the next I was with my uncle we went for about a week and then the next summer I convinced my mom to drive me back down and dropped me off alone where we had given up the year before but uh I'll just you by yourself yeah when I was 13 I was alone but that's a trail that's called the long trail and it's marked there's a little paint mark you know on the trees up but how do you tell anywhere to go yeah Brooks right now you were 13 yeah that's a little kid yeah and your mom's like go good it was amazing I was given a lot of freedom I guess so I mean I had already quit school by the time I was 13 you know really I went back a few times but yeah I mean I I never I never finished the fourth grade to tell you the truth but I went to one year high school eventually less curious about what's going on over there did you ever get a GED or any of that jazz no I never needed a GED for anything I did but I went to ninth grade and you know I did my own thing after that but you seem like an educated guy do yourself educated if I get any education itself educated you I just I like to be learning all the time whatever I'm doing I like to learn but if I'm making a TV show I want to learn everything I can about it you know if I'm flying airplanes I want to learn a lot more than I need to know to do what I'm doing and it's the same thing with going out there and living just learning as much as I could there's so much so much to learn out there now how long did it take you when you're 13 and like what did you do for food oh well that was easy bite at the store and carried on your back I never hunted when I was a kid oh okay I mean I remember going once or twice with some uncle's of mine we never got anything I never I didn't have any real hunting experience until that summer I walked out to the lake really yeah so you really just had a rifle and I don't quite know what you were doing I'd read a lot about what to do the biggest thing Joe I got out there I had two months food I left two months worth of food at the lake okay to get me started and I walked out there in July pausing for a second when you say two months food like what did you bring oh I had left basic stuff grains like you know some beans some rice the stuff that you knew you could serve a jug of oil you know basic some flour was out there and I left that the year before when I had a plane my whole plan to become air taxi and and do the bush flying I at that time I realized this doesn't go together with living off the land in the wilderness so I actually sold that plane that summer and drove up the road and walked out to where I had left these supplies the year before and decided that's what I really wanted to just go live off the land mm-hm I don't know I don't need an airplane anymore I don't need to fly so when I got out there I had there was a 55-gallon barrel and it had some food and it had a few supplies I had a tent you know it was insulated but it hadn't really become a cabin yet it's the same place that you've seen but it it was just a little less a little less solid back then and the cabin as it stands you built yeah well I flew in the plywood and stuff and then when I get out there I put I put I had a walton originally I'd had a tent camp out there since 2000 I built a plywood cabin under the wall town basically that's what I do but when I get out there I had some food I had my rifle I had fishing equipment I started living I started improving that little cabin you know and by September I ran out of food like completely I had one bag of flour this little plastic bag of flour it was all I had left when it got cold enough that I figured I could start moose hunting so that was my plan I got to get a moose why'd you have to wait till it got cold his regulations bugs you got to preserve the meat I've got no freezer all right I had you know I had to wait until like I still do when I hunt moose my moose hunting season starts the day I can leave a piece a scrap of meat out on the ground all afternoon and go look at it there's no fly eggs on it mmm that makes sense wow that's crazy so you have to other than the rifle aspect of it you mean you're really living like a primitive hunter-gatherer I would have used a bow and arrow if I thought I could have survived there's your spot right there there it is Hey well if you only want to gather me the rifle is the way to go you know I was always trying to just let go of everything I could I could do without but I never got to the point where I thought I could make it with just a bow and arrow myself you know people used to survive out there before they even had archery they survived out there with spears but there were groups of people they would build a fence they would Corral the animals yeah they would put nooses up between trees to get a moose things like that there's also probably a lot more animals I don't know that to be the case maybe not Alaska Alaska probably not too much different but throughout North America look if you listen to or you read rather the tales of Boone and credible in Crockett the Lewis and Clark when they made their way across the country like they found a lot of game there was a lot of animals I mean it was just an abundance of animals and then of course if they ran into Buffalo obviously there was millions and millions of Buffalo unbelievable that's the difference between Alaska and down here down here with modified ever since yeah we've paved everything over Alaska's still wild northern Alaska is the most wild place left in this country that's why I went there it's barely this country - I mean it's not even attached yes some people don't really think of Alaska's United States it's not but it's not it's a frozen Puerto Rico its way up there it's it's not even connected to us it's one of those weird ones but it is wild and and you see actually that's what drew me to it the first time I ever saw the Brooks Range was years before I moved to Alaska I was on a flight I used to get jobs as a courier when I was in my 20s I was real interested in traveling and I found out this way I could travel all over the world as a courier so I would go to New York City I'd get these jobs as a freelance career and take off to wherever they needed me to go and one time I got this flight to Tokyo and I'm flying right across the whole length of the Brooks Range great circle route New York Tokyo takes you right across it 600 miles of mountains from the Canadian border over to the Chukchi Sea across from Siberia and there's one road across it in 600 miles and I was just glued to the window the whole flight looking at that Wow I thought someday I'm gonna go check that place out on the ground you know I mean it's incredible when you see those mountains they're big mountains they're up to 9,000 feet high and that one rose the haul road yeah the haul road also known as the Dalton Highway that was built in 1974 just to construct the Alaska Pipeline to get to the oil up at Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope the oil fields up there they built that road in one summers amazing story in itself Wow yeah they started in April and they had the whole thing done in one summer from the Yukon River all the way up to the Arctic Ocean so when you got down to one bag of flour yeah was there a part in your head were you like what what am I doing here no I never wondered I was doing no no yeah oh it always felt right for you oh yeah what I was doing there was looking for a moose yeah and you already had that hole shed built yeah for me oh there's no shed for me well what's that thing that you do well you have everything like the sock covered up the sod house ya know that came here that came like four years later yeah no no I didn't have that yet I didn't even have a meat Pole really no I built the meat poll after I got the moose the same meat bullet still there that you seen is 20 feet high and I built that with a piece of parachute cord and a little block and tackle that you can fit in the palm of your hand they just had parachute cord around it and I had to get well that big it's I'm actually talking about that platform that's right beside the meat pole right the meat poles 20 feet high plus explain to people what a meat pole is so that they know just that's like my freezer I don't have a freezer out there so I just hang meat up and I live in the freezer the Arctic's your freezer from September until usually sometime in May I can keep meat with out anything other than the open air around it it's a long time yeah it's most of the year yeah the lakes only thought out from June until most years around the 1st of October it freezes over so you get about four months open water about eight months of ice so you're basically living off a fish for those months no there there was one year when I caught a lot of fish there because I stayed there I stayed there one time 15 months without going to town and by yourself no I was only there for four months totally by myself but I'm not totally crazy I went back out and and I got my woman to come in there with me after she stole I got divorced from her later but but actually no I most of the time I've been out there have had a family uh with me most of the time I went out there you know I actually was I I got married before I went out there I went out there for four months I went back I got sylvia my ex-wife and we were out there for years you know we would go back and forth we would go to Fairbanks for six months or sometimes a year would go out there for a year you know we would go back and forth and then what happened was after we split up I was out there one winner totally alone and that's when I got on the show right after that it all just the timing was perfect that I'm up there by myself I'm living real close to the land I mean I'm sleeping under caribou hides that winter and I'm eating just caribou like I had a little tiny bit of store-bought food with me hardly anything and I hadn't seen a human being in four and a half months and the executive producer the show flies from LA all the way up there to meet me in lands and it was they know you were there the summer before I was in Fairbanks and for a few years I was trying to figure out how can I share this stuff I'm experiencing because it's incredible I'm just I'm realizing that this is not ordinary life anymore and there are a lot of people that don't even realize what's going on out here in the middle of the wilderness so I'm talking to people I'm trying to find some kind of a filmmaker or somebody and I don't know anything about it but I'm trying to find somebody to help me do something like a documentary or something like this so my friends know this somebody handed me a email address they said you should write to this person they're looking for people like you they told me it was a filmmaker I didn't know what it was I sent off an email I said hi you know I live in the wilderness I'd like to talk to you about if you're interested in making a documentary and a few days later I started walking from the road again to get back to my camp so I left them a satellite phone number I said this is my only means of communication it's a satellite phone I don't keep it turned on because it runs on a battery you can send a message to it I check it once in a while it's basically from her he's only but you can communicate with me this way and I put that in the email how to do it well that whole winner went by eight months went by I hadn't heard from then I'd forgotten about that person that sent emails to a lot of people and then one day I turned on my phone is this message there they want to talk to me so I called them up and we start talking and they tell me it's a reality TV show and I had literally never seen a reality TV show in my life I hadn't watched TV for many many years and so you had no idea what that even meant not really I talked to him about that but they mostly didn't they mostly wanted to talk about me not about them and I kept trying to get information like what is this exactly right you know and because I kept I remember I kept saying what I really want to do I want to talk about nature out here and they're like well we don't want to make a show about nature will make a show about you but in any case I learned what reality TV was over the next few months because after we talked for two weeks the executive producer flew all the way up from LA he flew from Fairbanks on a little ski plane out there to meet me and he landed it meant me to make sure that I wasn't the biggest bullshitter they'd ever talked to they had no idea I mean they're just talking on satellite phone and I was telling him okay you know right now I'm living off these to care but I killed last month and and they came out there and they saw that it was real and they were like yeah we want you in the show Wow in a few weeks later we were making TV so they had to come out just to check to see if your story was legit yeah we actually like yeah yeah the actual lake were you living I couldn't give him references I mean I was all alone out there wow that must have been very surreal for you the guy lands out there some Hollywood jackoff comes out to visit it was great it was like getting out solitaire I hadn't seen anybody four and a half months that's a long time but I say Jack remain with all due respect I just mean a Hollywood person you know like a la television producer flies out to meet you when you're doing your wilderness thing like what a convergence of worlds there's no world that's more removed from the world of living by yourself in the woods then Hollywood that's like the most opposite of it in some ways but we're all human yes we're all human and we had a great afternoon together we had an awesome afternoon together so you take them and show them your routes and all the places where you go it was in April I had a packed trail on the snow that's still winter where I am and I took him out for a walk up onto a mountainside so he could get a view of the whole country there and it just happened that the first grizzly tracked I'd seen that spring that had come out of hibernation was right there in front of us that the bear had hit my trail and was walking down my pack trail right in front of us it was that day totally fresh track so that was exciting and did you see the bear no we didn't see the bear it headed up the mountain I was walking a lot faster than we were but we saw a lot of beautiful things that day and you know he shot a sizzle reel and he brought it back for the network to see and everything Wow so what were you thinking when the guy left like I was thinking this game that was fun cool I got to show somebody around out here you know because other than my immediate family that had been there with me my wife and and we had two kids by then you know that they hadn't been there since the year before but nobody had ever seen it with me I I never had had anybody out there to to walk anywhere all these years by the time this happened I'd been out there for nine years off and on you know I'd had my camp out there since 2000 actually and I'd been kind of living there at least half the time for nine years I'd gotten to know that country so well all the mountains I've walked some days 2025 miles over 5,000 foot mountains and everything hunting sheep hunting caribou and just looking around trapping sometimes but always alone why was this life so appealing to you from such a young age like the fact that you're you're 13 years old you make that walk all the way across Vermont but I mean that's that's a law as walk you know I grew up in a small town right near the base of the highest mountain in Vermont now Mansfield and some of my earliest memories are looking at that mountain wanting to go up there and I got to the top of mountain by the time I was 9 but it took me 9 years just get up there things take time it's like so this just always been something that's you're drawn to I guess some reason you're drawn to being in the wilderness I'm drawn to a lot of things but the wilderness is definitely one of them when you get there do you feel like everything's right like when you finally got to your place and you finally started when you walked 60 miles out there and started living did you finally feel like I'm in my spot this is where I'm supposed to be oh yeah like you knew I had literally been planning to do exactly that in the Brooks Range for seven years like that's what I was doing every day was preparing to do that Wow but what was it about it that was so compelling like why was that a thing that you were so drawn to because when I was living in the woods before that when I was in the tepee in Vermont every single day I'd wake up with a smile on my face I'd just be excited what was going on get up look out see the fog coming up off the water on the lake you know oh wow there's something over there there's a loon whatever it is there's I was just excited about what was going on out there and I just felt really connected to it and there are a lot of really positive aspects to being out in the woods I mean just the physical part like I like to stay in shape I like to be active and you can't help but be active out there you can't help but stay in shape I like the diet I mean once I started eating animals I killed myself and food that I collected myself you know plant food - it was that's the best food I ever ate in my life when I ate that first moose I kill I mean I never had anything better crazy way to live man it's interesting because most people would tell you hey you got to get a job you got a you got to be a normal person you can't just go out there and live yeah yeah well and that's what I told him I said I'm gonna make a career out of this now I didn't know exactly how it was gonna play out but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would not only benefit me but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and it would pay off and it did it just took time now what did you do for money what I did for money was two things one is I didn't go out there till I was 30 years old I didn't go to Alaska till I was 30 years old I had to have some savings and number two is I arranged everything in my life so I had literally no expenses or almost no expenses I didn't have I never had any debt I didn't have student loan like I said I left school early I didn't have a mortgage when I got to Fairbanks I found one acre of land on the edge of town for $6,500 I built a little log cabin myself 200 square feet no plumbing just a wood stove to heat it with I lived in a tent all winter before that cabin was done 40 below zero that wasn't easy and that was right on the edge of town and then moved into that cabin I had everything arranged I got a vehicle but it was all paid off when I went to the Brooks Range I literally didn't have any expenses except about $300 property tax a year for that little cabin in Fairbanks what were you doing for jobs before that you said you worked as a courier I did a lot of courier flying that was mainly because I wanted to travel mm-hmm but when I was in my 20s I was managing some real estate in Vermont it was Timberland and that wasn't something that I was interested in doing as a long-term career but I was able to make some money from that and then the next thing that I was planning to do was to get into the aviation but the thing with the aviation is if you're gonna have an air taxi service you're not going to be living out in the bush I didn't realize that when I started down that path you see I also did a lot of other preparation in terms of studying one of the things I did too was I made these shorter forays into the wilderness the first place was in northern Canada and I went up to northern Quebec five different times one time my girlfriend at the time and I we spent six weeks canoeing across a part of northern Quebec never saw a single person six weeks during that canoe trip we would see these small planes flying over and that's when I started getting the idea these little float planes I started thinking okay I'm gonna become a pilot that's one reason it took me seven years to move to Alaska because I had to study aviation there was a lot of different things I had to do but that's when I got that idea after that trip to Canada I started studying flying and that did slow me down moving to Alaska but that was a good thing too because now I can actually afford an airplane I just got back into flying last year and the next stage of my life I think that's going to be quite important so when you first got there and you you set up your your Shack you're you're living out there you're hunting food and did you feel like I mean this has been something that was like a calling for you for a long time I got a feel very strange that you were actually making it happen like it must have felt cool oh it always does when you do something you've been dreaming about for a long time like what was it like to wake up there and go I'm actually doing it like this crazy pipe dream of living in the woods next to a lake now it's real yeah yeah and I was I just felt super fortunate that's still how I feel like all these things that I've experienced out there I realize how few people in this day ever get to experience these things oh yeah I mean you're you're right next to grizzly bears wolves grizzly bears Wolverines these animals inhabit the same area that I do and I have a lot of interactions with them because I'm out there so much you know over the years a lot of things have happened I've spent a lot of time around wolves amazing things you know that if you had asked me I never would have thought would have happened could happen I mean depend times when I ran out of food and I've literally tracked wolves and taken food away from them when they've killed caribou why yeah how many wolves were there one time there was a lone wolf that got a caribou just ahead of me he didn't have time to do anything except got it for me literally that's what they start eating is the guts and he had opened up its belly and pulled the guts out and the whole caribou was there Wow what happened that day I was really hungry I we had run out of food I was out there with my ex-wife and we had and your kids had one baby at the time so you're out there with a baby and you don't have food the baby was fine she was nursing yeah well we always had something to eat just not enough but I never ever had been out there when I didn't have something to eat every single day some days it was just one rabbit some days it was just one time again which is very little food but I've always been able to get something to eat but this particular year it was kind of early on this was the winter 2006-2007 hadn't been out there that long made a miscalculation I was counting on caribou showing up because so far I'd always seen a lot of care but in the winter that one of the income if I had known I could have prevented a situation but we had taken one moose in the fall I'd killed a moose in September and I thought man we got 500 pounds of meat we're set the caribou will come later in the winter but it's amazing how much meat you can eat when you're not eating much of anything else hmm and all that I was eaten at that time really was meat fat and maybe a cup of berries a day you know that I had gathered in the fall and froze so the moose we went through that pretty fast found out that two adults can eat a large ball moose in three months if that's all you got to eat i i've eaten by myself of a large bull moose in six months yeah for people that know no large bull moose is about 2,000 pounds i don't think they're quite that big what they're probably 1800 pound you probably get 500 pounds Oh a Yukon moose is like 2,000 pounds with people people know they exaggerate a lot of things yo so but I feel like a 60-inch bull how much does that guy yes I'm like that's actually what that ball was it was about 60 inch Wow that one was actually 57 if I remember I don't pay too much attention to the exact measurements but somewhere in the range of 1500 pounds which is like what how many pounds of meat you think that is I would guess that you probably are getting 5 600 pounds of meat there are you taking the the femurs and getting bone marrow out of them and doing all that job oh yeah oh yeah that's that's really important part of of my diet when I'm living off an animal is I like variety and they analyzed a ton of variety in it one caribou will give you so many different options in terms of food if you know how to utilize it I've eaten everything I have a caribou except the poop literally you can even eat part of the antlers when their own oh yeah and the spring when they're growing they're soft on the ends it's like a pickle you skin them you take the velvet off in the last inch or two it's just it's got the consistency of a pickle they're great really eat it raw yeah I had a lot of animals ride a lot of parts of a caribou raw but anyway you get a lot of variety eat all the organs eat the eyes eat the brain you live with the brain oh yeah really spinal cord whoa like I said I've eaten everything except the poop out of a care but literally I mean you can even the cartilage you can get all kinds of variety and it's nutritious is good for you I mean I learned about all this from the old people that used to eat this way I went to I would have been reluctant to eat certain things if I hadn't been educated by other people that you can do this I was talking this 9 year old woman in Fairbanks you know and I asked her so you eat the brains cuz I'm thinking you know mad cow disease prions oh yeah the brains are great and then I did a little research they've never found prion ik disease in Alaska and any of the animals up there this is like starting the brain that's an issue that's happening more and more here in the lower 48 you're getting a lot of CWD which is the prion disease very scary stuff you know it's there's parts of Wisconsin where my friend Doug durin lives where you know 50% of the deer they they test test positive for CWD yeah which is a real fatal disease and hasn't made the jump to humans yet but they're very concerned and you know this is coming from the deer like you said there's a lot of deer and where deer and moose live together the moose get it we don't have any deer so other than moose and caribou that's why we don't have the periodic disease and have no deer up there at all well moose or caribou or deer but we don't have anything other than moose and you have black tail which those are much further south down in southeast Alaska I don't know their exact range but nowhere near where I am that's interesting it's too harsh of a country they don't it doesn't not the right habitat Wow so you when you take this caribou away from the wolf how does that go down what happened that day was uh thanks for mind me I'd forgotten that story I had a trail up the mountain there's a lot of snow in the winter you know two three feet of snow so you gotta have packed trails to walk efficiently pack them down snow shoes and stuff and pretty much follow the same routes I'm following my trail to go up the mountain looking for food that day and I came on there were no caribou I couldn't find a caribou anywhere I didn't see caribou track for like months they're migratory and if they happen to migrate ten miles away I'm not gonna see him that's out of my range I come on a track of one caribou its wounded it's bleeding it's being chased by one wolf and it crosses my trail so I start chasing it was real fresh it was snowing out and I could tell this has just happened this injured caribou this wolf is chasing it up this mountain they're right ahead of me I've got to follow this so you have a rival yeah yeah my rifle my constant companion I mean like that rifle goes just about everywhere I go out there so I start just jogging up the mountain as fast so I can go it's 5,000 foot mountain this this caribou is wounded pretty badly he's bleeding almost continuously you know and it's clear to me that if he doesn't make it over the top of that amount and this Wolves gonna get him I mean going down the other side I don't know but this wolf has a good chance to get in this caribou this is usually the way that they injure them and it takes time it's not like they just run up and knock them down you know usually hamstring right you know they they'll jump on their back they um I see a lot of them injured on the the big muscle right here on the back legs that what you mean hamstring yeah right in here yeah yeah they'll get him in there you find a lot of caribou injured real bad that get away mmm they get away with big pieces of hide ripped off of I killed a caribou once that only had two good legs it couldn't even walk anymore Wow but anyway I start chasing them up the hill that kind of zigzagging up the hill and this caribou obviously doesn't know this mountain it doesn't know where it's going it heads in a direction where there's some cliffs on the other side of this Ridge and I'm getting real hopeful at this point and I still haven't seen them they're there ahead of me on the mountain and sure enough the tracks come right up to the edge of the cliff both the caribou and the wolf and go right over the top of the cliff and I'm like there's no way that care we survived getting down because I know this mountain like the back of my hand and I just sat down there and I listened and I sat there at the top of the cliff and sure enough it's real quiet out there in the winter the Arctic is just like dead silent and I start hearing the crunching in the snow of this wolf he's down in the ravine and he knows I'm up there he can sense that I'm up there at the top of the cliff and he wants to to bug out of there at that point and he just walked up the other side of the ravine I'm looking across the ravine and I see the wolf going up and I know hey that carrot was down in that ravine somewhere so he's just getting away from you yeah did they already know you by then because you you had shot quite a few wolves right you had trapped a few I shot a few not tons we shot a few on the show that one time on the lake it's frozen and yeah I didn't have a cameraman with me that was actually that story was told on the show and I documented it a little bit as much as I could with my little camera at the time that day I shot three walls but that was a very unusual situation that was those walls were actually trying to get me which is almost unheard of but this was years before that this wolf and like almost every other wolf encounter I've ever had every other wolf encounter I've ever had the wolf wants nothing to do with you I mean the wolf knows I'm dangerous and how do they know you're dangerous are they having any interactions with other humans wolves know this all across North America I've only been able to find two documented bonafide II cases where wolves have killed humans in North America in recent times it was this one guy young guy up in Saskatchewan several years ago there was one woman in Alaska apparently was killed by wolves it almost never happens they just know that people are dangerous they've been persecuted I mean there were bounties on wolves I think it's in their DNA now hmm you know all wild animals grizzly bears they don't want anything to do with people 99.9 percent of the time it's interesting you saying that grizzly bears where they're hunted don't want to anything to do with people right they're having a real problem with grizzly bears in places like Montana where they don't hunt them right where they don't have any fear many many generations of no fear of human beings and you're getting a lot of maulings cuz that yeah I wouldn't be crazy about walking out in national park where you're not allowed to bring a gun yeah well my Montana in particular there's they have a lot but in this case the wolf wanted out of there it walked up the other side of the ravine I watched it it was about three four hundred yards from me when he got up to the top of the ridge he stopped way way up high above I remember looking at him through binoculars or maybe it was the scope of my rifle I just remember him given a yell he lay down on the ground when he knew he was safe way up there and he just gave her yawn and I could see his tongue it was just like a dog him give this yawn like he had just climbed up this big mountain in about ten minutes you know so I just walked around the cliff went down in there got that caribou I actually made a backpack out of this rib cage to carry at home and it was cold it was like 25 below that was pretty brutal getting I think you know back to the camp from up on the mountain there how have you was it I don't know I a lot of things I don't wait but I'd say a caribou like that probably weighs about 250 pounds something like that you know I obviously don't take all of that weight at one time with me I've carry as much as I can did you have a backpack that like a pack frames I had a frame and I just stuffed everything in the remember it was so cold and I was so tired up there running up this mountain the one it's dark it's dark a building there's no Sun in the winter I just remember getting the head off that thing throwing the legs and stuff in the in the ribcage and throwing it onto that frame I had and it was all inside of the big rib cage still had the skin on it and everything was the wolf watching the whole time he was up on top of the mountain I didn't I wasn't paying close attention to him after that and how long you hang out up there I would think that you would want to keep an eye on that fucker wolves I spent a lot of time on the walls this isn't a lot of time when the snow conditions are just right you can actually keep up with Wolves believe it or not I've stayed with Wolves all day long going eight or ten miles when the snow is deep enough they start walking single file in every wolf in the pack steps in exactly the same track and their stride when they slow down to a walk like that is just right for me I can step right in their tracks I don't even need snowshoes if there's less snow you can't you can't keep up with the wolf you know their normal gait their trotting you can't even come close to that speed but when the snow gets deep and they get single-file if you're in good shape you can jog behind wolves all day long and I followed wolves I followed a pack of 12 volts one time 8 or 10 miles they were hunting caribou right in front of me there was another time I remember taking care boomy away from a pack of wolves which I didn't even see they had killed the caribou but you know there's a lot of brush and different stuff around I discovered it because Ravens flew up off that I went over there and judging by the tracks they're half a dozen rolls around I took that caribou that time brought it home and ate it but I had a lot of interactions over the years of the wolves and I never had wolves act aggressive to me I've had a Mac curious I've had a Mac scared I've had him act indifferent I never had wolves act aggressive to me until that time January 2012 when a pack of twenty wolves literally took after me out on the lake and I did shoot three of those wolves and what was that about why do you think they were taken after you it was a very unusual situation first of all there were 20 wolves in one place that's unheard of up there that's totally unheard of the largest pack of wolves I've ever heard a count of that far north was 17 wolves and I was back in the 1970s usually there's five six wolves and a pack up there it's real hungry country it's hard for them to feed themselves with the pack gets bigger than that they have to split up go somewhere new but I don't know what happened that year I don't know if two packs combined I don't know if the pack just grew to that size but it was unheard of anyway I'm up on a mountain I look down at the lake it's in January it's just Twilight in the middle of day I see this big brown spot on the ice I'm like what the hell's that it's like out in front of my cabin about 500 yards big brown spot first I thought it was water overflow that comes up through the ice sometimes when you get a crack I got the binoculars I'm looking in holy cow that's a giant pack of wolves that just took something down on the lake I can see like one of those breaking off one of them's breaking off and then coming back over and I I realized what's going on there was very little snow that year even though it was January it had been cold since September but very little precipitation it was only about maybe four or five inches of snow so I could literally run down the mountain I was down at the lake within 20 minutes and I went right to my cabin I got my camera I got my tripod I'm like this is phenomenal I got a document this and I start walking across the lake out to where they are to get pictures of this so I get about 350 yards from these walls I still don't know what the animal is that they got there and you know I can hear them you can hear bones breaking and stuff the wolf it's just amazing yeah and I start taking pictures and I run out of batteries I'm like oh shit I ran out of batteries so I gotta go back to the cabin that's like 150 yards behind me you know and I turn around I start walking back to cabin when I get about 30 yards or so from the cabin I look back over my shoulder and the whole goddamn pack of wolves is racing across the lake straight toward me I'd never seen anything like it I sprinted like Jesse Owens through the door that cabin I was only 30 yards from it I turn and I look back out the window and these wolves came right up into my yard they were 50 yards from the front door 20 walls whoa yeah like this is unheard of wolves are usually hightailing it out of there when they see people so I get my new batteries I get the camera set back up I go back out by the time I get back out in the yard they're back over at this thing they've killed like 500 yards away and I want to get more pictures of this I got my rifle too of course so I start heading back over when I get about 350 yards from them I start taking more pictures I got a great picture you could pull it up maybe yeah I'm gonna see that it's in the note section on my facebook page as a story and unusual occurrence with the Wolves anyway they're all eaten and I start taking pictures again and after I take some pictures first one and two then three the Wolves they're like I can see they stopped eating in there looking at the other 350 yards away but I can just see that they noticed that I'm back out there on the lake and they're sizing me up kind of and then I see some of them are just really slowly moving toward me like walking a few steps and stop and I'm thinking yeah I got my rifle and everything but there's a lot of wolves there how do I know they're gonna stop when I start shooting you know so I decided maybe his best just make a slow retreat and I started backing up and walking back toward the cabin and the Wolves it looked like they were slowly walking towards me as I'm walking toward the cabin when I got about if I remember right it was a hundred yards from the cabin those wolves started galloping they just all 20 wolf started galloping towards me oh wow yeah those wolves right there they start galloping towards me and I dropped that tripod right there where where I was and I you know I was a hundred yards from the cabin they were four hundred yards from me and I ran as fast as I could for the cabin because I thought hey if I start shooting what if they don't stop the ones it's 20 wolves there I got right four or five rounds of if I had one in the chamber I had five rounds they ammunition I ran for the cabin I go in the door and just like the time before they're right there in my front yard I look out in there 50 yards away they're all milling around 20 wolves I'm like Jesus Christ this is amazing I've never seen anything like this so but I'm safe and sound in the cabin so I just collect my thoughts I'm like man it's time to teach these walls a lesson if I let those walls leave now they're gonna think I'm just food I run away when they see me right now that I mean I could be out there in the night in the dark not even know wolves are around getting ambushed by him or something so I had to shoot some of those walls so I loaded up got made sure everything was perfectly right you know put some extra ammunition in my pocket checked everything out okay I'm set to go out there with this gun and and talk to these wolves about the situation and I go back out and they were back at the moose it turned out to be a moose they'd killed they were back over there at the kill so I thought well it'd be a lot safer if I shot from close to the cabin you know rather than go out there on the open ice so I'll just see if I can lure him back over here and I started running back and forth right in front of my cabin on the on the ice just to get their attention and sure enough it worked that whole pack of 20 wolves started racing across that Lake and a full gallop straight toward me I couldn't believe it I was right in front of my cabin I just run back and forth like 50 yards out to my little water hole in the ice and back to the cabin a few times and they just started running right at me so I sat right down there on the bank on the shore right you know 15 feet in front of my porch and started shooting I think if I remember right the first one I hit was 264 yards I measured it all off the next day it was kind of interesting just checking out the tracks and seeing what had happened I hit three of them yeah what happened when one got hit they stopped at the closest tracks to me were about 40 yards you know what if when it was happening it was it was happening so fast I was just sitting down you know braced shooting I remember reloading after I shot five times it all happened so fast but then the next day when I had time I went out there and looked at all the tracks and measured everything insides up a situation figured out where I'd hit different wolves and stuff and I wrote that all down that's what I was mentioning in the notes section err my Facebook page that story because I wanted when it was fresh in my mind to really have the details because I knew right then that something happened to me that doesn't really happen to people I mean to get have a pack of wolves come after you is a a very unusual occurred you could read you can read all over the place that wolves don't attack humans you know I've read that many times but they have they have only technically historically historically a whole little red riding-hood that's all because they were trying to warn children about wolves yeah do you know the story about world war one and the Wolves the the Germans and the Russians had a ceasefire in World War one because so many of them were getting killed by wolves they decided to stop killing each other and kill the wolves because they were losing so many guys and then you know if guys got shot on the battlefield the Wolves would find out the Wolves would tear the guys alive yeah it's it's a crazy story if you go to the meat-eater calm this was a story that I had told before and you know Steve Rinella on my friend who runs a media those guys were like a little skeptical of it so they historically researched it and turns out to actually be accurate and there's a lot of stories from the New York Times and James pointing what there has been an update on the story as of April of this year that there's this I'm fighting an article about it but they're talking about that and it links back to an article from the New York Times in 1917 and then this team researched a little bit further before you got too far it turns out they debunked it in some way and someone trying to figure out exactly how it says there's no mentions of any wolf truce and some Russian stuff the Christmas truce of 1914 I guess is what it was called or something close I think that's a different truce yeah they just said there's no I guess there's no they couldn't find anything in the Russian sources I guess it's approved they could be finding in the Russian sources but didn't they find things and their German sources I mean there was absolutely recorded instances of people getting killed by wolves and I think they definitely did have some sort of a ceasefire to kill the wolves like the guys at meat-eater calm they went over this really thoroughly with many salt and sources this is the information found its way into newspapers at the time but no one dared to check the New York Times sources in New York Times might have bullshit this says meanwhile Russian hunting scientist Sergei Matt Vega Chuck said there were no Russian sources for this information the earliest information appeared February 15 1917 in the Bridgeport evening farmer newspaper hmm an American newspaper I guess go to the meat-eater calm story on it I think it's the meat-eater calm how the fuck do they not have meat-eater calm I don't understand that buy that please but um anyway it is difficult kill people it's difficult though to get to the truth I mean it's hard there's so much BS who knows what's true what's not sometimes but the story I know that historically there are a lot of reports of wolves and Russia killing people for some reason and you know and maybe Scandinavia in the older time know about more Harris you know about the wolves of Paris no very famous story apparently at one point in time and now they're starting to see wolves around Paris again but at one point in time wolves had actually invaded Paris and there's an historical account of the townspeople getting together and spearing these wolves Wow yeah Google the wolves of Paris there article and media was updated in August of this year and their takeaway at the end of that because they said that was actually mentioned in multiple newspapers but it might have been a barroom tale but there are courts of people dying from wolves hundreds of people killed wolves in the war there was a ceasefire of some kind but the actual and he was all being together at that exactly one may not be accurate but I think what had happened was what what they were saying was because of war itself all the gunfire these wolves had moved away from certain areas and then they had found wounded soldiers and they started eating the wounded soldiers so then they started to associate gunfire with wounded soldiers so they started actually going towards where the gunfire was which is what you hear with grizzly bears yeah people talk about that with bears i I never experienced that I'm a little bit skeptical to be honest about animals associating gunfire with food and going toward gunfire that to me it's an issue armed places where the grizzly bears aren't hunted people claim that yeah look well they have rules in certain places where if a grizzly bear finds your elk well you have to leave it alone right like you're not even allowed to scare it off you have to get out of there like it's not yours anymore yeah which is fucking bummer yeah and I have that issue you know bears find kills when you're when you're working alone you got to leave me you got to make multiple yes corners where the moose I have to make 10 trips of course now when you found these wolves and you like how when you start shooting and you hit one did the other ones freak out they realize what's going on the the some of they started putting on the brakes but like I said the first wolf I hit was over 250 yards in he was 264 yards something like that from me and some of the tracks came about 40 40 to 50 yards from me before they had stopped they were doing u-turns you could see in front they were all just milling around when I was reloading I just remember seeing all these wolves milling around in front of me like running around in circles and I was like holy cow and I'm reloading and I remember shooting one more time as they were headed away but they all took off they headed into the woods and one of the walls that I had hit was parallel paraplegic but he was still going on two legs so I ran behind him yeah I ran in the cat the other the other two had just dropped immediately one of them is hit right ahead but I ran in the cabin grab my 22 because I didn't want to put a big 36 hole in this this wolf that was paraplegic and I chased him down caught up with him and shot him with 22 then I could hear all the other wolves howling and howling they're like you know probably almost half a mile away from me by then they were up in the woods the other side of the lake and I just ran Turin over to that what they had killed and this is the first time I saw it it was a year-and-a-half old ball moose and it was still all there the legs were still on and I got pictures of it stuff they had just started eating it not long before I started for the pictures on your Facebook page not of that moose they put those on lbz I think what's lbz life below zero oh when they showed that story that was way but you know that's like six years ago I was one of my first stories that's a different move I got charged by one so so when you find the wolves that you did shoot and you know you shot and killed three of them yeah do you eat them you know I ate some of the hosts just because I was launched food I don't like to eat wolf me if I can help it it's to me there's like cleaner meat and there's dirtier meat III don't really like to eat bears a lot of people eat bears I've eaten the one grizzly bear that I ever shot I didn't shoot him because I wanted to eat him I shot him because I needed to shoot him but if I have caribou and moose I don't really want anything else really ungulates is what I like to eat right of course they're cleaner if you see the stuff that bears eat I don't know why people are so crazy about bear me some people really like bear me but I've seen what bears eat and I don't really want to be in bears rotten food oh yeah I mean you know they just got a lot more parasites that can actually harm you yeah like a caribou is a clean animal there's a couple things they can have that can hurt you not too bad normally but a grizzly bear I mean you skin and them and there's worms this long crawling out their ass and they got a lot and those worms can hurt you there yeah you know they're they're bad if they get into a person they can cause serious problems because they don't stay in your intestines they go into your brain in different weird places it's the eggs get into you and they hatch cuz they're an unfamiliar host I don't know where to go oh Jesus you go into spinal cord to go all over the place what do they do if that happens to you a lot of kids have have had big problems get the same kind of very similar kind of worm lives in raccoons so kids play on a playground they you know raccoon feces has the eggs in it oh wow it's baylisascaris is the the genus of worm it's like a round worm normally it doesn't cause a bear too much problem he just lives in their intestines but if that larva if if you get an egg in you and now the larvae doesn't know where to go he's an unfamiliar host and they act differently they'll migrate into weird places in your body like nervous tissue they get in your eyes and stuff oh Jesus Christ yeah yeah oh look at that so there's got one of their eyes oh Jesus the parasite on the playground roundworm Wow look at that man in the eyeball yeah and what did they do well I I've never got one in my I saw like it fuck that look at that thing traveling around inside this person's eyeballs yuck that man there's a lot of parasites out there that's the thing people don't realize is like humans used to have a lot of parasites in them how many people have them in their eyes those are all those pictures of eyeballs yeah I killed this one bear one time and those worms there's one on the Left Jamie right the left your cursor right there click on that that's 15 worms now click on that oh my god their eyeballs overcome with fucking worms yeah I've had to deal with those worms but not in me a 15 centimeter that's what it says oh that's so long yeah they're long they're long they're about as big around as your your pinky oh or at least my food this is 14 worms in this little woman Zion oh my god oh my god that's so insane oh fuck parasites man so there's so many parasites it's creepy like I seen a lot of parasites but most unwanted where those are one that will and the one that's in the grizzly bear is just a slightly different variation from that one that's in raccoons baylisascaris transfigure lives in the grizzlies up there and wearing rubber gloves when you cut it down and everything hell no no no but I I did build a big bonfire right there Sue's right in my yard and I just burned the ground because I got little kids up there and they were you know crawling around that time playing and stuff and I just built this huge bonfire sound and make sure no eggs the eggs are very resilient they can last for years and years in the environment they can survive being frozen all winter really oh yeah they're microscopic eggs that's what you got to worry about not the big worm you got to worry about the eggs fuck a lot of bear hunters don't know this when you're handling a bear skin those eggs are on the fur yeah if you're playing around the bear skin before it gets tan and then you you know you go like this or something all the sudden you get those eggs in you scary shit fuck that oh oh that's that's one of my number one fears something creepy crawl is growing inside me getting my eyeballs into my brain tissue I have a buddy of mine my friend Justin Ren he does a charity called fight for the Forgotten and he builds wells for the pygmies and we help sponsor him and we do some things with him and he goes back and forth to the Congo like a couple times a year and he went there recently and like six months ago and has caught a parasite that they can't identify and they think it might be in his brain they don't know where it is but like he'll work out really hard and then they'll be shivering with like pale skin and you know they're trying to do all these different things to him to try to eradicate the parasite they don't only know exactly what he has because he's so deep into the jungle he's so deep in the Congo he's going with a lot of Western people don't go so there they're really baffled don't like we're not we don't know what the fuck you have and he's had it for months at months and months and months of suffering and just it's taken a toll on him across the board every every aspect of his health has deteriorated because of this it's really creepy I've heard of people dying from parasites they picked up in the tropics yeah so when you eat the wolf what do you eat the backstraps you do you cook the hams like how do you how do you eat a wolf the only way that I like to eat a wolf is a boil it for a good long time because wolves too will have parasites they'll have trichinosis they're meat eaters Anthony eats meat you wanna make sure it's thoroughly cooked I like to boil it boiled wolf yeah she's in a lot of wolf I've eaten wolf you know three or four times when I didn't have much else and I figured hey I better take advantage of this food I got here rather than give it to something else too easy feed it to your family they've probably wolf like my kids when they're little maybe once or something like that cellairis how many people could you ask that to and they go yeah my kids probably eaten wolf I don't know like I met these Mongolians once and they were like oh you shoot some walls we want wolf meat we love wolf meat you know Mongolians they're all into it yeah a lot of Native Americans were into wolf meat I don't like it's a trappers we're into wolf meat well that's what they had to eat but uh yeah but some of them were actually preferred it really yeah there was something from the Lewis Clark exhibition oh yes another thing that expedition it was something from Rinella was telling me about some guys actually preferred wolf meat I was like their favorite favorite well domestic dog Lewis and Clark expedition they would buy dogs from the Indians and eat him because they didn't want to eat salmon they had they had fish is what I heard they could have eaten but they'd rather eat dog because they want to read me oh Jesus yeah Wow when they got way out like the Columbia River area so did you eat these wolves they shot I ate a little bit of it because I was short on food that at that time that winter you know not like the whole thing but a few meals of it so you boil it and how do you do it like onions and potatoes make a soup I didn't have anything like that no I mean no I'm out there all winter long that was 2012 2013 there was I didn't have any vegetables do you know where I get the vegetables out of the caribou stomach what the caribou eats for plant food that's what I get for plant food in the winter that's the only so you would actually eat their stomach contents yeah really sure people's done it for thousands of years I believe you I believe they have not only that but a pickle meat and I take tenderloins off of caribou right pickled in their stomach contents pickled stomach contents explain that to me how do you do that well you you got to learn about caribou stomach because you don't want to go too far downstream it starts turning brownish but like the first the the big chamber the rumen when they eat these lichens in the winter that's what they're feeding on mm-hmm you can't eat those lichens off the ground there's harsh but when it's partially digested in a caribou stomach it actually is an edible food and the old people used to eat these a lot I read about it and I even talked to some people who had done it you know and they were kids and stuff and sure enough it's not bad stuff I got hooked on it man one winter I was eating a lot of caribou stomach contents and yeah my family wasn't into that they they were like looking at me like good I don't eat that anymore basically I went as primitive as I could go and I satisfied my curiosity about living that extreme of a subsistence lifestyle so now I eat much more store-bought vegetables I eat you know normal foods but for a time there for a few years I got down to where I was eating caribou stomach contents I was doing anything I just wanted to just immerse myself in that whole environment out there I wanted to get my food right there what I could see what I could get myself just get right into it you know 15 months without even going out to town not talking to other people I mean at that time I had my wife there but just to really get into a different state of consciousness it puts you in a different state of consciousness and it's a beautiful thing and when you said pickled stomach contents yeah how do you how are you pickling a tenderloin in the stomach contents you just take the caribou you get to the right chamber of the stomach they got four chambers on their stomach you know you just cut a little slit in it just after you've pulled the guts out and you just slip the meat in there you slip it right into the room and contents there and what happens is assuming the temperatures about right it it will retain a lot of heat it creates heat I think the the micro organisms in there create heat because if you just bury that in snow and snow of course insulates it it'll stay warm for quite a while and if it was really cold it might not work out it might freeze solid before it pickled but if it's the right temperature the meat will turn brownish color over time and it'll be pickled that old people used to do this all the time I read about this you know 20 years ago and then I talked to people and I said yeah this is safe to do so I tried it and and there was a winner there where that's where I got a lot of my vegetables with out of caribou stomach and the meat will just it'll it'll turn brownish first on the outer part of the mean and all the way through it and it gets pickled I've done a lot of different things with me you know what I like to do with me a lot of people don't realize because you live in the modern world and just like me when I grew up right meats dangerous if it's wrong you gotta be careful yellow like wash everything be careful actually what I found is that it just all depends on the conditions once you learn how to handle meat properly you can do a lot of things with meat that most people would be scared to death of and it's completely safe as far as I'm concerned I never had any problems with it but like moisture is very important if you buy meat in the storage wrapped in plastic that keeps it moist you let it sit around for a while it spoils and it doesn't take long leave me out of your refrigerated least spoiled in a day right but if you take a muscle out of an animal and you butcher it properly you separate the muscle as one piece you don't make a bunch of cuts in the fashio you can take a muscle it's 2 or 3 inches thick don't put it in plastic don't wrap it up that'll cause it to spoil you leave it right out in the air 2 or 3 inch thick muscle I set them on a rack up high above my wood stove it's like a hundred degrees up there sometimes other times it's cold up there just varies during the day depending on how the fire is stoked right I'll let it sit there for a week ten days and then I'll eat it never cook it just let it sit there really yeah never cook it no just let it sit there so he gets a crust on the outside it gets a crust on the outside but it's too thick of a piece to dry like you would dry jerk your subscribe it stays moist inside it's like making cheese on it turns into something like cheese it gets different flavors so you're aging it yeah you're aging it's actually fermentation that's taking place I believe it's actually a fermentation process but it takes on different flavors I really like I call it gummy me cuz that's what my kids used to call it and gummy me gummy me cuz it gets kind of gummy no it's good it's good yeah it really is I wish I had something I was saying when I left Alaska I wish I had some something like that to bring Joe down but I didn't have anything so when you're was going I was looking for something about the caribou stomach and there's this thing called the polar manual made by the government yeah I think the Navy oh this is Kara back fat is better than chewing gum and they missed mid 1961 so it might maybe even older look at this old timers from the North mention many interesting Eskimo Indian and Siberian foods pemmican I've heard of that it's the meat of bear seal caribou and walrus mixed together with fish eggs and dried to a hard frozen block trappers peaches and cream is chewing dried beaver tail caribou back fat is better than chewing gum don't overlook the contents of a seal stomach for a fresh fried fish dinner nor the contents of a caribou stomach mixed with the trip lining as a tasty in quotes salad of reindeer moss and lichens properly how's that word acidulated situated i like the next one there walrus milk that death gives 16 quarts of milk I love dairy products I can't get my 10 quarts of milk from a walrus I one time I was thinking about milking a caribou after I killed her but I I didn't just because she was in bad shape she had been attacked by the wolves and she had an infection in her leg and I was afraid that somehow I might get sick but I just remember this lactating caribou that I had killed and I was thinking I never heard of people doing that but you know milking an animal after died until you just read that but walrus oh you were worried you would have taken the milk but except for the fact that she had been infected she was the one that only had two good legs and her back leg going right up there towards her udder oh it was in terrible shape it was all it was full of pus and damn I encountered that with an elk shot once he had been stabbed by another elk like in his in his one of his back legs and it was just all filled with pus like when we were quartering him and taking it apart there was this one section that was just all possums and a ste I've seen the same thing in a moose stabbed in the back like in the haunch there hmm yeah by one of the tines so when you boil the the wolf how are you eating that uh just plain just plain just chop you can fry it after you boil it give it a little extra flavor to do or if I yeah was that what you were doing or were you just eating it boiled both what is it like is there something you could taste a little Wolfie luffy wolf meat it's right it's a desperation food right you said how you would look at it if I didn't have something else Eddie wolf but yeah you know I got other things um there's all kind of stuff you can do with food you can you know you guess primitive as you want yeah I can imagine but there's so much else going on like for me now if if you want to live that primitive lay off the land that's all you do it takes all your time mm-hmm if you want to share that life with other people like what I've been trying to do the last six years you can't just do that yeah because not that I don't really have the amount of time to hunt and gather like you would I wouldn't even have the ability to communicate right I won't even be able to arrange to be on your show if I was out there living the way I was living No six seven eight years ago right so I wanna like how long did it take before you got it down where you knew what to do like you said when you went out there the first time you really had never even hunted before correct so how long did it take before you had like a system down what are you like okay I got this I know what I'm doing well I did my homework I did a lot of reading before I went out there which so you know I I picked it up pretty fast like that first moose I killed the biggest thing I had ever killed before that was a snowshoe hare but I did all right I mean I salvaged that whole moose and it was six hundred yards from the lake I got it all down to the lake I got it back to the camp I just believe in approaching problems in a measured way don't rush into it it could be dangerous you know kids I've gone out there they want to live off the land they've starved to death people have died but if you do your homework if you want to do something like that not just going living in the wilderness if you want to do anything dangerous do it carefully so I studied so much before I actually started putting into practice that it came pretty fast you know within a couple years I felt like I pretty much had things together out there a couple years a long time though so for a couple years you just kind of piecing it together well I was on a steeper learning curve the first couple of years I'm still learning I mean we're all learning all the time but yeah like that that winter that I learned that you can't count on the caribou you know if you got two people out there you better get two moose in the fall because the caravel might not show up mmm so would you like when you shot a moose and you knew you had enough meat you would stop right there you'd say okay I'm good yeah I mean in the fall normally normally you know like 14 Falls I've spent out there I've always gotten a moose in September always and normally if I'm if I'm alone that's all I need is one moves that'll last six months even if I didn't get caribou you're from with a woman or I got two little kids out there like I did some years that's not gonna be enough to go through the whole winter so you would get another moose some years I did get two moose what are the regulations the regulations there's different regulation sources assistance hunting right not really not in that particular area there really isn't much difference at all in subsistence regulations there are a lot of myths about that the only difference where I was in terms of subsistence regulations was federal regulations as they applied to migratory waterfowl so I can legally when I'm living there hunt ducks in the springtime but all the other seasons are exactly the same but the truth of it is Joe when I first went out there I couldn't even have a high license that high license expires in December how the hell am I gonna get a new one right I mean January February March April sometimes I'd go to town in the summer and get a new hunting license you know and the I didn't even have a calendar I didn't have a watch there's times I didn't know you know I figured okay it sits around the equinox it's late September that's the moose hunting time but what mattered to me was that the flies were no longer laying eggs then I could hunt moose it was legal because the legal season actually started even earlier than that but I didn't care about the legal season what I cared about was when I can preserve the meat and you know the caribou season is pretty much all winter long and pretty much all year long I think they got a month or two in the summer now you can't hunt him but the season didn't affect me too much I mean one one difference in my life now is that I play by the rules I didn't use to play by the rules it was the illegal for me to even live there when I got up to Alaska I discovered that hey you can't just go live out in the bush legally you know I went and talked to the state I said this is what I want to do they said that's actually illegal well it's actually illegal but things were loosely enforced twenty years ago - I got away with it for 17 years before I had a permit to live there so when you had to get a permit would do you have to tell them hey I've been living there for 17 years oh no they flew out they flew out and told me hey you've been living here 17 years you got to start paying for a perfect really actually you can't get a permit to live there to visit oh yeah yeah I'd been waiting for 17 years I built the camp you know the original tent camp in 2000 so I occupied that spot since 2000 it was a known thing I had told people at the agencies that are managing that land that I was going to go out there and everything but yeah 20 years ago it was just a little looser I think and also I wasn't hurting anybody who cared there was nobody else out there right it wasn't like there were other people that wanted to do something with that spot or anything so you know some years there would be a state trooper that would land there in a little ski plane and check on me you know ask me hey Glenn you need Athen you know I can bring you some toilet paper next time I come by or something it was never a problem but as time went on of course and once I got in a TV show I mean I thought when I got in the show I was like okay I'm gonna you know blow your cover blow my cover for sure I remember saying hey could we do this show without telling people where I am no no no we can't do that people discovered where I was the first week I was on TV I had people writing to be say hey is this your camp and they had a satellite photo of it they're like we tracked you down oh Jesus Christ it was feel so weird I tell you I kind of was like I was like wow congratulations you found I thought it was amazing like the skill that because we didn't say exactly where it was on TV these guys figured it out like looking at at the footage on TV the mountains and just knowing that it was somewhere in the Chandalar area which is a huge area and then they started looking at satellite photos and they tracked me down I was like complementing one good job well if not you mean he's 60 miles off the haul road all they do is make it grid well 60 miles as you walk not as the raven flies okay we don't have any crows up there but basically yeah it changed things and you know there was one day just a couple of years ago when I was out there with Tricia my partner now and heard a plane coming in the distance and you just don't hear planes coming in low like gonna land very often like maybe three four times in 20 years I've ever had a plane come out there and land when I was out there and well except the state troopers landed maybe half a dozen times but I hear this plane coming and I was like Tucker they're laying here and I said to Tricia I said this could be the day I've been waiting for for 17 years is probably the state coming to talk to me about the situation here and it was for 17 years well I mean yeah I did been a long time so uh I mean I I just believe in being honest about stuff you know it's like there's no point I mean I told everybody what I was doing right but just because it happened to be technically illegal I wasn't going to give up my dream of living in the Alaska wilderness you know so what what's the first thing they say to you when they land hey Glenn saw you on TV how's it going the pilot who brought him felt real bad you know because he knew me oh and they had hired him but no I didn't mind I mean what the hell I was living on state land I didn't have a permit I needed a permit right so how does that work how much does it cost I paid $1,000 a year after that I had to pay some back fees but honestly the only you can't get a permit to live on public land you can get a permit to do certain things there I was given a permit at that time for a commercial trapping permit or trapping cabin permit they call it in it for the purpose of making television I paid $1,000 a year for that I paid on my back dude I paid everything off yeah you're clear we're clear but what about hunting license lots I talk about it even if I just I'm open I don't I got no secrets but there's no risk of them taking away your hunting license because you've hunted without one for a long time I don't know what the statute of limitations is on that one but that's I that's I play by the book now right ever since you know six years ago I pretty much I got on TV and by that time there was no problem getting a hunting license because I get a lot of planes going back and forth and I mean I was buying my hunting license they were in the early years there were times when I literally had no way to get a high license right when it would expire in December when I get to town the next time I bought a hunting license I mean I always paid every year right but yeah I mean I tried to do it by the book now did you ever eat near Raven no I heard Raven taste good oh I heard crow had crow taste good I heard it's very similar to like diver duck look if you pretty prope prepare correctly you know diver ducks state yeah like I'm merganser some more of a fishy taste to them oh you mean like yeah like some of them yeah like a scoter mm-hmm yeah but apparently Raven the crow you need it it's good oh you can eat anything that's whether or not you want to what's the weirdest shit you mean weasels weasels no question that was the weirdest yeah it was that hint to mouth period when ran out of moose meat caribou didn't show up I was starving I was literally starving and I was getting a little bit to eat every day but I was running all over the mountains hunting burning up lots of calories and I can eat three or four pounds of meat a day some days all I was eating was a grouse or something and there were a couple days when the only thing I brought home were a couple weasels you know I was trapping Martin I had Martin traps out and sometimes weasels go into him and I've eaten weasel and I'll tell you somethin bout weasel they smell like a skunk they got a scent gland they're terrible you if you ever want to wheeze weasels for food you've got to skin it real carefully you don't want to hit the same gland and then the other thing about a weasel is if you just fry them up real hot they're so small you can eat just about every bone in them like the legs just crunch crunch crunch really oh yeah yeah and the weasels are speak probably carnivorous right so you probably have to cook right through them to live on voles oh yeah oh I fried them right up until they were like blonde little mice yeah well voles are like rodents that live in the Brooks Range we don't have real mice Oh so voles like a cousin of a mouse or something they're related so you're you just fry it till it's just everything's dead yeah hopefully that was that was not good that was the weirdest stuff I ever ate I hope never so uh it's not not good depends on how good a job you do skin on they smell like a skunk I mean you know flavors mostly smell this is family eating this weasel too at the time Sylvia at the time was out there with me yes she did weasel yeah she was looking a phrase while she's eating weasel she had a good attitude about it she was pretty amazing woman in terms of taken to the bush she I mean she was an opera singer in Berlin before she met me she wasn't really and and my partner Trisha that I've been living with the last five years she was an attorney in Boston why it's yeah Wow well I get that people are always telling me like you're never gonna find a woman to live like that out there but actually it's appealing to certain people and I think a lot of people that's why people watch on TV people want to be free right yeah and people want to be alive yeah and a lot of people don't feel it today it's true if you spend your whole life in an office or a courtroom and before that you were in school you've never really yeah just feel trapped yeah in the grind the grind of just keeps showing up at the office every day and cases are piling up and like she know she's living with Glenn by side of a lake dodging wolves I get it man the the appeal of it is why those shows are so successful yeah I mean that shows really six I had sue Aikens on the podcast before she's a really fascinating human - really really enjoyed talking to her like what a tough broad I'm not on the show anymore you know yeah I know yeah yeah um what happened with you in the showed you guys have fallen good question yeah we had a falling-out what was the falling-out about they never told me exactly they just got ready they renewed my contract we went out and filmed one episode and I never heard from him again really yeah I mean not about working on the show anymore do you think they just decided you weren't a storyline that was as successful or is I think I'm very popular with the fans every everybody that I talk to I mean yeah the viewers know you were my favorite guy I love it because people tell me that I really made a difference in their life like they learned something that got inspired they actually made changes in their life and I hear this all time like yesterday traveling you know had four different people come talk to me about it and but I think I went about as far as I could go in this show because I was always pushing to tell stories or to share things that didn't fit into the concept they had when you make a TV show you got a concept before you find the people to put in it right mm-hmm and I mean life below zero is a show about supposedly people living a subsistence lifestyle in the bush and that's part of my life but there's a lot more to it and I'm always on a person who's always trying to learn and grow and do new things and expand so when they met me I fit into their show like a hand in a glove but I wanted to do more and I wanted to share more so I get bored you know I made I think I'm an eighty five episodes of life below zero I made a lot of TV I wasn't satisfied just to show people what it's like to search for your food and chop down a tree you know for your firewood I wanted to do more so I was always pushing to do stories that were a little bit out of the range or the scope of what they envisioned for me to do in the show mmm I wanted to fly on a little eight pound paraglider off the top of the mountain to get back to my camp I've been dreaming about it for years and you know I said hey I'm gonna do this I'm gonna paraglide off this mountain I got a lot of resistance from the producers about stories something like that I did it I did it and I was like I want to film this and that you know hey if you guys don't want to film it they didn't want to film it I'll get somebody else for them I am gonna film this and I'm gonna do this because I was excited about it they put it in the show but I got a lot of you know resistance and I wanted to teach people all the time about things and that wasn't really the maybe the best vehicle for it I mean I had a blast doing the show I had an awesome time I learned a ton of stuff about making TV about all kinds of things and I made awesome friends the cameraman I worked with some of the best people I've ever met in my life and overall had a great experience but I was always pushing the limits of what they really wanted to do I think because I wanted to make a story for example about finding a site where Stone Age people had lived that was very unpopular with the producers but we did it I mean I I was just add why would that be unpopular that's so he said you look like you're just walking around you look like you're just out there exploring walking around we want to see finding something to eat go chop something cut some more trees first I was like no I've cut enough trees on camera I want to do something worthwhile you know I wanted to teach people things watch there's all kinds of stuff out there nature I just wanted to climb the highest mountain anywhere around I'd never been up there I've been looking at it for years and years those were the kind of stories that I had to really twist people's arms to get on the show the fans loved him but the producers for some reason didn't now this don't age site did you find it yeah yeah well it was amazing it was like if maybe that - not that we can get to right now it was like we made a whole story on TV about it is amazing I found something found the stumps I heard about it from somebody that had been there in the 1970s he said there's a place where you can find stumps that were cut with stone axe I was like that's totally amazing now you got to understand the stone Age's in Alaska was we're talking like what maybe eight years ago maybe a hundred 100 150 not that long ago really and everything's frozen eight months of the year so stumps lasts a long time you know these stumps were old like you could you they were still standing and you could touch him and you could knock him over they were like right on the edge like they might not be there in ten years it was amazing but yeah this this this gentleman I know who grew up as a little kid out there with his dad his dad was a hunting guide and they had been all over in this area and he told me that there was this place where people had camped and they had found rings of stones where they had had their skin tense and they found these stumps that were cut with stone axes and so we actually made a shows awesome I went with two cameramen we walked for a couple days just to get there from my camp Wow and then just going by this verbal description that he had given me I was able to locate he told me about a game trail that and it was still there like the the animals are still following the same route you know and he said you get there you you turn this way you're going up in the mountains gonna be there and off to the side you're gonna see these stumps and sure enough I found the stumps on camera it was amazing Wow I got one of them in Fairbanks I brought down with me that's so wild that it was just off of someone's description yeah from the 1970 yeah Jack rieckhoff he's an amazing man he um he still lives in the Brooks Range in a small village called Weisman and he was somebody that I learned a lot from after I got to Alaska wiesen was on that show as well wasn't it didn't they do film some stuff from that that part of Eric soliton that's right actually the only person on the show that I knew prior to the show you knew him Eric and I had known each other for 10 years I met him not long after he came to Alaska he's another really interesting guy he is yeah unfortunately uh Eric and I were friends and I kind of replaced him on the show that's what happened but but you guys were together at the same time for a little while it was a little overlap yeah first it was Eric was on for a year before me then they found me then we overlapped for a while and they go where they are so they would just get rid of you if they decided they were bored with your storyline there's other people living up there like that they define them and office politics I think wasn't and also just differences in creative vision I mean I was not satisfied to just do the standard I'm starving I'm looking for a firewood or whatever stories over and over I was always trying to push it I was doing paragliding I was doing you know just exploring showing people where Stone Age people lived climbing Mountains just for the joy of climbing them and sit up on top and philosophize about life those are kind of stories I like to do and that really wasn't the vision they had I think that was a lot of it but honestly they never they didn't talk to me about it after they stopped working I still haven't talked to him about it so they just stopped yeah they didn't call you up and say they renewed my contract right they had an option to renew for one more year we shot one episode radio silence after five months I sent him an email and said hey what's up you guys plan on filming something or what's going on and I got about two lines back from and said story the schedules all fall we don't have any plans to film with you Wow yeah that must be weird okay seems like that's a lot of episodes to just sort of brush you off like that were you difficult to work with the show producer told me a couple years ago he's fired me if he could but he couldn't really the the showrunner why didn't why did he say that I first of all I didn't work with producers in the field after the first year and a half I said hey I can produce myself in the field I'm I don't need to work with producers anymore and they went along with that so I'm responsible for my own stories as far as I'm concerned I'm the author of my own stories it's me and a couple cameraman and we're out there and I'm making what I consider real TV I'm sharing what I want to share nobody's feeding me lines nobody's telling me what I got to do I'm producing myself I'm working with awesome cameramen and we were doing incredible things I made whole episodes of LBZ in the field was just one cameraman and then we send all the footage back to LA and they work all their magic and edit it and everything and do what they want with it but yeah I've made several episodes with just me and one cameraman out there but that's a lot of a freedom that's not normally given to people on reality TV from what I'm told and of course that caused some tensions so they wanted to control you more oh yeah yeah so why do you say that he would fire you if he could guess he didn't like the kind of stories that I was so it was there really because I I don't remember the details of that conversation but there was just a general tension a lot I got a lot of negative feedback about what I was giving them and it was weird because people were loving it I mean the people that you would contact with on social media man yeah like I I wasn't I didn't even have the internet when I started this show you know I didn't I didn't have a cellphone when I started this show I just got all modern in the last years but yeah I got on Facebook and I got thousands of people you know giving me positive feedback and when I travel anywhere or even go to Fairbanks I was getting all this positive feedback so it seemed to me like the viewers really liked what I was doing but I did get a lot of negative feedback from certain particular people making the show that that wasn't what they really wanted they have a formula right in the formulas survival really the formula like subsistence survival finding enough food to eat chopping wood it's really appealing it's one of the more interesting things about those kind of shows it's like what is it that's tapping in or what is it tapping into what what part of your ancient memory where this is like really exciting to people because I think there's a lot of folks out there like your lawyer friend or your opera friend that they just there's something about the idea of getting away from everything and just living away more simple life it's it's it seems like the antidote for them so when you watch this on television and you see these people just chopping wood and living by the land and dealing with the dangers of living in the bush it's like there's something about it's like make you tune in every week yeah and I mean it is it's it's beautiful stuff to share I think it's it's awesome just for me I don't think it's the perfect vehicle to share exactly what I want to share because I want to go a little deeper mm-hmm I want more than you know like a four second sound bite and that's what I like about this show Joe when I discovered your show is like wow they're people they just sit down have a normal conversation rather than everything being chopped up and edited little sound bites yeah and you get a chance to really talk about stuff you know if you're sitting around just having a conversation with someone for three hours you get to really expand on your ideas and have you said something that you think maybe didn't say it right you get to say it better or well what I was saying was this and you get to explain yourself expand and really get a thought across there's not a lot of places where you can do that in this world no no no and those reality TV shows mean you your your situation sounded like it was pretty much you producing it which would give you as much reality as you know they left in with editing but a lot of reality shows you know as well as I do they just set things up like hey you're gonna pretend like you lost your keys in that lake right you know I fuck my keys where's my key you see bad acting like oh my god and I know I know how worse I've done those shows before I know that there's someone who's always trying to set up these scenarios they're scripted it's like sort of non scripted scripted like they have a place to go to to have it and you see them on these shows you can tell when people are acting that's like a weird feeling that you get yeah when you know this guy's opened up the storage shed before and he's opening up now Wow what do we got here like come on man you're a terrible actor this is awful but there's something about these formulas that these people have created reality television is a very strange animal yeah because it's not reality you know a lot of times at least and one of the things I think that's really exciting about those shows like life below zero and your situation in particular was that there's only so much of that you can fake I mean just the the actual undisputable reality of your existence is so fascinating you have this tiny little fucking house that you built yourself on a lake and then wolves are trying to kill you like that shit is real you know to me I mean and you're out there walking in the snow oh yeah it was like a rifle and some snowshoes and a backpack that's as real as is humanly possible and anything that they bullshit with there it's like so what because the the the scene itself is so crazy like just you know your life I always feel like that yeah there's no need to bullshit yeah why do people think they need to bullshit and it's not just reality TV but in general I mean come on it's in politics and everything yeah just being straightforward and honest can get you a long ways but a lot of people think for some reason that it's better to bullshit you why do you think that is because in the short term it can work for some people it even seems to work for quite a while I mean come on talking about the president yeah you can go along yeah but I don't know I mean to me how do you feel inside about yourself if you're making some false story up about yourself yeah right yeah there's something about it too that when someone gets caught like that Jesse small a guy when he got am I saying it wrong like Dave did no it's that juicy smooth a is it just Jesse small lot yes boy do you know he is no good for you I should not even tell you you don't need to know this nonsense no I'm trying to get up-to-date it's a guy who was an actor on the show Empire he was actually in one of the alien movies too he was in which one was he in he was in the one with it was a good one he was in a good one he was one of the people on the ship anyway who's in one of the more recent alien movies well the Mighty Ducks too well there you go he's been a bunch of shit anyway he's an actor and he made up a story allegedly seems like you made it up of getting beat up by these white supremacist with Trump hats on Magga hats on they put a noose around his neck and he walked into the hotel with the new still around his neck and told the whole story well he didn't by taking the noose off of his neck which is like everybody's like what we--what like everybody that heard the story it's such a badly concocted story everybody that heard the story was like what the fuck and then the two guys that he got to rough him up he got these two guys to rough him up and then they came out Sandoz bullshit this guy pay and then the Chicago Police Department is they're prosecuting him they're trying to get him to pay for their investigation there's lawsuits and he still it's it's it's the most obviously fake story ever and it's coming out of a guy who is a really successful actor so it's so crazy it's this you know race racial hate this hate crime story that this guy concocted for attention apparently you know the thought is that he wasn't happy with his role on Empire or what but it was a huge national story wherever cuz everybody knew kind of right away that it was fake everybody's like wait what he's got the noose around his neck and he's holding a Subway sandwich he went to a subway so he still had the sandwich right somebody smacked him in the head a couple of times and he had noose around his neck he's telling this crazy store and he wants to hold press conferences he said he was the black Tupac or the gay to POC he called himself sorry it was just complete nonsense and there's something about him talking telling his story where you know it's bullshit and you're like what are you doing like what is this it's such it's so compelling and you see someone lie like that about some crazy wacky made-up story it's so compelling it's like because you know like I when I was a little kid I would lie about shit I'd make stuff up you know every little kid will tell you a lie and I remember thinking this guy never stopped like he like lied like when he was a little kid yeah and just kept lying that happens to some people Cass yeah yes that's the dangerous thing about lying oh yeah if you lie enough I think some people actually start believing it oh for sure yeah yeah yeah there's a psychosis involved for sure yeah some people when they lie about their past and they you know like the one that weirder once is like when guys get caught with stolen valor like they have a crazy lie made-up story about their military history and war record and that happened with somebody in reality TV that was working with Cody Lundin wasn't there somebody working with him dual survivor or something tape oh one of his one of his guys was was a stolen valor guy me I shouldn't say I don't know never watch the show but I if I remember right I heard that he's a weird one huh that guy just walking around barefoot was disgusting feet I like to go barefoot yeah but his feet it looked like the monsters feet they would show him like it'd be like a thing like a Badge of Courage would show these gigantic calloused feet like that what he didn't have any shoes cuz he everywhere he walked and walked barefoot so his the bottom of his feet was like the top of this table mmm like this hard crusty and fucking look at that look at that guy shoot his foot oh look at that here's the thing man mine don't get like that even when I go out there in the fucking desert constantly is that that's not his foot dude that's a little kids foot really it says Cody's flip-flops I was like a flip-flop but he made he made it for someone yeah okay yeah there's something about walking around barefoot that seems really fucking gross I love it in the summer it's the first thing I want to do is get my shoes off yeah oh yeah I climb up the mountains barefoot until I get to where the rocks are you know anyway oh yeah I've walked like the 60 miles from the road to my camp two-thirds of the way barefoot really yeah got a blister on my foot after about 20 miles so took my shoe off and I realized hey the foot without a shoe feels a lot better than one with a shoe so I took them both off went the rest of the way oh yeah I'm big into walking barefoot but you got like soft pack ground up there right the ground sponge if it's damp if it dries out then those lichens get abrasive then it's hard to go barefoot they get very abrasive but if they're damp man they're soft you can use them for toilet paper believe me I do use lichens for toilet baby I've used all the different stuff for toilet paper but lichens are one of the best mm-hmm if they're moist if they're dry they're good for firestarter that's about it so that Lake where you live you live right off of fish in that Lake a lot there been years I fished there like I said there was one year when I never went out I stayed for 15 months and I fished a lot that summer you know Park I like 75 fish on that summer I remember right but I don't eat a lot of fish I'm not a big fish eater and right a weasel those desperate times Oh a neat one not the lake right hey there's my camp oh that's so pretty man Wow look where you live well lived I don't live there all the time like it right um this the other thing is situations change with my permits and you can't get a permit to live there and I can't even get a permit to make TV there now and I'm a TV show anymore really yeah I can transition I'm not making TV so right now I'm in the process of losing my permit for commercial use I have a trapping cabin permit but honestly I'm not interested in trapping I did some trapping when I first went out there but it's not something that I'm gonna do to you know sell fur and make money and that's what that permits for so I'm probably going to be giving that up so but so so you're not allowed to even keep that cabin up there if that cat was the case I had to take it down really yeah I had to take that cabin down right now I have a tent up there because that cabin was illegal when they gave me my permits just last year I had to remove the illegal cabin and I had a permit to build a new cabin with my friends in the new cabin and the old cabin the new cabin was going to be legal because it had a permit they can't give you a permit for any illegal cabin but they so they can't give you a permit for cabinet okay they're back rats why don't you tell them listen come back tomorrow want to take this apart and put it back together again exactly the same way so tomorrow when you come back it'll be the new cabin exactly this is the old cabin it was time for an upgrade I go I've got four kids now Joe that place is 100 square feet hmm I was kind of excited about building a new cabin but yeah that 200 square foot mom write something huge I think it's 400 they said I could go up to 400 so they said yeah but uh how big is that the room right now I we all we live in a what is this this room is bigger than 400 feet Wow so you live in something smaller than this hole right now we live in a 600 square foot cabin whoa in Fairbanks yeah that's huge for me we lived in a 200 square foot one until just well I think it was like a year ago so you living in the place where you built when you bought the piece of land yeah except I've expanded over the years I started off with one acre and then as I could afford it I bought up my neighbor's I got six acres and three cabins now oh nice now do the neighbors look at you weird because you're that guy lives in the woods on TV um not that I know about they didn't mention it no yeah they know you tell everybody what you do know they know they just know they watch TV a lot it's Fairbanks laughs cuz Dark One's nothing to do right are they weirded out by you see you on TV and see you right there I don't think so no just normal person yeah but even if you're a normal person you're if you're a normal person on television you're not a normal person people get weird and they mention it they mention hey we you're on TV they in the beginning I mean I bet I was been on TV now for six years it's not like we talked about it normally what a like the people in your town like Fairbanks is a real City it's about 40,000 people I think it's a small city but it's as big of a cities you got northern Alaska the only place Biggers Anchorage and that's an 8 8 hour drive away yeah and how many people is Anchorage that's good whew it's got to be what is anchored now 300,000 maybe 400,000 almost somewhere in there I had loving like half the people in Alaska live in Anchorage I think really I've only been there once spent a couple days there we did some gigs me and my friend Ari Shaffir and did some salmon fishing up there comedy gigs yeah we did comedy up there oh cool yeah we just had on a whim we said hey let's book a gig where we can fish during the day and then do stand-up at night so we did that for a couple days it was fun oh yeah but it's just the people up there were really cool man like a really there's something about people that live where nature is inescapable like nature and the wilderness and it's like it is impossible to not be aware of where you are like where we live here in California is so alien and so non-intuitive it's just not how human beings have evolved and it's a really recent thing that any human beings ever live like this yeah but there's something in your DNA that sort of cries out to the times that make sense to the places that make sense and that's one of the appeals of your show that's one of the appeals of living very close to the wilderness living very close to the woods because these tasks that you have to do just acquiring food and water and and and you know staying warm and dealing with nature all those things are enormous ly appealing to people that are stuck in a situation like I am oh yeah I don't say I'm stuck like I'm in some terrible place but it's great I probably got a little better than most of us but the thing is we're separated more and more from our origins and it definitely has an effect we gave up a lot for comfort yeah we gave up a lot we gave up a lot of our vitality mm well you know I love to jump in the lake and swim every day from the time I can get in the moat next to the ice and that water is like 32 and a half degrees whoa and it's so invigorating yeah it's great for it's amazing ice baths what a fleet stew them yeah and just little things like if you don't have a toilet which I still don't have a toilet even in Fairbanks I mean if you squat you have a toilet in Fairbanks no no bro a toilets a big thing man I don't know if I can afford a toilet it's you got to have a septic system you got to have plumbing you got I don't have any of that stuff I don't you're buying all this land if you your biology land you can't buy a toilet lands cheap toilets expensive you gotta have the right kind of land to have a septic system yeah the land that I buy is is boggy it's it's spruce forest it's like you'd have to it's complicated then you leave town I like to be able to go to the bush for six months milliner your pipes freeze you gotta have a house-sitter then you gotta have you a furnace friend 21st day all gets a wood stove right it gets complicated man I like to keep it simple Wow really simple I mean maybe I think I always tell people they say why you have a toy I like can't afford toilet they like come on you know for a toilet you got an airplane you got this here that I was like maybe if I had I don't know 5 million 10 million I might think about getting a place with toilet I don't have that much that's so crazy 5 million bucks I'd get a toilet maybe maybe maybe 5 million I don't think about it Wow because it's a full it's a huge change first of all I couldn't live on that land where I live really I mean I could but it'd be way too complicated and get like I said I don't want worry about house sitters freezing pipes away about rises about houses um you know my favorite way to go I don't like outhouses I like to squat and just poop on the ground and I'll tell you something ok if you want to poop inside five gallon bucket little plastic bag you poop in your house in a bucket this times oh Jesus look but you're in this tiny little house look that's big the little one a hundred square feet now I don't use the movement there but actually sometimes you got it when it's like l0 I go outside when I'm in a 100 square always look people I think the the UN's working against open defecation I think that's what they call they spend millions dollars you're trying to get people stop pooping on the ground in the Brooks ranges all over the world in Bangladesh yeah but that's because yes people living rice too many people that's that's the only problem population density well if you have enough land it's not an issue in the Brooks Range I've been pooping in the same spot for the last 20 years probably about 1/4 the size of this room and you can't even tell I've ever pooped there it goes back to nature I don't even compost I don't even do anything I just poop on the ground in the same area and it just goes back into nature the only trying to make a little mound no it doesn't doesn't build up just just or something we're rats right rat see delicious gray Jays eat it gray Jays what sage wolves I've had wolves come eat my shit oh boy first wolf I ever trapped set the trap right in front of my poop pile oh god he came in for your shit and got killed yeah I thought he'd eaten shit before there let me Laura man with this tasty treat no but it really does it it you know that's the thing as people are separated from nature now and so something simple like a simple solution to a problem pooping on the ground you know if you're in a rural area if you got space there is no problem with that really it goes back into the earth where do you think the Bears the Moose the caribou they all go underground it's not a big problem it goes back into the earth well you're living in a largely uninhabited place yeah that's in a large place yeah yeah so when you dropped a log next to the trap for the wolf you knew what you were doing you were doing that on purpose to lure men well I always poop in the same place the same general place but a wolf had come and eaten the poop you'd noticed yeah see the tracks have up the poop Oh wolf came here last night and ate my last poop oh how do you feel about that just normal you feel different when you live out in the woods Joe it's that you get a whole different mentality different ethics you don't think about that's no big deal this pool right there's blood there's guts there's poop there's right wolves and caribou with their legs ripped open and it's different so were you trapping and selling the skins I usually was trapping for my own family use you know like the kids had mukluks and mittens and and ruffs and all this stuff trapping out of wolf out of Wolverine out of Martens you know those are the main things up there's wolves Wolverines there's some Marten there's a few Fox or eating a Marten yeah I think just about everything what's a Marten tastes like like a weasel they're better the better they're to tell you the truth to me a Martin's just about as good as a snowshoe here but I don't really like snowshoe hares like I said I like to stick to ungulates why don't you like snowshoe hares I don't think they're they're very good compared to a caribou or compared to a moose just taste wise taste wise they're small tedious I'm just not I'm not big on small game tedious in terms of like room well in terms of hones the amount of effort the time you know to go catch them to skin em to some people they really are get into it but like for me okay I have caribou usually most years in that area I have moose always in the fall I mean I go out hunting maybe five six days I got a moose I got five hundred pounds of meat there's not very many snowshoe hares around where I am there's not that much brush I'm up high in the mountains so how many bullets are you bringing with you when you go out there for long periods of time oh I'll have a few packs a man this is funny story though because when Tricia came to meet me the first time you know we had a long-distance meeting right we we met over Facebook over the internet after haha so uh she slide into your DMS did you slide into hers DMS you don't know about that no I don't be in the dark I'm trying to get up to speed like I said it is rate messages Oh direct my sis right yeah I do I have heard about that she sent me a friend requests and you know as I was looking for a woman that's what I mean that's why I went on Facebook actually in the beginning really that's that was one of my motives for doing the show I remember when when the producer came up there and met me I was like hey you think this is a help me find a new woman I'm looking for a woman I mean I just spent the whole the whole winter by myself right I get it I'm only human I get it trying to find a woman out in the woods it isn't easy I mean every day I get up you know fix up my hair and stuff go out and didn't see any I mean you think it's hard hunting moose and caribou up there try hunting for a woman up there I would imagine it's very difficuit far between so I had to slim pickins I had to get modern yeah I get it anyway Tricia came for our first date we had one date afford a date before she decided to move and live with me Jesus Christ that woman's crazy you got a good one and she told me she wasn't adventurous she wasn't adventurous that's what she said she hangs out with you for four days then moves in with you was quite a job we spent oh yeah she left her you know gave up her apartment sold most of her stuff Jesus Christ but we talked every day you know for what three months before the date Wow we were communicating every day a little bit was this why you were at the shack no I was at that time I didn't even have internet up at the shack I do have I did get Internet in 2017 eventually at the shack yeah how did you do that I had to actually get certified as a satellite internet installer oh yeah yeah I'm a certified satellite internet installer maybe they'll be my next career you know Wow I can't get another gig in TV maybe I'll take a stall and satellite internet so you got certified and what are you using the power at solar no battery and a generator run generator once in a while and it doesn't take much electricity got a big battery and then you link up it's real slow I can never post video or anything but it was cool because then I could start doing Facebook posts and you know other social media I could put pictures from right there right then rather than one next time I came to Tahoe so your upload is extremely slow right yeah it's really slow it's I don't think I'm even gonna maintain that system but I don't even know if I'm gonna maintain I can't tell you the truth but I'm gonna keep going to the wilderness I'm gonna keep having experiences out there and I'm gonna keep finding ways to share with people but I don't know exactly the future of you know that particular spot in that particular cell anybody visit you up there you mean just random yeah just know that knew about you from the show no they always say they're gonna come or something yeah good luck if anybody's straggled in art help them out but no it's it's a big project people get and maybe who knows how close they've gotten before they turned around you maybe somebody drove all the way up the haul road and chickened out after the first day walk and I got no idea yeah I guarantee you some people but how many bullets do I carry how much I mean it's now my so Trisha comes up for four-day date after we'd communicated for three months and tell to bring some ball she was she had tons of ammo in her apartment down in Boston she really oh yes yes a wild lady she had guns and ammo and everything but she came up to visit and after you know a day or so together I decided that I want to take her out to the camp you know I said hey got any plans for tomorrow I want to go the Brooks Range so uh I wanted to fly up there so she could see the place to know what she was getting into right mm-hmm and we're packing and I like I think I threw in like ten rounds of ammo we're just gonna go for the day she had to be back at work you know she just came for a long weekend and she's like what that's all you're taking ten rounds well we're not even going hunting this is just like in case in case a bear happens to attack us I mean ten rounds that's a lot like I go months without shooting ten rounds ammunition so I she convinced me to take a full box I think but I don't carry a lot of ammunition no I think I started carrying a little more nicer I think usually when I go moose hunting I'll throw in a box off 20 rounds of me but I never use I mean I've never used anywhere near that much so it seemed to me that you would need do you do have a tool or anything deciding your rifle just in case something goes wrong with the site talking about a target yeah I got a target okay you have a target yeah but there's tools you know where you don't have to fire off around oh no I don't yes or siting yeah it's like a bore sighting it's like a laser and it has it set up like literally you can have your rifle zeroed in at a hundred in like two shots are usually get a zeroed in you know three or six or something it but I definitely never goes far out yeah shoot 200 yards I have my target 200 yards like right in front of my camp I shoot across the lake there when it's dead calm mm-hm and I hardly ever have to adjust I scope I mean that I'm so happy with that gun that's the all only rifle I have ever killed a large animal within my life Wow what's the calibre 3006 I bought that gun for $550 in 2003 and I never needed another centerfire rifle it's a classic rifle it's about sex Ruger Fairness m77 was it called m77 marked and knee - what kind of site are you using on that it's got a two to seven powers to go the difference is that's an older picture there was nobody up there with me actually took that picture myself but that was before I got my suppressor I only got a suppressor I'm all about suppressors yeah I wish they were illegal in California they're not no they're not I mean I think they're worried that people be sniping people or sometimes that's it's kind of stupid it's it's it's ignorant because for hunting purposes like one of the biggest problems like I have a friend of mine my friend Cody he's his ears blown out because he was working as a guide and someone fired off a shot right near his ear now as to wear hearing aids it's all it takes is one shot if you're close to the muzzle mm-hmm that's why I got a suppressor I really think this is a very important thing so many people are damaging their hearing without even realizing it yep yep 100 percent hundred percent it's it's a lot of guys did it when they're young a lot of my friends they go with a suppressor that's a that's actually a different gun but that one I've never killed in with but that is the suppressor that the problem is when you're hunting it's not practical to use your protection right and if you hunt regularly that adds up over time it adds up but you shoot a rifle that's a hundred and sixty decibels why are they making a law that you have to damage your hearing to go hunting right why why they making a law where you have to cover your ears with something the reason being is because they're worried about urban situations are worried about people shooting at people and you know you're not hearing anything but you do hear something though yeah you hear a parent oh no you hear a lot more than that have you ever shot suppressed rights like a crack well it depends on what you're shooting but assuming it's hypersonic supersonic it's still loud like a third party us without a suppressor is about a hundred and sixty decibels that's deafening you put a suppressor on it it's like 130 it knocks it down about 30 decibels more or less it's still very loud it's are there different levels of suppressor I bought the best suppressor I could get if you want to make a gun shoot like in the movies just silent like a little pop you have to shoot subsonic that's not practical for hunting oh you have to you have to now I'm questioning whether or not I've actually used the suppressor well I feel like I did at one point in time someone somewhere let me shoot their rifle that had a suppressor on but it might might be a false memory now you can put subsonic ammo in there you can you have I shot subsonic 22s 3030 I say you can load it subsonic you can buy 308 ammunition subsonic and it's very quiet but it's going so slow that it's not effective to hunt moose or carry with right yeah but yeah they're still allowed if I mean pretty loud in compare I have a muzzle break on my seven millimeter that's really well oh it's a cannon yeah but I actually met a person once who was just about deaf he was like stone deaf from one shotgun blast he was in a canoe and somebody shot kind of in a position where the muzzle was right next to his ear yeah yeah that's how it always is it's always someone shooting near you just blows your eardrums out it's terrible yeah but so in California you cannot have suppressors but again I think that's what they're worried about and I think it's just there's a lot of ignorance it's a lot of people that just don't know enough about about firearms that are making the regulations but I think that would be the worry that would people be shooting and you wouldn't be able to hear it well I think that there might be other ways to deal with that because we're hunting I think it's super reasonable to be able to have something where you don't have to have ear protection on all the time and you can it make it look just less disturbing for all the people also that are in the mountains if you're on public land and you're hunting deer and you hear boom like over the side of the hill it's kind of gross yeah even in countries that have more regulations on firearms they're places where you can use suppressors from what I've heard I mean I haven't researched extensively but I think in Britain even people have suppressors and in New Zealand Australia different places yeah yeah I do 99.9 percent of my hunting with a bow and arrow that's awesome but it's not a I'm not doing it because I need you know it's not like a subsistence thing I don't need it absolutely just I love our tree I love hunting archery too because you have to get close yeah you know that's where it's at that's what I love doing is getting close like some guys will brag about oh I shot this moose 600 yards way I always like to get close yeah it's just more interesting isn't because you learn more about the animal yeah it's more intense - it's um it's also it requires more skill I feel like these sounds fucked up but I feel like the animal has more of a chance like if if I'm inside you know 60 yards shooting an enamel that animal has way more chance to get the fuck away from me way more chance for me to blow it to step on a twig or it to catch my wind or it makes it more difficult yeah and it's just archery is it's there's nothing this set like rifles for sure are the best way to gather meat for sure no doubt about it boom one shot there down you know you hit him in the breadbasket boom it's over but archery requires way more discipline in there's so many ways it can fuck up there's so many ways it can go wrong and but there's that requirement that you have of yourself to practice and to be to be able to execute like when the the time is now it's it's hard it's very very difficult to do yeah and because of that it's like that from my brain that I find that very appealing I'm very I gravitate towards difficult things like that yeah you know but it's also very people say it's not as humane listen man people wound deer and elk and moose all the time with a rifle you know if you make a bad shot and people make bad and I've made bad shots people make bad shots it's like you it's bad no matter what but with a bow and arrow you'd be amazed how lethal it is oh I'm not surprised because you get that big broad cutting edge going right through their lungs I mean they hammer it's quick they die quick I mean I shot an elk at to hone ranch last year and it was down in four yards it stepped one two three four boom dead just shot it in the heart you know and I've shot moose through both lungs and had him go 50 yards something they're so tough incredibly - they're so tough moose is such an enormous animal - when you when you see one down and you look at the bones on that thing you look good Lord what an enormous animal yeah you know just out there eating twigs and trying to stay the fuck away from wolves crazy existence they have yeah but this is an amazing amount of respect and appreciation you have for them - when they're down what you're looking at like this is my food because I'm gonna I'm gonna eat this there's gonna be a lot of food yeah you know I feed my dog with elk my dog mostly yeah I'm allowed to do that yeah that's legal well why wouldn't that be legal in Alaska you can't feed game meat to dogs why because trying to allot the game to people who want to eat it so many dogs up there you know dog teams and you used to be a little one time in history but you can't you can feed the guts or something but you can't feed me to the dogs but you can feed salmon to them yeah that's gigantic amount of more Hammond just to feed their dogs because they're more fish than there are caribou oh I see well the way I look at it's like he's a member of my family yeah I mean my dog is he's my buddy you're not seeing the whole dog team well yeah and also I guess that's what it is right in Alaska they have giant sled teams do a lot of dogs yeah yeah that's interesting though that it's illegal it's it seems like you should be able to do whatever you want me could feed your dog steak if you wanted to you can go to the grocery store and buy your dog hamburger if you really wanted to why couldn't you feed him gamey I mean you got a tag you know you should be able that long ago who gets utilized there all sorts of rules and regulations they discriminate against dogs that's what it is they discriminate against all sorts of people anybody that's not they're making the rule I guess weird a lot of dog owners around that day but no I mean think about it every every rule we make it's just a game now this the technology exists if you wanted to use a guided missile you'd kill the every animal right yeah so you gotta you gotta have limits on the technology for you you personally prefer to use a bow and arrow for me I use a rifle I would definitely use a rifle if I was in your situation right some percent some guys want to go hunt with a helicopter right and they've made that illegal in Alaska because there aren't that many people that could afford to go home with the helicopter sway I look at it there's not that many people that could afford to go home with a helicopter therefore they didn't have much power in making the regulations and so when you say hunt with a helicopter you mean hunt out of a helicopter you can't even use a helicopter to transport hunters gave me hunting equipment anything really right so the idea is to make it more difficult for them to get to play someplace like the Chugach or something like that some some places difficult to get to the mountains the idea is the people that don't want to use helicopters are the ones you get to vote don't want people to use helicopters I understand I mean I'm not saying I want people to bill use helicopters I'm just saying maybe if a lot of people wanted to use helicopters to hunt you know cuz they know you're you've got a certain number of animals that can be taken and maintain the population right so the technology to take them it doesn't matter in terms of the animals don't care they don't care if they're getting shot with a machine gun they don't care if they're getting hunted out of a helicopter you've got a herd of so many thousand caribou you want to take a certain number out every year it's going to maintain the population but now it's all got to be regulated so it's like some people want to hunt on foot maybe they would prefer that you couldn't use an airplane because the people that are flying with airplanes are they going to be competing against this person on foot yeah but the way it all balances out a lot of people like to use fixed-wing airplanes they're relatively economical so you can use that you cannot use a helicopter in Alaska the transport hunters meat or hunting a quote about scouting can you use one Scout helicopter I don't believe so that would be a problem if you were on the ground if someone's flying above you in a helicopter spooking things I've heard people say that that's happened to them before the regulations are getting so thick I don't even keep up on every detail that doesn't apply to me but I believe that now there's some regulations you can't you can't even scout out of a fixed-wing airplane at least in in certain situations if I know there's places like that in the United States or in the lower 48 rather yeah there's a lot of people we're doing that for sheep I mean I would see that even in in such a remote area where I am there's a lot of guided sheep hunting right and you'd see these little super Cubs flying around the mountains looking for the Sheep that's the ultimate rich guy trip yeah hunting in Alaska is a very very expensive and they go you know deep into it's like their ultimate adventure you know and then they have wild sheep hunting Federation and all these uh guys you know they spend shit tons of money to go to these really remote areas get someone to take them in tour to get a big sheep get a big Ram and some people don't like that but on the other hand aren't those people that are spending twenty thousand dollars to go get a sheep or whatever they're tapping into this same same basic desire that I have or that anybody that goes hunting has I mean they want that experience of getting out there into the wild I think doing something primal I think with people have an issue with anything that's really expensive that only a few people get to do you know as soon as you hear about that and it's also it's like it becomes it's a sheep hunters are like it's an interesting breed of people you know they're really into sheep hunting and apparently it's a lot of the factors like the danger you know you're hiking on shale and like extremely very very like steep Heights and real big drop and very steep cliffs and it's like I've never done it but the people that say they like it's the ultimate yeah yeah exciting really got really exciting they live in these really remote places it's hard to get to and once you're successful it's like it's so difficult to do that once you're successful it's a huge huge relief it feels very exciting and happy and the food's delicious I've had sheep I've had wild sheep before my friend Remy gave me some some backstraps yeah I love she yeah what other animals are you we were you hunting when you up there anything unusual for big animals the only the only thing around is moose you Sarah shot one one grizzly I shot one grizzly that was becoming a problem that night I had a moose in the camp my wife and the little baby were there it's time to my and my daughter was only three years old and my son was you know just months old and this moose was hanging there I just killed it a week or so before and a grizzly was coming around that night trying to get that moose meat and I chased it away a few times and he kept coming back and you know eventually I shot right over the bear trying to scare it off cuz sometimes that'll work if just chasing them off doesn't work and but it still he was walking toward me at 16 yards when I shot it Oh God 16 yards they could run 16 yards so fast yeah he was just walking he wasn't thank God he wasn't running yeah he wasn't trying to get me but he was I just couldn't have that bear hanging out there trying to get that moose that I had there in the camp yeah so you shot him and ate him yeah what was that like oh the fat was unbelievably good man the meat for me bear meat like I said is not my first choice I liked it but I'd only have a desire to eat it once every four or five days you know it's not like something I wanted to eat pounds of every day the way I can caribou and moose it's just different the fat was unbelievable it's stunk terrible like I took all the the fat out of the the internal and the abdominal fat and all that stuff too and boy did it smell bad just like bear gut you know it just stung and I remember Sylvia saying you're gonna eat that stuff and I was like I don't know try it so I rendered it and you know just heated it up until it liquefied mm-hmm and when that cooled back down no bad flavor at all it was like almost tasteless isn't the mildest fat you've ever had really yeah that cured the bad the bad smell and I don't know we'll get past that though not a lot and it's not it different it's bare fats real soft it's it's real soft at room temperature it's not like you know sheep fats hard moose fat caribou thighs slightly soft or maybe then sheep fat but it's still hard fat bear fat is soft and creamy and so it was nice variety that winter to have all that bear fat it was really nice variety but I learned something from that just a practical thing that for some reason I don't understand the chemistry behind it if you got some fat that tasted funny if you heat it up really hot and cool it back down it'll take that away how'd it happen with moose fat once it was getting old so it was getting a little rancid and I tried it i heated it up until it got just about to the smoking point cooled it back down and it tasted way better really yeah what do you think he's doing that I don't know I never looked into it mm-hmm I think that would be something you'd want to look into not really just a little practical Boy Scout trick once you know you know that's it you don't need another magic behind it so so you take what did you do with the bear hide turn it into a blanket still still have that hide wow it's beautiful bear it really was yeah how big was it I think was just over six feet it wasn't huge because the Bears up there don't get is big I mean they don't have salmon up where I am away by mountains but it was a real light color bear there's a picture of that one you might pull up yeah that's it there's another picture with right after I shot it on the beach there but in the in the photos right on the first page there whatever they're called those ones that you can keep on this Facebook oh you're just because the Facebook page I can't zoom in for some also so that bear was super light-colored all its claws are white they're on white yeah this is beautiful hide really then you keep the claws on the hide when you make the blanket yeah I just it was the only bear I ever dealt with I skinned it all out like taxidermy you know I left all the claws and the lips and the eyelids and everything it took a long time and then it--and it myself it was a big project I built a big stretcher and had it all now what do you use to tan it I used the same thing I used on wolf or Wolverine which is like a diluted battery acid basically really yeah what's the old way these do these these brains right yeah there's you can tan with brains I hear but I never got into that somebody showed me this battery acid tanning system way back when I when I first went up there and started trapping and it worked really well for me so I stuck to that how does that work it's been a long time since I did it but you just dilute the battery acid is very diluted and I forgot the exact proportions because it's been been a while but it's very very diluted and then you add a lot of salt also and you want to get the proportions right so you want to look into before you try it but that's all that's in it the solution is just battery acid water and salt and sea and rot battery acid up there just yeah you don't it's so concentrated it's like a little little package I flew it out there like one time is enough for five years or so and you flew it out there just for tanning yeah Wow yeah and that system then you'll the other thing you need is baking soda you have to neutralize it you have to get the pH back to neutral after you're done tanning it here it is seven gallons of water to to cut two pounds of brain wait wait about that thought the what I used 16 cups of plain or pickling salt salts good okay this is but there's the battery acid three and a half cups battery acid from auto parts store two boxes baking soda yeah yeah that's pretty much it except you can skip the bran flakes what about foot oil what the fuck is foot oil neat's foot oil you know use that stuff oh yeah that's well you got a soften the hide afterward you got to put the oil back into it is that what foreign oil is yeah neat's-foot oil where people's feet they make that from sheep feet or something oh really I can't remember no I don't know it's something they call it neat's-foot oil but it's just a oil that you used to preserve leather oh you put it on your baseball glove neat's-foot is supposed to be one word at least when I just googled it Oh neat lol rendered from purified shin bones and feet of cattle I don't kow how weird so good we go sir I just gonna say we're talking an awful lot about traffic hunting stuff like that but there's so much more out there oh yeah I'm sure it's it's like the whole that's that was my problem in reality TV everybody when they hear that you've been attacked by wolves that's all they want to hear about for sure yeah for sure but there's so much more yeah it's uh you know it's a whole different experience the consciousness you get into a whole different space space is different I mean look at how come fine we are now what what you think about is as space down here I mean you riding an airplane now you just got a few feet around you right and out there you've got space space as far as you can see you stand on the top of the mountain you look hard enough you can see the back here ahead just about yeah I mean it's yeah there's a lot those mountains stretch for 600 miles yeah and it changes your perception because not only is there all that space but it's not all chopped up into little pieces you can basically walk anywhere you want you can go anywhere your legs will carry you you feel very free if you ever run into another person while you were out there one time when I was walking from the road to my camp I met another person really headed the opposite direction we were both travelling along a creek of course you know you follow natural routes walk in the gravel bars mmm how weird was that it was very weird and this is the thing when you live without many people around and you spend periods of time totally in isolation you really appreciate humans that's one of the great benefits of it you know you appreciate anything you go without go without food you go without sex you go without people and me and this guy we sat down we talked for like a couple hours really which I'm doing he was just going for a hike he had had some had hired a plane to fly him to a place that was a long ways away like he was walking I think a hundred miles back to that road that I had left and we just happened to be following the same Creek just walking down the gravel bars and we met up Midland over so we sat down and we talked and talked and then we went our separate ways Wow exchanged numbers or anything no I think I still remember his name though but this was years and years and years ago long time ago that must have been really weird all those different times you're out there by yourself yeah all sudden you see a guy yeah yeah it was that was really that's the only time I met somebody at random on the ground ever you know I've had one time when some hunters flew there and landed and they were thinking of hunting there but after they talked to me for a while I convinced them to go somewhere else but I mean there's plenty of space is no reason for two people be hunting the same area yeah especially out there but yeah I mean almost never meet anybody so it's different you know you really appreciate people and that's something that I've always noticed when when I was out there a long time if you see anybody if it's a state trooper that stops in and you haven't seen anybody for three months I mean it's great you know you you uh you invite them in you talk to people you don't just it's not like when you got a lot of people around you can't communicate with everybody you have to ignore people I know you liked a lot of aspects of living up there but what's like is there one thing that really stands out one thing would definitely be the autonomy the independence I think is this a natural need that humans have you watch a little baby when they learn to crawl they start separating from their mother a little bit then they start to learn to stand up but they're still holding on to the wall then they start taking their first steps and it's like wow I can stand on my own feet you know they get all excited and start running along before very long mm-hmm and I think we just need that feeling of Independence some people more than others but it's the same basic thing for me it's just like to be out there totally independent on my own nobody else is gonna help me if I have a problem you know if I'm up on a mountain and I don't have a satellite following me I got to be able to walk back to my camp I have to be able to there's literally no choice right and just to have that degree of responsibility mmm that in modern society you don't have you can't have that degree of responsibility in modern society for yourself you can't have that level of Independence it's standing on your own is it hard for you to like come to a place like LA like what is it weird like what is it what's the feeling when you're driving on the 405 from the airport headed over to the studio you had to be you have to be like why the fuck would anybody live here no no no I find it fascinating it's it's interesting because it's a different environment I mean I'm very curious about the way people live everywhere but I do find myself realizing why I don't live in a big city you know yeah I find it very really nice interesting me sleeping have a shower it's like well this is cold water toilet a toy I don't we have oil to the toilets here did you use one yet yeah tell but they build them too high I'm used to squatting and Oh squat you can get a squatty potty know what that is no they basically yeah it's like a thing that they put underneath the toilet you put your feet on oh yeah sort of put your butt in the right position I'll ask I'll ask the front desk they're going tonight I don't think they will say yes but that's what you're supposed to have right you're supposed to be in a position where you're squatting that's the natural position for humans to shit it works for me that's another thing I like about it out there okay there's the autonomy that independence is very important and I think a lot of people are missing that and that's why they're attracted to to learn something about that life but also just like I said when you do these basic things to be taking a crap it could be taking a shower or whatever in in a different way out in nature I mean you can't a lot of people can't bathe outside they want to they don't have the privacy here this but when that's your your normal thing I mean it becomes a totally natural thing and it's like very healthy and it's beautiful like it kind of you're out there looking at mountains all around and they your little Tweety birds flying by while you're bathing you know you're not sealed off in some little fiberglass cubicle hmm yeah did everything yeah it's it's a 100% different way of living life and your perceptions change your senses change in the modern world there's a lot of extraneous noise and imagery that we're filtering out all the time you can't pay attention to everything did you ever get injured while you're up there yeah yeah but you can't pay attention to everything I'll get to it okay you can't pay attention to everything so you're filtering stuff out all the time right right and when you're out in that environment it's very quiet you're not getting inundated with all of this extraneous noise and you're instead of filtering you're tuning in you're really tuning in like one little bird that hasn't been around the valley flies through I'll know it I'll hear it Wow hey that was a pine grosbeak I haven't heard one of those for a while mm-hmm you're paying attention to everything and that's really different it changes it changes the way you think there's a feeling that you get when you're in the real wilderness like particularly we did some hunting on Prince of Wales yeah and you know when you're you're out there it's raining rains every day hmm and there's this feeling of beautiful isolation like you're really isolated I mean you're really alone there's no you don't see anything you don't hear anything and there's this indifference that Nature has towards you that's really humbling it's like it puts you in your place yeah humans need that they need to be put in their place like I always say that some of the nicest people live near mountains and live near the ocean I think the reason being is the ocean just lets you know hey bitch look at that you ain't shit look at that water so you can't you can't survive there and did knowing that there's something right there that you can't survive in it's like a there's it checks you a little bit the mountains check the sheer beauty and the vastness like if you know you're looking out at the continental divide and you see the the Rocky Mountains it's like it's humbling it's humbling on the one hand you feel really strong being able to do what you're doing there but on the other hand you feel really small yeah really vulnerable really insignificant tell me about how you got injured I've had problems with tendons a few times I've had some weird medical issues at different times like things that most people wouldn't have done here like what the it's okay if we diverge from injury to illness sure sure well one time I was starving the time I ate the weasels this was a protracted starvation like I literally was having a famine for a couple of months where I was always getting a little bit of food but not enough how much weight did you lose a lot I didn't have a scale right but I got real skinny real skinny like first I lost all my fat then I literally lost my muscles and I got really weak I still going out looking for food every day but I couldn't go as far I couldn't climb up to 5000 foot mountains anymore I got that week and this is over months over months Wow didn't have enough food for a couple of months and you couldn't fish this is in the winter ice the ice is very thick back then the ice used to get thicker back then it is usually about four feet of ice on a lake by late winter now some winters have only had two and a half feet but anyway I I would try fishing but there's not that many fish there this is a little Lake a mile across isolated in the mountains the fish that are in the lakes stay there like this they're also smaller they don't grow as fast you can expend a lot of effort chiseling through remember I don't have a power auger or anything chiseling through three four feet of ice trying to catch fish that are you know this long and this big around so I was you know trying to be as efficient as possible I had out a lot of snares for snowshoe hares they're not many snowshoes there's not much small game but I was catching a little bit every day I'd like I'd get a grouse I would get a ptarmigan I'd get a rabbit but I was I was gradually getting weaker and weaker and thinner so what happened to me health-wise though was that eventually when I got food I just ate as much as I could eat for three or four days all I did was eat sleep and shit literally and I got refeeding edema whoa which at the time I didn't recognize I didn't even know what it was but you can actually die if you refigure self too fast like World War two when they were liberating concentration camps soldiers didn't notice they're given prisoners all the food they wanted to eat and some people got this refeeding edema to get pulmonary edema and literally die Wow and you know disaster relief people that go into like famine areas and whatnot they know about this now you can't give people unlimited food I didn't know about that so I get edema and it was weird I just thought like I was getting fat or something but it was actually retaining fluids and I didn't find out four months later I was talking to a doctor about what happened to me said you got refeeding edema so you were just living with it yeah it didn't last that long like I don't remember exactly how long it lasted but within two weeks of when I got food I was like all puffy and I'm like what the hell's going on I couldn't put on weight this fast but it was actually just fluid that my body was like my chest was I remember Sylvia pushing on saying you're all like spongy and I was like he hasn't that weird because I had been like you know how'd you feel skin and bones if I just felt hungry still I was just well not for two weeks but man for days all I did was eat until my stomach just couldn't take anymore Wow what did you gotten is that when you had gotten the caribou from knows that's when I guess store bought I got store bought food a friend of mine flew in the the thing that had happened was we had this arrangement where somebody supposed to come partway through the winter that we knew that was going to bring in food and and some supplies and I kept thinking like I just want to survive I want to through it like my goals to live off the land as much as I can and we got this arrangement anyway Tim's gonna bring us some supplies later in the winter I'm just gonna see the best I can do you know and I just kept going on getting small game then what happened was even when you got a plane coming it's hard sometimes to get in up there and also you know my friend was working during the week he could only come on weekends the weather was bad this weekend and then he couldn't come and maybe there was some other issue with the plane or something he just kept getting delayed and it got to be a real problem finally I was like I sent him a message on that Sat phone I was like hey Tim you know like I'm starving up here I've been living on muskrats and and snowshoe hares and not enough of them you you got to come next weekend or make sure somebody else gets in here because I was really worried about my health at that point then he did get in there and he dropped off all this food and I just picked out Wow and I got refeeding edema what kind of food I always just would get basic food I'm talking like beans and rice oats rice legumes powdered milk something I used to get you know yeah and then not long after that in February in the middle of February the caribou showed up that year and I got five caribou at one time out on the island on the lake and then you know we were all set again we're used to famine yeah it is it's like a hungry country but there are a lot of animals but they just they're different places you can fly over the Arctic all day long and I see hardly anything yeah that's a weird part about it right you would think there's animals everywhere no it's almost like a desert it is it's like the Sahara Desert up there a lot of times but there are a lot of animals concentrated the caribou are contrary this herds of a hundred thousand caribou but 100,000 yeah at certain times a year when they all congregate there can be a hundred thousand that's insane yeah some of the bigger some of the big artic herds I mean they don't all get in one place at one time but there they are recognized as a herd they get into the hundreds of thousands hmm they're very cyclic the population goes up and down but you know they're in there in certain places and if they're not where you are you're in the Sahara Desert then when they show up it's like the Serengeti Plain I mean all of a sudden there's caribou everywhere you step outside you hear the antlers all over the the valley if it's like in October when they're running you hear the wolves howl and Ravens croak and it's like what the hell happened I hadn't heard anything for the last two months and all of a sudden look at that oh my god yeah we're looking at an enormous pack of caribou what do they call them the compacts hurt herd enormous herd of caribou look at all those yeah it's in the summer now in the summer they're up on the north side you god that's insane it's so big still a neat huh I've sat there at the cabin looking out at the lake and caribou walking across the lake moving all the time and I estimated at one moment I could see 800 on the lake Wow yeah a lot of caribou like the way I hunt them sometimes is to run around out there on the lake with them really yeah like um can you pull up a picture on Facebook or you can't do that this there's one of me running in a caribou herd and you're not saying why right on the front page there it's like the pictures that you can leave up all the time what do they call them not in the note section no it's right on the you ran with them and that's how you were hunting them echo chasing the car I told you how I used to study a lot of anthropology I used to listen to anything that I could hear about how people used to live in the old days and especially the Inuit and people living up north there was this this interposed Austin Bullock see he made some films back in 1960s of the Netsilik people the Netsilik Eskimo series is called is fascinating he went up Budhia Peninsula in northern Canada and filmed people that still knew how to do things in very primitive ways and one thing I learned from those films was how they would hunt caribou and the way these people would hunt caribou is there only be you know a few hunters they're build the little stone nuke sucks that comps like a scarecrow make a line going down toward the lake so it looks like people then the few hunters would move around and they would use their voice their yell and their echo their voice around it confuse the caribou and chase them into a lake that way they could use their voice to get them down there and then one guy in a kayak can overtake the caribou and spear him it's amazing but you of our self yeah but this is something you can use by yourself you can use this technique of using your voice to confuse caribou and herd them where you want them to go you echo out on the lake if their caribou it's wide open they can see me half a mile away and they'll go out in the middle of the lake in the day and stand around out there if I try walking up to him a few hundred yards away they might just take off yeah as loud as I can yell and project my voice over to an island or shoreline depending on where I am and it'll bounce back and they'll stop and they'll run straight back at me wow I've had him come running by me where trisha was like oh my god she thought I was gonna get run over she was filming once and I could hear when I watched the video and she's like I think he's gonna get run over you know she's like really would you see that picture there Jane it's it's right on the yeah scroll up the top right there the upper leftmost picture yeah okay Trisha took that picture Wow so now those caribou those caribou they were running away from me before this picture was taken and I screaming and hollering echoing my voice off the shoreline and they turn around and run back and I do many times I had these caribou run back and forth like five six times I could stay within fifty yards of them a lot of times just by yelling as loud as I could you look really close right there yeah well Trisha thought I was gonna get you know trampled and so this is how you hunted them this is a technique I've used for hunting but on this particular day I was just demonstrating it now did you run into any issues where you really didn't have any vegetables other than the the vegetables in the stomach six of the animals you were just eating meat did you run any health issues just living off a meat I've eaten a very high protein high fat diet for long periods of time and I think that there's a lot more to food than nutrition the reason I was eating that way had nothing to do with me thinking that it was the best diet the reason I was eating that way is because I just wanted to live as close to that environment as possible and that's what was available right so I know some people are thinking well this is a really healthy diet maybe it is maybe isn't but that wasn't my motivation what I yield how would I when you had a good amount of it what I felt was that if I ate too much meat it had bad effects what kind of bad I believe I believe my body started to feel weird I believe that you can only handle so much protein but you can handle a lot of fat what I found is I had to eat most of my calories from fat I would eat a half a pound of solid pure fat a day when I was eating just meat and fat I might eat two or three even four pounds of meat a day but but like a half a pound of it was pure fat and weight but it was the form of it was a bear fat or were you getting your fat from it would be moose fat it would be sheep fat something one year it was bare fiber fat is weird right because it's a different caribou fun chewy fat like a deer fat so it's actually but you know I'm saying it's like it's not like like it doesn't render down like beef fat wood moose fat yeah oh sure does render you can render it if you want I rendered along it's a different like the way you look at it on the animal it just seems different what's different about it is that those game animals do not put on fat within the muscle right it's separate right if you get a fat moose he'll have a big fat layer on his back and so you would render that fat or that's how you do I mean I'll eat it all the way when I'm butchering the moose in the field I start eating the fat right there really sure Wow grab it off the kidneys and stuff and start eating it so that was the key for you was to get enough fat I had to eat a lot of fat and then I would feel better if if you're just eating protein for me it didn't work like what what how did it make you feel it made me feel like I had drink an awful lot of water whenever I like you had to drink an awful lot yeah I drink a lot of water or I'd feel kind of like just a weird feeling inside I mean that I also you know is working really hard physically at those times but I definitely drinking more than a gallon of water a day sometimes almost two gallons of water a day when I'd be like in real cold weather climbing mountains and everything eating meat and fat all the time mmm yeah I've been drinking a lot of water and the other thing that's really important to me like when I hear people talking about how they eat a high meat diet or ketogenic diet now and they're just eating beef mm-hmm I wonder you know what they're doing for a variety because for me I was eating all different parts of the animal all the different organs and things and also a lot of it I'd eat raw or half dried for example was one of my favorite ways to eat caribou meat when I was eating you know this meat fat diet now I eat more vegetables and fruits and and I still like to eat a lot of meat but I do eat more vegetables and fruits you feel better that way personally yeah I like more I like variety I like a mix I mean I felt good when I was eating that stuff but like I say I would eat I would not feel good if I was just eating steaks every day right if I was just eating steaks every day I would I would feel strange but if I took a caribou backstrap and I just sliced it up thin and hung it over the wood stove and left it there for half a day or something would get a little you know dry on the outside but it'd still be raw inside that stuff was delicious I'd be like candy for me I just pig out I love that and what we do with the crust eat it oh you mean you mean the crust on big pieces that have been hanging around all winter yeah that gets turned into bait that gets fed to the animals okay if it's do you ever try to eat that the only crust that because that's where the oxidized blood is basically it turns really dark will get almost black sometimes they'll be for some reason like down around the shank on on a big animal like a moose when you're cutting it into smaller pieces the crust looks so clean and everything down there you can eat it like dry meat but most of the crust on most of the big sections of meat get black and they get I would knock through that food it gets like it's it's not the same as dry meat that you take a fresh piece of meat and dry it for a few days this is coming from a guy who eat the contents of animal stomachs so I trust you sometimes when you say it's not meat it's not food don't eat it not that not that black crusted it's just blood it's oxidized blood yeah blood is good but you want your blood real fresh right yeah like that's the thing with blood is like a lot of times I haven't even been able to eat the blood from an animal because I'm just too busy but that's the thing is it you can eat the stomach you can eat the intestine you can eat the coal and I've eaten the colon of a moose you can eat the lungs even you can eat spleen I've eaten all the stuff but the truth is if you're one guy working alone butchering a moose you have a hard time getting all that stuff preserved and prepared you know yeah cuz it like if you want to eat the colon you want to get the shit out of it fast before it gets hard like a big boy what is the colon of a moves taste like Oh donkey no it's great cuz well when you do it right all it is is fat it's just it's like doughnuts it's like fat don't you slice it what you do if you want to eat the clone of mooses old guy that was married to an Eskimo told me this and it works you uh you got to work fast when you when you take the colon out of your next out try this out Joe okay turn it inside out the poop awful sock turning inside out like a sock okay you got the outside you got the inside out it's all smooth right you know how the outside of the colon to the large intestine is full of fat like on any animal you know there's all this fat that's gonna be on the inside now you just wash that you know take it home and wash it good get it get the lining all nice and clean then you slice it like doughnuts and fry it up and what it tastes like delicious does anything that resembles that would resonate with people that it's like good most fat Wow there's all different kinds of fat I have a hard time describing exact taste what does it taste the people always ask me that well you might think I'm mousse : yeah I'm saying there might be four other people that know what that tastes like oh no no you up go up in some village in northern Alaska a lot of evil old people you know you find old people eat stuff like they've grown up you know 70 80 year old native people there's a lot of people today that follow carnivore diet and that they just eat animal products and meat but they're eating mostly domestic steak then it's got a lot of fat in it already yeah yeah that's true that would be different I haven't tried that but I will say that I feel very different eating beef from wild animals there's a huge difference huge difference yeah huge like and you just look at a that beef cattle like they're they look lethargic mm-hmm compared to a wild animal they're obviously overweight they've been pretty much just bread and fed to be fat and you look at that and it's somehow it doesn't feel like that animal is gonna be as healthy to me to put into my body as a caribou running around wild like those ones we're just looking at picture of no it's not as healthy it's the mean gram for gram ounce for ounce it you take a caribou or an a moose it's much more protein this is it's much much more dense material but much denser meat it's way less fat it's just a completely different experience it it makes you feel different when you eat it there's a feeling that you get from wild game that's like a almost like a stimulant you know there's like a little bit of a woo oh and it's what you did to get it yep that too it's connected to I mean you get that but it just tastes so good after you did all that work yeah there's nothing like it there's nothing like it and you know when I guess the closest you could get us to bison you know if you buy store-bought bison it's pretty close to what it would be if it was wild you know if it's just grazing you know as long as it has that yellow fat that they get when they're they're grazing do you know anybody who's tried that for their kind of or diet like only e bison is something closer to a wild animal no I only know a couple people that are doing it and they're all doing domestic ribeyes and stuff like that you know just getting a lot of fatty meats I love ribeye steak but to just live on that I don't know how that would be I never tried just living on that yeah I'm watching these people like waiting for the shoe to drop you know like waiting for them to develop health issues waiting for this it's weird it's like a it's very much like like vegans in a way where they're completely committed to this idea and any other ideas stupid and they they're just already ideological hardliners with meat and they think that vegetables are bad for you and you shouldn't beaten vegetables but despite all the evidence to the contrary and then the same thing with vegans vegans want to think that this is the only way to eat the only way to think eat is with vegetables if you eat meat it's bad for you but meat kills you right people have been eating meat for literally all of time 97% of the population of the planet eats meat it's crazy to think that meats bad for you meat is one of the reasons why we're human what's bad for you most likely according to basically every study that we've ever done when they look at like meat eaters versus people not eating meat what they don't dissect is what are the other things these meat eaters are eating and what kind of meat are they eating either eating a sandwich from a fast food place a cheeseburger with fries and a shake and soda with a lot of sugar in it is that the meat eater or are they doing what you did you know are they eating you know fresh caribou are they eating you know what are they eating after spending a whole winter out there living primarily on meat and fat and very small amount of wild plant food gathered maybe 15 20 gallons of berries in the fall had some dried leaves from the spring before willow leaves had a few roots but the roots they're very small so I'm eating 90% meat and fat at least for my calories I got my cholesterol checked next time I came Tyler just curious I hadn't had a check for many years and I thought what am i doing you know eating all this fat I mean like half a pound of fat a day might be really bad and my total cholesterol level was 138 it's a good that's really low in fact the doctor checked it said it 200 I think is like high to hundreds borderline high or something and the doctor checked it said you that's the lowest cholesterol I've ever checked any test ever cuz I told him I'm a little bit scared I've been eating so much fat this year like unbelievable amounts of fat yeah but you're spending so much time burning energy the amount of energy that you must get from hiking 20 miles a day in the mountains you know at elevation wandering around the woods stepping over logs all the kind of stuff you have to do you're burning off an incredible amount of calories it has to be just routine activities - you want to get water yeah you go out there and open up that hole through the ice with a chisel you know and you carry your water every day you disloyal that water - no you don't know no beavers up that high I saw one beaver in that Lake in 20 years you take a risk there are few beavers in the general region but it's like the limit of their habitat okay so far north and so far up in the mountains yeah when we were at Prince of Wales we drank right out of the lake yeah just dunk dunk your cooler or your thermos into the lake and just start drinking I was like that's crazy I feel so weird I drink out of puddles do you really up in the mountains there's no other water sometimes you find a little puddle in the tundra I never got sick from drinking water out there it can happen I know two people that got Giardia but they they were both like old timers that had lived most of their life out there in the Brooks Range and they each had had it one time what do you want to do now not or not you're not doing the show anymore they sort of yeah good question you know my contract just ran out two months ago and I've been thinking a lot about this because I love the wilderness I love nature and I absolutely love sharing it with people and I want to find new ways to do that and there are a lot of new ways now I mean that's what inspired me seeing your show is like wow I mean I presume that you don't have to ask anybody about what you put on here right no you can do what you want that's why you're here that's why I'm have to go through a series of producers and I would never do that if we ever got to a point where they wanted to offer me like a gigantic chunk of money to put it on the network but they had to pick the gas I've been like there's no chance right there's no chance this is not a chance in hell the beautiful thing about the freedom that comes with this show is I can talk to people that I find interesting like I found you incredibly interesting your your story's amazing when I would watch you on the show I'd be like wow I'd love to talk to that guy really yeah man like so when you reached out I was pumped oh yeah yeah what a crazy I was like man is Joe Rogan gonna want to talk to me he's talking all these big-time celebrities oh I would like to talk to you probably more than a lot of the big-time celebrities some of the some of the big-time air-quote celebrities that I talked to it's just like oh okay I'll do it you know so that's my feeling on it I don't do like the the show bites this show by itself has become popular through whatever reason for whatever reason I don't know how it happened it just did right but I never think like oh if I get this guest that will be really popular this will help the show grow this will bring me to another level I don't think that way ever that's awesome my thought is always that guy be cool to talk to like oh I'd like to talk to her she seems interesting oh that guy's got a weird life what the fuck was that like like I'm it's all a hundred percent genuine curiosity that's awesome you're doing something that most people don't get to do which is what you really want to do you do what you want to do yeah that's the beautiful thing about it is that I found out a way to also do it where people enjoy it we're like it actually provides a service so folks are driving they have a long trip or they're on a flight they can actually get it it's free and it gives you something and there's a lot of wisdom being conveyed by some of your guests I mean that's what got me interests in the shows I'm here as people talking it's you know today just did - there's a lot of free education out there for people on the internet yeah and you know it opens up whole new possibilities it does and conversations like this although you know they're not technically education they expand your horizons yeah they expand your understanding of how people are living their life and just hearing people genuinely talk hearing people have real conversations without anybody interfering or anybody Jim I hate Glenn maybe it'd be interesting if you're just like a little bit more mysterious you know we need a you know what we're gonna get you an outfit we're gonna you you're gonna show up to the Joe Rogan show with a fur coat that you made yourself with isn't it interesting that all the time I was on TV and that show did really well you know I never came down and talked to you but then on our own we connected yeah it is interesting interest yeah well life's weird the way things happen and when they happen and why they happen that way it's like yeah but as far as what I'm gonna do next yeah you know I want to keep experiencing these things which to me are precious and rare I want to keep going out into the wilderness I want to keep experienced in it and I want to share it with people it doesn't mean anything to me if I don't share to people anymore I have no desire to go live by myself in the woods and not talk to anybody it seems like you could have a skeleton crew of cameraman editor you yeah and put it on like YouTube that's what I've thought about yeah I think that's a move man because you can make real money off of youtube now I mean obviously see these YouTube celebrities they're very wealthy and they're just doing things on YouTube and you could just transfer your show over to YouTube and I guarantee you people would watch I mean 100% definitely would need a camera I definitely would need a cameraman editor yeah cameraman and editor so it's like a three-person crew so all the stuff that you had to deal with with all these other folks that weren't even there these producers that were saying they wanted to fire you and all that other shit you wouldn't have to deal with that at all it would basically and if you had an idea like hey I want try this I want to make my own bow and arrow and go shoot a caribou with it you know and do it with traditional methods and use the tendons from animals to make the strings and all the stuff that like the Native Americans did you could do that like you could you could do we can do whatever you want you can do whatever you want and that's what I think will be really appealing to people because just like if you started a podcast or just like anything else where there's no one telling you what to do you get to find out who the person really is mm-hmm you know and I think that would that would be a great way to give you all the freedom that you want where you know I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to get enough advertiser dollars to pay for an editor and pay for a cameraman and and put it up there and start generating revenue yeah some guys are really good like you know Les Stroud used to film himself a lot yeah I tried that a little bit but I can't film myself it's like I need the interaction yeah les les is I mean he's the only one that really did that without any horseshit that live in the woods for seven days and survive off for whatever scraps he could find and find some sort of scenario that they piece together for the show you know the the reason why Bear Grylls happened the whole reason why that guy I got a shows cuz they were trying to tell les to fake things oh really and you wouldn't think anything he's like I'm not gonna do that way so they got let's get this fucking guy so he would just go along with them Bear Grylls just slept in a hotel he'd pretend he drinking his own piss all that stuff les is out there really surviving that way when you would see he would do like a seven-day trip and maybe he would find no food and by the end of that seven days you could see how much weight he had lost I mean he looked terrible and then he would get rescued as per you know how that he would have to go to a drop-off point or a pickup point but now he's all 'bigfoot les is gone gone crazy Bigfoot a hundred percent I get more questions about Bigfoot what is it you live in the woods and you're supposed to be running into Bigfoot you're supposed to be a Bigfoot authority to two questions people are always asking about global warming I'm not a scientist and Bigfoot right I mean I'm not a scientist but you said you did notice that the ice is thick yes yeah anecdotally I can say that it's definitely warmer where I am compared to what it was 15 years ago the winners have been warmer but how many years in the room have they been warmer oh I didn't keep the data because I know there are a lot of sign is keeping it and those are the people I'm gonna defer to on global warming right and I believe in global warming I mean I believe in the consensus of scientific opinion what I've seen personally is just overall the ice is thinner on my lake and that's a sign that over the whole course of the winter they've been milder winters 15 years ago I'd get around 4 feet of ice now the last few winters have been times when I went out there in April which is when it says thickest and there's only two and a half feet of ice and I'm like wow that's crazy I never saw them you know 10 to 15 years ago the other thing is the absolute coldest temperatures since I've been out there three times it went to colder than 60 below zero they were all the first couple winters first two or three winters I don't know if that was just you know coincidence or what I'm not saying this is global warming I'm just telling you what I've seen and like given recent winters where the coldest had ever got was you know once or twice to 45 below one of the first winners I was out there in March for like two weeks it never went above 40 below I haven't seen anything like that in the last four or five winters hmm since I got on the show the coldest temperature we ever saw was one time it went down to about 50 55 below one day for a little while I've seen times like I said where it would literally not go about 40 below for two weeks in March mmm that was first or second euros out there so I said anecdotally yeah that's just look we got a we got a defer to science on this thing I mean they're collecting data all over the world you can see the Arctic oceans there's less ice you can you know measure the temperature of the ocean by sending sound waves through it you can there's all different methods so it doesn't really matter what one person sees in one place but there's a consensus of opinion that's what matters yeah but it is interesting your your own anecdotal experience seeing that the ice is that much thinner and the winters are warmer it is just I'm sure the National Weather Service has all kinds of data on a lot Shore sure I mean wait for instance in Fairbanks Alaska they never used to use any salt on the roads at all the reason being that it was too cold for the salt to work salt will only melt ice if it's a certain temperature if it gets colder than that it doesn't work so they didn't even store salt there the department transportation didn't use it which was nice your vehicles didn't trust out but now there are enough times in the winter when it's warm enough that they actually are using salt in recent years on the roads of Fairbanks and you actually see times when it gets up to freezing there's even freezing rain events in the winter which didn't use to happen hardly ever and now that's not that outlandish to have it you know get up to two freezing in the middle of the winter some days Bigfoot what about Bigfoot I just can't believe people waste their time talking about stuff like that well first someone like you actually lives in the wilderness and you actually live in Alaska which is one of the places where people supposedly spot Bigfoot yeah it's because a lot of nutty people go to Alaska they call them end of the rotors yeah you drive until you can't go any further and then you camp out in the woods for a while and see Bigfoot yeah does Les Stroud really see Bigfoot see how I don't think he's ever seen that she believes it's out there his show sad it makes me sad because he was like a really respected guy doing the survival thing and you know I think it was a really interesting educational show and it showed people how hard it is but then he got hooked up with this guy and he was filming these Bigfoot shows and the guy is completely full of shit there's no like a fucking he's wearing a mask pretending to be Bigfoot in the woods filming it the high-resolution it looks so fake you should see the show the fake cuz it's so dumb it's so dumb it hurts your feelings like you're like what you're doing this Hey but it's real popular that's the problem if you have like a survivor show you might get X amount of people to watch it if you have a Bigfoot show you might get double the number what's that tell you about our culture not good look at this this is the video footage this is he said they said this is a close-up high-resolution of Bigfoot look look at that thing how fake is that he's gonna zoom in on it it says the Todd standing Bigfoot video as seen in survivor man Bigfoot show with Les Stroud what's going on are the people that are watching this stuff actually believing it or they just find it entertaining there's people so stupid it's fun Calma sitting on their couch sitting in front of TV thinking about when they're gonna go to bed or look how dumb that looks man look at this fucking stupid fake Bigfoot face and they're there sitting there going well they wish it was real they wish it was yeah they wish it was want it to be real they want there to be some large primate living by itself in the forest a small number of them not that many just a small number of them know some crazy stuff but it wasn't Bigfoot well here's the thing if there were Bigfoot why wouldn't there be thousands of them all over the place what's gonna stop Bigfoot from breeding Bigfoot would beat the fuck out of a bear kill Mountain wine like what would stop a Bigfoot you're talking about an eight to ten foot tall gorilla what the hell would stop dad that would be the king of the phone what would stop us from seeing the thing and it won't stop us from finding a body yeah would stop us from finding bones yeah just cuz skeletons I mean how about an ancient one you know you know what in a site like you know when they find these mastodons and saber-tooth Tigers and things that existed here ten thousand years ago why don't they find a Bigfoot okay Emma I can't believe it it's it's amazing what people just think how productive we would all be the society if people were putting their energy into something more worthwhile than Bigfoot yeah well you could say that same thing about just surfing Twitter yeah how many how many people are just reading just mindless tweets over and over you're looking for something it's gonna stimulate them that never comes their way hours a day you ever looked at like I looked at my phone the other day I had four I was embarrassed I had four hours of screen time during the day four hours I'm like what could I have some of it was answering text messages some of it was answering emails let's be honest that might have been an hour so like three hours of me just fucking off I could have been writing jokes I could have been you know researching things I could have been I could have been doing a million things I clean mic gotta clean this desk I've done a lot of shit it's kind of cluttered oh my god dude people keep bringing me things just stack them up there you know what I used to really like Charlie Rose remember his show sure it's two guys sitting around table talking yes I kind of when I discovered you I thought I wonder if this guy ever saw Charlie Rose if you were inspired by no I never watched his show I was I was really interested because he had interesting guess mm-hmm you know no I've seen um clips I'm sure I've seen clips of him talking I think he got in some trouble yeah he liked to show his hog it was uh being a little loose with the ladies yeah thing was like women he's working with said he was harassing him yeah shocker yeah that's too bad yeah what it was it was an interesting show it was one of the few TV shows I used to like when I was younger when I had TV well there was a time where you know I think it was really difficult to get people to sit down and have a conversation and so a show like is or any kind of show where people are just sitting down having a conversation particularly without an audience like a lot of these talk shows you see it's the most unnatural environment of all time you're sitting sideways facing a crowd of people that you don't know with lights and cameraman everywhere and you're supposed to act normal yeah like it's the least normal you're ever gonna act you know but those are good too like Phil Donahue remember him oh yeah sure I used to watch it sure yeah yeah that was the same I even talk about something Dick Cavett never see the old Dick Cavett shows is really interesting from the 60s and 70s a little bit yeah well there's videos of I've watched almost all of them on YouTube but it's it's cool it sounds like conversation people like conversations because they like to know how other people are thinking and they kind of decipher that and piece it together through listening to people talk yeah listen man I hope you do your thing on YouTube or somewhere else like that where they give you control I think that would be the really the ultimate thing for you to not have produced look if I had what you were going through at any point this podcast I probably quit if I had producers telling me what to do and how to argue with the network about what kind of guests to have on or you know what you know like we have to review a show why did you talk like this why did you say that I would have never got here it would never it would have never happened don't worry reason why this happened was because the time I created it aligned with technology and it aligned with the ability to get things out in this way mass scale that just didn't exist previously you know and I think that could be expanded to what you do easily especially YouTube something like that or Vimeo or many amenities of the streaming services doing something like that we just have a cameraman and you just have an editor and you and you're out there I mean be magic perfect and you can give the a hundred percent full vision of you you know you don't have to you know you have to have anybody else's input give the vision of what's out there yeah and then you also have a direct line to your fans like if you put it on Facebook and like people that like it or don't like it hey Glen I'm tired of seeing you shit in the woods you know that's the amazing thing about this world is that people can connect yeah yeah it's it's phenomenal yeah it's amazing listen man has been cool to connect with you I really enjoyed this a lot of fun you know we do like three and a half hours thanks for having me down oh really I wasn't paying attention it's almost 3:30 it's a long show yeah it's great though man I really enjoyed it if people want to find you on Facebook please tell them how yeah I'm on Facebook Glen Villa new VI L le and E you ve or new to Instagram I got everything but I'm most active on Facebook that's what
