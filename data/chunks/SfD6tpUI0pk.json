hello freak bitches now as a person who's governor state and you look at the what happens when someone gets in office when when Obama gets in office promises all these things gets in office changes almost everything what are the hurdles I mean what are the differences between the hurdles of someone who governs a state versus someone who governs the United States and how much more difficult is it to change things it seems like the United States is a like like a gigantic ship that takes so much effort to shift even slightly that these presidents get out of office eight years later exhausted looking like they've aged 50 years and very little gets done well I think there is a silver bullet to the system and I hope I'm tying in to what you're saying but I do think there's a silver bullet to the system and that would be term limits I think that for the most part of politicians once they get in office the main concern is to stay and off right and if you had term limits I think that people would do the right thing as opposed to whatever it takes to get mean for Congress and for the Senate Congress Senate anyway right well Supreme Court's another topic but but certainly elected office right agreed yeah I mean you have it for the president why not have it for all I think I'm the best example of term limits I really enjoyed the job I had the opportunity to serve for two terms so I in my estimation I pressed the limits term one but not to the point where I wasn't going to get re-elected and then when I get reelected I started off by saying you know let's examine the drug war in this country I started off by saying that marijuana should be legalized taking on what I thought at the time was and it still remains so as one of those really fixable things in our lives that would make the world a better place but because of term limits I was emboldened because I man I was getting out of office and there was no return right what are your thoughts on all the other recreational drugs not just marijuana but the more controversial ones like maybe cocaine or psilocybin LSD things on those long so when I was governor of New Mexico I had a I went to Portland Oregon and judges in Portland Oregon there were judges that wanted to meet with me in Portland and so I went to meet with these judges and I didn't know what the what it was gonna be about but it was six judges Portland Oregon State district judges I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label but what they said was was hey governor Johnson we just we're here to tell you we completely agree with everything it is that you're saying but we would like to share with you some stories here that maybe you can pass on to others that will allow others to better understand the drug issue they said that the really horrible drug out there is methamphetamine that people that use methamphetamine really have their behavior altered and not in a good way so it's really the boogieman drug out there they said methamphetamine is the best example that we can think of of a prohibition drug it exists because it's cheap and it's easy to make and what they said was was that hey we're not suggesting the following but if cocaine were legal these people would be using cocaine instead of methamphetamine without the negative behavioral consequence and that's true but if the government were to tell the truth when it comes to cocaine cocaine puts holes in your heart people that use cocaine their entire lives are stereotypically Whitney Houston that die before they're 50 because they die of a heart attack from using cocaine now will there still be people that will use cocaine knowing that they might die of a heart attack I think I think there'd be less cocaine use if people actually knew the truth and could trust government when it comes to the truth I just maintain that 90% of the drug problem is prohibition related not use related and that is not to discount the problems with use and abuse but that should be the focus when you have 8000 death a year in this country 8,000 which is staggeringly low due to cocaine and heroin overdose and people will immediately say well yeah the number is so low because it's illegal no you can argue that if it were legal if quality quantity was known it's arguable that those deaths would significantly decrease although there will always be people that will commit suicide always be people that will push the limits yes you're you're always gonna have people that abuse everything everything everything every mean we're we're living in a culture that has alcohol available at every block all over the world I mean everywhere you go there's a restaurant or a bar or somewhere that you can buy enough alcohol to drink yourself to death it's it's readily available yet when you consider the amount of people that actually drink alcohol the the low number of deaths is pretty incredible and it's because we're aware of the effects of alcohol and it's pretty when you get a bottle of Jack Daniels it is pretty consistent well but there are 100,000 deaths a year that are contributed that get contributed to alcohol consumption and I'm not talking about drinking and driving or violence committed to see alcohol abuse alcohol abuse statistically no one dies from marijuana so obviously what I was gonna get to was that when you look at what's happening in Colorado one of the more interesting things is the Lessing of violent crime and drunk driving those are two effects that have dropped pretty drastically noticeably statistically because of the legalization of marijuana that you would reduce because of the legalization of a less harmful more peaceful drug you would reduce the effects of what's right now a readily available and incredibly prevalent drug I have always maintained that legalizing marijuana will make for a better planet on the medicinal side of marijuana marijuana products directly compete with legal prescription drugs painkillers antidepressants that statistically kill a hundred thousand people a year no no documented death due to marrow on the recreational side I've always maintained that legalizing marijuana will lead to less overall substance abuse because people are gonna find it as such a safer alternative than everything else that's out there starting with alcohol the campaign to legalize marijuana in Colorado was a campaign based on marijuana is safer than alcohol and Joe as you were pointing out all the statistics that all the naysayers were gonna go south have gone have gone better there are less traffic instance there's less overall crime in the state of Colorado Colorado is vibrant and does it have to do with marijuana I think that that's an ingredient comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant right now unquestionably unquestionably and I think a prime example of how screwy the system gets when people lobby against the legalization of things that don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp is illegal federally and that we're trying to make it legal and trying to make it legal statewide in various states and start production of hemp but hemp is not psychoactive it's crazy we we can sell hemp products in this country but they they come from China my desire of my company on it we buy it from Canada we buy hemp protein from Canada and grow it in America we can import it but we can't grow it CBD CBD oil yes same thing not psychoactive helps pain very effective for people not getting people high it's not ruining lives it's not doing anything but there's a lot of people that are concerned that are making money off of the alternatives especially with hemp I mean that was the reason why marijuana was made illegal in the first place that's the reason the conspiracy of DuPont promote nylon as opposed to and and of course the William Randolph Hearst vapor factories they made they made marijuana illegal but because the marijuana plant and the hemp plant look the same then hence hemp was also made illegal yeah that was the conspiracy yeah well that's I mean that's all been proven so it's we're in a strange time that it's 2016 it's still illegal getting it's slowly starting to become legal and people starting to I believe in Kentucky and a few other states they're allowing farmers to profit off of this incredibly vibrant plan that's easy to grow doesn't require pesticides has a variety of uses as a textile as a commodity for food full amino acid profile it makes amazing clothes and make this jacket I mean if it's if the marijuana plant were discovered today in the Amazon it would be hailed as the greatest discovery of humankind yeah in 1999 good news bad news here in 1999 I was the highest elected official in the United States to call for the legalization of marijuana in 2016 bad news I'm still the highest elected official in the United States to call for the legalization of marijuana although Bernie Sanders apparently rolled out of bed hit his head and now he's come to that same epiphany wonderful I'm glad but in 1999 a roll out of his head weld that he came to this epiphany at this point in his life he's never said it before uh-uh no not until he's been running for for Senate so you think it's like one of those lick your finger put it up in the air check where the breeze is going I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd win it but but in 1999 30 percent of Americans supported legalizing marijuana in 2016 60 percent of Americans now are supporting the legalization of marijuana and not one politician outside of Bernie Sanders in office is aspect and when I say elected official at the Congressional senatorial or gubernatorial level not one politician in that group outside of Bernie Sanders myself have a spouse legalizing marijuana I think and what a disconnect what an incredible disconnect between what people think and our elected officials
