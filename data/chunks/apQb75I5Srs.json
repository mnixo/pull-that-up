recipes alright a lot we lied to shit worden BAM when your each other damn hello welcome to my weekly podcast I'm so low then we shut the door so nobody interrupts us Shazam I'm back riding totally 100% solo this time here to answer your questions talk to you see what the fuck's going on out there in the wild world of Twitter thank you everybody that tuned into the show we did yesterday on Sirius I did a show for an hour yesterday on raw dog and I'm gonna try to do that more often because it's fun and it's just uh it's fun to do even for a goof but it's a great way to promote gigs and you know get things crackin not this weekend as in tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday but next weekend next Friday not exactly sure the date I'll be at Gotham I think it's the 26th what's this day 7-days yeah the 26th the 26th I'll be at Gotham for two shows in New York City I don't get to New York City very often I only go there like once every year and a half two years and it's already almost sold out so if you want to get tickets you got to hop on that shit now Gotham comedy club in New York City you know how to use the Google Sun I would throw up links but if you really want to go you'll figure it out right so get Eddie on my podcast I will definitely Brian is supposed to beat my lips Bryan was supposed to be here today for this one but he got held in traffic and he is getting getting boned by the IRS he owes and back taxes pay your taxes bitches that's a Uncle Joe's advice for the day pay your fucking taxes the worst thing is when the IRS like signals you out singles you out as a guy who's not paying taxes and then they just crawl up your asshole and look around the tax laws are so gross the whole thing is so gross the idea that you have to pay such a giant percentage of what you make to do what to keep more people resting people for buying pot to do what to fix the streets is that where the fuck is the money going goddamn it our machine is just too goddamn big you know when you get to a certain amount of money you get into a forty eight percent tax bracket you know yeah that's when you have you have to pay half of what you make half literally that's crazy um the crazy thing is is the people who make them more money the more money you make rather the the higher percentage you have to pay so not only do you pay more money just because you make more money which seems that seems rational to me but the fact that you pay a higher percent that's just like saying listen we know you got it fuck you give us the money I mean it's really that simple it doesn't make any sense that someone who makes more money somehow or another uses a higher percentage of resources that's completely unfair it makes no sense but people just accept it they just accept it and just taking the ass and the machine keeps rolling on there will be no end or will there will go to first the Twitter to check it out the Twitter feed that is on the Ustream page which is Ustream TV channel slash Joe - Govind - live which will that's where you're at and then also go to forums joe rogan net that's my website and there's a forum up there dedicated to this particular rather a threat dedicated to this particular broadcast and so I'll answer some questions from there too you motherfucker pull out of Iran Afghan and you'd save a fortune yeah what is that well that's a mean that's a simple way of looking at it right CMC dermo 73 it's a simple way of looking at everybody says pull out but why the fuck are we there in the first place like what is going on you know I mean is it as simple as you know we're over there because we need to keep these terrorists from becoming strong we need to go and attack them at their base okay if if that was what was agreed that that's the reason why we're there but there's a lot of people that say that doesn't make any sense there's a lot of people that say this very few Taliban that are actually left in Afghanistan that we have other motives and that these motives might be the natural gas pipeline that runs through Afghanistan which everybody apparently has been trying to control for years or it also very overlooked and a subject that people like they kind of poopoo it and they make it seem like it's not that big a deal is the opium market Afghanistan produces some 90 something percent of the entire world's opium the entire world's poppy seeds entire world heroin more than 90% of it is produced in Afghanistan that's fucking crazy right you hear about that you're like that's up there's a lot of goddamn money in heroin there's a lot of goddamn money in opium I mean if all of it is being produced literally almost all of it in this one place like someone's making some fucking money off that it's not a date the u.s. got in there and they stopped making heroin no there's more heroin now heroin apparently we talk to people no you know I know people do heroin and they they say there's more heroin and it's easier to get now you know what the fuck man what what is really going on then you find out that the president left of Afghanistan this is absolute fact President of Afghanistan his brother was being paid by the CIA for years like our government dollars were going to pay the brother of the President of Afghanistan who's in the poppy business this guy is involved in the opium trade this guy is involved in the heroin trade and he's an employee of the CIA like really is it that blatant is that obvious there's for sure there's a ton of fucking corruption when it comes to the the higher levels of government but I think really selling drugs are they really doing it that openly it seems ridiculous right it seems like there's no way that could be possible there's no way it could be that corrupt if it was we would have heard about it but when you start researching the history of the CIA like they've been accused of doing this forever not just accused of doing this but people who don't make any sense like crazy people and you know internet conspiracy theorists but no they've been accused of doing it by people who used to work for the CIA they've been accused of doing it by people who've actually flown in the drugs there's a great case about a guy named Barry seals from Mena Arkansas this case - driving flying to Mena Arkansas and drop off big packages of cocaine I think we talked about this before I talked about this before and anyway these two kids inadvertently were there when the cocaine got dropped they were they witnessed you know what had happened so they took these kids and they murdered them and they left their bodies on the train tracks and the excuse the official excuse that the police used was that these kids had gotten high and that they had fallen asleep on the plane tracks because they were on drugs well the mothers of the the kids forced autopsies the parents forced autopsies they didn't want to do autopsies but they forced them they got them done and turns out that these kids have been murdered they had been stabbed multiple times before they had been put on these train tracks so then the investigation goes further and it turns out this guy named Barry seals who's a CIA employee and there's you know documented this guy's got a great long history with the CIA there's you know tons of pictures just tons of you know documentation on this guy and this guy was flying in drugs from South America and that's what he did he did it for the CIA and right when he was about to go testify the guy gets murdered he gets assassinated with George Bush's phone number in his pocket um so there's that guy there's there's another guy named Michael Rupert Michael Rupert has a website now and he's got a bunch of books on the whole situation but his story is that he was working for the LAPD I'm not sure if he worked in narcotics but he's involved somehow or another in some narcotics case and it turns out that the CIA was involved and the CIA was protecting these people in the CIA was selling drugs and he went to try to report it they squashed everything and he just went public with everything and it's you know he gets very little attention I mean it's really shocking how little attention he gets but he's a fascinating do this Michael Rupert guy he's got a couple really fascinating books I think the end of the Rubicon is one and that's the one I've read and there's uh he's got he's got a few other ones so it's basically like going into great depth and detail all of his research on the CIA and their involvement drugs why why would they do that why would our government do that fucking there's a lot of goddamn money on it I think they could justify that there's so much money involved in drugs and someone's going to make that money people are addicted to drugs like why don't we make that money and at least that money is being made by the good guys I mean that's like the most idealistic point of view make sure your kids don't do drugs make sure no one loves do does drugs but let's be honest there are people out there that are going to do drugs and if anybody should make the money it should be the good guys I can see people falling for that but the bottom line is it's it's all greed it's all this nasty evil greed that that's the whole reason why some drugs are legal and some drugs are illegal it's because when they make them illegal they can control what you do they can you can't control things that are really easy to grow like marijuana it's one of the main reasons why marijuana is illegal is because it's so goddamn easy to grow you just plant seeds out a field it'll grow on its own you know you need to help I mean it's a really Hardy plant and I know a lot of morons that grow pot and when you know it's an easy thing to do like that you can't control that you know they're not going to be able to control it there's going to be people selling it left and right they're not going to get taxes from that because people are just going to exchange cash or whatever the fuck they're going to do with it you're not going to be able to wrap something up the way that you can wrap up oxycontin's or something like that you know it's very difficult to produce an oxycontin you know they like that they don't like heroin heroin is just like what are you doing you're growing a plant and then you're scraping some shit off the plant and yourself no stop that's illegal we won't let you do that but we will let you buy these pills that are basically the same goddamn thing they're just made by pharmaceutical company and they process it and they make this orally ingestible heroin and that's what oxycontin is I mean it literally they call it hillbilly heroin it's fucking heroin it really is heroin you're just eating it you know you're eating it in a pill form just like Marinol is THC in a pill form but that stuff's supposed to suck I've talked to people that say that principle THC zhilie one active element in marijuana there's a whole bunch it's way better to get the actual stuff from the plant you know I don't know if that's true with heroin I've never done here when I've never done marinelle either I wouldn't do heroin I'm scared of anything that's addictive but if I was a musician I might consider it I'm like I'm like snore it a little every now and then you know write down once today and never again or something try to convince myself that somehow or another wouldn't be addictive I don't know how addictive it really is I hear varying reports you know that the problem I have with whenever someone talks about things being addictive and not being addicted is that alcohol is addictive you know people get addicted to alcohol but I'm not addicted to it so I don't get that I mean I can I could if someone told me right now I could never have another beer another glass of wine for the rest of my life I'd be like okay I mean I enjoy it I like having a shot every now and then my friends just to get fucking crazy a shot before a show is fun but realistically it's not that important you know I don't hate it it's not really addictive to me but to some people it is okay is that the case with heroin is that the case with cigarettes seem to be the one they've got the most wired cigarette seems to be the one thing they can indict the most people to you know because there's a lot of people that don't get addicted to the normal stuff like there's a lot of people that drink coffee and they drink it all the time but they can just quit and doesn't bother them at all and there's some people that they if they don't have coffee every day they're fucked those people are addicted to caffeine when I was writing my blog I was writing a monthly blog right before I recorded my my comedy my spike TV comedy special I wanted to make sure I kept my brain like real sharp and I said well the best way to do that is to perform as much as I can but also write as much as I can so I forced myself into writing a blog every day for a whole month and when I did that you know I was drinking a lot of coffee and I was drinking French press coffee well it's like it's really fucking strong you know and I make it strong - I like it I like a strong cup of coffee but the problem is I was drinking this shit like two three cups a day and then I did it like 30 days in a row and there's one point in time where I didn't drink it for a day and I had a headache it was like oh like my brain was getting accustomed to having all these stimulants in it and then I realized okay this is not good I got to stop that show lately have a drink of tea try and turn me on to this thing this is like this you put the tea leaves in there and then you put the water in there and you can it like you don't have to like have a tea bag you get like fresh tea leaves taste good it's just like I sometimes I need something warm to drink it's like it's just like like my friend Tate he says the best I said cough coffees like a warm hug but I got addicted to coffee but uh I mean it was only addicted for a couple days couple days I'm not drinking in just drinking water and everything was back to normal again luckily but this is 30 days in a row not 30 years in a row you I couldn't imagine that but cigarettes seem to be the one that they've got the most nailed as to how to just get you fucking hooked you know um there's a an article that I read recently where they were discussing all the different additives that the government allows them to put in cigarettes and there's 599 of them how fucking nuts is that there's 599 different chemicals and you look at them unless you're some sort of a Pharma chemist sort of a character you're not going to have any idea what the fuck they are and there's five hundred ninety nine of them in cigarettes aren't cigarettes just supposed to be fucking tobacco like what the fuck is going on what is that I mean is it up are they preservatives is it is it like that Russell Crowe movie The Insider is all that shit actually designed to make it more addictive it's one of the most damning things I think about politicians is that they never talk about cigarettes you know they're always wanted they always want to talk about the ill you know the bad drugs out there and you know this terrible thing that can happen if your kids get involved in drugs but nobody wants a banned cigarettes like nobody ever says that and it's because those fucking tobacco companies spend a bankroll they spent a fuckload of money all right what else let me go to the questions here there's a lot of questions and they keep moving fast and I'm a rambling motherfucker Joe wear a different color shirt in the UFC broadcast next time no no I like wearing black shirts and I get them for free I get clothes from affliction for free send me some cool shit so that I don't make fun of them anymore I like their stuff I like some of their stuff there's there were some Scully stuff that was just a little too Scully and flamey for me but uh I got a pair of the dragon jeans they got dope leather jackets too and I like their uh the Japanese styled stuff they had all I forget the man's name a tattoo artist designed a bunch of t-shirts for them that were really fucking cool like right up my alley like Tiger vs. samurai type stuff I got a bunch of those I love those but apparently that that guy he was selling his same designs to a couple different t-shirt companies they had to get rid of them because it's a some sort of a copyright lawsuit then go on affliction pros were fuckin brutal Edie Hardy is the most brutal to me ed hardy should assassinate John from Johnny Kate Plus eight because that guy single-handedly made ed hardy shirts like that is just like that's the gold stamp bang douchebag like when that guy started wearing it everywhere like I think ed hardy was probably paying him but little did they know that uh that just put the fuckin the douche label on the ed hardy there's a chick that's a one of the morning DJs in Denver I name is Missy and she calls them douche capes which is the perfect way to describe them douche capes it's impressions here that you guys like the raw dog show that was fun it was real fun am i coming to Australia anytime again soon I'll be in Australia next time the UFC is gonna be there I really can't fly over there just just to fly over there at the time it's too long 16 fucking hours in the air I enjoyed the shit out of the I had a great goddamn time that Strongest Man dude that's gonna fight tim sylvia aaron davies ask me a question there's this guy pooja now skis like one of the one strongman competition like many times and he's scheduled to fight tim sylvia it was a former UFC heavyweight champion I'm looking at fighting everybody's like don't watch see this fight it's a great fight is a great fight tim sylvia can fight like just kids Ray Mercer knocked him out just kids like he's lost to a couple different guys like phaidor this is a big goddamn difference if she loses the phaidor and losing to a guys had one fight and it's really good at lifts and shit that guy's gonna get his ass handed to him if tense if tim sylvia loses that fight to something wrong he's got something wrong with him and he probably shouldn't fight anymore i think tim sylvia should be able to keep that dude at bay I mean it always is big and strong I mean I just cannot see a world where Tim Sylvia doesn't bomb on that guy ice is coming in you know I mean I could be wrong he could just get completely overwhelmed by the power but technique is more important than power and fighting and if one guy I mean you can hate on Tim Sylvia all you want the guy was the UFC heavyweight champion and he wasn't because he sucked go watch his fight with Rico Rodriguez you know watch watch some of his fights you know watch the when he had kicked ray telligman he's fucking dangerous man tim sylvia is one of the most underrated and underlooked guys yeah I got knocked out by Ray Mercer but guess what Ray Martin acts on your head like that everyone's going out he definitely fucked up and he definitely didn't fight smart in that fight without a doubt but you can't write him off just because of one performance he still accomplished a lot of dangerous shit he's always been a sucker for that over here right that's what shouldn't say a sucker but he's getting hit got hit with it before Randy Couture dropped him with it that's where a loss key hit him with and that's all so obviously we're a mercy hit him with you know he's got a lazy jab they said but I think that pooja now ski guys like wow you're jumping into the deep end of the pool son you know Tim so he's not that old tim sylvia has had some tough fights but not that much no I think that's gonna be a real tough fight for that push now ski guys I've everyone I could be wrong he might chuckles running fucking leg kicks like he did to that other dude we just basically ran out of like a bowl but that other guy comparing him to tim sylvia is just ridiculous he's smaller he's not as nearly experienced he's just a boxer is I mean there's so many differences between the first guy he thought and fighting the UFC heavyweight champ that's fucking that's pretty crazy he might not even get to him because he's got to fight in between then he's got to fight before that I think in April he's fighting someone else and he's gonna fight Tim sylia right after that he might not beat that guy that he's fighting in April I mean if a guy knows how to fight it's just a big goddamn difference Cheney guy was just strong he's gonna leave openings man you know if he leaves open someone's gonna catch him and if someone's gonna catch him he can't put muscles in your face and you know I mean I don't know exactly what kind of a background he has and fighting other than being super strong but didn't look like much he looked real stiff you know I mean once he hits you if he gets ahold of you starts hitting you you're fucked but it's all that before you get to hold you stuff that's like it's all turkey jerky you know all muscle no technique you know it's a thing it's gotta be interesting but when your guys that strong last do it learn a few techniques get them really good and fuck I mean you're talking about a guy that literally is that one of the strongest men to walk the planet you know if you could teach that guy teach that guy some some solid wrestling teach that guy like it's just a good amount you know just a few moves just teach them how to keep his hands up close the distance teach them some takedowns and teach him to get on top of dudes and just smush their fucking head you know a guy like that if you taught him some shit he would only need a few things just because he's so goddamn strong a few things you'd be able to beat a lot of guys Tim Sylvia oh I don't know but that's on I don't know about that time let's see what else we got here I watched a video today of a dude who cut his fucking balls off the dude somebody posted it on my message board and this guy it says something crazy Oz man or deranged Ozzie man as the thread cuts his balls off this guy tied a rubber band around his balls until his balls like literally died like they turned like like dead and gray and then he hacked his balls off with a knife really um do you want to see it if you want to see it you know what I'll throw the link I just let everybody know that it's fucking completely disgusting there's no way you should really watch this but if you want to I will copy the link and I'm going to post it on Twitter and I'm gonna say do not watch this okay I just posted on Twitter don't watch it you don't need to unless unless someone has done you wrong unless you're unless maybe Sandra Bullock is out there Sandra I know that you've had some tough times recently and I saw recently online the photos of this young lady that Jesse James allegedly is how to fare with and you might want to watch the video of the guy cut his balls off the rest of you know but this is a message to Sandra Bullock you need to know sweetie that there's a broad spectrum to human being since human behavior and it's you know life isn't what you see at the craft service table when everyone's kissing your ass on the set there's a lot of crazy shit out there and this crazy fucking skank with a tattoo on her forehead fucked your husband it's a mad world it's a fucking mad world if you looked at Sandra Bullock and you looked at Jesse James you know you'd say well you know he's a rough fucking handsome character and she's a beautiful woman and they make a great couple uh and I showed you this freak with the tattooed on her head this this crazy bitch that he's apparently been banging and I said would the Aussie think that he would cheat on her for to do it what the fuck is that no just Jesse James right this guy's a fucking TV star he's married to Sandra Bullock he's not gonna fuck this crazy bitch with a tattoo on her head but yeah I did and why did he do it because people are fucking deranged people are crazy they can't help themselves they they're looking for something to fucking just just a blow energy out somehow just what are they gonna do to some drugs cheating their wife drive too fast get a motorcycle what the fuck are they gonna do if you read Tiger Woods's stuff and I can't fucking help it some new skank came out with all his Twitter's or not not as Twitter's his text messages that he sent to her mind first of all what kind of relationship do you have with these girls that they would want to put his like D even or was even friends with them it seems like these girls like don't even like they didn't even talk to him it seems like you know like it was this this thing was just all fucking and because of that I think they were like they felt slighted and that's what I'm getting out of this I'm getting that they felt slighted you know that here's this guy with like the most squeaky-clean image in the world and this image is what he used to make a ton of money and you know he's like a super successful guy at the most you know like lucrative sport in the world and the mother sport the most connected to money to big businesses to mean so many like it's so important to be like the best golfer ever my god it's just such a huge thing like to market and sell then so here was this guy and meanwhile he's just a dirty bitch just talking about taking it out her ass stuffing in their mouth like those in his taxes like this motherfucker was crazy you know it's it's pretty clear that it's it's more than just oh you know he thought he could get away with it oh you know he's just a man and no no no he was deranged all right people are crazy he was getting a wild thrill from doing this thing that he wasn't supposed to be doing was all like naughty shit you want to piss on girls to saying I want to give you a golden shower but the crazy thing is Tiger Woods with scented text I want stuff my cock in your ass and put in your mouth like whoa Tiger whoa like man if you're gonna send a text like that to someone you got to make sure that that person is your friend oh god Sam you can just if you're fucking Tiger Woods you can't just go send in text like that the people you know you got to go hey um if I show up sent you attacks and it's really crazy will you promise me that you won't sell this later you gotta say something you can just just fuck it free ball like that Tiger does Tiger Woods have any fucking friends cuz I feel like if you had any friends they were going dude what are you doing like you're banging waitresses and people are watching you know like you're gonna you take it down a notch you know you know yeah you know get a hooker who has something to lose well who has something to lose in comparison to him no nobody if you're a guy like that you can really never trust anybody you know if that's what you're doing if you're a wild guy that likes to cheat on your wife and you're a fucking billionaire super squeaky-clean character who the fuck can you trust like that guy man what a predicament he would have to go somewhere where they didn't know we it was they'd have to go to like Malaysia to cheat poor fella poor fella what do I think of James tell me I'm disturbed by James Tony his recent speeches you know um oh I don't know what's going on with him physically you know I don't know I mean I guess he wants to fight heavyweight I've heard that he says he wants to fight brock lesnar if that's the case i think maybe the best thing to do to get this over with is just given brock lesner you know I mean if Dame James Tony loses to somebody the way I look at is like James Tony obviously all the respect in the world as a boxer all time you know really one of the craftiest guys to come along in decades and I really utilize that old like arching more shoulders you know like shoulder roll style like had a real classic old-timers boxing style like real good at like like rolling with punches then coming back with his counter right hands against John Ruiz there's like a YouTube clip of them like you see how beautiful his timing was and like when he just destroyed Evander Holyfield in their fight man he's so he's so skillful as a boxer very very skillful but there's so much more to MMA than just boxing and I'm not hearing about him going to American Top Team I'm not hearing about him going to Team Quest I'm not hearing about him going to you know to like high-level camps to work with big wrestlers then I try to take him down because otherwise I'm hearing him say he's going to fight Brock Lesnar I'm hearing one of two things I'm either here and he doesn't give a fuck he's just here to get paid or I'm hearing he is crazy and he thinks that he's going to be able to stop Brock Lesnar from taking him down by hitting with a punch either one it's not good because one of them means he's delusional that he doesn't really understand what this is all about and the other one means that he's just a guy was looking for money either one it's not that good I don't know you know I don't know boxing is a tough goddamn game and when you've been in as long as James Toney ass even though he doesn't take that much punishment you know you got you got to realize these guys at a certain point time you know they only have you only have a certain amount more punches you can take you know there's at a certain there's a finite number and after that number you're fucked you know and I think the thing with James Toney is he has this incredible confidence in his hands and he really truly believes that if a guy like Brock Lester tries to take him down that he's going to be able to connect and with those little gloves he's going to put him to sleep I think it looks a lot easier than it is that's what I think I think if he starts training with high-level guys he goes and you know work out with you know team mo work out with some like high-level wrestlers and see how easy it is for those guys to take you down you know you think you're just going to catch it with an uppercut you can't throw punches the same way when you're worried about a guy taking you down you don't the timing is not the same you can't stand the same way if you stand the same way they're going to kick your legs out and they're going to take you down easy so you have to change your stance so you not have to change your stance as a boxer you have to constantly be thinking about sprawling constantly be thinking about getting your underhook set it's not it's not the same sport it's not the punching ability that he asked is a huge plus and it'll definitely if anybody is stupid enough to not try to take him down and just box with him you're gonna get your clock cleaned you know for sure he's gonna hit you with some precise counter punches he's gonna take advantage of little tiny mining openings because really he's such a high-level boxer we don't see that high level of striker in the Octagon he can make you guys look foolish if somebody chose some crazy boxer you know in the UFC a guy who's got good hands chose to try to stand up just stand up with James Toney he would make him look like a fool he really would really demoralize that he would talk shit to them he would he was talking to bitch look bitch won't somebody's bitch boom and he would keep just land and punches on you he will fuck your world up but I don't think they're gonna do that I think guys gonna do one of two things they're gonna kick the living fuck out of his legs or they're just gonna take him down and I don't think he's hitting me oh stop that I don't think even I was top down I don't think you know if he got like a big jujitsu God gets all of them like a life like Nepal Gabriel Gonzaga Gabriel Gonzaga got all the Jesus Christ he might just start breaking pieces of them off you know and if God help them if Brock Lesnar wants to take them down you can't we can't just catch that guy with a punch that's not enough okay that's that's enough for your average regular human Brock Lesnar that's that's a freak of a man that's a like the high end of the genetic spectrum or you like you know you can have a dude who looks like Ichabod Crane you know you could ever do who looks like you know like who's olive oil in that Popeye movie what's that bitch's name mm-hmm bitches I'm so mean Shelly something another whatever her name is realest nigga Lindsay Lohan you can have a Lindsay Lohan frame you know Paris Hilton my frame little skinny body or you have the high end you have breakfast or some weird instance where you know Vikings fucked Vikings for generation after generation and their warrior bloodlines were passed on and this motherfucker living in the woods in Minnesota you know he got the best of the best fucking head is that big you know I mean that guy for sure has good wrestling for sure works very hard on his technique and all that's well and good but at the end of the day that motherfucker is a barbarian the reason why he's so fucking good he is a direct descendants from ancient giant warriors from thousands of years ago that's that ain't a regular dude man he ain't gonna just be able to punch that guy and send him home packing no he's going to eat your punch and he's gonna pick you up in the air like you're a pillow and you're gonna feel so bad you're gonna feel terrible the feeling that you're gonna have of helplessness and hopelessness when that fucking gorilla grabs ahold you and Yanks you up in the air and smashes you and then gets on top of you and starts boom boom those big fucking lunchbox fists that's a wrap son you're done okay you're not you're not gonna jab and shoulder roll your way away from Brock Lesnar he's gonna fuck you he's gonna do whatever he wants to you he's gonna have you work for him you're gonna own him he's gonna be he's gonna be your master he's gonna put a dog collar on you he's gonna do whatever the fuck he wants do you not understand that like that guy can do whatever he wants to you if we didn't live in this civilized culture thousands years ago everyone that Broad was there fought would be chained up in his yard they would work for him and they would just hope and pray that Brock doesn't get angry and decide to fuck you up today you know that's that's a scary dude man you know is he the best guy in the world I don't know he's got a fight phaidor he's gotta fight Shane Carwin you know he's go we got to see what happens we gotta see what happens with fucking Cain Velasquez Cain Velasquez is a motherfucker whoo that guy's frightening the talented frighteningly talented and frighteningly dedicated you know incredible technique to and everything he does his punches his takedowns his kicks everything is perfect technique there's no fluff in his and his technique is no fat you know there's no like excess movement like the way he throws leg kicks got down beautiful just perfect technique the way throws punches same thing everything is perfect technique his endurance is like second to none you know I'm super super impressed we came Velasquez I think he's just stays I'm amazing you know the big question is does all that amazing cardio and technique and and and and discipline does that make up for the great white warrior you know does it make up for that big fucking freak of a monster like Brock Lester you know that's an angry motherfucker dude when a dude beats your ass like you did to Frank Mir and then still get to the fucking camera start screaming fuck to have fuckin he's screaming spits coming out of his mouth and his mouth pieces falling out you like what the fuck you just beat his ass and you're still mad and then it gets in Frank Mears phase you fucking talking shouldn't like whoa like that's that is a guy who's got a lot of pent-up shit I mean when you're 290 fucking plus pounds of muscle and your body's covered with swords he's got like swords and skulls and death it's all like axes and swords and destruction it actually says kill them all on his lower back he's got a tramp stamp that says kill em all be em all whoa who's that therefore it says Gary fucking dude man that's a real angry motherfucker and it's real interesting to see you know I would love to I really want to see him versus phaidor that is a very very intriguing fight to me because they represent such polar opposites in phaidor you have a God as you know relatively small heavyweight he's just about six feet tall he weighs about 230 and he's got a considerable amount of fat on him I mean I would say like probably at least twenty pounds of fat like he's got a lot of jiggly fat he doesn't try to lose weight at all you know he just says anyway this is it this is what I weigh I'm gonna fight as a heavy weight you know there's a broad contrast between him his personality you know he's very stoic you you never see any expression out of him I mean everybody like comments on the fact that the dude like never seems angry never makes a mean face never seen he's heard no matter if he's cut burden matter if he's got the guy hurt and he's finishing him off he's just got this dead expression whereas Brock Lesnar is gigantic has to cut weight to make 265 he's a guy who you know is at the very top of the weight class and he's a guy who is just flooded with emotion flooded with anger flooded with expression I mean he where's he is you know one of those no-nonsense motherfuckers he wears who he is out on his sleeve you know and he likes to talk a little shit it gets angry at people and and he likes to swear and you know I mean he's a he likes to stick the bird out the audience and you know when they bloom fuck you you know he's a totally different dude be very curious to see those two approaches and see which one would ultimately prevail because it's really not I mean it is fair but it's not fair because Brock is so much goddamn bigger Brock is a lean 265 and when he's 265 he's cutting a little weight to be down there you know he'll drop some water weight like maybe 10 15 pounds you know to get down so he's inflated you know well up till like 280 by the time he actually gets in the archive you know just solid as a fucking house at 280 whereas phaidor you know to 30 that's 50 pounds less is not nearly a solid you know phaidor at 230 it's known as jiggly you know it doesn't matter if he connects to your face you know he's a badass puncher his jujitsu is fantastic his grappling is fantastic he's great off of his back but there's a that's a big difference man that you know when all things are equal and I'm not saying they are skill wise because I do not believe they are I think Fodor is more skillful and has more options to win the fight but rockets so fucking big he's so much bigger when you're talking about 50 pounds of bone and muscle 50 fucking pounds that's a significant advantage and then on top of that you're dealing with a guy who's this freak athlete you know it's not just that he's big but big and lumbering like they've had guys that were big and lumbering dudes that have fought in an a before they just they were never like this motherfucker the way Brock moves he moves like a white guy even though he's a giant guy he's a freak athlete you know I mean he really is the descendants of some fucking crazy warrior tribe that's why he's got all this you know angry energy to him that shit's genetic a lot of it gotta be so that's my answer that question all right that was the going off of the Ustream shit so I'm going to go to the Joe Rogan dotnet forum and we'll see what kind of questions we got up in that bitch we've got two pages of questions and a lot of them are joke questions jokey jokey joke bebe John says hey Joe what do you know is that a rhetorical question I know I know I know not enough my friend I know not enough nor do any of us that is the great unfortunate truth I'll say yeah how do you feel about the Pope knowing that child sex-abuse was going on and he didn't say anything about it when he was a priest in Germany I think they're all fucking freaks I think there's only one way you can be a guy who dedicates your entire life to not having sex the only way is your sexual deviant there's something wrong with you I don't believe there's any priests that aren't really completely fucked up I think it's one of the craziest ways that anyone can ever make make a living get through life it doesn't make any sense to me you're a what you're a fucking priest so wait a minute do you get to a different heaven than the people that get pussy and get to have a good time no you get to the same heaven so by doing what you do what everybody has to listen to you and give you money and you get to fuck the kids like what is that about it doesn't make any sense because it's it totally goes against what the idea religion should be all about religion should be all about it's like God's Word to everyone on how to live your life why did it happen these guys that spread God's Word they don't get to have sex what's that about why do they why are they so fucked up I'll tell you why because initially preset too much goddamn power you know a long time ago priests were allowed to have sex but the problem was they were fucking everyone because those are the guys that were in charge of god those were the guys that were talking to God those were the guys that were they were at the front of the fucking God line they had the Willy Wonka golden ticket and they were reading the Word of God in a village you know of several hundred people the guy who's the fucking priest who speaks the Word of God and has to console all these women and you know maybe these women there with husbands and you know are tired of fucking him and this priest would love to teach step in and take some of that what's up I'll give you some God knowledge now give me some head and that shit was going on left and right and that's why priests can't fuck the reason why priests are a lot of fuck is because they were fucking everybody so then well who the hell wants to be priests if you can't fuck you know once they told they couldn't fuck anymore what they did well they probably some of them probably kept fucking and said yeah I'll stop and they kept banging people then they got caught they probably got flogged or something terrible like that and so then they really cracked down and made sure that the priests are not allowed to have sex anymore well once they started doing that then the only people that want to be priests were either gays who could be with other priests and they just like keep it on the sneak sneak and bang each other or pedophiles because they had access to all these children these children had listened to the overwhelming amount I mean just it hurts your head to think about how many fucking kids have been sexually abused by the Catholic Church I mean it really hurts your head it really hurts to think that all these people are so blinded by a fucking fairy tale that they're willing to let some criminal some monster fuck their kids after all these years the fact that that is still going on that is mind-boggling it is mind boggling that we pay any attention to this fucking silly cult and no one can say this no politician can say this because for sure no one's going to vote for you if you come out and say this is nonsense and if there is a God for sure these are not his words this is the word of man how the I mean if you just analyze religion I mean just as I mean let's let's say that once upon a time it was word of the Word of God who the fuck knows I don't know you don't know I mean if there really is a God I always said I've done things that were so much crazier than the stories that people tell about heaven when you smoked DMT and you've communicated in another with beings that are made out of love and understanding and they're they're super knowledgeable they know everything about life and everything about you when you've seen something like that and someone wants to talk to you and tell you that they've seen you know a guy in the cloud with a harp and who need to tell him that he's full of shit you're talking about something that you've actually experienced and I've actually experienced it's way more fucking crazy than angels with wings and dude in the clouds with a big book of who gets in and who doesn't that's way less crazy than the things that I've actually experienced and this thing that you actually experience when you die this DMT the stuff that when you die this is what your brain produces when you're in heavy REM sleep this is what your brain produces a natural part of human neural chemistry and it lets you see something way crazier than what these religious people are talking about so who might say that there's no God that maybe maybe there is a fucking village in the clouds maybe it's all true but just studying the actual words if you know the history of how the Bible was made the the ancient ancient Hebrew which were the the original Old Testament was written in the original Bible written in ancient Hebrew was then to this day they only know three out of four of those words for this day like today twenty-five percent of the words in ancient Hebrew they like who the fuck knows not only that there was no numbers in ancient Hebrew letters doubled as numbers so like the letter A was also the number one and there was numerical value to words that is completely lost in the translation to Greek and to Latin like the word Locke of the word love and the word God have the same numerical value and this numerical value the value of these words it's like it was very important to the translation of what you know what what it was what was meant all that is missing when they translated that and then eventually to English all that's missing and then you've got the New Testament which is just complete wackiness because constantine who wasn't even a fucking christian created this and this is just clearly a ploy to try to control people constantine got together with a bunch of bishops and they wrote it all out and there's stuff that they left in and stuff they took out so the New Testament which is he made hundreds of years after Christ was supposed to be dead who the fuck knows what that's all about who knows but only you need to know is the guy even wrote it wasn't even a Christian delete like right before he died he converted I believe and you know it was very clear Constantine wanted who's an emperor you wanted to control people and that's what it's best at it's so good at controlling people that you'll let pedophiles fuck your kids because they have the fucking the the magic fairytale golden ticket it's mind boggling it's mind boggling that this goofy fuck in a crazy outfit this cult leader gets special treatment they'll make fun of the Moonies they'll make fun of Scientologists but the fucking Pope on TV somehow another gets to be national news this crazy fuck who's not allowed to have sex so hangs out with a bunch of crazy fucks who aren't allowed to have sex and every rock you fucking pick up there's a priest fucking a kid underneath it I mean it's just throughout their entire organization there are thousands and thousands and thousands of cases every fucking year new ones pop up every fucking hear some new scandal about how they knew this guy was fucking kids and so they moved them to New Mexico or some shit I mean it's really shocking that Catholic people are even going to church anymore it's completely shocking that there's still people that they trip just the sheer weight of its own bullshit should have collapsed the Catholic religion a long fucking time ago and this is coming from someone who was raised a Catholic I went to Catholic school when I was in first grade one year I went to Catholic school and it was such a fucking horrendous nightmare I don't remember second grade I don't remember I remember first grade though like a motherfucker because first grade was the only year that I was in Catholic school I remember this fucking cunt sister Mary Josephine's his evil evil woman who used to tell you that if you didn't get your homework done you have to sit on a nail in the closet overnight she would smack you in the head I mean it was real shit have you cried if you were upset about something she would make fun of you you know look at this one crying she was just no compassion no love no friendship no warmth it was all evil it was all anger and evil and that is what that relationship is it is unnatural it's not real this relationship to life where you're a person who's in charge of some nonsense fairy tale and because that you get to shit on people and yell at their kids and hit their fucking kids and treat them like shit because you somehow or another are special because you're one of those people that doesn't fuck and you have you know what you have more access to God but no you don't even have more access you don't have anything it's the craziest most ridiculous cult ever and it's still going on and if that's not a damning condemnation of human beings in human culture today in 2010 with the age of information with the internet with all this that we still have the Catholic religion that that stupid shit is still around it's mind-boggling without a doubt if there is a God that's not what he wants if there is a God what God is is the energy that creates everything you know it might not be a conscious thing or it might be all conscious things together as one thing in some sort of a framework that we can't even recognize because it's so big it's so great that literally you know when someone some hippy says hey you are God and gods you what if that's true what if that really is true what if our purpose on this life has shielded us from that recognition because we have to go through whatever we have to go through like we're here for a reason that we're pushing humanity and human culture and human innovation forward for reason you know probably some sort of fucking some sort of a technological thing that we're going to create that's going to enter us into the new age but if that's the case it said that we just lacked the perception to really understand that we're in tune with anything with everything with the whole world then that make sense that everything is God and that's the feeling that you get when you do mushrooms when you do mushrooms you get this feeling of connectedness that you are attached when you do DMT as well which is very similar to two mushrooms in what-what it is chemically what DMT is is dimethyltryptamine what mushrooms are cubensis mushrooms is forfox floral oxy and dimethyltryptamine so they're very closely chemically related and you have this intense feeling of connection with everything with people you know with the friends in your life with animals with with wilderness with I mean that's why they say do mushrooms and going in nature because when you do when you you know have some mushrooms in you're laying in a you know in the woods you know in a plot of trees you like you feel like the energy of the trees it's like some avatar type shit but you really feel like the fucking tree of souls communicating with you I think that our our main problem as human beings is that we are in a stage of evolution and we're in an adolescent stage and we are certainly passing where we used to be and are just our potential for evolving above the basic fight or flight instincts and our potential for evolving above just just animal brutality and anger and jealousy and all these things that we think that we need in order to compete and survive we have potential to rise above that and that's what yoga is all about and that's what meditation is all about in isolation tanks and people who are a psychedelic enthusiasts what that's what that's all about is this this struggle up the slippery slope to get to the top to have just a little better view of what the world could be and I think that that's what that's the the potential that we have inside of us it's all moving towards that you know human understanding human the idea of human enlightenment you know this this quest to get your shit together it's all moving away from these nonsensical animal instincts to something higher and more evolved and I think that potential is the only good thing that human beings have it's like we have this potential for one side of the other we have this potential to be like you know like an evil government that corrupts its citizens or we have this potential to be a brother we have this potential to be a sister we have to potentially be someone who loves you like they love family like they love themselves you know I mean I have a buddy that has a kid and we were talking about babies recently and we were just joking around he's a comic as well Jean Papa last night at the improv and we're just talking about and I've had this conversation with other people too about how it makes you like so much a nicer person and I said that like manage everybody treated everybody the way I treat my daughter what a fucking beautiful world we would live in it would just be a world of warmth and friendship and you know if we just had a pill that made you love everybody the way I love my daughter and we do have a pill like that it's called ecstasy but that's it's terrible for you and the next day you feel like shit and it hurts your head but if we figured out a way and maybe we're going to do that I mean maybe that's what the next stage of evolution really is all about maybe it's an evolution pill you know maybe you know some people take the evolution vaccine and some people won't and they'll shoot your arm with some shit that lasts like six months and it's some vaccination against stupidity some vaccination against against nonsense against a lack of understanding and appreciation of the fact that we're here in this temporary situation has one gigantic hive one super organism one super organism and that the more love you spread out the more positive energy you spread out the more you get back you know the more it comes back to affect you and it goes out and ripples because the people that you affect they affect other people as well and the more positive you spread out that literally you can change your world you can change the world of the people that you come in contact with you know I think that is what human beings are slowly starting to realize and that may be what God really is what God might be is everything what it's not is a bunch of dudes in fucking robes that won't have sex with your kids okay that's not God that's nonsense and the fact that these fucking presidential candidates and all these knuckleheads that want to be world leaders and they want to guide us towards you know they're not guiding us towards anything it's business as usual there's no evolution whatsoever in the political process there's no evolution whatsoever amongst these fuck heads that talk their decades and decades behind the progressive American culture the the people that are at the front of the line of thinking these motherfuckers are decades behind you know that this idea of religious freedom yes I agree yes you should have the freedom to study religiously you should have the freedom to do whatever you want you the Flying Spaghetti Monster that's your thing that that's fine you know but you can't take it seriously like you you you can't expect someone who is I mean that that is the whole idea of the separation of church and state the whole idea is like some sort of concede is conceding somehow that okay you're allowed to believe really ridiculous shit how about this how about we just leave all the religion out and all we concentrate on is how things are run business how we treat each other what laws we enforce how you make sure that people aren't being victimized these fucking politicians and these newspapers and all these people that that really follow all this Pope bullshit they just add credence to it because knuckleheads read about in the news so they think it's legitimate I had a conversation with someone where they were saying that you know that we were talking about cults and I said well I was watching a documentary it's really fascinating the documentary on Christianity and they kept referring it to the cult of Christianity that's how they were referring to in this you know the very scientific documentary and this woman was very upset she's like Christianity is not called and I'm like how can you say it's not call and she's like well because first of all you don't have a cult that has billions of people in it yes you do it's just a bigger call like if you have a cult that has three people if you can trick three people you can trick 3 million ok if you can find 3 people dumb enough to believe your wackiness and they let you fuck them and they wear purple Nikes you tell them that's the sacred color if you get three people to do that and they really believe it they're going to get more people to believe it we are all going through this life completely clueless these we are like people in a spaceship that woke up from hyper sleep and we're going through the the manuals and no one knows how to run the ship that's what we are like and there's a few of us that are older that are pretending to the younger people listen don't worry we've got this everything's going to be fine we're gonna have a meeting with Congress going to work all the time and these people are trying to placate the rest of us who are just like them and no one knows what the fuck is going on so anybody that steps up and tells you that they have all the answers that God wants this for you God wants that no you don't know those are the enemy anybody that says they have the answers they're your enemy and anybody who wants your money they're your enemy too you don't give me a fucking show all right don't just stand there and recite some stupid Latin shit and pass it on a basket because you're too lazy to work for a living you fuck no if you if you want to be the real messenger of the Word of God you would be asking for money okay stop it people would be giving mind you because they love you you wouldn't have a fucking basket you pass around make everybody feel guilty fuck you that's that's nonsense that's silly goddamn nonsense and until we acknowledge that until we acknowledge that that is our own insecurities that are asking us to search for an answer to something that's impossible to answer to acknowledge that were fucked we're spinning our wheels we're in the same spot we've always been you know and that that is the problem the real problem is everybody wants to pretend that there's an answer to something that you cannot answer there is no answer it is absolutely impossible and if if there is a God it's probably so much more complex than you could ever possibly wrap your fucking head around and I'll tell you what it's not it's not a Adam and Eve okay it's not God made to people and you know they fucked and they had kids and the kids started fucking each other because that's what Adam and Eve is there's only two people because one of the that's like any child with a simple grasp of mathematics and five minutes to think about it you'd say okay I'm going to tell you a story of Adam and Eve you tell me what you think is wrong with that they would go okay if Adam and Eve made people everybody came from Adam and Eve everybody the whole world okay if Adam and Eve made people so they had kids and the kids were like their brothers and sisters yep how do they make more people there we go no they fucked each other they fucked each other - Adam fuck the kids and Eve fuck the kids and the kids fucked each other and that's where people came from what it's 2010 no one has any fucking answer no one goddamnit except maybe gang star gang stars got the answer I like this house I don't know the big elders but I like Big L recipes so that's my long answer to a short question fuck the Pope fuck all those dummies fuck anybody that tells you they've got it wired no no no stupid no you don't have it wired and you got to get a real job now okay it's two thousand fucking ten if the whole world got on mushrooms the Catholic religion would implode okay they would have to go out and start kidnapping kids to fuck because nobody would bring their kids to them anymore you know it's it's a corrupt criminal organization of kid fuckers that's what it is do I have any idea how lost ends no those fucks I've been trying to not tuned in I'm going to be on Adam Carolla's podcast real soon I think next week actually I'll tell you right now because I'm on the fucking Internet Hollow I like them apples I love the internet is easily my favorite human creation I'm so addicted I'm it's killing my vision I have a hard time reading things when they're up close now okay let's say yes next week the 23rd so next Tuesday the 23rd I'll be doing the Adam Carolla podcast however I don't know exactly what time the podcast but what time he puts it up so that's my answer that but I'll be doing it next Tuesday the 23rd are more questions that Bobbie says Joe I once read if they legalize all drugs it can cost the USA a hundred fifty thousand good jobs and cops lawyers and so forth I don't know if it's true but I believe the war on drugs is a makeup make work project forget about if they're getting some profits and selling them I don't know if it's true would it sound right yes is definitely though the war on drugs is definitely look between the private prisons and between law enforcement there's an industry in keeping drugs illegal and it's not about protecting you you know some drugs yes it is you know when when they go and close down crystal meth labs yeah that's a fucking danger because crystal meth makes people it completely fucks with their judgment makes them insane look what it did to Jesse James you fucked that bitch with a tattoo in her head I guarantee that do is doing Metheny fucked her there's no way sober you know what fuck chicks with tattoos on their head when you're sober when you see a piston has pray for sinners tattooed on her fucking forehead you go what and she's ugly oh yeah let me stick my rod dick inside you now that God is doing drugs and there's drugs that are bad for you okay and crystal meth is one of them it's a terrible terrible drug you know heroin is another one I mean I've seen cocaine turn people into they're like they become like like roaches they become like bugs you know that like they don't down thinking about you man they're just trying to get that shit I don't I get that shit you know they literally get black shark eyes they turn dead on the inside man there's drugs that are terrible for you and those drugs yeah I could see an argument for them I can see an argument for us doing something about the people that sell them because they're they're damaging people it's dangerous but there's other drugs like mushrooms and pot if you get caught with those things man it doesn't matter those are still illegal drugs as a matter of fact they're more illegal than heroin do you know that schedule one drugs for the most part are the drugs that really have like use schedule one is the most illegal okay schedule one is DMT which your own brain produces so as Terence Mckenna said he said everyone's holding I mean that's really really what it is you are in production in production and in uun possession of a really illegal substance the number one the Schedule one DMT marijuana Schedule one knows our diet pot ever do you know what it can't the only way pot is going to kill you is if you're standing on the wrong side of the fence when when those Mexican drug helicopters comes over and pushes a bail out and it clubs you on the fucking head that's how you die for pot other than that you're not going to die for pot you might think you're dying but you're just going to fall asleep and you're gonna be fine no one's fucking died of it ever but yet still pot is Schedule one mushrooms same thing I've never heard of anybody dying for mushrooms you can definitely die if you eat poison mushrooms but poison mushrooms by the way are legal and you could have poison mushrooms all around your backyard you can munch on them all day and fucking die of a heart attack and nobody gives a shit no one's going to have it it's not going to be a big inquest no one's going to go crazy but if you if you put psilocybin mushrooms in your yard and the cops come and find them growing in your yard they will lock you in a fucking cage even though psilocybin mushrooms they can make you go crazy if you do too many of them and if you have a weak mental Constitution I could see you going crazy for mushrooms just too much information too much realization but you could go crazy from anything you can go crazy from paint you know you could huff paintin you know sniff paint and blow your fucking brains out you can go crazy for anything there's a lot beat some people are weak and fragile and there's any really extreme experience can fuck them up there's an ant that I think it's called an iron forget the name of the ant but this ant bites you and the venom is so intense and horrifying that it's been described as slamming your arm into a car door for an hour that's what it feels like just slamming your arm imagine what that would feel like and it lasts for 24 hours what so this intense insane throbbing like literally you're getting ripped apart like someone slamming a door on your arm and it lasts a whole day and the experience is so traumatic that some people when they come out of it they're never the same again they're just a shell they're just so fucked up they could not get through the pain of one full 24-hour period under Celicas there's some shit in the world that could fuck you up okay that's not why marijuana is illegal that's not what mushrooms are illegal that's they're illegal because they're trying to keep you from them they don't want they don't want a society that is questioning leadership they don't want a society that's the other problem the people that are in power they're not using these things throughout human history shamans have been the leaders of tribes and shamans have been the ones that the tribe will go to when a tribe has troubles and what the shamans are were people who had a lot of experience in navigating psychedelic dimensions and in the Amazon when you know they would all sit around and drink ayahuasca ayahuasca is a herb like a tea that they brew with them that produces DMT and it's a ordinarily DMT is not you can't drink it because it gets broken down when you take it in orally when you eat it gets broken down with something in your stomach called mono a mean oxidase and it's produced in your gut and this ayahuasca was a way that they figured out how to extract DMT and a mono aiming oxidase inhibitor from another plant it's really fucking crazy I mean they've been doing this for 10,000 years in a place where there's you know 250,000 plus different species of plants they figured out a way to combine two to make this incredible move that lets you communicate with with the afterlife you know and which by the way is totally illegal you know I mean it's a mess you know it's it's it's a real fucking mess when when you start think about what what it really is because what it really is is people keeping other people from having an experience and the reasoning for it the reason why is not because they think that this person if they have that experience is going to make life difficult for me they're going to come after me they're going to hurt my family now they're doing it because they can profit off this person not having that experience if I say that something is illegal and I set forth laws and I say if you cross this boundary and you do this behavior and you you know you violate my law I get to lock you in a cage I get to make money from locking in acacia not only that I get to employ people that will now they have a job their job is to go after people that are doing what I said they couldn't do and get them and kidnap them and put them in a cage that's what you're having with marijuana and mushroom bust and stuff like that you tap you're telling someone that you're by your judgement they shouldn't have that experience and so you say well if you're going to make such an extreme judgment that judgment has to be based on facts right no no it doesn't have to be based on facts of course it doesn't because if it was then marijuana would have been legal in the 1950s I mean it would have been legal and when when they passed the sweeping schedule one psychedelics Act of 1970 I believe it was when they made everything illegal they would have they would have had to provide some reasoning for making mushrooms illegal some reasoning for making marijuana illegal and it would been scientific and it would have been medical but the problem is every single fucking medical study that's ever been done about marijuana shows that it's relatively harmless I mean you can ruin your life with anything you can ruin your life with cheeseburgers if you want to like I was talking about like bottles you could take a bottle and bottles can hold a nice delicious drink or you can take a bottle and you can stuff it up your ass and throw yourself down a flight of stairs and bleed to death it doesn't mean that bottle should be illegal the real fucking problem is that we are allowing people to victimize other people for profit and that's what the war on drugs is all about and the reason why the war on drugs works at all is because the people responsible the cops and the lawyers they're not doing drugs if they were doing drugs if they were doing the right drugs they were doing mushrooms and they were smoking pot there would be nothing it would all stop they would have to stop if you do the correct amount of mushroom dose you would realize that in victimizing people you are victimizing yourself you are creating a terrible stream of karma your your ruining lives for nothing you were ruining lives for something that doesn't have anything to do with you and something that's been around in terms of from marijuana and and mushrooms and ayahuasca tens of thousands of years of human use and as I said in those indigenous cultures this shaman was the one who made the decisions that's because this is the guy that had the most experience in these these matters of the spirit world we don't have that anymore now we have the opposite we have leaders that if we find out they're doing mushrooms would be shocked we would want to remove from office if Obama had a press conference on Monday and said I got together with my wife the other day we did five grams of mushrooms and we went to the mountains and I really started thinking about our country everybody but what the fuck are you talking about that would be the most beautiful thing that he could ever say if he could say I just took something that allowed me to literally tune in to the stream of love that is God that is the energy of the universe that is mother Gaia I connected myself to all that is loving in the world and I came back with some revelations and some thoughts about how we could lead our culture better how it can be kinder to the rest of the world how instead of going all these places to to control the resources and to to ruin them how about we introduce them to this spiritual realm how about we introduce the whole world to mushrooms how will we prove them in mass quantities and slowly start to open people's eyes up to the fact that it's not a lack of resources that we have in this country it's a gluttonous fucking gigantic group at the top that are fucking and raping the world it's not that we have not enough resource to run the life that we need it's we don't have enough resources to run the life where we're living we don't have to live like this this is all nonsense we wrote we live on a Greek ultrabass life we live a life where we rely on fossil fuels and you know we will rely on petroleum but we don't have to there's many many things that can be done with plants that we're doing right now if marijuana was legal first of all just hemp as for use for oil and use for textiles and use for fur you can big houses out of it and you can you can fucking fuel cars with it you could build cars with it Lotus actually made a fucking car with a instead of carbon fiber or fiberglass they made the fucking shell out of hemp I mean it's all possible we just can't live the way we're living right now and there's no way to effectively reset civilization better than psychedelics but meanwhile saying that makes you sound like a retard like I'm listening to my own self and I'm like if I didn't do drugs if I had never you know done mushrooms or anything like that I heard a guy talking like this well you're who the phrases idiot like what could you possibly say that you think you have all the answers I don't have the answers but I do have a possible door to the answers and that's what I think I think psychedelic experiences are and these guys are running for president they will deny that to the end they will they will you know Obama had this fucking thing recently where as a town hall meeting and he got all these questions from the internet and the number one question the number one question was marijuana legalization and every other issue that was being discussed that day whether it was health care or anything else he gave these really well thought out in-depth answers but it came to the marijuana question was like ha ha ha well I don't know what that shows about this group here ha ha ha I said no I don't think that's a good idea really you don't think that's a good idea you don't think it's a good idea to stop suppressing people you don't think it's a good idea to not jail people for having a fucking experience to not jail people for selling a plant a naturally growing thing that's never killed anyone you don't think that it's a good idea to reverse an evil fucked-up corrupt law that is helping people with the worst karma ever imprisoned people for nothing well you sir I need some fucking mushrooms and that's the problem we have a whole group of people running this fucking country and none of them are doing mushrooms I would like to have a talk show I talked about this on stage I wanted to have a talk show where I make people do mushrooms with me and it would it would be called do mushrooms with Joe Rogan and we have on you know like people that would mean you want to know a real truth serum mushrooms is the best truth serum you wants that fucking wave hits you that wave of of alien information and the wave of love and the connectivity and when you see the fiber of the very universe all around you you're gonna start talking and if I could get you know like Ken Starr and Dick Cheney and could you imagine could you imagine if those guys like if people suit them and people you know you know because like look there's a lot of people that want to take them to trial for war crimes especially Dick Cheney when you think about the fact that Dick Cheney was a CEO of Halliburton and then you know he becomes a vice president in the United States we go to some crazy fucking Wars where Halliburton gets the contracts and the wars are all based on totally false information about weapons of mass destruction there's people that say that Dick Cheney's at the helm of it he was lying you could try that motherfucker for wars against crimes against humanity you could try him for that and if he was convicted and they said here's one thing you can do to get out of it you got to do the let's get let's do mushrooms with Joe Rogan show and you have a guy like that like a any any really fucked up politician George Bush Senior George Bush jr. you know anyone like that sit them down and make them do mushrooms make them realize that just because you've been living this life the same way as everyone before you as your father and all these other corrupt politicians it doesn't mean it's justifiable just because you can find examples all around you people who have done worse and people are doing the same things doesn't mean that's supposed to continue and it's got to there's got to be a way to stop it it doesn't seem to be stopping with the the evolution of culture it seems to be the same you know it seems to be the curve it's being exposed more but it doesn't seem like it's put a monkey wrench in it like they're just stopping you know the financial corruption involved in this bailout is staggering and if you really want to hurt your head you go and read some of Matt Taibbi articles about it it fucking hurts like when you look at the billions and trillions of dollars where it's going and how it's being funded and these guys are getting bonuses and they're getting bonuses but they don't have any money - the money came from taxpayers but they were owed the bonuses or else they'll quit well why don't they fire them they're the ones that fuck this thing up in the first but it's staggering I mean it's literally our entire civilization is built on a foundation of unfixable bullshit it's the only way I think to restructure our society correctly well literally it would have to be done by someone other than us because once I mean that's what the the Constitution was all about when there was the the the birth of America the idea of America was that we were going to have a separation of church and state that we were going to have people that could only run it for a few years and then they would have to leave we were going to have the will of the people and then it was going to be we're going to be free from all the imperialism bullshit that we have to deal with in England in Europe but after a while it just felt the same thing you know people inherently if we're left alone and we're just people the way we are right now our evolution our cultural and social evolution is so much lower than the evolution of Technology what we're able to do we're able to communicate with people all around the world where the flying fucking tubes through the sky we're able to send video through the air you know we're able to watch television programs that are being broadcast from the other side of the planet I mean we have this incredible technological capabilities but socially we're just a bump ahead of where we were in the 50s just a little just a little I mean it could be argued that we're like slightly behind where we were in the 70s in comparison to like you know if you lis think about it like as far as like what the kind of access to information they had back then now everybody was all about love and fuckin peace and love why is that why was the 60s the late 60s what was the drop-off between then and here you know struggles its what it is when you know all that summer of love all that Woodstock ship they were all on acid okay they're all on mushrooms they're all on peyote their highest fuck and they were realizing that this way of living the life that you know leads you to be your dad is does not worth that when you watch your dad dropped out of a fucking heart attack at 55 and you scarcely can remember him laughing three times ever you know and you go what I'm supposed to be that guy what the fuck is that you know and then the Vietnam War and all the disenchantment with our government I mean that's what forced people to more drugs that's what forced the culture to change more we need something like that we need something like that right now because the way we're doing it we are just spinning our fucking wheels when the president wins the Nobel Peace Prize and then like a week later sends 30,000 people more into Afghanistan you got to go what the fuck really you know what the fuck you think this is a good idea nobody after the Vietnam War thought the Vietnam War was a good idea less people are going to think the Afghanistan war is a good idea because Afghanistan isn't even really the fucking country I mean it's like it's like one city and a hundred tribes you know the way John McCain describes Afghanistan he said it's wrong the same way it was run when Alexander the Great was around I mean literally you have warlords and and they run tribes and in between these warlords you know there's a few Taliban like sprinkled in the hills and you know how we find out about these Taliban this is work it's really funny we give the Warlord's viagra because the Warlord's can't get it up anymore and you know they want to still be the warlord but you know they got leave these six wives and these chicks are like sitting around when you can fuck me and they can't fuck them so that they take viagra now and the soldiers give them viagra they in turn in turn give them information about the Taliban it's pretty fun shit okay let's see how long will the world ignore the people that are dying of starvation I think Sam Kinison and the best answer to that why don't you people live where the food is okay I'm sitting Tiger Woods is gully I don't know what that means fuck James Toney Big L recipes Oh Big L was a rapper that was shot and killed in Harlem in 1999 thank you eternal damn it's already almost 7:00 a fucking clock we've been doing this for and I want to have all right people I don't see anything interesting here so I'm going to go to back to Twitter I'm going to stank stay with you guys for another half an hour if someone thinks I can't recognize two dudes dicks I claim early I'm proficient and identifying poor stars by their dicks some fans might wonder if you're truly being asked because it seems kind of gay whose is whose peter north ron jeremy rocco siffredi I would say the bottom one it looks a little like ron jeremy and the top one looks a little like rocco siffredi but the top one could be the same guy in which case I say bolter ron jeremy am i right sad so sad that I know all right Twitter she was on Twitter goddammit I love you too Aris for Andrew you motherfucker infiltrate the White House kitchen and mix psychedelics in the food mmm that might not be such a good idea to hear about what happened in France I'll find the article for you the CIA the CIA put LSD in they spiked I'll put the it's all over the Internet not just one I'll put a I'll put one up on but if you just look up CIA France LSD in Google you will find many many many articles about it I'll put it up on Twitter right now just threw it up on Twitter right there it's so fascinating shit man so I don't think that dosing people with acid is the answer I think that's definitely not the way to go I think any psychedelic drug should be done if you're going to do it at all with an understanding of what you're doing and you're doing it with someone who knows what they're doing who's done it many times before and that's what the role of a shaman is supposed to be you know what a shaman is supposed to be is someone who can give you experience and help you and guide you through the experience of of literally leaving this world I mean that's that's what psychedelics are all about you know I mean everybody wants everybody thinks that you know to really leave this world you're going to get a spaceship and you're going to go to another planet you can leave this world from right here you can leave this world in your own mind and it's much more possible to me that the real aliens the real alien life it's probably way weirder and way more complicated than we've got to broke it down the movies with metal ships and shit like that I think it's I think it's more of a dimensional thing I think there's there's a you know only if you talk to people to know anything about quantum physics and I don't understand I don't get it but from their claims and supposedly this is mathematically provable there's at least 11 dimensions you know that's just what we know about what does that even mean do you even know what that means I'm not sure I do you know but I think that the way I think about it is that it's very likely that just this reality it's just the reality that we're tuned into but there's probably an infinite number of different realities going on at the same time all around us we just can't tune into it we just don't literally don't have the senses for it so it might be that alien life is here right now all the time it's just operating on like a different frequency on the dial you know like that the world is a radio and the weird 97.1 but that the aliens are 109 point eight and you know we just can't turn them in you know who the fuck knows but you know when you start talking aliens people gonna think you're crazy if we ever did math we ever did fucking find aliens god damn would that be a crazy day if they ever did come down but I don't think they would be too nice to us because we're not so nice to chimps you know look what we do to killer whales man you know we take fucking killer whales when we know they're super smart and we don't care we don't give a fuck get the fish tanks deal with getting the tank and do tricks you know what makes us think that aliens are going to treat us any differently I mean maybe that's what all these alien abduction experiments are all about maybe they really they don't think of seriously at all they just think we're crazy pink monkeys with nuclear weapons and they come down and they fuck with us there's a joke that I do my act about how if there are really are aliens I believe the earth is the Tijuana of outer space and I really think that might be accurate i mean this might be just a place to come to fuck around you know why would you want to fix us so what so we can make more is early six billion of us you know what why would you want to make more in you know the last hundred years I mean how many more people have been born something like four or five fucking billion I mean it's getting pretty nutty mad this is motherfuckers gonna get overcrowded soon and look why would they if you're going to fix us it would have to be a radical changing it would have to be really radical because socially we are not catching up to where we are technologically our awareness is not up to what we're capable of what we're capable of blowing up the whole planet for in the world capable creating black holes and we're capable of all kinds of nutty shit I mean just a nuclear arsenal that North Korea possesses look at those dummies they got one fucking stupid little dude with glasses makes him shut the lights out at night to save energy nobody's got any money this motherfuckers got a gang a nuclear weapons square launch on people 11 this guy 11 dimensions explained says syz G I watched that and I still won't learn anymore I'll watch it but I'll still be like I'm not sure really what they're saying if aliens didn't exist that says that everyone who was abducted or saw UFOs crazy now doesn't because first of all what UFO means is unidentified let me tell you something man people are full of shit you know we did a thing I used to do a show called game show on my head I did it for CBS and it was a hidden-camera game show and what the show was was we would we would have a contestant and the contestant would have to convince people to do a bunch of shit and it would be under a hidden camera and we set up in Hollywood and this dude we had a contestant dress up like a newscaster like a guy worked for Channel 4 News and he stood there on the street corner and we had all these cameras pointed on him when we cameras right on the people and he would go up to people and say can you do me a favor I'm in a terrible situation we had a situation here earlier and a UFO landed they had to tell the people on camera that a UFO landed and that all these witnesses had seen it but then the witnesses took off so I need you to pretend that you saw it and every fucking person we asked to do that did it I thought no one was going to do it they just step right up and they so tell us about the experience the guy was like well you know I saw the UFO and oak Ramos silver and lights around the edge they describe it in detail I'm sitting there like what people love to be on camera and people are just generally full of shit and even if they did see something by the time that story comes around and there's cameras on them where they're being interviewed and they're talking to reporters that story is going to morph and memory it's going to change who knows what the fuck it was it could have been an experimental government jet it could have been a flock of birds at night it could have been a UFO who the fuck knows who knows what it really was but the people that are talking about it almost all nuts man they're almost all loony so I think that people see things and then they blow those things up in their head and as far as the abduction experiences all UFO duction experiences occur while people are sleeping there then they're all curling like late at night if you look at them the bulk of them look except the people are just probably completely insane to think they'd come and take them you know they're in the middle of day and bring them back and it seems like they're only gone for a second but really they're gone for days there's some loons that will tell you some stories like that but I I think that what's going on is it's DMT related because we know that the brain produces DMT while a person is in heavy REM sleep and if you smoked DMT the experience that you have is very much alien it's very much like what you would expect someone to be talking about if they were brought to another world or brought a boarder spaceship I mean it feels like you're going on to something you know and who knows what kind of you know a response you would give these UFO people if if you took them and gave them DMT and made them smoked DMT and go okay was that what you saw and if they were like yeah I was back on the ship okay settle down then you know then you know what's going on you know what what is that there are they really making contact with entities is it really their brain and their their imagination that becomes supercharged because of this chemical that floods through it and what is imagination exactly I mean what there's you know people can poopoo that say oh it's just you're making things up it's hallucinations is it you know how do you know that that world is not just as real as this world just because this world you can bang on it make noise you know you can feel it it doesn't mean it's more real that just means it's solid you know it's it's very possible that the world of the imagination the world of your mind the world of dreams is really a world is really another dimension do I believe in ghosts I'm not scared of them I I fucking watch those ghost stories I know what are they scared of this fucking ghost never kill anybody you see doesn't shit there's amazing how many of those goddamn shows there are though everybody wants to learn watch the paranormal everybody's obsessed with UFOs and everybody's obsessed with you know shit that's not necessarily real you know Bigfoot like I've always had the killer whales are way more interesting than Bigfoot these super intelligent animals that actually rescue people they kill they kill great white sharks they kill dolphins they're like they're ruthless crazy super intelligent animals they play with their dead like seals you ever see killer whales like throw a seal up in the air and SWAT them with their tail it's end up flying they're fucking ruthless and they're super smart it's fascinating shit all right I think chatroulette if you'd be on chat with that you probably see my dick sorry no I never put my dick on chat without that's just rude I think it's funny though I haven't done it yeah I did the other roulette or yeah you just type just like it's like one-on-one personal messaging again bazo's dudes trying to get laid were you dude I would say yes and then they would just fucking hang up I mean so I started saying I was a chick and I did a few of those and I put him up on on the forums on Joe Rogan net it's kind of fun all right did Dan Hardy get to leapfrog top-ten Walter woods and get a title shot you know I don't know it's hard to assign I think Dan Hardy is a exciting dude it talks a lot of shit he's saying all the right things yeah serious power in his hands it's just whether or not it's going to be able to deal with fucking wrestling game of GSP GSP can take you down man he's such an athlete man he's so explosive and it's I think it's just really hard for dudes to avoid that takedown and he gets on top of you and stays on top it's gonna beat your ass you know the thing is about GSP is will it be a fight like the Thiago Alves fight where he neutralized Alba's but he never really came close to stopping them or will it be a fight like the Fitch fight or the BJ fight where he just gets on top of them and beats the fucking shit up or will hardly have something up his sleeve you know maybe Harley's takedown defenses better than we thought it is you know maybe Hardy has a strategy for how to counter the the double and how to stop him when he's coming in or how to you know take it to him or maybe he's going to pull guard who the fuck knows what Hardy's gonna do Hardy's a very very smart guy and he's very confident in its real confidence it's not bullshit he really believes that he's going to clip GSP and he's going to rock them and he's going to go home with the title who the fuck knows son it's going to be interesting splice bag of ice all spilled bag of ice says that the 11th dimension is in his pants that's built bag of ice is still around if I would have abandoned that Twitter by now you got a lot of stick-to-itiveness son good for you alright I think that's enough right sucking 37:11 that's a perfect time to end we are proof that aliens exist perspective okay when are we talking about now you've done too much drugs you're you're you're ruining the whole cause don't know I will look one more time for a good question on the forums Joe Rogan dotnet and if we cannot find one we'll wrap it up did anyone ever wonder why we lose all the good rappers that have a significant place in hip-hop history rappers like Tupac biggie big Adele easy why don't know Big Al is easy yet we're stuck with garbage like Nelly and fucking soldier boy yeah that's interesting um I think rappers man that life you know the life is all guns and I mean when you're Tupac and you got fucking machine guns tattooed on your body it says thug life on your stomach you know those aren't signs of a long and healthy career he was like the first dude to like cover his body his whole body with tattoos - they're all doing that now it's really crazy you know little Wayne I think it's hilarious that little Wayne said that he's a gangster like told Katie Couric I'm a gangsta miss Katie meanwhile they put him in jail they immediately put him in protective custody you're a gangster maybe you and you got all your money in you're outside but the inside world know you're you are a singer you're an entertainer and it would be awesome if one of those guys fucked your face not for everybody for them for that guy to fuck your face he'd be I'm not saying that I'm looking forward you're getting your face booked but let's be realistic it would happen god damn it your motherfuckers all right when all right I think that's it there's no more I could say like I said I'm going to be an Gotham at Gotham comedy club next Friday next Friday is the 26th for two shows it's almost sold
