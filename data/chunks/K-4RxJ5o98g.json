hello freak bitches when you come across people like that because you're in the criminal defense attorney world and you have to represent these people do you do you try to think like is there a way to fix this guy I mean do you put that in your head or do you just go and try to win I try well when I get when I would get them to do the apologies because one I mean the thing is like for a lot of these guys too many witnesses too much of a record it's coming down to this fucking apology right it's coming down to our plan for what we're going to do next and talking with them and coming up with a reasonable plan about what they're going to do after jail or what they could do instead of jail and addressing like why would they they did something wrong okay why was it wrong like I would go through with my clients a lot of times if I wasn't sure that they were getting it and I would be like okay so you're gonna have to give an apology to the judge you're gonna have to tell him that what you did is wrong you're gonna have to tell him that you know that it was wrong and you're gonna have to tell him you know why it was wrong so why is it wrong to hit your girlfriend um she doesn't want me to well okay all right there's one when you hit your girlfriend what do the police have to do they have to show up and they have to arrest me were you nice to them no do you think they like that no do you think now would be the time to apologize for being a dick to them when they were just doing their jobs yeah okay but now say it in a different way say it in a nice way no cheese and then I made them say it in a nice like and you have to really coach them through this and you do you let them know like listen your freedom may ride and we're not your believable yep yep and our most important performance I would tell them like you you're not gonna lie up there everything you say is gonna be true we just need to make you fucking recognize you're just a couple minutes you got to recognize this situation because you can't lie out there they hear too many lies they don't like lies just it's like George Michael and Freedent like take a lie and make it true a lot of times I was just quote George Michael yeah I did that's on freedom yeah it's on it is a good song right yeah good on you for admitting a lot of people they shy away from giving George Michael the props he deserves but I would use like take these lies and make them true I would use that on my clients and you saying that no terrible you could say it no can't take these lies and make it true somehow we have to do there we go ha ha ha dude how about I was in this go-kart thing with jason Ellis and Donna Cruz is there you're competitive you're racing fucking go karts mm-hmm I see Dominick Cruz in the corner hyping himself up dead Sierra's going they don't want you to win did him sell what they don't want you to win this he's talking himself oh my god I'm like oh they love it I was crazy he's playing for keeps - guy makes amigos the guy who works there it's like some Costco fucking warehouse thing they set up he was fucking crazy and I went I guess man that's why he's world champ I tell dick jokes and you work at Costco cuz we think this is a game he doesn't brother there's no game I'm fuckin almost won yeah exactly really yeah it's hilarious they don't want you to win this sort of you know masculine she's so fragile managers socialized to be violent they're not just socialized to be fun you know this is a hormone thing men just are more aggressive you know and if you at means for instance in colleges right if you if you tell women that the worst things ever can happen them is somebody putting a hand on their on their leg and you call that sexual assault and you put that in the sexual assault statistics and you know you tell women oh you can wear whatever you want and you can go out at 3:00 a.m. wearing a miniskirt and no man has a right to look at you and you know you know no victim blaming all the rest of it you're telling women effect if they can put themselves in danger and bad things are going to happen to those women we do live in more civilized times but we also have to recognize that there is something there is something dark and dangerous about men and it is what creates it's what it is what has driven human civilization to the heights that it is risen to but it is also why men for most of the prisons right the sublime geniuses and the knuckle-dragging Apes of our species are both male right and that's been you can see that in a variety different things people don't take like you very seriously but you can see for instance in IQ distribution one of the suggestions that might be the case you know sublime musical and artistic geniuses up in the very top end of the IQ scale where women tend not to exist like wise you know down in the knuckle draggers 70 and 80 IQ women tend not to exist down there either men are more variable than women in general men are more complex I think than women in some ways and this you know there's the idea that you can just sort of BuzzFeed your way out of rape and civilization is just insane BuzzFeed your way out you know if you if you just if you publish enough listicles about how masculinity is so fragile and white you know straight white men are the root of all evil that that's somehow going to stop rape no in fact I think it's probably counterproductive I think that's probably going to be going to push some men too but you know boil over because they're they're sick of being lied to and lied about but the good news is rape has been going down for 30 years American college campuses are probably the safest place you could possibly be as a young woman in America today despite what the left tells you the lies it tells you about you know about all sorts of things we're in a good place but the left won't say that or acknowledge victory because I'll put them all out of business well I was out of I was out of that having watched chocolate I didn't have another chance to send the kid an email and get it so I just went to the store I asked the kid I just want prone I didn't want to spend the ninety four dollars for the way cuz I didn't wanna ha all that protein powder so I went to the one on Lancashire and he goes do you take any pre-workout shit like I don't take mom I take the fucking quadriceps I didn't tell him that but I take that I take like half of the shroom tech right I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack I take half of those fucking shoe attacks sometimes you're in middle of class and you're gasping for air because so much air is coming in to you and my body can't take it's too much fucking ass sometimes like you're like fuck this is too much so I just went there one
