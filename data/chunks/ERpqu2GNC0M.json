hello freak bitches like I'm I when I look good ask me to have the ESI bodyguard Academy and aspect yeah when did that I don't know but the guy supposedly was in a room 6 by 12 room when he killed 12 Mexicans at night point with his bands ah so he opens up on this ESI thing and it's you know it's 20 G's you know it's a summer long program and you learn how to adjust up at the high altitude and drive an evasive driving and shooting then they have a course on maritime how to defend people out on the ocean and all that stuff but she Aspen in all of those places like Woody Creek where you went is home to the baddest retired soldiers in the world and you don't know who they are you just think that dude over there with the American flag is mowing the lawn that guy killed 80 people with one hand and be hey guys there's a guy never die no I'm target I'm Mallory is where they put them why why they put McCloud because the mountains to keep him away from civilization chanting in Chinese music somewhere you know ever want that to happen great glass in case of war and there was a guy that came in that was a Marine that bro Joe you know anybody comes in with stories I know one thing well I see it I believe it the motherfucker used to get picked up at Aspen Airport in the helicopter yeah like they said like a helicopter with two guys jumping out four guys around them and he was just waving uncle Joey I was 19 Wow and he would tell me stories about you know that the Green Berets and all these guys was sitting around saying cooking chili and they were all telling how many people they killed I killed 18 I killed 22 meanwhile he was staring the soup with his bit over the fire I'm saying like that's the type of stories this guy would tell he had me all fucked up in the head and I asked him once I go should I go to that ESI and he goes listen I go in there and smack them all with my left and he goes first of all you can't peach what you need to learn over there there because four years of Charlie and the bush is a lot better than 12 weeks of you hanging out with some white dudes with suits shooting people targets in them it's not real it's not until there's real consequences so that is a big part of what the election was about talking mitt you making us say and think things or just letting things be real well it goes in cycles we do one way and we go the other way and that's what it is just like we got tired of people going so hard politically correct like right see how there's progress now like we're talking about wicked-cool yeah exactly I mean you can't what I mean that's good people would walk into our schools kids will walk up to other kids that were kind of slow what are you retarded yeah like right to their face look at him he's a spade he's retarded that doesn't exist anymore and I think it still exists and just exists less and not like your kids go to school in comparison to where you go to school I'm in a bit of yeah a unified you're hanging out in Compton I bet you see some bad shit in school yeah probably probably this is probably some bad shit still going on a lot of schools a lot of kids are getting bullied and people understand the consequences of that now like you're scared to go to class someone's going to hit you yeah but here to go to class almost beat knew what bullying was just part wasn't bullying it was just life back then but it was bullying and it did ruin people live it did but nobody called it out no adult would help you out with it another way when you Nolan had take care shit and everyone was being bullied by somebody else it was it was dog eat dog it was a yep you know I don't know I think that you're right I mean the politically correct thing there's eight swings that way and you're left with some good stuff and everybody adjusted and then it goes too far and you start to go after things that don't affect a lot of people yeah and then people get fed up i well those thing is those people that go too far that go too far with all the politically correct stuff right they're almost always emotionally unbalanced so given enough time they will reveal themselves to be either crazy or power-hungry or like really like you know a big part of that whole social justice warrior movement is really about shaming people like expressing anger attacking people gaining power punching people that disagree with you like punch fascists punch punch Nazi like been aggressive about it and it's somehow another this is a good thing as if because they're so delusional and so detached from real physical violence if they have this idea I'm just going to go out there and push these people and take back know they're going to show up with guns you fuck yeah like this is how Wars get started people escalate you try to control people you push too far you're not kind instead you're shaming people you're creating bad feelings and aggression like they've got this juvenile idea about confrontation right that it just goes out there and it never comes back to you he always comes good luck yeah it was it comes back it comes back yeah I mean as much as the son was to walk in his father's shoes it's just not worth it man right it's really nice and you're probably not going to be as good that's just how what if you kid won on the fight like a bot like box yeah a boxer kickboxer I mean I'm Erica like I wouldn't advocate that either you wouldn't let them do that I'm pushing them to go towards like education I want them to be scientists like if I had to do it over again I will never play football I really yeah besides you would start from the beginning like if you could go back to college and knowing what you know now Wow not even close and just because the damage to your body well that and uh so it's a weird it's a weird thing so like you're you're in your prime physically as a man but you're in your infancy mentally alright right and so like I'm just now figuring out who I am and what kind of man would be and you're you're why you're in your prime that's when you're in the public eye so you have to deal with all of that on top of figure so you're figuring out who you are and fishable and it's a really weird really weird thing so I don't even want to do like any kind of recognization or any kind of fame or whatever people are called it I don't I don't like it I don't want it I feel like the best to me that the best society would be artists and scientists that would be a ideal society to me wow that's an interesting take on considering how successful you've been playing football I mean playing football obviously it was very financially rewarding for you made you famous for sure I mean if just some regular dude went on Twitter and started talking about I can take a wolf or nobody kills a flock nobody okay like shut up stupid I'm not I doubt anybody cares anyway but it'd all be fuckin my Twitter loaded on us then you were coming on like you would at school um I would just go home man my uncle shot a wolf man was gonna kill the whole family I don't know man um it's it's a weird like once you get to that to that financial summit that everybody strives for the American dream you realize that there's no there and if you ain't happy with $10 you're not gonna be happy with a million it is not happening now granted there are some things that you need you need monetary value in the society to to a certain extent I think they did studies like after $75,000 a year money can't buy happiness like right so everything else out there kind of is just luxury and really if you put a perspective I think like thirty five percent for me if you if you make $35,000 a year you're in the top 1% of wealth in the world yeah something like that so it's all about perspective man and once once once it took me to get to that financial summit to understand that unfortunately but the weird thing about is once you tell people that and you're on top of this financial summit really he's for you to say oh my god of course yeah yeah easy food I know a lot of miserable million ism yeah I was on the Concorde with Muhammad Ali and the and he had his angel dengue that the guy he had dodged one of them yeah and the he was very nice man very nice only met him at one time and that's not true I was in the Cotton Club in 1978 cotton club black nightclub used to be and via there was a black comedian and I was trying from a red red fox red fox mm-hmm and I'm the only white guy in the audience whoa and he was said something about white people so I've been tuned up we going in back in 78 I thought I was pretty tough I stood up and I said something back to him now this went over like a turd in the punchbowl I mean to call these people they're around me all the color of Fox and so Fosters and you don't come up here and so I go and then Muhammad Ali was sitting about six tables over and he protected me he said we got to let this white boy alone I mean you know we don't want a problem here so then I say well you don't have to protect me and I'm just was idiot or silly young man yeah yeah and I try to pay the bill in Mohammed Alisha's no your money's like good here the money's medicating jail oh no yeah they didn't not forcibly but but they actually video yeah nights over yeah then I tell her get out of here with you lighter clicks correct anyway so but yeah I had a big mouth listen damn tiny you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
