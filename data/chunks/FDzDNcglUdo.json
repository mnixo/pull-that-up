boom ok so now that I'm the producer of the Donna wrong spot we already established they established that yes we've taken off the RZA sure thank you for being here thank you I'm gonna give them a beat you're gonna have music first off we'll you said that I said I got a but down to it oh just assume it's all hip-hop use that that was insulting you know not hip-hop I would love any genre if you have a vision or you see or even connected to this at all whatever you feel I fucking got to fill it and I'll make it work I think your idea driving around talking shit is a great one I like my Villiger I did a podcast doing that we basically did like these little video things tuna but driving with Darnell is a great idea or even just you don't limit it do whatever the fuck you want one day we want to drive drive one day you want to sit in your living room just talk shit in your living room do that the day today was a good day for me because I knew was coming to do your show and I've been ducking the question and evading it for so long when I see you I can't even be real with you like I want to and I was like I said fuck man I'm doing Rogan in two hours I gotta go do a podcast what are you writing I was just writing podcast come on I know if he was on a podcast or a podcast p OD p OD knows of this I'm just yeah taking notes yeah it's just gonna be like it's just gonna meet I just wanted Joe to stop bullying me I didn't want him to talk shit cuz every time I just trying to help every time I see you side he'd be like this we have a regular conversation to hit just start doing like this what so much podcast we go shoot this shit to the moon oh come on you're good you're too good to not have a fire and I said and i'ma tell you I could go in front of thousand thousand people ain't tripping off that shit but just something about me talking to myself talking to myself I never did that well 44 minutes yes yeah do you ever talk yeah you know what you I gotta admit you gotta talk to yourself but I never did it but you know what you got a star bro let me say I gotta say this no the real talk Tommy Joe no bullshit I've been talking Joe buy this shit for five months we talked about the people bet his fans talking about and I ain't gonna front I was a little nervous about it and like I was like uh-uh and then when I did it today when I finished it I felt good his shit saying I'm a I felt like this I was like always bought the org site it's on see moving that's all you needed you just needed a launch who's they podcast off with Joe Rogan producer and a RZA producer and Jamie Vernon doing the difficulties Jamie was mad at me at first I said okay Jamie you're absolutely right I agree with you 100% but what I said what can I do to help me and you we're gonna make it happen and we worked it out worked it out he wanted to turn my internet oh he was like maybe I put me online and nuttin said there's a couple of companies that offer like a turnkey sort of situation what is the one who does Eric Weinstein's podcasts and it does Google they have a service they have a company and they just did they get all the ads for you and they take a certain percent and then they set up a studio for you you don't have to think about shit you just go in and be yourself we know it's crazy um not that I was jumping on Darnell's then why do I have used to that all right all right let me just say yo um nah um maybe for the last few months since we started the hulu the American saga a series people been pushing me to do a podcast I love listen to you I end up not doing one but we have one for the show of course that kind of does you know like after the show go go and listen and hear you know more inside details of the story but still during that process it was like you need to do a podcast with us because just the way you think you just need more people with that kind of thinking you know yeah so he said as he talked to us you know you don't talk to herself but then after he was finished talking to himself for 44 minutes he felt a weight come off him I was there's a scripture on that book what is the scripture is in the Bhagavad Gita why no no no I don't know I know the Quran is the Quran all right so the Bhagavad Gita suppose means the song of God this pet Gita Gita the Gita right it's actually the words of Krishna and he says contemplation with yourself which is talking with yourself will take you further than praying okay and if a man is not contemplating right if you're not and what are you doing it verbally like right now be talking out loud we all got that voice and I had yeah you had that voice who's like y'all put the condom on enough right you know if you listen to it or you don't listen to it right but the bottom line is that according to Krishna it's that contemplation that makes us better it's that reflection of what we did what we're gonna do and mu nu verbalize it even out loud I mean the spoken word it's even more powerful you get it out mmm that's how I felt oh I'm telling part it was like I was not let Jo talk shit to me about doing it but I'm glad I did it man did not reach him yeah yeah you gotta do a podcast you should they get mad money to say the most important thing is that you have a voice you're an interest guy if you did a podcast he would be interesting a lot a little it's good to have a bunch of different people doing it from all different different styles of art different person is alright other person has already been interested yes so what people want to keep getting yes how can you give it to him did you talk about man that's a death so fucking easy that's a no-brainer the bhagavad-gita it's you and Duncan Trussell the only people quote the bhagavad-gita that's hilarious that's all that's an amazing book man that's what Oppenheimer quoted when he watched the first atomic bomb blow off so I am become death destroyer of worlds so quote right from the bhagavad-gita yeah that's crazy shit yeah that's a that is a fascinating book man there's all sorts of allusions to like UFOs and shit to talk about whoa what the Maharaja which is a longer version yeah so the bhagavad-gita is about 700 verses that's talking out at the Maharaja which is one of the longest it's not D longest poem isn't it tops how do you say is it Mahabharata how do you saying yeah you might have that B is Indy I never even know those where does this Mahabharata up silent be it sound like that's gonna be in there that Debbie makes noise right but it's a there's Vimanas in that right where there's flying crafts there's about yeah weird shit the people face history try to figure out what the fuck are they talking about yeah and uh you know that ancient civilization was measuring they call coppers every thirty five thousand years you know and they were saying you know imagine coppers you know like that's that's that's like ka PPA like Cappadonna oh oh I got a tendency to make a disclaimer real quick I have a tendency to pronounce words the way up an ounce oh you never spit a six now I didn't I'm very white hate no no Manny I didn't even know what he's talking about I had to like go over tell him to bars you said you smell what I said hip-hop he was asking me about Sugar Hill and I said yeah I remember that and then I started singing it we went to sugar after a period of time yeah you actually if I knew no no this was said you miss sixty you was like this would you Toby Jo you said I don't have time to spit six no I don't I have much better things joy you said Jones enjoy listening to at halftime it doesn't what Jo you say I have much better things to do my time to despit sixteen I don't think that's what I said I'm pretty sure that's what you said what I said was I'm too busy to do one more thing and I like rap but I don't like to do it maybe I would love it but I'm not going to I mean yeah the top means don't try to twist treating me edit edit it out edit edit this we were talking about how few white rappers ever actually make it like the tiny percentage in comparison the ones who try it like how many of them try it you got a think this must be millions and millions that have tried it Yeah right like this like a small handful of guys well in all reality is a small handful period that's true too so if you look at the ratio normal ratio gasps mmm as we talk you'll see I'm always I'm always pulling some numbers into things but if you look at the ratio let's say 1 million white guys tried right 5 made it let's say 50 million blacks tried it's not me hmm so so usually the ratio right there anymore doing I sewers yeah yeah make sense but he'll pop let me just say some about hip hop Caracas I could say that right is that no Takashi tried to kill it but GU is not a beautiful thing is that hip-hop no not so good you know that's what I like I like this this this energy here but hip-hop is a pure American creation culture yes like it's like it's you know people try to chase it nah man trace it right here yeah and when it was formed right it's definitely you know you know a lot of young black men you know you go back to ku Hoke and Grandmaster Flash and in Melle Mel and spoonie gee you know you could go back to the classes you know Grandmaster Caz right but just with their Grandmaster Caz crew with a cold cross brother you got Charlie chase right so you got the Spanish brothers there with in our first hip-hop songs that we love you know LL Cool J Rock the Bells mmm oh god sue produced that Rick Rubin mmm you got the white brother oh yeah we was talking about it so so the so the youth culture of America at that time right even with Fab Five Freddy going down you know talented a CBGB crowd and all that and blondie you notice all these things was melting from our culture then whereas of course it is a dominantly a black expression right it'll be just say we dominated the culture but it took angles from every other part of New York to make it exist and that means it took our Spanish brothers and their culture they took our white brothers and their culture to all forming and then of course when wu-tang came me what the Asian culture you know I mean yeah and who tell you say that it's like it came in like a thunderstorm so so we said so so what we should be proud to know that is that it you know that this is like an exclusive American art form and look Bruce Lee who was an American right people who got it you know he represents the Asian culture but he was born in America went back made it big and hardcore and they came back to America and took the next level again and when you look at some of those breakdance moves and some of the philosophies that he bought to mixing more styles together you know G kundo which means the way of the intercepting fist or also the way of he could bind boxing with fencing with with Wing Chun yes right he pit all those in the maze together before was even that right when it was taboo exactly hip-hop also is that same type of product when you do have the the sole of James Brown the the jazz of the loneliest monk I mean I mean the the rock beat of Billy Squier yeah I got a big beat or honky tonk woman by Rolling Stones those are break beasts but yet you also got the Latin feeling of the Mambo Kings and songs like Apache and the men you think do you think hip-hop is evolving and not just because is it evolving in a sense of the creativity of it I think it's because people they got a situation now where it don't have to evolve among people have found a way to make money off of something that people may not agree with there's like hot but do you think your puppet is evolving yes it always evolved right so part of the evolution we're seeing now is where as we in my generation we relied on user that was created before us because we went to we came in the time when it took music programs out of school right so you didn't learn how to play a guitar piano good and your music equipment or your instrument became your turntables it became your drum machine eventually became our sample and then we sampled a lot of songs or a lot of breaks from old records that already existed right right but this generation right they're not actually force the sample they actually could take their chipboard their drum machine their laptop and just create and on their phones yeah and on their phone they just create the beat right and so now the beat has no historical reference to it in the sense of oh that was a James Brown oh the Marvin Gaye's that below this that's just that kid who whether he did foody loops and do some course progresses that or whether he sat there on his garage band on his phone and and hit the guitar program that comes with it or whatever the creativity of it is narrow having this form of originality right now of course once it sounded like that happens there's a formula so we keep hearing that same formula exists right right but I think one of the greatest evolution of hip-hop right is and and I said well I'm gonna use the word evolution loosely because when I think about the cold crush brothers and the foursome DS they did this anyway in the beginning but hip-hop has become more melodic now than it did in the 90s in the early 2000s right so what I mean by that you know rappers Niro you know you know I'm just so D like this it's more melodious more you know it's all champion right has the reggae chant vibe to it when we was doing it I smoked like smoke control it was all aggressive chop flap you know I mean so so you see that it evolves to this melodic form and then look at Kanye he's now it took it to gospel its melodic as hell right now Luke took it to the Snoop lion but still I mean he was snow was really successful this new client thing didn't wasn't that successful but the one he won the AL gospel I think he was getting awards and nominated in like and stayed on top of Billboard for a while yeah and now Kanye's is in that well so so it's evolving right and charts even different now you got fucking pussy eaten preachers now what you mean now just say like viral the pussy eat preacher Jamie googly googly say it was preachers bitty pussy for a while but this will get caught on camera a car outside I'm pouring on it like they just report no no no it's yeah yeah it's real okay women doing little

but cunnilingus is oh look it's you know fellatio or whatever you guys want to do this is part of sex so it is what it is right and of course everybody likes it everybody likes sex you listen I don't think you're gonna find a species that don't like sex you can see two flies on top of each other in right doing 360 right you know what do it verticals do there's the Eagles do it they have to fly to the air and they they almost crash to the ground while they're fucking because they kind of like run out of space guys trying to nut on the way down if they don't make it sometimes they'll bounce off trees and shit never seen it you should watch Eagles fuck Jimmy Schubert used to have a great bit about it I know if he still has it but you had a great bit about Eagles Eagles fucking sellout game of a ban yes evils fuck do they go to sleep afterwards I don't know I don't know a whole lot about it remember learning about it from a Jimmy Schubert bit yeah this is them fucking they fun and they just lock up until he gets it off she's like let go you're not gonna call me sick I'm gonna get it off about that those are American Eagles big risk for come this bananas that this is the real thing and then apparently they'll disjoin with no emotions no emotions involved with this look at his face though yeah that face like no emotion involved at all it's a terrible animal that has our national animal well no it's a raptor a vicious Raptor that doesn't give a fuck about any but when that motherfucker spread his wings oh that look is like you're that look and flying is what gives it that you want the world to be scared of you yeah he definitely want to eat an eagle is a good good one a good one I mean that's one of the forms of kung fu that I had a lot it's the Eagle Claw yeah I know you when did you get into kung fu movies wow I got a nose like I saw my first kung fu movie I think at the age of nine right wow you know that's probably only my third movie experience Wow only because

stuff affects my life the killer bees to swarm will turn killer bees right third time to the movie theater right or third or fourth time because sort of rocking and then I saw a double feature starring Bruce Lee which is called filly of the Dragon and another movie called black samurai starring Jim Kelly oh shit once I saw that he was good once I saw that I was hooked on action kung-fu movies as a double feature you had to the double feature ten days of nine and mind you how was the birth of wu-tang clan and mind you back then to go to the movies you did with my family didn't have the dollar twenty-five like to get the money to go to the movies that's a big deal I may take six months and we got to the movies I'm tell you this family my family this is back when I was still

you got 25 cent was just say boy ain't got good sense ain't got no sag got good sense boy you know it so we for that ever but at the end of the date of those movie moments you know I mean they really inspired me really took me like to a world I was different from the from the project world that I lived in you know I'm a hmm and once I start seeing movies like the five deadly venoms and 36 chambers and mask Avengers and super ninjas all that we start seeing those narrow you'd like in the preview yes it seen all this action and is this you start resonating with me and uh maybe around the age of fourteen I just ended if I hear more talk to talk the whole show of it but yeah yeah some like what is the potato and did is it I don't know how you know they like as a course Serb is this dehydrated was to origin of it I don't know there's a lot of wine that's not vegan apparently is that what they do egg whites yeah I don't even really to be honest I don't even really know what the fuck a real

only saying that to see that I could look at my household as a living example that you don't need I'm with you dad to live a man I'm not arguing whatever because I'm especially so now I talk shit about vegans that shit I talk about shit about plant-based motherfuckers but I know now like what the way people cook it and the more options there's more options to eat like that then it was when I was coming when I was coming up it was just like that sunrise paddy that's the only vegetable and they could tell you eats of broccoli or carrots or something but it wasn't no options then and it wasn't so many people doing it with you you wouldn't find a no vegan restaurant you like it would be one spot you got away go way over here you go to Jamaican spot in Brooklyn if you was a vegetarian

supplement I don't I don't really monitor yo alright I don't eat a lot personally you know I mean like on a good on a good day for if I'm on my best the best versa I'm not eating once a day anyway once a day yeah like the typical man haven't you ever eat today really no not me I got some I got so many goal of this I got some lettuce wraps yo you give them that shit you try to give me son that I want to eat after I might finish this what's it yo why you act like I'm against being a vegan I'm Noble I never said I wouldn't love it so I'm not at your diet man only thing I'm saying is you know I don't know Allah no f-bombs you eat one of those right what's this the wheezed white butter no it's nut butter yeah you can't leave it with not you can't leave it with healthy oils with that nuts cool crunched-up nuts guys I crunched up nuts that all right yeah well I eat a lot of those it makes the liquid that some people some people are cool with a liquid diet I'm just a couple with it tastes good and the veggies need nutrition work real quick okay it's great shit man well I like this reading it it sounds so much very healthy it says basically just protein in them organic dark chocolate I'm gonna say this weed brother no man why you keep don't say this to you because I go to him there's no work on him all right but every time you say something to me you said it like before you start tripping out all right this is for you okay no no it has dark chocolate in it okay so dark chocolate is known to reduce high blood pressure right us as black men we're you know they say we have high blood pressure right basically base towards being in America not getting that real natural Sun right and having a high sodium diet unstable oppressors dark chocolate helps reduce it so this is good for me yeah everybody but why you got just directed at me like I need dark chocolate you know what I'm just next no no I'm just saying key point deviation I'm sorry I like dark chocolate like everybody else like dog shot you like milk chocolate with dark side I like dark chocolate you know snow snow it's great well watch this shit on TV this is my shit box one on TV the food that made America anybody watch that you know what is it yo Channel no it's uh maybe it's a History Channel or one of them stations but they go into the Hershey Company the same people did the men that made a man yeah AME docu-series I didn't know I didn't see that one but that right that one about the Minute Maid America yeah I gotta wash it good yo they cover Kellogg they cover Kellogg's yo check out how I walk start black people like Pepsi but hold on let him tell the Kellogg story cuz you don't believe this okay Kellogg star because he's us a doctor with a little the quality sanitary but the quality sanitarium yes we had the words wrong whatever it is wait wait the doctor yeah no sanitarium there's a no tidal creek sanitarium yes so he's there I never knew that motherfucking motherfucking big Kellogg no Kellogg was a motherfucker he invented cereal to keep people from how awesome be AA cereal boxes forever he invent cereal to calm people's sexual desire because they because they because they was sick there and it's what they thought the best way to get the nutrients he would bake orders drained together and then break it up and no he did pour milk his brother actually was the one that was like pissing milk in it he's right Golden Grahams immediately Nath gonna check out the punch line of the story right so Kellogg's is doing this shit his brothers like yo listen it's money in this we could sell this but Kellogg's he's the doctor he's already making but he's like Marion look his brother's little dyslexia he ain't really kind of got its got these sons brother look we ain't doing all that son let's go to work and do what I tell you right right so he's going to go do what he tells him and then one guy comes over to the sanitarium no money can't afford to pay he has to work it off right so they let him work it off right he's working he's eating the cereal every morning and he's just checking out the sanitarium and he goes he looks around his name is mister post mr. post yeah huh he leaves the sanitarium and before Kellogg starts Kellogg CEO mr. Powe started post-civil homey and blue forgot about post yo for real it was a beef was it like serious oh it was severe be food for the whole pepsi-cola right you access a black people love Pepsi Cola right how somebody's white doin tank so you know why black people like pip sounds like you trying to be racist right and he explains story to me back in like the 30s with coca-cola and Pepsi was the to vine bottling companies and Coca Cola was smashed and Pepsi on sales like like 125 minutes like three million in sales per year right and Pepsi needed to do something to get a different audience so Pepsi painted basically coke to be either racist or not really caring about the black community and perhaps was the first corporation they started putting black people on the cover of the posters and it don't be in affluent like like doctors nurses they because anything you saw him was like Aunt Jemima shit but I've been perhaps II was the first ones to start doing that in Pepsi hired an ad agency twelve black guys I think was in Louisiana to go out and do juke joints and touch the black community and what Pepsi did was like quantity wise like say if you had ten ounces of Pepsi 10 ounce of coke pepsi cope with charts like 27 and Pepsi with charge like 10 cent but basically getting doubled you won you're given the get sugar you don't matter you could charge it up right yeah so that's the reason and didn't if you think about that through generations generation that's the reason why a person could be disconnected from a certain brand you said think about it if you if you like if you at home right you got Pepsi coke and then you hear somebody said man we don't drink that coke man that's at white people soda you don't said you won't drag it in and that's what I did and they it's a book called this call is a book called the real Jamie pop it up the real Pepsi challenge the real Pepsi challenge there to us and I think this would be I looked into trying to get the rights to if some kind of blocked early on maybe I had a right Jew tank laying on my team how one pioneering company broke the color barrier in 1940's American businesses Wow and see that you wouldn't see impact in you wasn't seeing posters of of a working mom you were just seeing like serving stuff and that's when audio version in that book about you could see the Buchan just see you really you could just see the outfits they was wearing and like the Pepsi dudes they was a Pepsi motherf they was a Pepsi that was just to have money to go throw parties that shit yep Pepsi it up pep it up do you know that coca-cola to this day is made with cocaine no they use coca leaves and then they extract medical cocaine from that and then there's a company that makes yep there's a company that extracts it for them and makes medical cocaine and they have they have coca leaves that are shipped to coca-cola to make coca-cola there's a certain flavor that those coca leaves give it no cocaine anymore coca leaves no but there's a company that's connected to it that actually uses those coca leaves and extracts the medical there is medical cocaine yeah they use it for different like surgeries and shit like that even though right well yeah in the series the food that made America they go into coca-cola crazy they could still buy coke yo but the events of coca-cola was hooked on coke come on another drug oh he was hooked on uh I forgot you can look it up right he sucked almost other morphine he's hooked on morphine right so he's trying a charity he's trying to counter his cocaine basically oh my God he's speedballing but but check it out but the cocoa the cocoa leaf by the cocoa plant was actually an African plant you know I mean we always think of it as being a Colombian and also it's like coffee how coffee all came from Ethiopia is that kind of party I'm going to it he make he makes cocoa he makes cocoa - cocoa planning few other ingredients together and uh he made coca-cola so he made a cocktail ended up take off the morphine and yeah in the original formula is still unknown no I mean Coca Cola when it had cocaine in it you like crack streets coked up exactly the fuck is really thirsty now heal it right now you imagine what that what was the decision like when did they all get together dry him we got to take the fucking cocaine out of coca-cola when did they get together and take it out how did they did it for people like we had with dental in like issues with their mouth yeah yeah okay lidocaine they using surgery okay yeah when I had my deviated septum fix I had a broken nose they straighten it out and they flood it with lidocaine to numb it it's like a cousin of cocaine yeah it doesn't get you high makes you feel like shit it doesn't get you high but you feel like disconnected and weird like they gave me a pretty good dose when they fix my nose and I remember I went to a restaurant like either that night or the day after I think it was that night and I was I was feeling terrible I got Mike I don't I can't taste anything I feel all shaky and weird like I'm not on cocaine but it does do anything to your appetite or anything yeah it wasn't that hungry well yeah it fucked with me it just made me feel shitty I just felt like I felt like my heart was beating too fast I felt weird and it just felt like something was off it didn't make any sense but they use it just to numb you up for surgeries it's real common I've never had another real common you've joined injuries and shit like that shoot you over lidocaine I knew some science to the world against the lidocaine okay shooting into his shins before fights for what the numbers showing I'm the shit out of his shin they started you fuck you come on didn't feel a goddamn thing he was all numbed up well there's no lidocaine in this this is strictly no dry roasted macadamia nuts no volcanic dark chocolate seed the next part is better on the back than the front right at least we're in chocolate canes cocoa powder cocoa butter and dark chocolate stars put this in my pocket take this take it don't you do it you put it on top of something no I just like it just like just throw the things squeeze the thing it just throw this I don't work out you can work out here to produce your show about to work out tell you everything a reason day cuz I'm gonna eat better cuz I'm tired of this muhfucka luckily be like I eat off fuck keep looking to be like let me explain to you anyone who's disappointed if your discipline with your diet no matter what you're gonna do it rather than people or not man I could do it I could do it for every reasons I could do vegan and everything for every reason the health reasons every reason for what I don't mind I'm not I'm not mad I'm not mad at beautiful I think it works for some people health-wise but a piece of a piece of fish sire you advise on it right if I can say I'll take my advice I said look even if you include one day a week is it what a vegan diet just one day right just like how like how some coaches they have you know Saturday included one vegan fried a vegan Friday no don't fry can give up vegan fried for fish Friday do you have good Indian restaurants that have vegetarian Indian restaurants they know how to do it cuz they've been doing it for fucking hundreds of years that's double diet I'm not mad at it I wish I liked it especially I like food especially if it's the best of that you're not saying anybody for those vegan struggle plate what is that what's that I don't know if carrots will or personick vinegar selfish Oh struggle please restaurant video know what that one of the plates they're vegan struggles like Travis Barker's place is get that crossroads vegan restaurant yes I want to contact him vegan is like one carrot like what banana you know you need party no extra sauces of nut just not rape plate yeah some band-aid sandwiches but vegan versus yeah you want something hard yeah you remember sorry you all have our own sugar sandwich don't advise it's just basically what is it - um itself sugar dye stuff it's like the cheapest thing to get was a loaf of bread yeah the cheaper thing you can get his loaf of bread loaf bread was 25 30 40 cent or whatever cheapest thing you love bread but everything else it's not cheap to meet not cheap you don't say buddies could be free a free well if you want to create the whole sandwich because no matter how big it is if it's meat what it is the same size whether it's a jelly sandwich or whatever you know and then you would get like anything in between two pieces of bread whether it was butter is sugar yeah I know this sells so know it sounds bill but it's gonna fuck you up you'll be asking butter and sugar that's not a bad joke you will die Joe no good but that shit is like as a kid yeah it was like being me me me me me well that's a peanut butter and jelly does for you if you have like Skippy of you're like one of the real delicious peanut butters and I said those delicious peanut butters well instead of organic ones the ones you have to stir yourself those are good they're good for you they're much better for you because they don't have any sugar added to them but everybody loves like Jeff sandwich with Wonder Bread everybody had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich everybody I want a Bologna and cheese I wouldn't bloated cheese mayonnaise I

Slimers this sandwich you think that's better than cats I'm telling you this sandwich it's the best thing they got in Cleveland is LeBron and this sandwich say yo the sandwich is still there yeah they're famous for their famous yeah but its largest you get this sandwich like you could just use if you really you get like the same is like this big you could be like give me a sandwich I did a half loaf of bread cuz you're gonna make you can go yo you could go home this slimy shit like if you want to get if you want to smash it let me check it the Midwest you come back - that's Lyman I know you ain't fuck with this son the death sandwich that's hilarious how big that is but no it's not just the size of it it's a really good Sam I believe it but it's I love when people do that something that's just over the top and what partes was farming me is that the cow's ass come on man a lot of meat is made from the legs the rumps you know a lot of roasts slim jims yeah it says right on it it says beef lips mmm beep beef ass asshole beep heart hearts good for you okay lips an asshole I don't even want to talk about meat what'd you make the real problem is really the preservatives and all the stuff they put in and to make sure you could roll it up in a fucking tube and stick it in a tray and let it sit there for weeks and months on end and it's meat it's not supposed to sit there like I don't care how you seal it if you unless you're drying it out like beef jerky and then even beef Jerky's got a shelf life you make it last as long as it can for bacteria takes it over but it's a it's tissue so don't they that's why they would dry it you know they would dry meat so they can carry it with him on the row but they didn't plan on its staying forever you know what it does it stays pretty long but that's slim jims they add a bunch of stuff to those processed ones I had some turkey jerky or some wood from somewhere thought it was wack but it was very good some turkey jerky not a fan of Turkey it's a weird choice for food it's like chicken tastes better well for black people Turkey anything feels like you just cleanse yourself your first turkey burger you like oh I've even know this part of life existed so mmm there you have people competing who makes the best turkey burger yeah a good turkey burger can change your life get me on a road of being a vegetarian well you know what that's the path I took I started first I stopped at me and then I went to actually turkey burgers Toki pastrami turkey turkey chop meat for my spaghetti you know I mean it may be chicken burgers and then one day I was eating like I when I was younger I can knock out about 30 chicken wing you know I mean I mean oh man one day he pointed at me chicken knockout 30g wings 100% so on so on the on the by the 29th chicken wing my teeth hit hit the bone gene and my Maura said no more dead bird really said you eaten you in New York City where all these pigeons flying around and here you are supposed to be an intelligent human being you're eating on a dead bird and I was like that sounds pretty stupid to me and I never ate it again that's interesting there it's funny is that pigeons were actually brought here for food that's was even ironic about us listen when Mama's fried chicken Harlem fried chicken next door fried chicken Brooklyn fried chicken remember we had the big chicken meal - it was crowds fried chicken double crowns fried chicken all agree yeah you had to get the hot wings cuz highways they had to make it right on the spot the other drug could be in the window for a long time matter what you got all of a sudden pigeon population I pay attention to the type of shit peasant population in New York City drop down we've been doing the movie Ghost Dog we had to get pigeons from Josie [Laughter] drop down and I was like yo dead bird so so I own operate chicken again puppet pigeons are edible they're good it's called squab that's what pigeon is the famous British name yeah that's pigeons come on son menus they just call pigeon anything outside chicken I feel thinking like you'd be calling anything but chickens you know this is some some birds are actually red meat like sandhill crane you ever see this and they call it rib eye in the sky it's crazy who said this they eat it your red meat the breast is a red mean it looks like a steak from a crane from a crane it's like a bird that flies in the sky giant ass fucking white bird flies in so this is on a menu yeah you could get it on some menus in Texas I believe but it's a wild game animal I would try wow that's what it looks like look at it it looks like Sun I know it looks like steak that's Suvi my friend that's your style Suvi and something that's what it looks like to see the time yeah crane actually is a good example of relationships a crane will fly across the country or the world whatever go to the mating place with other homies at right meet somebody fly home and when of age fly back to the valley that dude and stay married for the whole life kid Wow and let's might shoot them down and final panel of the Conner look like they look at the wait be with somebody for that long they wanna get shot I just wanna be delicious you see at the heart of that thing is red meat no the breasts that's what those images are that pull that image that's all sandhill crane breasts their beef yes it's the people I don't care even though I go to vegan restaurants if you like vegan fish mm-hmm don't call it vegan fish right that fish right that's just food if you want to say or whatever it is flavored like you know like barbecue flavored chips or something like that you could say flavored more officially flavored fish so you know the mind is not gonna respond like that they gotta do something to the mind and makes it still enticing you know that's ago that's vegan fur ain't no such thing as vegan firm but it's not such thing as vegan fur but if you are vegan mother you gonna buy that because you heard the word vegan fur how about vegan leather of the up a real thing it will work like that Vetter it were worse about the feather feather like flatter feather instead of you do know that's gonna say alright how about that verb like this a ver jacket wait you remember pleather fur is good yeah plastic leather yeah yeah yo shit a blow-up put the V or anything with the vo they're gonna buy sell buy it Vic yeah instead of chicken you sister V in there Ziggy like how you do that's my question alright you can tell a chick she you want this Vic Vic V in it take the world vegan and mix arm outside don't tell me that you're giving me a vegan steak mmm in a mistake homey steak is a particular part of the animals that's why we call it a steak the ham is a particular part of the animals why it's called the ham woody thank you about you I don't think they care about your professional it was fresh off of a hamburger right so that means they don't want you get him with that impossible I've never had it but the good if you were trying to trick someone into being a vegan that would be the way to do it you give them that and go look you could just start with this you know tastes a lot lower you miss burgers just go to this one you need a burger you have you ever had one no I have one the problem is this a lot of oils it's like it's very processed I think if you're gonna eat vegan you could eat Whole Foods but the perfect real food but I don't want you Joe they want a motherfuck like me they don't want you to do it to herself I was like like me I'm not gonna think about saturated fats right I'm not gonna think about that shit you know all that like you was y'all read that shit yeah but for you tell them I fuckin this burger is impossible because there's no meat in it and it's close to me but it's like even close and I've had that burger you'll be like this you keep telling yourself it does it is yeah yeah you up trying to save money for me when I was beyond but above it beyond what's better than impossible at the Brioni mmm both brand but is it the same thing it's the same concept but it's different times more delicious is one more delicious you gotta ask different people well let me say the meats we gonna the impossible burgers only a variable in restaurants right so you can't really get it in your crib but to be our burglar you're right they have products they got a lot of shit you go to Gelson's you can get sausage you get beyond whatever what do you think about lab-created meets the they're on the verge and they've already created some the they're on the verge being able to mass-produce like full meat that has never been in an animal well that's weird that's the matrix baby what does the meat definitely an animal it's a it's bits basically they've taken all the building blocks for meat and they've somehow or another what's with Google how they do it before I butcher the actual expediting here come out a makeup that's the matrix we learn to matron nature you see he was like yo oh he's eating a steak he's like I just want to be an important person but it wasn't he's like it's not a realistic is just right but this is a real estate this has all the nutrition of a real estate but it's not a real estate right but it is actual flesh it just was never connected to living on paper like no it's not you know it's actual flesh like it has the essential amino acid profile of steak but it has nothing to do with an actual organism like it's never been alive it's not like you killed it to make it there's some process by which they are able to create this that I don't understand and we're trying to figure out what it is to me yeah but this is you've got a good point you got a good point because we don't know what the fuck is gonna happen to people can see Joe all that shit is man they doing this shit already already not really this is a different thing this is a different thing and what this is is is meat without death and I don't know if it's real no it's I'm sorry I know it's real in the sense that they they have done it right I don't know if they can mass-produce it I don't know if it's viable and I don't know where they get it and I understand how the process starts but if I'm so motherfucking confused but if you could have it with no ethical moral or health consideration if figure if they figure out how to do it because meat essentially is a bunch of molecules it's a bunch of particles it's a bunch of things put together as people get more and more intelligent and they have more and more control over their environment they're going to get to a point where they can recreate all life right and meat is a step good things will be like this how much can you charge for it well I don't know but it's like cell phones cell phones used to be that Michael Douglas thing on the photo Beach that's what I'm saying the old man Rick it was probably a lot of money now everybody's got a goddamn phone everybody yeah but how much would they pay but a shitty phone now a $200 phone now it was a goddamn world changer 13 years ago you'd freak people the fuck out if you had the cheapest mass-produced Android phone you brought it to the past you showed people they'd freak the fuck out yeah I think that's the same with everything and as the technology to create viable options for people who are healthier when they eat meat but don't want to be a part of animal agriculture they say that like maybe this was about three months ago and it was big about how red meat does not digest yeah no no they was reversing it it was basically saying after all these years well scientists are things not bad for you isn't that bad for you so that was it that was it that was the Amish they go both whoa well here's this do good look it goes both ways right but I still say it's good for you did they say it's bad for you if they got an individual so you know what is good for me isn't that right but I will say that there's a way to create something that will save other lives yeah creative yeah right that's that's that's the evolution of man man should be able to say y'all you know what we have to kill all these animals to get a coat right now we don't have to do that we could form we have a formula to make a coat that's gonna keep you just as warm keep you just as serve the purpose and needs and no nothing has to die for it right but I'm saying we're gonna react eight people then well you could do that the same way with human human work right if you know you know you know not to go back to historical right but machines come and replace the the mandatory nosov human physical labor in certain industries right yeah okay that's better right good so now you don't have to subjugate somebody to do that there's no cost-effective friend it's more cost-effective it's better for it's more humane in all reality right so we support that but the catch-22 here he's got to be conscious of as you know in your own lifetime right if if somebody's telling me that I look you do this and I'm still gonna have my let's say 70 years on the planet then here do it but if I'm doing it and you're gonna turn my 70 years to 50 years I don't want to make that bet you know I may understand when you're saying I think that's what how we that's where we watch out for with anything even with the what even with the the you know the vegan diet or the the pillar Tholian died all these different things if it's gonna enhance your life that's the biggest your life take away your life yeah but you you talk to me like you I know what you saying though about diets and here's the thing about diets is everybody's different everybody's body is different people were some people respond better to a vegan diet than others some people respond better to a carnivore diet than others everybody's got a different make I mean like we were talking earlier about people being a allergic to peanuts well people have to make adjustments there's some people that are allergic to certain green vegetables now there's some people have weird reactions to kale and all kinds of other things I hate motherfuckers that allergic to healthy shit like what a my friends tell you what I do say yo I'm allergic to pretty much all salads I'm like that's the first segue it to be healthy salad these people are allergic to like basically saying I'm allergic to vegetables that's crazy some people are though yeah so girls are calm did you know that how do I know that some girls are way too jizz they're learners and their mans come inside the reservatol all over the place and it wouldn't matter where you go carve your name on their belly they get read it was one sucks told me to see that she don't like water that's it I don't like what I like I don't like water she don't drink water Yeah right that's not gonna but did she'd not like it because it makes her feel bad or did she not like because she prefers flavor you know what that's a good point because some people like when like water some people like I don't like what a why cuz it tastes like what something like I don't like water because it don't taste like sugar or anything is in it let me tell you something man I do hot yoga I do it a couple days a week I dunno I need 90-minute classes and water is delicious well you are sweating and it's a hundred five degrees in that room you're holding these poses and sweat is dripping off therefore it and you got a 64-ounce you just like what it does to fill it with ice and water you want that water I do could be a diet coke or a fucking glass of milk I wouldn't touch those things then we're right for that water when I'm when I have time I average oh I'm from my era oh I remember it going from only time you got water was that a water fountain water faucet water hose yeah nobody had bottled water and when when when they started my mother thought it was a devil when they started charging motherfuckers for water listen when they started trying to be water my mother was like no ain't no I could go right home and get water and I saw I go from charge like McDonald's like they blade like extra for water I started I sort of changed from that to bottling and having a tag saying 99 cents for a bottle water yeah would you pay for the bottle dollar rock the water is top half and bottled water in the studio like so many people have complained and they're all right everyone's right I listen to the good plan my guy yeah I got other things think about but do i what what what can we figure do about this who had done producing Donald's podcast can we figure out a bottle of water is this is just bring the conundrum into a good full place commander my fellow everybody's cup every time is gonna waste more water potentially than this guy works for Dick Cheney well we what I come to containers I thinking like a glass bottle yeah person that comes in look at that big brother I mean we clean him after every show we have a giant jugnu fill up a glass bottle so that people what about it people know you're recycling does that make a different makes me feel like a better person if they know you're recycling what makes me feel like a better person if they think I'm a better person I'm like again some people just never gonna give a fuck about plastic I'm one of them all you can do you can bury there you can show me the edibles eternal fuck about plastic hot yoga I love it did it today nine minutes reason why I want to go back to that because the idea of how water tastes hey and I wanna it goes back to me look this way this guy yeah Stephens he killed it okay dude rare dude that everybody loves everybody loves the only reason I said that case you know I don't know I know you say just gonna do comedy but I didn't know if you gonna crack a joke so I just wanna let you know if you cracked a joke that I don't know how hard you go you just start beating it up uh-huh yeah no I have some information I was going back to the idea of water yeah tasting good right and as well as any type of food and drink right all that tastes better after hard work yes so after you doing your hot yoga and you sweaty and you put that hard work in now you understand you appreciate the water yes so what I teach my children right is hard work when Adam when the most heart told Adam he said man shall work to the sweat of his brow now we may have a job that don't make us sweat you know right but if you ain't working out or doing something physical to make your body physically yearn the reward of working out which is the nutrients that you have to be punished yeah after you have burnt them out you know I mean then you're not gonna ever taste water you ain't gonna be able to bite into a piece of celery and like and feel it I know you don't think I respect celery I know you know what you just said I know that's the only thing that you gonna get that burst it is not like you get some celery then got that motherfucker pop with no string of none doing just a clear bite so I know you and I know you looked at me again but the water this is size celery I know you don't think I respect it I respect this do you like celery or peanut butter I like celery anything like celery I could just eat it like I could just eat celery I like celery peanut butter like celery well hummus you know I know how good a peach taste celery if you lift weights and then you eat a peach a juicy cold peach you bite into that fucking thing you said you said you gotta do something in your life to appreciate right some people that's drinking right like you you wanna know maybe I like you right now I'm not saying right now I'm not gonna do this with you I'm not doing this if you talk about being nice positive be nice we're both drinking I'm drinking too something has to like you've been drinking like the best time you appreciate water is at night after heavy drinking like you've been your pal is endings minute that's an alcohol alcohol you you had that feeling where you had some drinks one night till next day you drink some ice cold water you like god damn who the fuck invented this simple it's simple it's the same way you need it but till your body was like asking for asking for it you're right right but when you're drunk and you drinking that water you feel like an asshole like God what the fuck only a person could appreciate drinking only person can't drink appreciate water what he drinking is a professional drinker because in their mind like this I can do this with one glass of water yeah the average motherfucker is drinking they ain't give a fuck about that ratio a buddy of mine drank with jean-claude Van Damme back in the day professional jean-claude Van Damme was a pro he said he would ever drink and he brought a gallon of water with exactly a gallon so he would have a drink and then BAM fuckers chose water that's the only way he rolled just kept running the bathroom taking a piss and coming by when he drank he drank with a gallon of water and whatever the fuck he was throwing down I'm actually party in the top ten master drinkers Wow now if you ever if you ever really want to get a crazy night of drinking and see if you can hang hang time I'll just put his glass down but but uh you know so that's that's that's the challenge anybody who ever catch me on the right day want to challenge me but my brother the virus says something's really cool about drinking and smoking and everything right because at one point you know all hip-hop I'm abusing it right I'm just you know just whatever yo bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk he says listen he said listen y'all again how y'all drinking for nothing no celebration you did he said use you drank after you complete something and then you celebrate that's right he said that I took that I took that as realization and I strive to give myself a reason yes celebrate give yourself that's a beautiful philosophy for life give yourself a reason so right yo you early yes yo can we celebrate this so many people that a fan of yours spill over to the fans and minds and I get so many tweets and when are you gonna go on the Joe Rogan let's celebrate that and that's what we're celebrating today I mean I've been I've been hearing about you reading about you listening to you and my friends and my peers that's enough that's an honor because who me I've been listening to your music forever and so I appreciate you guys tremendously will tell you that your collaboration with Rage Against the Machine Boutin Clan ain't nothing to fuck with is the greatest collaboration in all of rap rock with that the second place maybe Run DMC and Aerosmith but to me my generation Rage Against the Machine and wu-tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with is the ultimate workout can I have a Woodson fuckin song man if you're doing deadlifts and that song wu-tang Tiger style I got one question was wu-tang sorry I like the way you start the quest of this you like this and you still agree syllables yo okay let me say wu-tang the vision in the design of wu-tang was it designed to fall apart and when I say fall apart was it design we're a group of individuals that were getting their equal due respect needed a bigger platform so everybody see him at one time together you were bigger were you designed to elevate what I'm saying with profile of all them all the members and the reason the reason I said this years ago years ago years ago years ago I had a sketch group years ago here's a glad to schedule it was 12 motherfuckers everybody had different person knowledge everybody was dope everybody could be started at different writing whatever but nobody had the plan to get the people to see that everybody is nice right right I would say this right wu-tang was designed right to come together for a common cause right and that cause of course being to express our art to rise ourselves out of poverty and the feed off families so that was that was a foundation but it's not designed to fall apart in fact wu-tang that's why on our second album it's called wu-tang forever breath meaning no matter what we do no matter if I go make movies or Method Man make movies or you go write books you come back together yeah we always got to come back but this will change forever but hold on finish last night but now to put us all on the same like to expose it all the world through one outlet yeah see that it had to be there it had to be that and the reason why I said it cuz I had my sketch group I have my schedule years ago Scott secret society when I was doing that I had this manager and she came this was before today Chappelle show it just thing I was like watching you bro look and I'm and then I said I said I'm one of the managers working with she was like the name our group was secret society she said I had Mike Epps I had monkey I had read grand so bad my father and and she said Daniel I think secret side is falling apart I said Nick it was supposed to fall apart it was supposed to fall to play but what it's fault whether it was fault does it land somewhere you could grow something else like I knew it was only three people that were gonna be stars but it was four other people that were gonna be writers right right it was two other enough mother fucker that was gonna be it was a different shit but we needed dad okay I got you there so he doesn't so force will fall apart that were you said fall apart I didn't mean it like you made more likes credit spread his wings yeah and like even though like when I said that I mean it like even though like everybody for the most part everybody want to be a superstar everybody had the chops everybody wasn't a superstar right and it's proven to this day some people's like this can sweat this motherfucker and wrote on eight different shows we won right this dude is toured in Europe we want exactly you know I'm saying it was like when I say fall apart it was like it was gonna go to here and then it was just gonna be letting it fall i dis yo you know it was good we all got it that they're strong enough kids exist independently in different areas I always come back together if there are two that's why we called ourselves like wu-tang forms like Voltron you watch Voltron yes yes each of the Lions yeah well you lead the blazing sword everybody got to come together yeah boats are so so we took that philosophy and we knew that within all of our crew that any one of us was first of all whoo tang there's a bunch of alphas it was it wasn't like what right it was a little sucker dude nobody wouldn't get Jesus fit but you [Laughter] it doubled up what it built 90s night behind these baggy yes yeah yeah we know back in those days you may have won three pair pairs right yeah and in the summer yeah but not but the night but the main thing is that to be able to you know I made to have the Alpha energy right and they come to a to us and to our industry that was lacking that he had mystical philosophy behind it too of course but that was the thing about it it's like wu-tang was inexorably connected to kung fu right like there was like there was that's the wall yes if he was a part of the music man it was like there was a thing about you guys that you were spiritual there was like there's an intelligence and then of course you had ODB who was off the rails what was beautiful about it is that you you guys all existed together you know what I'm saying and like even though you had this sort of spiritual kung-fu kind of energy to it you also had people just off the rails partying but New York niggas used to have a fucking wu-tang side easy knew wouldn't even know whoopers in this that was like oh like I don't know if there's ever been a group that you could just mention that anybody from wu-tang was there it was a whole bunch of garbodor tour has the fake Cappadonna oh my god he did get caught - he got about 70 grand and some like where was it in Baltimore Atlanta but he does it at all just hang out Carrie cuz you didn't because someone is so many of us you might not know how a motherfucker look you're not gonna know when they start getting and did you think about this I would did they we got kids who can't kids that is like we had to point now I'm always go woo kids gang try to have kids baby oh my god the most well the most beautiful thing though you know that's the beauty of art creativity and and being you know the spiritual aspect the the Alpha aspect all these aspects multiplied us to be a unique version of the American Dream and when you look at you know we did the documentary of Mike's and Men on Showtime and you can see that that it's more like it's like the lotus leaf grows out of mud right but it's the symbol of Buddhism which is all this peace and beauty but it grows out of mud we like that which grew out of the mud and then when you go and watch our whole new series the American saga right you get to see like this group of men weren't always on the same page wasn't always there's no way trans with each other and I think the biggest thing that I learned by pitting the TV show on Hulu is that there's other chairs across America in a similar situation yes right so so there's a scene where it's the soundtrack to life right but I just dare talk about like there's other kids that are hearing this that they can resonate this make sense right yeah so get my first drum machine I have the you know get it by illegal means right and think about how about how many people talk about how many people you know leave something to do something but don't have the means to get it and some may cross the line you know at the end of the day the way I really got my equipment right you know I definitely try to do anyway to get it but I didn't get it by stealing it right I had the hustle but sure one of yours oh you want it you didn't just want to get it for say I got you one because you wanted to do something with use it right that's a difference I sold apples oranges newspapers socks I'm on those socks guys have you better New York back in the day you know whatever cuz we're you bombed out 25th Street you get maybe you'll get a dozen for 30 bucks right then you can sell them with 10 hours of peso you get a dozen packs for 30 bucks with six in a pack you go uptown right and you sell them for $10 just for the whole package but you gotta find a neighborhood at knees socks you just get going neighborhood it got a lot of sucks but anybody but opposite is this use the uptown right account usually people go uptown to buy the clothes high-end clothes no no you go home town to get no you get if you get drunk from uptown Oh drugs like although I could get a hung out with with drugs uptown way to get back downtown selling for $200 yeah they had the best race or any drug you ever night but then you can buy drugs you could buy a bounce uptown right and sell it downtown or we even take it to back to Staten Island you've got a triple your money so satin islands three do these light with your money like the village is to here like that okay if you go out of state you may find and that's what all the New York motherfucker was coming down to DC and Virginia but socks you buy downtown take it out town because the drug bill is a flight it gonna have please it's so late so now they're buying the socks with $10 that you pay you $5 do you remember the ad VHS tape so people sit in the back of the movie theater I'm a film the movie and make a VHS they'd set up all your quarter don't worst the worst relationship ever terrible but if you but but then that's the same time that's when um VCR just came in so it didn't matter the quality you just had to have something to put in the fucking new technology yeah you know what you know what of art form or whatever um supports new technology always deal with porno whenever with your son it's true whenever there's a new weather's from beta to VHS to CD it's porno debt gets people to buy explore to new technology pave the way that paved away I don't know de yeah because there's so many people that are jerking off there's this it's an unsatisfiable quantity you can't you you always can count on them people are always gonna jerk off to porn so how'd you get it to them quicker how do you get it to them funny rewinding - like CD - a lake - now all you need is tag words well the way we think about people stealing music or people stealing comedy like they think about stealing porn so if you go to certain sites where it's just free and you just watch porn apparently the people that make it they don't get a piece of that so someone's making a ton of money and the other people are stealing yo you need to get somebody in between you making your argument I see what you're saying but I mean isn't it it's something it's a commodity it's a thing just like a Joey postal commodity yeah yeah in a way I mean if you create something like it's legal if you legal if it's legal rather and you hire cameraman you pay an actor you pay an actress you let them fuck you give them a certain amount you film it and then that's yours and then someone takes that and then they put it up on their website and then you could watch it for free and they sell advertising space and they make money off it at all that's infringing yeah it's it's no different than if they downloaded a wu-tang album and then they started selling it they put it on a website and then put ads connected to that wu-tang out so then that means they need to get better lawyers because a better story guys with that one album that that that drug pharmacy dude Martin with his name boscorelli squirrely he he actually got ahold of one of your outlets at an unreleased wu-tang the reality of it is that it's now said in a temperature-controlled rule in the Department of Justice really yeah so it's his he owns it still well he's you know he's uh he's incarcerated right right right right and so so Lee I think a lot of his assets has been seized by the government and including that album so those songs have never been released all right look at that fucking thing yeah beautiful one that guy's gotta be brilliant that's the way I could buy that off for him for real how do I look right here how dope with that look it'll be beautiful right here but I would release that online or release it with you or let you really I buy it maybe free though I don't give a fuck whatever you want but that the sitting there makes no sense to me and that box looks dope and I know that guys in jail you figure out a way to get it how about you boy and you know what that says right there I tell you what do you dope right here though it would I tell you one thing yeah I did have a conversation with the gentleman right with Martin yeah I said listen yo cuz he had a you know yeah a lot of bad things going on phone I said yo if I was you I would take this chance to do philanthropy and I would give this away to the public if I was help yes they store how much here talking from the public yeah but he was the net like we talked about early he wasn't a nice person he didn't want to give the impression it was a nice person he wanted to be I don't give a fuck and what you say was - he was having too much fun it was understood consequences I think he was doing that no fuck didn't he was he thought look he's a kid wasn't he born into money no where'd he make his money no he made his money in a pharmaceutical industry he was he was emigrate Paris who was like janitors but he wasn't like born to this company no so he was a part of the company he's what I couldn't be I think more thing to hear he had tenacity more than anything oh okay never experienced the public eye like he did with this whole pharmaceutical crisis where he's overcharging for it was aids Minelli's probably did but I think that his point he wanted he wanted to be known as that guy he was he was a smart dude he wanted to be known as that got him on being a supervillain this polluter but he didn't want to be on a low mega-money he tried to be on the podcast he reached out to me yeah that would have been interesting but I didn't tell I'm here to I suggest to you yeah whatever but I didn't tell them I mean me I'm a type of person I'm always going to try to see some advice in a positive form right that's just my personality all right listen bro the talking shit about you in the world don't look good for you whoo tang is good that's what lützen fella yeah yeah I say if I was you I'll take this opportunity to do something good how about this how about this maybe he sells me the box and then we released the the music I'll buy the whole thing from him and then we'll release it I don't know if he's got it he wants to sell it he's locked up for how long though he's just lost as a pill so oh the thing can you sell shit while you're in jail we've played Monopoly and you in jail it's your turn used to play over the house how many songs um 24 so that is ridiculous I think me personal needs to be released I think I don't my personal plea nobody in the history of music has been able to make an idea or sodas never heard art art like right to be quite honest it might only be no mother for the songs in there it's more valuable it's legend never being heard oh never being cracked right didn't release you release it then you set it up for people to be critical of it can't gotta give the opinion the opinion is there was something so dope Ted we could just break it down to one gonna fucking like what was the thought process button well from my point of view right it was just like that was how from my point of view music was devalued right by streaming service by society right how do streaming of course right illegal downloading illegal downloads right if you want let's talk a little bit of business I won't go to know give me two minutes of business all right so let's just take Napster right who's the founder right this type of technology right and he takes millions of songs and gives them away and then now people are getting all these songs for free now the music industry like any other industry has a certain quota of business it does every year like every other industry right whether it's four billion dollars a year five billion dollars a year it's the industry of a group of people and that's their yearly quota so if Napster comes right and and and he takes all these songs where all these people who are waiting for their publishing checks waiting for the economics to be created for music now there's no publishing check all the numbers are now decrease because there's no physical sell of their music for us to accumulate a value to send you a check but then at the end of the day after he does that he gets a billion dollars so now you took in what belongs to let's say say there's a thousand artists that's worth value and for us you know that sell records that you could say accumulate money right so he took it took the power of a thousand and put it in one man's hand okay so that's one of the first mistakes as an industry when you make and then the second mistake we make is that now their services going and there's illegal downloads and people won't pay a dollar for the record right right and for album you won't pay ten to twelve hours for album even the save was twenty dollars you won't pay that but you'll pay three hundred four hundred hours for your headphones well two or three dollars for your iPod or your phone and you using it for music let me ask you this what's that's that's without your headphones without music you have oh this is useless right so why would you not pay the ten twenty hours for the music cuz they don't have to right right because they don't get it some other way but let me ask you this what is the best way to support artists what's the best way to buy it well the best way to buy narrowly No yeah yeah now your music Tang Clan anybody's music what's the best way get the most out of it well the best way in the past was physical but now the industry has figured out how to monetize the digital streaming so now things are starting to rebalance but during this period of time though maybe within the last three four years it's starting to rebalance but if you look at from 2000 to 2015 there's a total unbalanced right a lot of artists had to stop making music because there's no economics right now I'll group like the wu-tang clan right so let's just say this I say the average verse for a wolf a purr you know let's say you're a metal you get a little good sixteen you might be y'all tell you don't know what 16 is to say yo don't be 20 cent for that right okay 20,000 Joe okay so now let's just say he got 10 verses on this album you know I'm a let's say every other group member do the same so to get the guitar album made it may cost a million dollars a studio session a studio session is up to let's say at a cheapest level 100 bucks an hour you do it to do a 12 hour block out that's another grand a day just to get into the studio but you got to engineer there you got so it costs money to create music right but now you get all this done and you want to sell it and somebody just the world just takes it for free so now you can't recreate it again now even though the tools have gotten easier now and you could do a lot with your laptop and all that even a laptop is - geez bro even though the download just logic right with everybody you $200 man and so you need a socially so so it's merchandise and brand now it's merchandise and brand is merchandise and being able to take the idea of that brand if you're a fan but if you're a fan what's the best way disciplinary whenever you what's the best way to plan what's the best way to support is it Apple music like what is what is the best one iTunes know that you now narrow everything gets found this way other words that you could stream is good and you can stream it Spotify skills modifiers good you could download it directly to your phone if you fusion perfections two fans like what's the best way to support wu-tang clan what's the best way to accumulate music require music I mean if I just they're all good now like streaming yeah I think it's balanced obviously the tunes how's this Amazon look music's the second thing the catch-22 here Joe is this okay now music is also made to be heard yes so while at one point I try to prove a point by saying look I'm gonna put a value on it so you know there's a value to it because there's a value to me but then on the other point right we put I put another album out called it better tomorrow which is like y'all do what you want with that you know outcome because I don't make music for me to listen to I'm making for the world and listen to it at the same time so the best way to support your artists is just by listening to the music alright would you it's beautiful but so this is good though this is cuz I've always wanted to know this cuz I've always I've always been like what do i do do I do iTunes do i do amazon like where do you get the most money back from yeah I think look I think the system has found the way to balance itself okay so it's okay now yeah so Spotify is good you know sliema you know Sleeman look you know I mean I think even Taylor Swift is thinking about coming over to the swimming thing that dirty girl don't come to streams yeah because because because that's the way to listen now as long if she gets a good deal right I'll be like you said just the whole thing in the day is play fair yes like you know what you can say I don't want this streaming service but somebody has to have a platform for people to even come check for you yes things need to know fancies knowing what a give I'm a fan and you know $14 is not too much money for me to spend I need to know where to spend it with if I could if there's one place you could tell me that's the best way to support wu-tang clan as a fan right and I had the money to spend you know I would definitely you know I would buy the vinyl right Wow because it's tangible right because it's there's a tangible spending money right okay you get a buy physical of yeah physical for physical especially a record like you buy the vinyl yeah there's a killer that's so funny that you said it because I know people of certain blah blah blah this like this oh shit they want audio rights to something so taking put it on vinyl and then the value is the history the story like a motherfucker one of vinyl wu-tang because it's art just like what they do one joy it's alright and like you said we talked about it earlier it's coming back yeah it's coming back now I'm not saying he's gonna go to clubs or anything like that and the DJ's like that but the act of collecting something and take it take home with you every member CDs CDs is like this technology is about to die why would I buy this CD because it has a book albums were weed or they give you a giant piece of rolling paper yeah yeah yeah and that was the last thing and I don't see what you did but I don't see people doing that but I think it's gonna go back nobody's everybody's not gonna have 12 hundreds in your house or whatever but some people especially if it's a genre or something did you connect with they're gonna be like I want to buy that well you know what's important though for fans we don't know for a long time okay it's okay no you go talk shit what I leave do you like this you probably wouldn't go for a lot of fans they don't know like they don't know what it there's no clearly established what's the best way to support an artist it's more great now than ever but like I said if you look the physical act of going somewhere right right and by is something uh you know it's a give-and-take it's an act like going to a restaurant you go there look the food is three times the price of cooking at home right but it's a physical act so if you really love an artist right it's just like I just got the arms I paid $100 for the soundtrack to the once upon a time where Hollywood soundtrack $100 yeah there's a hundred dollars for this hour it's a collector's that they had like a collector valeu okay down at the Grammy Museum I saw it I was like I'm gonna take this some some you know some great songs on it what's the band that made Cherokee Nation hmm anyway point being Becky people the Cherokee people Cherokee haven't you made that one yeah who the fuck made that Cherokee people what is it Cherokee who made that what is it find anybody that Paul Revere and the Raiders yeah okay that's a bold move George Washington the dudes in the boat but point being made is I wanted that vital yes I wanted a yeah I paid my hundred dollars for it right and I walked out the store with it you know I mean yeah it's just like comic books you know I just got a first issue of the new x-men I actually bought it for meth so when I see him I'm gonna give it to him but because he loves comic books and I was in a I was in our own when I was at st. not st. Louis at the st. Louis I was anyway I wasn't that of you it had a comic book store there I went in there and I was like yo they had the first issue of the new x-men bought that and plastic that in my bag and of course you go go online and you could do but the physical tangible thing I think is the best way to support artists and then you and if you in our day the way artists actually make the most economics it's do live concerts so the only way that's gonna work is if somebody hear your music so I always tell fans look just listen you know I mean listen enjoy you know we creating something for you to understand or for you to fill a vibe or for me to take you to my location I casual everything around me we're taking you back to New York the New York crime side you know thanks oh man and then when you come down and you get that song in your DNA and you come to a concert and you see us perform it then we have a symbiotic relationship you learn a song that's how I said that's beautiful because you giving them a physical object yeah I think it's important I think you're right man that's why I want that God box where are you Martin get out of jail sell me that box bitch come on how much do you think he'll sell it for if you had to guess how much do you buy it for oh he had it I mean I think they bought it what - two million I think I think he had it all exactly I don't obey I'm gonna release it for free I'm gonna release it if that's okay with you if it's not tell me and you guys can sell it but we need to have that that needs to be released twenty one twenty four twenty five twenty five songs get the fuck out of here let's make this happen man Martin well yeah cause you like collect call listenin Martin Martin when you get out I need the box for the desk Martin wow did you arm so so wow so now that Darnell's guard I could talk about is the best man we finally got him to do a podcast I chained him and to do in one episode that he already did right right because he didn't want to come here and tell me that he hadn't done it yet so he did one and then we're gonna take that one Jamie's gonna produce it and edit it he's over there saying is that like we're gonna do it together but we'll promote it I'll promote it on Instagram I just been trying to get him do it forever you know he's a goddamn natural natural he's a natural he makes me cry you can't be stopped now you said you'd do hot yoga are you insane anything's in there like what's what's it what shit is it all physical with yoga for you or something no it's what it's it's a mind cleansing thing as much as it's a physical cleansing thing cuz it's all about concentrating on my breath and ignoring all the fucking ideas to keep darting in and out of my head it's just like meditation in the sense that I'm trying to calm myself down and center myself and I'm trying to cleanse myself so when I'm holding poses and I'm concentrating on my breathing what it does is it eliminates all of the stuff that I don't necessarily want in my head right it allows me to manage my mind better and I think that's the thing that is misunderstood about yoga because in my opinion and I've done both I've done regular meditation and I've done physical exercise I think there's a benefit a great unrecognized benefit to physical meditation and I find that in yoga I find that martial arts yeah I don't know if you find that as well so definitely yeah because you have you have still meditation fucking stupid lights man we gotta fix it Jamie and I have been talking about it for three years whatever to the chest son the way the chest oh got read sorry being refilled with terrifying concoctions so we talked about physical any day meditation right and still meditation so as I say like there's a meditation where you just sit still yeah and you just breathe and actually won't hang right so I'll give you a little Tang law so what and the story is there's a monk named Chang san-feng who leaves Shaolin Temple because he feels that the physical exercise is not the pure way to enlightenment mmm right he thought that the kung fu was to external right too many complications by ego and so he returned so he'd be treats to the mountain and he goes for enter lukang fool but in the process of doing internal kongfu such as Tai Chi Tsing Yi BA kua right like these techniques like this this is they called the ACE peace brocade will you just sit you know I'm a and you just do very small movements you first you bang on the back of your ears it's called banging on the heavily drums to open up the back of your brain like if you do that right now if you clap make sense if you cover your ears right if you take the headphones off right and you cover your ears like this you take your thumb like that and you okay of course just louder right you hear right oh it gives you a little rhythm right so you do that first right and that's just to open up your your brain like to open that up right you do it.why inhale and exhale it bouncing again and yang like that's one of the blow case and it so you've made these eight pieces of brocade right brocade brocade means I've got something is blocked right right Kade right so you want to open it up but open up these open up your your main vessels you know me okay cause being your ears your eyes your nose your mouth you know that goes back to Jesus and the seven churches what is the seven churches that Jesus spoke to the seven churches where he spoke to the two hours the two loaves two holes in your nose your mouth you to it so he's speaking to a man say out of his mouth came a double-edged sword the sward of course no so I can come out of your mouth your tongue is that sword double-edged exactly yeah so a wool shouts all the preachers to be well before the carnal IGAs party becomes so so we'll take itself right this guy leaves the temple goes to the maryland the meditate and he's dealing with still meditation right but in all reality when you mix it together wu-tang in Shaolin you have the physical and the steel meditation and it takes both to actually find this level of enlightenment you're looking for so when Bodhi Dharma came the Shaolin he actually came from India so bodhidharma was an Indian monk who was more of a yoga student he comes to Shaolin and he's trying to teach them the Indian Way but he realized that all the monks are too weak to sit there and they're still meditation and so he created something called the low hands right on the 18 low hands or right and and he these forms and these steps were made so that now they could do a physical movement to build their body up so now they could meditate longer because you could have a strong mind what's the use of a strong mind without a strong body and what's the use of a strong body without a strong mind hmm so that's the yin and yang must be balanced and so that's the Shaolin the Moot a philosophy so when we made one turn Claire and I'll go back to myself with this we may will taint Claire as the name of our crew we took the verse from the Bible about the SS water Jesus speaking right we said okay we're gonna use our words and our wisdom and our spirituality to talk to the world through our music right but we also took that in the wu-tang law they said the wu-tang Marshall our monks they develop the best sword style right so we're like well we're the wu-tang we have the best sword style mmm but we come from Shaolin because that's the the well with springs forth right and so we took the physical of Shaolin as our base the spiritual the meditate force of Wu tank and we put it together and our album starts off if what you say is true the Shaolin and the wu-tang could be dangerous oh my god that's that's hip-hop history ladies and gentlemen I need a would I need a wound name sir yo give me a wu-tang name I don't know I gotta go to that name jittery desert yeah you name jittery me no how do you do it you can't change who you are the words won't change your essence I just want to your essence is donnell rawlings there's no escaping that show I respect what you're saying understand that and it still went out yo when I did that show Halloween with um Kevin Smith there was this louis MO tearing generator arrogant dreamer come on man Aaron get dreamers pretty girl take it out like that listen when I was doing that I'm Kevin Smith show Halloween yeah there was a part where I mean I mean I owned a dispensary I'm in there right and I smoked weed and the only time I think I could spit is when I smoked weed so I'm smoking weed and I just was doing these bars and at the end of every one I said wu-tang at the end of every one I say we'll take in Kevin Smith know me every time I text him he's like wu-tang forever the Dame says I should alter this is what this is my pitch to him for the Halloween show like they know every time I was right it's like yo nigga wu-tang forever what wu-tang forever so we had I pitched a scene where all I'm saying is will tell you tang and I'm gonna dispensary right and then you know how to security cams and shit I would like it'd be like it was in motherfucker say is wu-tang the actual wu-tang show up to the weed spot and that's the thing I punch way all my raps with I sure you know you know what David they did have a lot of jokes with wu-tang in it right and I really appreciate I love our music yes beautiful manhattoes on the show but he did one wu-tang joke right that that fucked me up so watch it didn't we Netflix specials right it was the first one and so me my wife's be excited yo Dave boom he put it on and we watch it and we die laughing and then he he goes into the the scene where he does like he's at a party and he had the transgender do fall out and all that and everything and then he then he goes you know he don't understand you know how you know how somebody do that like you know I mean like what does somebody do this you know did this chop the dick off butyne bang they just keep going I was like what what the fuck was like we both had a mess ain't nothing like for the first three minutes mr. white right next fucking huh next fucking day I'm somewhere and me in an elevator and boom it hits me could they stay on my fucking mind right I fucking start dying laughing it was a punctuated no no well so what was the difference with what you thought the joke did you didn't get but what made you get it well maybe get it was just I'm trying it because David's David's a genius yo his shit is crazy all right it's like a luring you want to get the vine when you get the ROM right but so well he was saying he said he don't understand how a man chopped his dick off so with a man do a mantle go decibels we the reason this guy tell what you got I figure I got then I got was the phrase you could say there's a dude that was affiliated with with us right don't say Philly before he was a routine he was wu-tang say listen it wasn't part of the wu-tang clan all right all right I gotta give you a test before we go further I don't want to test I agree with you founders from the Shaolin wu-tang clan strikes again the versa the jusa dirty bastard inspect the deck Raekwon the chef u-god okay Ghostface Killah and horse and master killed in come better make wanderer in New York right now for the jets-giants game right yes of course Cappadonna and master killer and a lot of mathematics and sometimes even red man a street life but but check it out but this soul so we had other groups be silent Northstar actually Sarnoff star assigned the Black Knights both West Coast groups so some some for long beach some from compton you know and uh you know with a lot of songs with them talented young brothers so one of the members of the North Star sown doubt his own dog so now one of them drugs you talk sold out and they call him you do it to care I don't what they call it yeah oh there's a word for it dogs what's it what's the word when you do it cast we just guess it had to get the word brother okay so now so he cast raised itself right so now that's the punchline of his joke the punchline is like cuz this do for no reason it was a callback yeah elevator like 24 hours later oh my god that bit as a long fuse yes yeah but Dave Dave does got those kind of joke oh man I remember when we were on a road when that actually was the news right and he was like woo time punctuated so much in anything whatever you do for fun anyway for anything wu-tang forever you so when a member or at least an affiliated member of the wu-tang cuts off his dick and yeah he doesn't he could have been like a nephew a wolf you did he glue that nephew or whatever you know what's so crazy about that incident first of all that it was literally funny but it was hurtful in the sense like when it happened I wasn't I was doing a TV show called gang milady right and so you know like I would go like say it happening on the night it happened the next night is the cast well the whole cast get together and this shit is the news this is like on every network there be TMZ this is like old shit and I'll come in the room and I say what the fuck happened like yeah but I'm telling you the thing about is like I don't know what should you do to represent your gangster but cutting your dick off is the most go hard shit a motherfuckers good it's hard right now that's like next level there's next level now homie so so I had a buddy with me at the time Paul banks from Interpol and we worked on the album and so he saw me as like dumb damn Bobby you look kind of fucking the press I see oh man like I don't like the way that sound man right he's like you know I mean it is like that depressed it feels you know feel man and so first of all I'll take not found in the history of mean of my study I never heard of a man chopping his own shit off this is biblical to yourself right so Mahabharata and we said to him what he said he's I listened he party was really fucked up probably really fucked up yeah I said but then you know verse and then they say he jumped out the window over the balcony but dick off jumping over it did hit full stride would hit down no no so so so my man Paul said this he said I think he was so lonely he jumped how can you get that check it out he said I think he was sober when he jumped and he would only give me this whole story about one of his friends that would had a problem here because he had to console me right now I'm kind of puzzled so he's like I'm fucked he's trying to control me and he told me I say yeah but he didn't die he said yeah he didn't die cuz he wasn't gonna die like you know I mean so gave me a little metaphor my head so he said I had a friend who used to drink and shit and one night he had a problem what he in one night he was in a hotel and he laid on the fucking the the balcony of a window right and he said and I said yo get the fuck off that and the windows over said he fought this way he's going down ten stories but if you go this way says hit the floor he's in the room and that's that's the whole thing he said that he went this way people will now every 10 surahs but during the fall he sobered up but when he hit the ground he didn't die he became quadriplegic the dick cut off motherfuck no no no no this is the dista this dog what point being made is that you ain't gonna go with till it's time to go right or wondrously so you think you kill yourself it ain't happen if you cut your dick off and you survived eh that's the time to go hold on hold on but so so the idea is was he sober when he jumped and so and I had the chance to speak to him right I sent him a Quran you know and I was like I think you know look my have to get into some studies brother cuz you know it's so so so so anyway I sent him to karana buddy hold you down off of that and then I said uh I said let me ask you a question and the question was you know did you know when you jump you know what you say yeah he's like for that moment like it was everything else was whatever it was and you know you could read this story and he says why he says what happened in the story but when he jumped he that was the moment of sobriety and and for me that was like man that's the way to jump when he cut his dick off that was at the moment of sobriety it's it's after okay you know when you ever do some shit you ever been fucked up yeah you do some shitty Oh Oh like like I had a really bad sexual thing mad man it was one of the sex nights you know I was put up I kind of I kind of had like a blanket over me and was going to room the room fucking girls was like it was one of them like bad sex drug in your system I'm fucking everybody tonight against the grain but then there's that moment right right yeah right it's all good yeah the scientists they got a world started hoping the Dave season so I'm getting I'm getting a track today I'm getting the track today you are getting the track any maybe right now son you money disappear man oh you said the thing about deal today into producing his show Gil today Jamie and to being the the technical adviser he guilted you into the music and then he would try to pretend that you trying to run out of here oh no what I said what I said was like I'm sitting you talking shit to me here it is you just produced the first episode hundred percent think you oughta Jack and Jamie wasn't fuck

the Hulu show I'm interested in the Hulu show okay cool this one thing so this is I'm give you something edit so that's why I was just no we're good he's good James gonna beep over ok so people are mad right now what the fuck it was better when it was live I could senator picture my dick so the Hulu show was our own created by me my partner Alex II executive producer Brian Grazer and I love Brian yeah he was just here last week oh yeah yeah he's all right that's right he's an interesting guy man I really liked talking to him and he uh well he's a entertainment icon in genius and what he do and he had he actually read my book the Dow of wool and that led to him having an interest in making this into a TV series you know a and so we are we part up with Alex see Francie cow-calf oh and we vote 10 episodes of this we don't you know gotta write as well put it on Hulu is called wu-tang in the American saga an American saga and it follows you know us you know pre wu-tang days in all reality right so you get to see some of the things that happen in our neighborhoods and some of the things that molded us to the men that we became and it's not only because of like like you know we know we have the Liberty to fictionalize some things right so for instance they could be a character you know you think about every Garner right that's like popular within the last three to five years right maybe a little longer right but for us that same thing happened when we was kids in our neighborhood in the end the same neighborhood Margy good okay so that's that happened on Staten Island you know they in and and and we was able to do the show kind of go back and look at some of the same problems that we have as American citizens in our communities that we are still facing today for instance in Episode three one of my favorite episodes you see a black mother addressing a funeral about how so many of these kids are dying from gun violence over things that's not even valuable things that could be the place where the sneakers are gold chained but the life can't be the place and she goes on to say something that uh you know as a mother the pain of Labor you hear how painful that is right I've seen how painful so imagine the pain a woman feels when their child is killed in cold blood I can't even imagine it and she goes on to say we never see our children as thieves gangsters you know criminals we see them as our babies you know I mean and we're turning our community into a war zone and we gotta realize that this is our community and these are our babies so the show the show gets a chance to tap into all of that because these things happen and I was talking about earlier with so much the same thing we saw my guns I was like a black person perspective and their views and how to look at guns is totally different from someone that grew around where the NRA was strong but we had gun laws I'm saying what every black person when you think about a gun you think about something this could take somebody's life yeah and I don't know yet you also think about a gun in certain cases what took a life of somebody it was innocent it was somebody with an authority you know I'm saying so like most black people their connection with guns is totally different from just like hunting and I want to protect my household yeah because and and in our show we don't we tap into that but at the same time we also tap into that feeling when when the kid gets a new drum machine right without their instruction manual and he's gonna stay up all night figure it out you know I mean play on it and makes up and eventually make something you know like for the case of me that SP 1200 I made that beat for playing the pain which is when I met the man's first video is one of his first charting songs and you did think to think about me trying to figure this thing out and figure it out and it makes getting excited every time you figure it out and this and they make something that the world appreciates right so you get that that angle as well but then you also you know you get you know at the time my mother was working for a man named fat Larry fat lab he was a healer he was an Italian guy who ran the number spots on Staten Island you know I just come to tell you restaurants I can't remember it was so it felt so illegal and fucked up but it was so good oh yeah salute Abitibi temple to that culture as well so so anyway so it was an honor to work with imagined TV you know Brian Grazer of art how it also blessed us all in as well in a my partner Alex II who are just a good writer you know he both super fly right the new super fly and he's just a good writer and our partnership led to these episodes and uh it's a vegetable that I feel to be respected as a hip-hop pioneer and someone has started some different shit in like you can rock a routine with forever but you still been able to I'd like be identified like you you don't say how's it feel to be go through the hip-hop thing and didn't being respected in the film world in the writing world like you are now I'm it's a blessing of course right you can say that without no joke no strength it's a blessing and the beauty of it all for me for the RZA is that every step that I take every foot when I leave I leave the floor hip-hop right so you think about you know of course you know dr. Dre is in front of me he's ahead of me you know and so you know I had his records before I had a record and so I watched the NWA movie and I'm like wow it's a movie now it was an album now it's a movie and now you know how do I take it to another level well now it's not a movie it's the TV series Wow you see and now somebody else at hip-hop could take a look at that and they could say wow what can we do now to take it to another level so the biggest blessing for me the biggest reward is knowing that there's footprints being left by the abbot if they call me the abbot but the abbot is leaving footprints so on so when people in hip-hop you don't have to be crabs in a barrel or trying to say a rom or trying to make a beat I mean you could you could you know you could take your art and put it in many forms because there's many outlets of art even an editor yeah even a good editor hip-hop video editor it's a certain style to his editing right so cuz he has that he has the hip-hop in them you know I mean so even there's the outlet a lot of young people you know in many films we all sometimes strive towards the same goal not realizing how many people it takes to achieve the goal and do film and with this do film being one of the most collaborative art forms and you watch a movie you'll see you know hundreds of names go by when I did my movie man with the iron fist I had was that Tarantino yo you know the weird thing about it like man like me being on the outside is saying you create anything man that connection felt so like it was so amazed so much since sent emails so it's like oh and the baddest man alive is like number two behind the rage against machine gutaeng collaborate psyches god damn that's a good song god damn it thank you but point being made that 500 people was employed yeah a lot of people a lot of moving parts so think about the young people out there who's trying to figure out whether their art filling fitting whether their talent fit in and I say to them look it took 500 people to make that okay and you never know where your talent gonna fall so be good like he told you to spit the spit 16 you got a 16 listen his talking attract millions just like 16 yo man only reason only reason this is why when he was 16 cuz knew he was gonna say where's the fuck is your pocket already know this motherfuckers voice is the voice of this whole shit in a muhfucka can just sit there and talk to somebody forever and not only just terms my forever just after doing comedy I was economy didn't I got time to talk to somebody forever and I'll have crazies you could do it too I want y'all started 45 minutes with nobody you I got two producers y'all already some I produced three producers we gonna do it you just you're on the road man you got no worries you're gonna leave with a verse check out hit me what's the logistics is my egotistic personality part of my coexistence or is it just the dangerous stranger paying me an uninvited visit like an unwanted Christmas guest or is it just a fragment of my lowest self Envy greed and lust or my higher self goodwill love and trust you this therapy - I'm therapeutic to discuss I was dangling in the dirt like a pair of loose shoe strings but I was born in the USA like Bruce Springsteen torn between the temptation of bringing the ruckus - maintaining a structure - keeping girls on my payroll that'll cut your nuts off after they fuck you before you've ruptured they're trying to put me in a quiet place with a word stop well put me in a clothes pin space ruin life through a bird box but close the windows shut the doors scattered ooh on the floor so the sound of my footsteps are dampening his orb that's a metaphor - kill the noise why they walk around we look blindfolded as they kill our boys and these crazy race is wrong with cold still and they killed for joy blood spills inside the church and outside the shopping store inside the movie theater school campus in church all the synagogue's no location is omitted most cases get acquitted by mental illness and no guns are prohibited is it rational to think this is a national problem therefore is a threat to national security and the National Guard's needs to solve it or is it visible it's a problem of individuals who are not in court with the principle of one nation under God and the visible respect to my veterans honor sir thank you thank you bye everybody [Applause] [Music]
