eggs Marshall is yeah I crack open an egg and mix it in with his kibble sometimes that's awesome yeah most the time I feed him either he gets a little bit of kibble and some elk meat I give him ground elk meat or some other kind of meat much to spoil he's well he's well that's awesome - he's a happy dog yeah I think everyone loves Marshall madam yeah metal you met him here right couple times yeah he's a sweetest dog in the world yeah the door like I didn't even know the dogs were like that yeah it's a special dog it's golden retrievers man they're smart - they're real smart I have a fucking box of sand as a dog but she's adorable she's sweet but she's dumping shit what is she Brussels Griffon I don't know what that is look like an Ewok oh okay yeah that's right yeah that's an odd choice is that your wife's choice of course yeah yeah fraud's the edge you get you at the dog choice wheat little dog but they basically want a baby that they don't care too much of it dies pretty sad I'm not like babysitting now fuck it's like a it's like a baby that you know you only have to take care of for like 14 years yeah yeah we talk about it sometimes like I love you so much I'll say it to the dog and I know you won't be here long you know ya know she's pretty young though so I think I think we know for lucky she'll have a good run I lost the dog last year that was terrible yeah I've lost the dog two years ago it's rough it's two dogs in a row well they both were so old they couldn't walk anymore and archived horrible hard condition and you know we've given him all the meds and he was just on a decline and I was on the road when he died it was you know I just was kind of stunned and I and I kind of you know I had to keep doing the shows obviously right it was like a long weekend the shows then when I got back I fucking broke down mm-hmm yeah it really fucks you up it's a weird relationship humans and animals you know yeah yeah it's and yeah especially like if you you grow up with dogs yeah yeah so it's like it really becomes like it feels weird when you don't have a dog or me I've always had a dog yeah I've always had cats and dogs always most of my life yeah either like when I was living in apartment in New York I had a cat and bossed I had a cat and then when I soon as I got to LA I got dogs yeah soon as I go to the yard I'm like it's the best like the first thing I thought of they're the best no they have they bark when someone's coming near your fucking house it's true yeah really and they have that extra system in them you know that that level of sensitivity to sound and smell that like yeah when they start what are you talking about yeah they see things like when I was having coyote problems I took Marshall out even when he was pretty young he was like six seven months old I took a mountain and I'm like well you what are you freaking out about and then I turned look and I see these eyeballs moving through the trees outside the chicken coop I'm like you little cunts it's fucking coyote cunts coyotes are such fuckers banned there's such fucker so I lived in you know in this neighborhood where walk pull out of your driveway noon yeah standing in the middle of street oh yeah looking around you well Whitney lives in Woodland Hills yeah yeah is that Street for me bro her areas infested she he's got dogs like three or four dogs in the yard barking and these cows don't give a fuck did you see that video where the pack came into her house or into her yard yeah it was like six of them yeah yeah that neighbor that neighborhood they're sketchy I told her to get a subsonic 22 and you start taking them out she won't put them down pop pop put a little bait out there mm-hmm does this city rules about taking out of Keio the city rules you keep your fucking mouth shut yeah shoot shovel and shut up is there any upside they handle anything yes rats rats yeah oh yeah man they're great wood rats our vowels and ours are way cooler than coyotes hmm and they don't eat your larger dog you leave the fuck out your cat though they sure will owls weed everything I said it's not an owl flying with a rabbit a big-ass rabbit in its claws once they're so vicious yeah and there's such scary hunters like I know at night and head spins around have you ever seen that video there's a nest video of these Hawks that are in a tree and this owl comes out and snatches one of the Hawks and flies away and you just from a distance they're like what is that right when you you're talking about the one with the eyeballs yeah and then also like what and it goes BAM that's just gone yeah yeah they're fucking monsters freaky animals man and we we think of them as being these wise like like it's professors of the woods for some strange reason have you ever heard Matt Braunger zal bit no it is one of the funniest things is it really yeah this is like the bit that he first liked his early on you know getting his is a first big joke that broke and um you know it was on Letterman and he was on Comedy Central it is a hug layer I got to see it I got to see it as owls are one of those weird animals that we have this very strange relationship with well we don't know what they really are yeah this distort bears or another one we have this distorted perception what did you see that video that was going around about that guy who got his face literally eaten off by a grizzly and then he shot the Grizzly when it was on top of him No oh dude have you seen it Jamie yeah he's talking he's like going around good yeah yeah he's talking while his face is gone and he's talking about like you could see one eye through this mass I mean if Jamie shakes his head like let me show it to you real quick yeah of his face to know it's right after the attack the guard that was with him started filming it and it's just one of those things where okay so this is the bear and this is the guy and that's his face and this is him talking where are you where are you seeing this yes bro the thing shoots face off that's him nasty looks like now fuck they rebuilt his face that's incredible did you have a doctor well you saw the chimp victim lady yeah her face is gone well that chimp worked on her for a while did you see the tree trimming it go go lower there Jamie go lower yeah scroll down whoa what tree trimming what what you've never seen that we're talking about dude and there's and you get to see the live oh where the tree goes into the guy's face this whole fucking yeah it wide open yes and then they show him in the hospital yeah you can see even in his completely destroyed face the panic and it's like he knows how serious his situation is yeah I mean they were able don't know I haven't seen the post-surgery stuff but that dude a tree just like perfect he cut he was trimming and like he just cut it and it didn't certainly swim right in the face and split his whole fucking face yeah oh my god yeah it's rough man yeah that's a rough look right there that's a rough look it's amazing how well they put that guy back together if I was him I would just be the Punisher for grizzly bears I just just load up every year with a million rounds of ammo oh my just go hunting bears fuck you have you hunted a bear you know yeah black bears not not crazy bears yeah yeah we don't we have this image of them because of teddy bears because kids have them you know they love them little teddy bears are the biggest right yeah polar bears brown bears and then yeah yeah yeah cuz I mean a brown bear can stand up and be wet like 9 feet taller bigger 11 really yeah Kodiak the really big one hey Cody are in a swipe capitated my friend watched a bear kill a moose with one SWAT broke its back he watched it chased this moose through a scope was looking at through a spotting scope which is like like a super powerful telescope yeah you could look at you know like at my mile away you can watch things happen and this bear just SWAT hit this moose in the back and snapped its back you have to snap a mooses back oh my god I just tore it apart I mean how powerful is that animal it's a big fuckin animal man you know you're talking about a 1500 pound just ball a muscle and fat I just thought about sometimes like you know cuz you you know a lot of obviously like trained fighters and that that equation always plays in your head what if like trained fighters people don't realize sometimes how well like how much that training puts that person at an incredible advantage in a fight right I sure like your average guy right trying to get that smoke with a trained fighter is a problem right but at a certain point what's the equation where all the training doesn't matter your size yeah size and strength like how big of a giant and how much how powerful does he have to be where all your training wouldn't matter it depends on what kind of training you do like with jiu-jitsu it's a pretty big advantage right would you JIT say you I've tapped guys that are a hundred pounds heavier than me right just crazy that is crazy yeah but I would never strike with the guy that's 100 pounds heavier than me cuz that would just yeah you'd get killed yeah cuz even through your gloves you keep your gloves up and 300-pound guy just loves you with the right hand yeah just like your whole brain gets rattled right you can tap a 300-pound guy though as long as he doesn't throw you on the ground the problem is it picks you up in the air and throws you on the ground slams you and hit you with the earth yeah because there are those like those dudes that are almost animals you know you're something walking around six eight oh yeah 350 you know you're like you're like I don't care how well you're trained if that dude is like athletic oh yeah like a pro gorilla pro football player oh yeah like you see when I was I remember I'll never forget this we were in Phoenix and we were going into this bar and it was like 20 plus years ago and as we were waiting in line this pro football player walked through the line and it was like a grown-ass man amongst little kids yeah it was like a third grade class and someone's daddy showed up and just walked through the line this guy had to be like six seven six eight 350 he was so big I was laughing yeah I was like look at the size of this fucking guy yeah just big old corn-fed whiteboy just walking through the crowd like Achin that dude gets ahold that's what they do that's their job bro you into the ground and just break everything break your hip and your legs and everything you know you don't follow football but I always think of this dude about like savagery Larry Allen he played for the Kevin where the Cowboys were dominant in the 90s this dude was not just so big and so freaky strong but like was born mean like he's what you want if you're like again like he had the athleticism the strength that's him right there that Mindy 3 yes she's size of this fucking guy dude would just he would just absolutely you know destroy like break people's will how long did he play for oh he had played over 10 seasons and he was he was like it's so big and so fast so athletic this guy was so athletic man like he was he there's amazing footage of him just chasing like the his team through interception he's chasing the though the 180 pound guy down like crazy shit bench 225 45 times you know just imagine doing 45 push-ups yeah that's a lot dude do 45 reps of the bar and you're gonna feel the burn man yeah you know like that's that's crazy my my prop it's just it's it's nuts you know he found benchpress here he's not a normal 700 pound bench press god damn not a normal the size of that dude yeah these dudes are like yeah well you know I mean yeah I think if that's your gig your gigs to be gigantic and fast and powerful and you've been working on that since grade school yeah look at them all fucking around jump they're jumping I'm lucky as an animal like trained lion goddamn dude yeah yeah he's so strong I ain't yeah there's just like that mountain guy that Game of Thrones guy like yeah get the fuck out exactly that's what I'm thinking about it like guys like that who are so if you're like oh but like I see spar with Connor no car fucked him up oh he did yeah he fucked him up like really fucked him up he just kept hitting him he kept moving away from him and then he couldn't hit Connor he's trying to hit Connor he couldn't hit him and Connor kept buh he was kicking him in the stomach punch him in his stomach that eventually just got exhausted and he gave up you had to see that like that part I mean in C but that's like kind of like with rules right we're gonna do mm-hmm we're gonna do we couldn't grab he cried to try to grab him yeah a goner there's Jim so there's plenty of room for Connor to move around him look at it but look at the size difference between the two of them see he started talking shit and and Connor was like oh really okay come on buddy let's spar let's spar he doesn't know what to do right the thing is Connor is much smaller than him but here's know what to do see he just hit Khan in the stomach there and he's just know what to do yeah look at that jump in front kick to the body and then pushed him away he's trying to grab him but he doesn't know what to do and Carter just keeps moving and Connors in great shape and that big fuck has never done cardio in his life all that guy does do squats and deadlifts just gets huge yeah so his his heart is probably right now pounding out of his chest that fucker played basketball before was oh he was really skinny yeah he was really raising let's see now now Connor starting to punch him he's starting to punch him in the stomach and the dude is trying to grab him and he tries to hit cart see now he's taking a break and Alesi stomach heaving yeah here's know what to do yeah isn't know how to get out of this because they're fucking around here's know how to get it out of this he tries to grab them the car is like no I'm just gonna move you go ahead and just gas him out come on but his trainer has got to be going crazy like what in the fuck are you doing of course you're one of the top fighters on the planet Earth and you're here fucking around with a 300-pound giant what did this guy gets ahold of one of your legs and decides to rip it apart exactly exactly that's what I'm talking about see they punched him in the stomach huh I guess they're not punching each other in the face yeah they're going bare bare knuckle tattoos head his baton doesn't even fit the body of him he's getting tired though see cuz all the flinching he's Connor Connors making a flinch he's he's making him move he's fainting and when you faint like that see he doesn't know what to do he's given up thinking about cars not letting him give up look he's not let him give up it's like come on fucker now he's gonna get into some Jiu Jitsu here no he's just he's looking knees him in the body Christ he's punched him he's mean he's not letting him rest you know you let some rest Hey look how small goddam yeah yeah see that guy was done though the good thing about being that big you don't you can't go long it's like a muscle car right if you got a muscle car with a five gallon engine or a five gallon gas tank and a big-ass engine you really you don't have much it's hard for a second yeah yeah you know your last is someone and then that's actually fascinating to watch weird right yeah yeah well you know big you ever seen a Wolverine chase off wolves Oh Wolverines are a little it's like a 35 pound animal everything gets the fuck away from it because they're so ferocious they're so crazy and they feel like no pain yeah like things can bite them and like their little chase wolves they'll chase bears what's the news with Connor by the way is he throwing out that he wants to fight someone he wants to fight kabhi kabhi but he's there trying to set up look we are most if this in the future this is March 24th on Tuesday and everyone's on fucking full lockdown here they're talking about doing a UFC they don't know where it's gonna be for khabib versus Tony Ferguson they're talking about doing that somewhere somewhere in another country you know I told Danish do it on a battleship just doing a battleship in international waters fly everybody in the helicopter fucking cool idea and there's no organization like the UFC that could pull that off yeah you can't do that with like any other sport no because you don't need many very many people you just need the fighters yeah I mean I don't even know if they're gonna have an undercard and the more the crazier the setting you're a fight the more exact it could be like and there'll be Lions roaming and I would imagine one of those sheiks that has you know a trillion dollars does they do it in my palace the palace you said Octagon in a giant ballroom dude if you guys called sheiks and and like do you want it like they would start a problem yeah this is no problem at all this is come on yeah they'll fucking sanitize the shit out of couple jets fly everybody in sanitize the runway just crates of Lysol absolutely crop duster planes spray and Lysol over everything it would be they would do it right actually I'm sure they have so much money yeah I mean they they could do it right they could test everyone well what do you do if someone has like is a they're asymptomatic and they want to fight anyway and but they test positive yeah you gotta go you gotta go what if it's Tony they test positive but they're asymptomatic too much of it resting heart rates low everything's fine too much of a good do Goldie you're shedding it man shedding it as you walk around after he's over we'll just cover him in a big plastic suit I guess if the other fighter was like I'm cool with it yeah me too probably be cool with it too yeah sure yeah send location bring medicine if you see that couple what they did do you see that today what that so Trump was talking about Oh angel - yes and then one of them I want to say the name wrong so whatever it I forget what it is exactly what it is what is it's it's medication that you use on a koi pond well to kill bacteria that's the one that they took yes but it's the same name I think it's called chloroquine the same name of it but the one for the koi pond has them like a - and another maja yeah the same name without the - is actually a medication it's a medication for malaria for malaria Coretta parently holds promise but they took koi pond a fish tank medicine they took poison yeah that they took poison that's what they took and they were like he told us to take it yeah but he didn't use no it's not and then they're like we saw it in our cabinet you think you have fucking malaria meds we had it in the shed yep we used it to kill everything in the koi pond and we figured hell Jed took it and he's dead well the woman they were talking to her and they said now it was funny because the the reporter was baiting her the reporter was like now this is you saw President Trump say that you should take that yeah they were showing in a lot that's what she said they were showing it a lot um no it's a different name - different name you fucks yeah this is the same beginning and you just I guys a PA I feel comfortable saying this public PSA you probably don't have the cure at home right now I feel comfortable with you saying that yeah unless you just got back from somewhere where you had to take something for malaria yeah maybe man maybe maybe you have it yeah it's a different medication yeah but people are blaming Trump for that yeah this just like this game of trying to get cliques and blaming people for like Trump did not tell people to drink koi pond killer no no definitely didn't do that he's been hilarious and this well did you see that one lady we're talking I was talking about this earlier this is one lady who is getting she's an opportunity to talk to Trump in a press conference mhm and she said did you hear that one of your one of the members of your cabinet referred to it as the come flu you know saw that yeah and he's like the what say that again and she was come flu so he makes her say it and then he goes who who said it and well I heard someone of yeah you heard yeah this is the one question you have right to ask the president United States during one of the biggest health crisis the world has ever known yeah and you were a mildly racist term is what you want to check in on yeah I think we're gonna stop to that they want to call people out yeah he did a thing yet he must have caught up though because yesterday he he read a statement that like I I love our Asian Americans and well it's because he kept referring to it as the Chinese I know I know Chinese virus here II scratched out on his I saw it yeah wrote Chinese I said coronavirus Chinese but that's people have to understand it's also because he's in fierce negotiations with China over these trade sanctions there's a lot more not and he's a combative dude yeah he'll take you know any chance to you saw the same lady did it with Kellyanne Conway mm-hmm same thing same question yeah and and you know and there and she's like I'm not gonna get into speculation here about a guy you don't know who said it you just you just heard someone said it and then you know this lady didn't know Kellyanne Conway's husband's half asian right so her kids are quarter asian she's like I'm sure you don't like you're not saying that I'm racist towards Asian my children her Asian yeah like what he what are you doing isn't that marriage kind of interesting oh yeah he's hilarious I mean he's the most outspoken critic he hates Trump beyond hates beyond aids and she's his most ardent defender yeah it's crazy you guys go to bed at night some people can these some people can be like liberals and Republicans and live together fine some people can be like hunters and deviants and lived in boats so vocal about their positions don't under anyway what do you want to eat like it's fucking crazy by the way how great would it have been if Trump or Kellyanne Khan we had been asked about the kung fu and they were like are you gonna see this are you gonna say it's not a funny term yeah it would be great it would be kind of great I mean look if it was an Italian virus yeah and then they call it the pasta virus yeah I mean would people who really get mad now probably not would they go out the meatball but like what would be the thing ya know the pizza virus I don't know yeah rigatoni virus parpadelle a virus it's just I don't know man I've read a terrible thing that one lady said um that some lady she's Asian and she was at a store and some lady yelled she had a mask on shield fuck you at her interface and then she took off her mask and coughed at her eye at the Asian lady yeah coughed at her and yelled fuck you at her see that's when all the racial jokes stop being yeah they all just want out the window right there yeah because there aren't religions out there but blame an Asian American yeah person of Asian descent living in America that has a zero to do with any of this and she'll be like fuck you because there's people just looking for an excuse to blame whatever on someone else and if it's an Asian person or a Latino person or whatever the fuck it is or all the fucking posts you ignorant of post 9/11 all these poor seek peace yes I'm not yeah it's bad enough that you're doing that but I'm not even the target yeah yes who you're trying to reach here think turbans everyone with the turban is Muslim because we forget let like you know the world's full of idiots too those are the people you really got to worry about it's you know I don't want people to die from this disease of course but I would like us to lose a significant portion of our moron population it'd be cool if it taught if it like preyed on low IQ individuals all these dummies crying not just low IQ because there's some low IQ people that are really nice but it would be great if it was low IQ people who are mean like it's a disease it only killed races open Wow mouth-breathing people huh something about racism just it just kills people with racism like there's a gene and it targets that gene and people are racist they just drop like flowers there are a lot of older people dying so it might be working it's definitely killed a few races in this last few weeks imagine if that's like something people focus on here's one silver lining mauriz held grand Wizards are gone we went into the Facebook pages of all the people who died and 64% were racist that'd be awesome that would be a nice silver lining yeah but what about the other you know no I 36 wasn't just nice old grannies it's terrible bit I love their neighbors it's terrible yeah yeah yeah but this is one of those things where you can't even crack a joke because then people oh yeah oh yeah what about this person and that person just you just can't listen to them yeah so I talked to Michael yeah actually I haven't even talked to him because he's not talking cuz he can't talk he's just texting he still fucked up five days ago thought he was dying um well no I mean he's been in the hospital for over a week but five days ago he thought he was dying he got this what happened he went to New York he did my podcast right after he did my podcast that weekend he had shows at Gotham so he fluid in New York City did his shows in New York City was feeling kind of sick and then got it got pneumonia and the coronavirus at the same time in New York or in LA when he got at home so he was feeling kind of shitty and then it hit him so he probably had a weakened immune system right then he's not a boozer so I don't think he was boozing but you know he doesn't have any like that you know no lying health is no no nothing he seems like a healthy guy yeah shape in shape yeah works out of law he said he was killing workouts he said nothing was wrong with him he said just started feeling like he had a cold and then flew home and then BOOM that is double whammy but he's recovering he's recovering yeah he's now the we mean he's not gonna die but he's not out of the woods yet and some of these people that have gotten through this disease have some sort of permanent lung impairment you no wonder that one that scared me I was reading about this guy see if you can find this guy 2012 gold medalist in swimming 31 year old guy got it and he said he's the absolute worst virus he's ever experienced in his life he said it was devastating so it's like some people have a like Idris Elba and there's nothing yeah asymptomatic ya seem to be fine well there they are I mean from my I just spoke to an infectious disease doctor on the way over here and and they're saying that you know the that's one of the big things about the asymptomatic people it's like they're essentially what can keep this thing going for a while because you're shedding for fifteen days and if you're if you're not hold up if you're walking around yeah rushing by people and you're at the park and you're in the store and you're you're shedding you're spreading it you're a something and then you go home but you just gave it to you know these people people then they go home it's just so weird that some people don't experience anything and for other people like this guy who's a 31 year old Olympic swimmer Cameron Vanderburgh 2012 Olympic swimming champion details bout with coronavirus he's from Africa that worries from retired South African Olympic swimmer details of struggle with coronavirus I mean this guy is super healthy yeah really really fit he says he doesn't smoke lives a healthy lifestyle and he's young he's in the the least risk demographic create incredible so you can't really predict how this will go he said although the most severe symptoms extreme fever have eased I'm still struggling with serious fatigue and a residual cough that I can't shake any physical activity like walking leaves me exhausted for hours this is crazy he's 31 and he's a stud I mean you look lying yeah Olympic swimmer right I mean talk about cardiovascular shape there's some of the the most powerful cardiovascular fit people on earth and incredible he said he's been struggling with it for 14 days Jesus Christ by amazing the worst virus I've ever had yeah this is any physical activity like walking leaves me exhausted for hours the loss and body conditioning has been immense and can only feel for athletes that contract covet 19 as it will suffer a great loss of current conditioning through the last training cycle it's funny how he's thinking about it infection closer to competition being the worst yeah isn't it funny how he's thinking about in terms of conditioning cycles like that's how Olympians think yeah did you see how I mean they just agreed to postpone but you've been like two days ago Tokyo's like we're not don't even think about it cuz they're crooks yeah look that whole thing is a crooked organization yeah yeah they should pay those athletes they're making billions of dollars the athletes make ends at leats make nothing yeah they're like if you get a sponsorship in a sport that's popular yeah then you're alright if you are the top like if you get to win a gold medal and everybody pays attention and then you become like Michael Phelps where everybody knows your name you can make a living yeah everybody else is fucked yeah while those cunts are raking in billions and billions of dollars ridiculous it is the grossest thing in all sorts only the only thing that's close is college basketball college basketball and college football were those guys again make billions of dollars for those organizations and make no money for themselves in and then you have these people who are like yeah but these guys get a free education the fuck out of fuck out of my face fuck out of here especially football get the fuck out of here yeah you get a free education when you get your brain scrambled every day and your brains scrambled and this like the football programs at a major university are so goddamn valuable not just even monetarily it becomes the image of the school yes they even get a high profile school gets more applicants and you get more people enrolled just because of that program it's crazy and it's a dirty it's a dirty thing that just like keeps going so it should have been they should have fixed out a long time ago this guy should have been able to they should be getting paid I mean people like whoa how come other college students don't you don't have those fucking skills are bad motherfuckers yeah that's just what they got yeah if you're winning NCAA basketball championships for your school you should be making a shitload of money because your goddamn school is making a shitload of money from you and then if you're like a bad motherfucker on one of those teams they sell your jersey oh yeah yeah yeah you don't make anything from that they sell your jerseys and they're like didn't you get that algebra class for free oh yeah thanks man and we gave you a tracksuit and shoes congratulations yeah yeah and if you even get I think if you get like I mean you can't get anything Yuki they can't even hook you up with an apartment dude it's it's super fucked like NCAA's again like a super corrupt organization you've seen that Icarus movie Icarus documentary which shows how the IOC yes it shows how how dirty like even testing is yeah in the Olympics and it shows how the Russian team in Sochi was just completely not just cheating but every one of their athletes they took their piss and swapped it out for clean piss all they had a hole in the wall they transfer piss back and forth - and there was a Russian team yeah the Russian TV it is like culturally built-in to deceive there seriously it's about winning it is about winning but it's also like it is lies on every level well did you hear me talking about Yoel Romero did you ever hear after the fight no the recent one no Dana White gave me this information they brought in Yoel Romero because he had a fractured orbital in one of his fights okay and they bring him in and then he gets examined by this doctor and the doctor calls up the UFC afterwards and said where did you get this guy and he goes what do you mean and they're like what's going because I've never seen anyone like him oh yeah he's an amazing athlete no no I've never seen a human being like this like this is the most unusual human being I've ever seen in my 40 years of practicing medicine he said his tendons in his eye are four times larger than a normal person's he goes his physical structure is different than any human being I've ever seen in my life whoa whoa Cuba yeah who knows what kind of fuckin wacky experiments they were doing some Russian pills when he was a kid that's for sure imagine Yeah right imagine I mean he was a top of the food chain wrestler he meddled in literally every single international wrestling meet he ever competed it Yoel Romero is a super stud yeah just a super stud that was a weird fight though right the last one is he yes yeah it was a good fight that crazy we were in an arena like a week before it hit the fan I know we were hanging out in Vegas but it was a little sketchy then remember we were like everything gonna be okay yeah then we went to like dinner we didn't went to my show yeah we hung out and had a show and then that was probably the last big show we'll see in a long-ass time I keep thinking about how I was talking about today I did all this morning Foner's today for further special ball hog ball hogs out on Netflix right in that favorite by the way is a they had you called calling has so many radio stations and this guy's like he goes oh I'm big instant family fan when are you gonna do another one and I go what do you mean he's like I like that show I go it's a movie I was it's a movie called instant family he goes oh yeah when's the next one I was like the sequel to an adoption film what like you just tell they're just you know it's reading shit off to you but I was talking to somebody on the on the press thing today and I go most of us comics since we've been active working comedians at a at most two weeks we've gone without doing stand-up and in that return you know when you first get on stage after like a vacation you're like I just feel fuckin weird yeah no you have like weird butterflies your rhythms off your pacings a little off you forget a word or something because you're just not fresh we might be 2-3 months it's never easy easy yeah he's out ever doing it yeah March all of March right well when was your show he shows the beginning of March March 7th yeah March 7th and 8th you did the Mirage so all of March all of April we mean we easily could be deep into July or August before I did a set March 11th was my last set mmm and then March 12th I canceled my had a show you canceled it too yeah because I was doing a Spanish show at the belly room mm-hmm and then yeah I cancelled that and that was it and everything that moved yeah the the store said they were gonna cancel gatherings of Les the the the state mandate was anything with 200 people or more and the main room I think holds 400 people so decide to keep the belly room open which is I mean the the oor which is one 150 I think yeah something like that and then they asked me if I want to do a spot there and I'm like I don't think I do I think I'm good I'm like I don't know what to do here and then I had improv a couple days later and then I texted The Improv them like I think we should shut this down yes it doesn't seem right the way that it rolled out was funny business so I had that weekend at the ice house so I go we'll move that you know I go what we can't do it so we moved it following week which would have been the weekend that just ended I was supposed to be in Dayton and even on Monday they were like do you want to do you want to do on Monday or maybe it was Friday they're like you could still do date they were given Swartz Swardson had some shows in Utah they were giving him a hard time they were like you know hey we're gonna lose our shirt if you cancel he's like um I'm fucking what yeah no this is guys yeah hey and then I go we got to move the date so then we move that and then you know everyday we keep pushing things month by month Oh Chappelle was doing shows like real late really yeah he was doing shows like the weekend after yours Wow yeah yeah yeah I don't know oh yeah yeah fucking big-ass theatres yeah yeah I was I mean I'm supposed to be in Vancouver on the 20th that's never gonna happen no then Chappell and I were doing a show in Nashville and a show in New Orleans those are not gonna happen that's the end of April I don't get moved apparently I mean I hope people get the opportunity to get a refund because there's a lot of people right now that probably bought tickets and like fuck I need that money right now just for food and shit you're totally right how many people or just have a zero check it's probably like 50 percent of the population in Ramos its enormous Lee devastating to the economy yeah I mean we had some people working on her house I had to fix something in the garage I was like two PR people working are they allowed to work and everyone's just it's just doing social distancing and you know I had some work done and they were like excited to do it yeah people are happy to work yeah I've been getting text messages and emails from people that are like I mean they had like viable businesses and they counted on the money being in there every week and there was no plan on the table for anything that involves no one being able to work of course and why would anybody be prepared for this no one of course and no one knows how long did last and Wow I'm just reading something about California where they're talking about like shows and concerts it might be six months yeah I believe it I mean it's it is so April May June July August September we wouldn't do shows until September it's so weird but I mean what will it be like all so weird so weird but I'd be weird for everybody that's true that's true be weird for the audience be weird for everybody I keep thinking too you know we we know all these people in clubs and like they're like immediately have no job the server services what are the chefs yeah the servers we got to do something for them at the store for sure because they don't have any money it's not like they're comics who have like saved up money and have no they count on that thousand bucks in the between those their shifts every week and you can stepped out and you know yep yeah yeah it's um it's fucking weird man and it's gonna be weird when everything rolls back up there's a lot of restaurants are gonna go under a lot of businesses yeah I think I heard something about the Marriott CEO giving up his all his salary and everything just to like give it to some of the oh that's nice I think I think about maybe I'm plugging the wrong guy but one of the CEOs was like you know just push it on down yeah I have a buddy man who runs a production company and he had a layoff 30 people yesterday and he was just like he goes and there's no money coming in everyone no one's paying him everything shut down and you know and these workers were like why don't you just pay us while we're not working is work cuz I'm making you money right it's like what do you want me to do like I don't know what you want me doing that was like weird conversation because he was he was like what am I supposed to do and I'm like I don't I don't I hope but never experienced that yeah I don't know what you're supposed to do know it because I don't know how much he's not rich yeah it's a real dilemma man yeah because if he's right he's running a production company right yeah so he has a huge overhead he has cameramen and trucks and post-production facilities and all this different stuff and it's all dependent on money coming in and then when the money doesn't come in and the payroll keeps coming out like you go dry wet eel quick yeah I mean even if you have even if you have some money there's a there's a limit to how long you could do that for yeah yeah yeah season it but people that work for you I guess just assumed you make more money you got enough money to pay me keep paying me he's like I'm not rich he's like I barely you know feels like I make enough money every year to live a good life but yeah not to pay 30 people where there's no money yeah Japan you're paying 30 people let's just say they get a hundred grand here mmm that's so much money yeah there's so much money yeah what that would be three million yeah right like that gone yeah no I mean you have to be able to have come and we have a staff you know we make podcasts yeah and we're continuing to do podcast so we can keep paying the staff yeah that's weird right we can keep doing this yeah and then you got to think also like if someone's doing that and you have you know 30 people that you're laying off those people have to get unemployment how much unemployment is there it's a record number by 4 times the amount has ever been filed and it all filed like in within the same like 72 hours I'm not too long way they have to pay those people I'm sure it's not enough I'm sure they don't have enough to pay the think the numbers come out Thursday I'm like the new ones the first numbers of like this is how many people have to have a job now the numbers gonna be crazy it could be nuts it's gonna be crazy and what is this quarter gonna look like like on the books this one and the next one actually this is you gotta assume let's let's be conservative and say 40 percent of the country's out of work that's conservative right it's a good question I'm not really sure I don't know it's I mean I would be something like that like forty million people that we're working probably at least aren't or not working right now that we're working and this is worldwide oh that numbers way fucking higher yeah I mean just in this country but worldwide it's like half the sizes are really like we are not at a real locked up some places have really locked down yeah we were talking about that before the podcast yeah did you see the Italian mayor's screaming at everybody stay the fuck home yeah there's a video compilation I'll send it to Jamie it's it's actually pretty funny there's a video compilation of all these Italian mayor's fucking screaming at people to stay the fuck home my cousin and Peru said you can't walk your dog in Lima right now so where's your dog shit I guess in the house or something or regulations if Marshall out of shit in the house we'd have a real issue first of all he'd be so confused he was you sure you want me to start doing this I black dude trust me just shit right there is it are you guys nobody leaves their home no because I seen it's an order so watch out [Music] incontinent dogs you need to stay at home people are dying don't you get it this is super Italian what a beautiful language it's a beautiful language the best it's I mean it's interesting how like American language like the American the sound that we make you think won't the way we speak English in America it's it stop writing me letters useless Daniel you'll be just fine all these hairdressers coming to your homes someone come with your house they came to my house and that's been to other people's houses rigatoni virus is killing us everybody rigatoni virus girl yeah where's your neck where are your hand gestures sure what yeah mayor who are you what kind of Italian you not feeling this guy get out of your pencil neck ciao did I got sea shut him off Jamie yeah it's well italy is losing hundreds and hundreds of people a day like yesterday it was like five hundred they said yesterday was the the first day where the number dipped yeah but i mean it's never before 500 a before was eight hundred day before seven hundred yeah it's been going it's been nuts but they do have the second oldest population of a major country in the world and a giant population of smokers yeah all smoke over there and then all day long every greeting is miss you know yeah affection there i'll baton each other smoke and fingering each other yeah yeah yeah I go to Italy every summer yeah mmm not this summer not this summer no maybe it'd be good discount fucking great discount that country by the way like I mean a huge part of that GDP is tourism yeah you know like I mean I want to say like over 15% mm-hmm so it's gonna be slammed for this no it's it's weird it's like you wonder what what does a country do to sort of mitigate the issues that are being caused by that the only thing I keep thinking about how like when you think about how badly so many places are doing is just that everybody else is doing poorly you know I mean yes it's not one place this is a worldwide pandemic so yeah and that's the only you can think of yeah there's the only thing you think it's it's a strange strange time for us I'm hoping that on the other end we come out of this with a little perspective you know the people that survive come out of this with a little perspective like hey we got it good we got it real fucking good I think that perspective will last about seven days months yeah yeah people will be like in New York it lasted a few months yeah that's true I think I think it was more special in here it'll affect Italians for a long time you know places that are devastated by it yeah I think so but I mean yeah people you know are usually humans are just are gonna react to the current condition you yeah that's the problem with us we're we get real comfortable I saw that that uh the somebody tweeted or something that this whole thing is the Earth's vaccine and were the virus who said somebody someone trying to be profound someone trying to be profound but then you start looking there like you know pollutions down the water is cleaner the you know the fish are swimming in the canals of Venice again good point good point they have a point well look at Los Angeles air quality better than it's been ever for sure it's amazing no one's driving yeah yeah but also no one's eating yeah oh there's that part yeah this the way we live is ridiculous and our ridiculous is not even as bad as New York's ridiculous New York's ridiculous is the most ridiculous because there's literally stacked on top of each other yeah there's no getting away from anybody they have the most ridiculous way of life and they love that life you know they love the fact that they can go to a hundred different restaurants at midnight yeah you know sure and it's great to be I mean I love being around it I like to visit yeah it is fun but I mean I would hate to be cooped up there right now Oh would be terrible terrible I really get out of the city yeah well Ari bailed yeah yeah I was telling you earlier he went down to Maryland it was hilarious I was like don't tell ya he likes to keep his woman in the dark doesn't know the extent of this she doesn't have a fucking phone yeah he's like no you don't see em that's why they get along so good she's like she balances him out in strange way he is so funny too in that he of course was like fucking five days ago I know I've really fucked and freaked out about yeah it's 24 hours later he's like I gotta get out of the city what are you guys doing how do you guys keeping social distancing I'm like wait what's going on here how did you switch someone well we're this text group group text that we're in we were all like hey what happened yeah what happened over the last 24 hours yeah well couple people got freaked out so I freaked out like who freaked you out it's a weird time man but I get I bet for Burt's special and for your special this is gonna be fucking Banzai it's so bizarre the hunties not a good word bonanza a bonanza is what I meant to say it is bizarre that so many people are forced to be home yeah and they've already announced that all the the views are up I don't know they have to throttle streaming yeah yeah yeah I mean but I've noticed it too on podcasts like downloads are up the user oh yeah you know yeah and you know it also kind of keeps him sane it's like your show like your mom's house or this podcast or in these podcasts that people subscribe to it's a part of their routine so yes at least there's some normalcy and I don't want to overplay that make it seem like we're doing some great service no but there's something that does give people some comfort I think they really let it's that molarity of like I listen to Joe show it's on this makes me just distract me from from you know the chaos for a little bit I mean I guess that's why we're allowed to do it because we're we're considered part of media yeah you know yeah I think it's funny that my show is like well who farted loudest today but it is I mean look if the fucking regular news that horse shit if that's yeah yeah yeah you know if that's media we're definitely media yeah yeah I know I don't know these I think with the time and like wisdom and having experienced and observed media for a while now and you get to like a traumatic thing like this a pandemic you I really look at I watch news I've always consumed a lot of news I'm like so much of this is just ridiculous sensationalism you know it really is all that same there's no there's no different the big news organizations then those bullshit click things yeah it's almost like new should be nonprofit I got a fucking breaking story for you I forgot well I I cannot believe I almost forgot this ooh so you know the guy in those texts that the big black guy yes yeah let's explain that is a trick people always say the link oh my god it's it's now killing more 20-year olds than any disease every like what what he clicked the link and there's this jack black dude with a dick that looks like my leg sitting on the edge of the bed nothing like he's like have you seen a bigger dick that's what his expression is when it's limp its limp yeah there is area yeah so yeah this is Bram knows he's dead right he's dead he died a few years ago so and by the way that the the that meme of like kind of has gone viral I mean right every I mean you know I get 25 a day from different people I have a doctor friend who sends me I'm like Jesus right so it's like it's not just in like gravity sort and I'm sure people listening or watching have have have seen it as well so I was like meh who is this fucking guy right like I know you kind of just get curious keep seeing this and it's like sort of like this sense of relief from the seriousness of the day right you'll be having you just seen like these people to hide and you know quarantined and then you get this ridiculous text and it's this guy so I saw an article where the photographer who took that photo was like ah he was like oh it's so sad that people are using his image that way because you know he passed away and and I you know he thought it was kind of offensive that he was being used to prank or whatever and he said you know I I saw that people started selling merch with this guy's face on it and I he goes I just wish he goes I own the photograph and I'm not trying to come after him when I just wish they would share proceeds of that merge with the family so I saw that and I was like oh I want to do that so I launched a shirt with that guy's face on it that says wash your hands and then and then I go I go I want to give the proceeds to this man's family so because of that article I reached out to people I was able to get in touch with the photographer the guy who took that picture and then I found I got in touch with his the the models fiance who you know his XP I mean whatever he passed away so anyways I contacted her I found her I've learned a little bit about this guy in that photo and I'm giving them the proceeds from the shirt sales all of them all the profits will go to them and I also found that when he when he died like the family wasn't prepared like financially for anything so they had to set up a GoFundMe for his funeral and tombstone and all that so I'm I'm gonna blast it out but I talked beautiful they're happy with it so that's my breaking news that's the break that's the break that's important news Jamie told me his dicks not really as big I didn't get into that with her I Jamie said that it's photoshopped I've heard that as well seen I saw the original blog post it came from you let's see what the original heart I don't have to find it now oh

his brains out right just let it let everybody out of the cage and then blew his brains out deal with this let tiger's eye on that footage and and seen the guy give the press conference he's like he reads he's like this cat and then he looks up he's like and sixteen lions like he's like fuck and they just had a run around and gunned him down oh my god it was game hunters there's lucky that got them all yeah that's just it's this they're not prepared for that in the same way cops are not trained for combat people forget that like when there's these big shootings and they're like why didn't the cops go in there they're not trained for that remember the North Hollywood shootout yeah of course I was on Newsradio at the time and we were all held up in the fucking we were in the break room watching it we were like what the fuck we were like eating looking up at this camera where these guys wearing armored vests and if I powered rhyme 16 I should yeah shooting at cops crazy that that I remember I was in high school and and I was watching that and I was like that's what California only happen in California yeah people don't know that was a that was a game-changer that was a bank robbery where guys had like fully automatic machine guns yeah and armored vehicle didn't have armored vehicles but they have like full bulletproof vests and suits and yeah and they were fully locked they were on steroids and coke and it was like real-life grand theft auto ship men like real life yeah like shooting these uh fully automatic guns at helicopters and shit too and but anybody that came in the way yeah I remember there was one where they coked up and everything though sure there was one activist that was upset because the cops let one guy bleed out there like they could have taken him to the hospital and they chose not to like what the fuck is wrong but it made me realize like there's gonna be people that complain about everything no matter what everything everything yeah and they just want to be heard it's like they just want they didn't want to have a hot take yeah on things mm-hmm and they and they're just waiting for the the group of people that go like good point yeah that feels bad always gonna be people to do that too yeah yeah there's so many of us there's always gonna be someone that agrees with your stupid point yeah that's true yeah that's that's what that's what like social media thrives off oh yeah I have a stupid point to make he also agrees with me there's always someone no matter what there's always something like you can have the most ridiculous point mm-hmm there's gonna always gonna be someone it's like I'm with him this it's just a numbers game yeah and then they find those people and then they get on a reddit page some somewhere and they all get together and then they agree with each other yeah then they think are the rest of world's fucked and then they they just have this echo chamber yeah people love doing that I mean that's what flat earthers do sure I mean if you watch that doc on rocket man did you watch him die I watched the did you see Rocket Man die no wait you wanna see that okay yeah he shot that rocket up in the air to try to prove that the earth was flat and they didn't fasten the parachute correctly to the capsule and so the parachute goes off with the initial launch oh fuck yeah the parachutes gone like right away and then it falls down here it goes watch wait so test set up what's happening here so this guy he decided he was gonna prove that the earth was flat so he built a rocket and launched himself up into the air he had done it once before but this time he launched himself really high to try to film the earth so watch boom look others there she's gone Oh he shoots straight up in the air and then like oh my god what is this breaking news at least fucking idiots so watch it it comes down right here there it is oh so that's he's on that full speed on the way down and he's waiting for the parachute go off boom yeah no parachute mmm just boom experiment go not good not good or perfect how did how did these guys really think that I mean how fucking dumb are you they're pretty dumb but here's the other thing how gross is it that in a video like that you have to have like and coming up next I have some respect you fuck Jesus Christ it's uh you know did you think you know like the like that crazy shit have you seen like Tom Hanks's comments about coronavirus you know the comments in his posts no dude all the top comments are like you are a pedophile you fucked all these kids and it's like like dozens of them yes Tom Hanks well because there's like that there's like flat earthers I'm saying there's the people who are like Hollywood is a pedophilia conspiracy it is I mean I cuz I want to just be like oh what's you know is he recovering I just saw his went to his page it's just some Twitter no Instagram and it's like significant number of them and like with hundreds and thousands of likes and what yes I've never heard this it's so straight Tom Hanks is a I think they think that any high a list Hollywood person automatically oh he's a pedophile son responded did you see that no no I did not like has made those weird videos last recently like yeah the regular voice and stuff yeah he made a video trolling everyone saying like we're in the Illuminati oh that's funny and like oh it's true my parents got coronavirus crazy they're both down in Australia right now because my dad was shooting a movie down there but the Instagram comments fine they're not even that sick dude they're not worried about it they're not tripping but they're going through the certain health precautions obviously but I don't think it's anything to be too worried about I appreciate everyone's concern and this is not the one where you talked about the Illuminati mmm hey guys I'm really stressed out right now it's been coming to my attention that a lot of Trump supporters have been figuring out the truth about me and my family you know being in the you know what I'm talking about and I don't know what to do right now because everything's starting to come to light I mean these extremely reliable websites like 4chan Ahn have been exposing shit and it's like if somebody wrote it on the internet you know it must be true and it is true so it's like I don't know how this is gonna affect our whole new world agenda ever since the Simpsons predicted my dad being the spokesperson for the coronavirus even though they didn't predict anything is it's just been it's been troublesome to say the least I guess I'm just gonna have to work extra hard at my human sacrifices I'm late for one right now and I'm a little hungry so I might eat someone's pen okay okay yeah why does he have that all-seeing eye tattooed in the middle of his chest he's a lot of tattoos it's a weird chore what do you got there Thomas I was looking at a I was pulled up the bankses comments like they're they're so outrageous you know it's like what what started it off it's it's this whole concept that like any a list Hollywood type I don't know what the origin is of that but if it's like you know Spielberg Hanks crew like getting those big-time names they're like you're part of the pedophile ring it's just that's how they get to be huge you have to be a part of the pedophile ring I guess become a big movie star I think so it's so exhausting yeah it's so exhausting these fucking people it's exhausting again we need a disease it kills morons this could be it I don't think it is no yeah if they're invulnerable what if I was like a disease that literally lowers over an IQ of the world like it's like if you're really smart you just die of dying oh my god well this is a weird disease too because my friend dr. Peter Atia he said there there's some speculation that it might be related to genetics and blood type people that are more vulnerable to it right as an o-type o+ seems to be the least vulnerable and a seems to be the most vulnerable interest i don't even know what type should know i don't know my doctor you should find out bro if you're vulnerable hmm and then don't let bert sneeze on you he's gonna survive everything everything he'll be fine I know at the end of the vol he'll be like 85 I really do hope this is a wake-up call for him and he gets off those fucking medications we talked about it yesterday yeah getting off blood mmm blood pressure medication doesn't mean shit no he's fat he's needs to stop being fat if he stopped drinking so much he wouldn't need blood pressure medication he's fuckin boozing every night if he just took three months off and exercised and ate well and didn't drink bullshit and didn't eat sugar I guarantee you you wouldn't need any of that well this is actually quite that the benefit of this is that you know where he really goes the hardest is on the road yes the road really fucks with him we talked about that yesterday like I asked if he was a prisoner to this sort of image that he's created and he's like kind of yeah definitely yeah I mean that party animal images it's unsustainable it's also he doesn't you know he has that personality where he doesn't want to let somebody down so if somebody even if he's done for the night he's like all right I'm definitely going in yeah and somebody's like hey man one more shot yeah will you Han arrest Thompson fan and all no I never I never really you know got into it was exposed to it that much um big fan of his and when he died one of the saddest things was watching the interviews before he died because he was a heavy Boozer drug yeah yeah I know that deep into his 60s right yeah I think how old was he when he died he was in the 70s when he died it was he 70s how it was her as tops when he died what are you doing I finally just found that link and other guys original dick they took me till fucking I'm deep on the internet right now oh do you want to see where I'm at or we'll just show the dick let's see the original dick now he's like it's deep brother it's huge it's a different picture but that's a different picture it's the same photo shoot right but where's the the actual photo where you see whoa scroll down keep scrolling oh this is a know your meme thing guys a giant dick there dude don't know what you're talking about with the same one it's a different well that's a weird angle right there any way you could make that bigger so we can looks like it's not a small dick I think you're wrong Jamie I think it's the same hard muscle bear Oh muscle bear so he was doing that kind of porn yeah oh okay I think he's doing looks like he's doing solo shots you know okay pictures of me yeah there's a lot of money in that maybe I don't know starting only fans Jamie um well what were we just talking about before that we were talking about Burt and partying and fuck on to the road not being on the road yeah we passed that though we're talking about new stuff people at home were screaming we're not even high how about that no my memory sucks you'll be being a prisoner though to that Oh hundreds Thompson Connor how cesari's when he was oh how old was he when he died that's the question when he died you barely could understand a word he was saying because he was so he would just stumble all his words into gathering 67 that's incredible I think I remember that didn't he kill himself after a football game no he killed himself because NFL was over what's that mean well there was no NFL because after the Super Bowl or something right wasn't he's got no argument with his wife he shot at her with a pellet gun and then went inside and blew his brains out something you know something along those lines but when he died before he died he would go on Conan and you know take Conan with him in the backyard and have you ever seen those videos yeah this house of Woody Creek which is outside of Aspen and he would shoot guns out there and had Conan come and visit him and you could barely understand a word he was saying he was so fucked up it's like his his ability to express himself was just gone it was just all the words blurred and mumbled together it's in danger of that kind of thing sure are 20 years from now if he keeps going hard in the paint every night I mean when Hunter was in his 40s he was fine yeah yeah when hunter was in his 40s is when he was running for sheriff I think I think maybe his 30s I don't know it's just that life of boozing is so unsustainable yeah the pot smoking thing is so sustainable it's so shocking like you talked at Tommy Chong he's fine he's been he's like 80 years old yeah it's been smoking pot his whole life he can talk to you fine yeah but the booze will wear on you who's crushes you that's true what was the other author the guy really got fucked up Bukowski yeah man and why did he die was it alcoholism was no way no is that I don't know but I remember he looked like fucking shit he looked like hell yeah remember Mickey work played him in that movie barfly uh-uh you don't remember no yeah Miki work and Faye Dunaway I just remember a reward for leukemia leukemia I'm probably related to alcohol but when he I remember the footage of when the documentary crew was in his house mouse keys like you fucking cunt yeah kick Cernik the girl yeah that's how they rocked it all day long that was the way they lived yeah yeah that white trash romanticized white trash boozy life it's very strange because he was a brilliant poet yeah he would write interest shit and you'd go wow that look post office and fantastic no yeah he's a lot of great stuff great short pieces yeah but you know his life was just gross yeah dude yeah it was Hollywood gross you know like living in Hollywood just going to the bars bars bars yeah smoking and talking slow huh man I know I can't a man I mean thinking about it makes me feel sick like to be in bars just drinking and smoking all day all day yeah just going to bars and talking shit yeah like he there's some funny videos of him reading reading his stories read and like doing public readings and people are interrupting him he's threatening to stab them yeah yeah he was he was a while dude yeah yeah yeah I mean but that was part of his appeal part of his appeal was that here's this guy it's like he's not trying to be commercially successful he's not trying to buy a mansion and have a big yard offense he's just living in some shitty apartment drinking heavily mm-hmm and just cranking out work I remember reading his stuff for the first time and just being like I didn't know anybody who wrote like this yeah cuz of how like he would be so vulgar yeah I know yeah I really liked it you should see barfly yeah I should it's weird Mickey Rourke plays he does a weird take on him to a toast or my friend he's always getting in fights he's like at this bar getting fucked up and getting in fights can't his ass character but it's this it's just this agreement that everyone has like everyone's fucked up and you're all just gonna meet together at this place and be fucked up together yeah and live your fucked-up lives yeah it's wrong yeah I don't know man it's not for me but I enjoy watching it do you have moments with Burt were you were we're alone with them off-camera we try to talk some sense into him about like his crazy got the booze yeah yeah sure yeah I've talked to him before about it I mean you know the thing about him is that he's so like high-functioning and he he's he is the perfect person to be he has the perfect defense of like I'm fine because he he can do so much and you know he's not sleeping in he's getting up you know with with the kids for school he's going on tour Joey says he goes back to bed does he yeah I don't know that he goes back to bed he's drinking at 11:00 he goes back to bed yeah how's it Joe he said I go really yeah tell she gets up with the kids that motherfucker sleeps till 2:00 in the afternoon really he goes right right back to bed Joey told me that he doesn't got too fucked up the other day dude no he's like even me I go what happened he like fight some 400 milligram thing I fell asleep vicodin no no no for no like millions of th oh he's like Tom Segura you know he says you know you're full fuckin name yeah stops ago I had my M&Ms in my teeth on the sleep apnea machine so he was like it was bad my wife saw me and she was like what are you doing he was what do you prefer that I do this so I'm out there robbing people yeah and she was like good point those aren't the two options you have if anybody if I had a magic wand and one person to fix their lifestyle it would be Joey it would be clean clean up his diet yeah that's gotta be as unhealthy as Bert if not more this is he's so big and you know he's 60 years old almost you can't you can't last being that big and he this is already it but he's already in a much better place than he was 10 years prior right yes but well no ten years ago he lost a shitload of weight okay there was one point time where he lost like 80 pounds yeah remember he said my head looked too big he that was like oh yeah I got a gained weight again reasoning for gaining weight but he can do it yeah like red band did that too red band got really skinny red band got down low yes 160 he did remember that yes and then I went a long time without seeing him I saw him again he put on a bunch yeah but he's the Cape I mean we're all capable of it you know I go up and down all the time I'm just like you know for me you can always tell if I'm gaining weight it's not exercise for me it's that I started eating sugar again mm-hmm you know like I worked out like crazy last year I got there was points where I was working out like out of 75 days I work out like 62 of them you know well but I was not dropping weight because we eating I was eating yeah yeah you want a reward for all that hard work amount yes cake yeah and then I also sometimes it's not even the cake it's like I'll just you'll see somebody who works out a lot and eats like a large balanced diet and I'll be like well I want to do that you know you should do eat nothing but duck eggs the whole month there's so much weight gooey jizz in my mouth oh so much weight but I have two little boys he make me eat a duck egg you're really gonna cripple the duck egg industry we just suck my dick I'm gonna stick to chicken eggs better they're better no such things are okay maybe people are in know maybe I cooked him wrong I'm sorry duck egg people yeah they're you're gonna get some messages about that but I have to do that the protein fat thing I have to yeah like the only way that I'll not blow up did you quit the carnivore diet yeah how long did you last I did it hardcore for about a month and then I did how long before the diarrhea in a way that was about 10 days I got a text from you this diarrhea astonish a was it was her diary astonished I have photos my phone that I saved cuz I'm like this is crazy I have ink the other word like real special diarrhea that I had was when you know so I went from like just doing that hardcore to having like some greens but like meat you know meat fat and then like some greens that was fine it was when I that first day of like I fuck it gonna have some pasta and a donut today and then it was like just immediately crazy shits crazy shits buddies like make up your mind yeah I'm here to punish oh no I had to hold on to the side of the seat they watch it was like Rocket Man really really a good extraordinary mmhmm yeah yeah there's a volume that's astonishing right it's like that mountain it comes out like I don't even eat that much you would know too you had like this warning your stomach does things it tells you like you're gonna want to sit down for this one yeah like there's like little explosions yeah and you when you feel the liquid you feel water in your gotcha I think i strengthen my asshole muscles though that's good because I I was clamping him down so often was likes and then I barely made it to toilet that is yeah this is I just never saw it coming cuz most of what I was eating before was kind of carnivore esque and then I would have like a little bit of vegetables or some pasta or some planked out but I lost 12 pounds in a month in a month and just got shredded pretty easy and I kept most of it off yeah I gained maybe three or four cuz I went back to eating pasta and bread and during this quarantine I'm not on any diet I'm just because I'm my concern is just I mean what if it's hard to get food yeah you know I want to make sure that I'm just eating food yeah I'm not I'm not thinking about the way I look or I don't think diet is a real big concern I mean you know I'm not trying to let go off the rails but it's no yeah yeah I lost ten on the in that month oh that's pretty good yeah yeah yeah if you just cut out the sugar you just feel so much better - you do and you and I see the fucking I see the dark cycle that happens when you start I start with sugar like when I start being like odd this today in that tomorrow oh yeah double stuff or you and then I realized that like I don't even want it but I'm craving it you know yeah yeah and I if I couldn't yeah there's the thing that I get when I'll eat carnivore well have a big steak right so I'll eat a steak and then I'm done I'm done eating but unless I want a cookie then I could have more room yeah more room for that cookie yeah yeah or pasta I got more room for that pasta it's incredible in the carnivore thing the amount that I can eat and not feel like that stuff feeling yeah at all at all like again when II 2 ounce fucking t-bone and you feel fine feel fine you don't feel wrecked no yeah it's the best feeling after food because you don't feel like you fucked up yeah you feel like you like you have all your mental capacity you have your full mental capabilities you can think and talk and when I eat a big bowl of ate lasagna or something I'm not talking to nobody about nothing no if you talk to me I don't know what I'm saying I'm just going what yeah rain shuts down and I start to go like like those types of verbs the guy starts to like push out door and then I'll start ripping crazy farts like I farted lapse Pristina made this pasta dish and last night I farted so crazy she goes do you even respect me anymore like I was like yeah but I mean this is what's going on this happens this is marriage understand farts yet oh yeah well like my oldest will be like you're a fart and he's four and he loves him he talks about him and he even has that thing that like like the almost implied shame like did you just fart it's like no I didn't fart you fucked like he knows that like you know I mean like you don't want to be right the farter yeah but and then my my young is what 20 months you fart he's like he's just like nods and smiles he thinks it's great he thinks it's great farts are always gonna be funny with some kids yeah just one of those things to little boys man they just they love it yeah yeah you got little savages I did it my oldest is like he called me a little fuck the other day whoa and threw little in there he goes you little fuck and I was like hey what over what it was like hey no you can't have that right now he was like oh fuck nigga what was that he goes you little fuck no I go you don't do that you don't do that daddy you do that for a living yeah exactly then he goes well you're a jerk I know you don't call me that either were you getting this yeah call me a fuck fuck what are you gonna let him watch you on stunned on television I've you know I've tried to do it for a moment to see like what his interest I'll be like hey check this who's this and it'll be like me and I'll show it so and he's like yeah anyway and he just immediately he's like put the fucking paw patrol back on your right here right in front of me what I give a shit if you're on the phone yeah doesn't care one day he's gonna appreciate it one day what how are you kids into it yet they they get weirded out but then they see people approach you did you not like that yeah they do not like that yeah my littlest especially does not like that I like because people don't pay attention to her they just start talking to me and if she's talking to me people interrupt her to talk to me he gets a really angry pull on me yeah that makes sense that makes sense I all just saw it somebody talking to me and he just looked he was like they walked away he was just I could tell he wanted to be like what was that all a bit do you know that guy yeah yeah it's like my kids always said do you know him I'm like no like but he he comes up to you like he knows you oh yeah like he took him awhile to figure out they've never seen me perform but one time we were all in Irvine together and I was doing the improv and I snuck them backstage I'm like you want to see what the crowd looks like and then like they like peek behind the counter they're like oh my god so many people well yeah I go this and this is only a comedy club this isn't even a theater and it's not even an arena yeah it's crazy yeah one I want them to come to an arena one day that was you have to because it's so bonkers of course it's got it's gonna blow their mind yeah yeah they'd be like wait a minute wait a minute there's view people yeah who knows what that'll ever happen again I know who knows yeah this look no one saw this coming I mean people that put on like concerts and sporting events and entertainment is completely other than this kind of shit yeah this is it yeah this is it yeah somebody was and I saw these ideas cuz people were you know doing virtual performance you know whatever you can go live and play a guitar or sing and they're like people like you should do like virtual comedy shows I'm like and you have to have the live audience what's that dude's name that did that one comedy special Jerrod Carmichael filmed it no I don't know his name but I know you talked that was no audience comment yeah so it's a strange concept terrible idea yeah yeah when Gerard was telling me I was like what yeah what are you gonna do well I think the idea of the audience is played out like the audience then I said you mean the most important part of a comedy show the fact there's people there - laughs yes it's funny I think they took a swing yeah I didn't work out I mean I guess you know I respect taking high risk you know that's a dumb risk though yeah that's like I'm gonna swim but with no water what are you thinking I'm gonna swim in the bottom of the pool I'm just gonna see who can just do swimming motions yeah see how fast I can get across the pool oh it's it is strange I mean like that's one that I never thought somebody would try to do I never thought HBO would go great idea HBO signs off on a lot of outrageous ideas do you know what they're doing yeah I mean they made game our own so they probably like well we know it we got it yeah yeah yeah where the shit well they hit a home run for sure of every cycle of shows they always have fun that goes oh my god did you watch The Outsider no it's great I watched make millions that was fantastic I didn't see that oh that's the McDonald's one is that each pillow as well it's HBO yeah good my cousin made that it's greatly your cousin cousin made it no shit yeah it's fantastic it is such a cool fucking story the whole scope of that scam is it will fucking blow your mind what is the scam so it was a lottery thing like that from so you obviously remember the Monopoly game that you would play I don't so weak though yeah oh you're kind of healthy but back back shit so but it was humongous so what happened was they would do it like maybe like twice a year where they would go the monopoly McDonald's game and what happened is you go to McDonald's and you would buy a Happy Meal a Big Mac and on like the fries and the drink would be like a peel-off thing and you could win prizes so you pull off a thing and you like you could win it could be it's something as small as like you want free fries so you could be like yeah I got you know I won another order of fries or a Coke or a jetski or a car and then there were cash prizes million dollar prizes so by by playing the game which was essentially buy something buy a meal and it would drive up sales obviously right like sales would go way up because people were wanting to win these prizes well everybody that won for this I want to say I forget now but like 15 year period or something they were all in on a scam they were all fake winners a guy was stealing pieces and giving them to people connected to him it was all a lie nobody was legitimately how did he do that that's the whole that's the series man it's shocking fascinating because at one point there's this the this guy's giving it to you know people he knows and they're talking about it in the series like people connected to him they're like after a while it's like it's weird that you know 10 winners have have won in like this 300 mile radius and eight of them are Italian we're like we got to branch out a little bit because no one's like tipped off yet because the guy was you know Italian he was going like friends and family yeah it was it was really fucking crazy and then amazing they kept their mouth shut they've kept their mouth shut and they would have gotten away with it I mean they were getting away with it it was just it was they got tipped off FBI got tipped off and then this whole investigation that's what the series it's a six-part series that's what it reveals is just the scale and the scope of this incredible scam it was a scam and did this guy work for McDonald's no there's all these different characters in it but basically McDonald's had to hire a company that would oversee the game like the security of the game and they would also have to hire another company to print you know like the game pieces and all that and within those companies the corruption light McDonald's didn't know and it it but the story is fast and the characters are outrageous to us I mean the Colombo family is part of it you know the crime family I gotta watch it it's good man it's really good the there's so many of those multi series or multi show documentaries now that are fascinating oh yeah like wild wild country like that kind of shit were you just like why and with it and when these networks get behind something like that like this Tiger King two things you're like man you know that's why you need that platform right like an HBO yeah it's likes to be like tell us the whole story right it's fuckin awesome yeah or wild country country you need something that's gonna play out for five or six episodes for three episodes in you like Wow how the fuck did I not know yeah what was that one you remember the one a couple years ago was it the staircase something like that about I never saw that one that was fucking good someone killed his ex-wife yes yes dude and and you just cannot believe some of the twists and turns of something like this it's just and then there was like that part of that I mean I'm jumping around and the Apple theory where they're like maybe an owl came and attacked her and that's what yes yes yes and they were like there were hours in that area it could have happened like people have all these conspiracy theories it's amazing how many people got away with crimes before like DNA evidence do you really think about how like how easy it probably was for people yeah 25 years ago sociopath oh yeah yeah around whacking people no cameras no DNA yeah I mean the the what's the big one that we just the Golden State killer well that was the one that Patton Oswald's wife was working yes she she was writing that book what are you playing over there yeah what is a I was looking at the video that Robert Durst guy he's on trial right now that was the other one that fucking series was mastic what was the show called I don't remember that's where I got that song yeah dad blood yeah yeah I remember that I was in a we were doing a gig and I was like check out this song mmm except that's where I got that song the bad blood yeah the jinx jinx did you watch it don't fucking excellent yeah I read the story but I didn't watch it it's really good and it's super creepy like you're following along and then in the final episode and he's doing his weird fucking he has black eyes you know like there's no color they're black and he gets up to use the restroom and the mic still hot and he's talking to himself in the restroom you see like the cameras like locked off filming a wall he's like it's a fucking weird moment why does he have such black eyes what's that about I I don't know man this this trials going on right now might be on hold because of the Orion yeah it just started earlier this month like two weeks ago that's another really cool series how crazy is the Harvey Weinstein oh no no no that's gonna kill him right I think so I mean we don't know but he really looked like I mean he always look like shit but he looked like particularly a hot bag of shit like what a trial oh my god and for the sentencing when he came in with the Walker and everything like what the fuck do you think that that was a scam that he was trying to pretend that he was more hurt than he was probably probably I mean he it was a movie producer so he knows right yeah I play it up yeah but he did look like shit he really did in a way that you can't fake like his face was hanging on you look fat and he he did look like he was like I don't know like needing that support yes of that you know I mean the guy was walking upright a few months ago it seemed like I know well also the stress of that life of having the the weight of his past come tumbling down on him and imagine going up to Harvey Weinstein four years ago and go dude I want to show you what the future looks like for you he'd be like I'll fuck out of here that's never gonna happen never never man yeah me imaginator imagine going up to Cosby and telling him that no like you're the most beloved father figure in this country yeah I mean just before that like just before things went sideways he not he wouldn't have fuckin I'm like what are you talking about yeah I almost think that his story is less shocking the result mmm like the Harvey Weinstein thing I guess I didn't know he was a piece of shit I had never no idea but I knew that Cosby was right we had all kind of heard that Cosby is a piece of shit we all know that know anything about Harvey Weinstein I just knew he made movies I know yeah I guess I mean with Cosby I always knew he was a womanizer I didn't know there was like you know date rape any any no I had heard that you'd heard that I didn't you know I heard that on the set of news radio Wow and then 90s I had heard that he was drugging women well that's when he was probably pretty active with it you know it was I think that one was The Cosby Show on the air in the 8th late 80s early 90s I think so it was probably just getting done yeah I was on Newsradio was 94 and I remember like what he drugs people like so I think candy Alexander's woman so they were talking meet you I mean there's probably people on set that had experienced it maybe yeah yeah could be but I hardly I didn't know anything about I just the Harvey thing I just thought he I mean just a big fat ugly movie producer oh yeah and also I think when that story first broke there was some ID like it was kind of implied this guy was a gross you know like show me your tits kind of I didn't write as the story details came out you're like no this too is like a full-blown like great like rapist that you would read about in the newspaper you know I mean like he actually pushed women down I'll hold them down yeah he's a real fucking animal and then he was like what what's the problem and he fully shameless completely disassociates with what he did I think he was living this crazy life where he could get away with anything like a king I mean we've talked about this before that like that behavior of Kings like gluttonous power behavior where they just yell at everyone and off with their head and yeah bring her over here just like that yeah that kind of shit well when you also that his story revealed yet like the scope of payroll mm-hmm he had like photojournalists editors I think lawn fawn like but mafia kind of shit does you know like I pay you to fucking watch out for my bad deeds yes so he really was doing well even more disgusting it was in his contract like if you have one sexual harassment claim it'll cost you this much if you have to you have to pay us this much like it was written into his contract so they knew they knew they knew me but how come nobody else gets in trouble for that yeah I don't know yeah I mean how do you what do you what do they know that's the question in a jail hospital he's at Rikers son but in the in their medic unit think so oh you think that's top-tier qualities are up tier top of the food chain they have a bunch of Corona cases right now at Rikers it's like a it's a big issue of course you have no windows they're letting a bunch of people out right now that I have like probation violations or something oh let him spread it could move that's the next thought hilarious let him out yeah unless you're letting him out into a furnace look I mean that shit if it did that to that Olympic swimmer that 31 year old guy wrecked him was gonna do to Harvey Weinstein oh my god no he's oh this is what I want to talk to you about the fucking comments of people mad at you because you're doing shows in Spanish are hilarious I get a bunch of emails hilarious how mad people get well the funny thing is like so for people that don't know like I just I got a deal with Netflix where they were like do an English special and then a Spanish special and they actually offered me to take like you can just translate that special and shoot it I was like that's kind of boring so I'll try to you know work on some new stuff for the Latin audience and translate like a few bits and then in order to shoot it I just go I just need a bunch of reps like you would in English I just need shows in Spanish so I started doing that you know and started doing are you fully fluent like you could have conversations with people there's no hitch just like you'd have a conversation with me yeah I can have a conversation with anybody in Spanish and you've been like that your whole life there's like times where the the level of fluency goes higher like especially from immersed like living right and there's no mic who do you practice with yeah I mean there's there's definitely I have my hiccups in that like I might grammatically say something incorrectly mm-hmm they'll definitely know what I'm saying and then that's one of the things I work on is that I record these I send them to a Spanish tutor I go really yeah I go did I say anything incorrect in this is especially like what the fuck is wrong she goes I'm not going to she goes I'm not going to comment on your material she goes it's not what I'm used to but I'll help you with the grammatical thing so she you know she'll be like you should have said manual instead of admah okay so we work on things like that you know like make sure you say it correct because the main thing is I don't want someone to be distracted because they're like that sounded right of course so broken English I guess you know I don't know fluency level is probably like 8 or 9 or something Wow but I mean you know it gets better the more I I work on it and it gets worse the longer I leave it so that's why I started doing the podcast in Spanish that's why I've been doing these shows and all I did was I would announce hey I'm gonna do a Spanish show I did one an Oxnard I did one in Ontario I had these Texas ones booked for April where one night in each of this in Houston Dallas Austin to San Antonio and when I posted them they're like people are like hey these shows are in Spanish and I go that's what it says in the fucking on the marquee on the ticket on the like this show is in Spanish and they're like yeah I can't fucking understand it though guys all speak Spanish I'm like I know this is for somebody else and they're like they're like but why don't you add a show in English and I'm you know you're trying to like go like well I will do that show in English later like when the English hour is ready because I'm just releasing a special so I got to build a new hour before I come to Houston and show it you know and they're like yeah but you should just do it you should just do it while you're here and I'm like yeah but that's not you know and then I don't know I just but people have been like you're a fucking idiot for Spanish why I put screen grabs of yeah I left there there handles out yeah I read a few of them ah yes I got more I got more but you do oh yeah yeah and people are like and then I have the ones they're like I bought the ticket and I didn't realize that this was Spanish and I would like a refund and I'm like don't talk to me about it you go first of all on the site it's it's called Tom Segura in espanol and that's what it says in and then it's like if you speak English this is not the show for you and they're like I didn't look at it I'm like what do you want me to do man so you take it's on Craigslist yeah so yeah people yeah got fired up at me for not adding the English imagine if you were responsible for returning all your tickets like you'd never be able to do anything did you get messages like that they're like hey I think I want to exchange this ticket I don't know what kind of messages are yeah yeah I don't know I got I'm so much happier I don't know yeah oh well I'll tell you this my special came out today I have not gone to look at I read some good reviews yeah yeah of your shit yeah okay I haven't even checked it out yeah I read I read a couple good reviews and some I think one of them was Washington Post oh it's great that's cool yeah I'm happy but ya don't read any I don't get into it I do remember I'm the last tour you know especially on the bus you just said there you read everything reading three people are like I bought tickets Friday show I'd rather come this Saturday show and I would like at the Chicago theater okay like up dude yeah hit them up what am I gonna do like you can figure this out for me like okay like you have plenty of time to be making these 20 minute phone calls to reroute is this Steve to get the Saturday tickets yeah no it is but you you post and walk away right yes yeah I don't read shit it's a way to do it I've been doing that for a long time now it's amazing yeah changes everything if you have discipline but you have to have a discipline and not read your comments yeah you know because I know people that read them and they go crazy and they respond to them and argue with them like that's the that's the problem too is that you not only have to avoid reading if you are reading you have to not engage in the back and forth no you can't you can't because a lot of people are just trying to get your attention and then a lot of people are also crazy yeah if you're writing to me you're talking to the void yeah I'm not I'm not reading anything it's just better that way man yeah it's better for you mentally for sure for sure yeah yeah it's just you only have so much time you know and you get trapped reading stuff about you and and and go what who said that why are they saying that like you know if you have fucked up you know if you said something stupid do just try do your best yeah you know especially like what we do and especially if we're doing shows or podcasts or anything like that where you're you getting high and you're talking crazy oh yeah trying to be funny and sometimes you swing and miss and sometimes you sometimes you hit a home run and yeah you never know but if you delve into the comments and start reading all the things that people say about you and tailoring your your act towards your your your tailoring your podcasts or your the way our way you're talking based on the kind of people that are willing to leave comments in the first place right and you're also catering it to the loudest voice I'm just saying like oh you're loud exactly okay that is the number one problem with social media that's what I've tried to explain to people that like read social media and talk about Twitter and Instagram you know like well there's so many right-wing Trump supporters that this there's so many left-wing Bernie supporters to do that and the Bernie bro and this and that and no that's not true what's true is on the fringes of the left and the right you have losers that spend all their time calling people out and talk and shit online and I've studied these people I study these people for years because I've been fascinated by people that engage in these Twitter beefs with people and so I have a few of them bookmarked and I go to check them and some of them I would bookmark and I'm like this guy has done nothing yeah but talk shit online for the 12 hour crazy and there's a lot of them like that yeah there's a lot of in the most virtuous the ones who are trying to get the most reactions and they're calling out celebrities for this calling out people for that there's just so much of that online it reminds me of something you know some some things but someone says just stick with you sometimes yes you know like and you just I don't know that you can't explain why but you go like that just sticks with me I remember one time talking to a guy who goes you know there's a lot of unstable people out there and I hear his voice all the time like about this type of mouth yeah there's a lot of unstable people a lot of unstable people that also have access to a phone yeah and then they just start running off to the races don't crazy yeah yeah there's a lot of it but there's also you know it's a lot of nonsense on both sides just the social media just the the wanting people to like you like did you see that imagined song all those knuckleheads got together and saying imagine there's no heaven this not the time when everyone's Grammys dying you fucking idiot to sing imagine there's no heaven and there's this sense of you feel like they've that they feel like they did something yeah she's so happy gal gadot whatever fuck I did Wonder Woman she's got this beautiful smile on her face and so happy to sing that thank you just like like she's seducing you yeah I lost my job at the meatpacking plant but gal gadot sang it man it's a terrible version you guys suck at singing yeah why are you even singing publicly I didn't even post but I I tried to do one where I first of all I tried to do that where I go imagine I just started laughing hysterically so then I did one where I go I want to connect with all you guys so let's just jerk off together I'm not used to this hand this hand just try to connect with all my fans but it's such a dumb move to I can't believe how many people I mean I guess that she must have reached out to them sent me of you singing up and they want to be like tight where they're like sure Wonder Woman yeah I'll do it yeah okay okay I couldn't keep I tried to stay off fuck stay offline you fuck I try get off your phone yeah I've tried to do it because I wanted to I wanted all of us to to mock it I think I have it I think the some comics did something like that yeah yeah wait like I saw Eric Andre and then like slap on my slob on my knob that's what they did right do they exactly yeah they did like a parody of it was great well it's the weird thing is you know people are sitting around going all people think I'm cool if I do this yeah yeah yeah you know instead of like just capturing a genuine moment in your life which is really hard to do on social media anyway because you feel like a fucking dork you know it's a weird feeling for though is like let Majan you had worked with Gao right I thought about this too like you did something you were in a movie or something and then she hits you up I am trying to do this you have that moment of pause especially as a comic cuz it was like so much self-awareness but you're like that's gonna be lame as shit and then you have to like figure out a tactile you know coaster just just notice 100% 100% first of all I could give two fucks whether or not I'm ever in a movie again ever two fucks whether or not I talked to her first like what's up she's like will you sing imagine a line from imagine and if I'm in it friends with her yeah that's what I'm saying I would have to say listen you're awesome I think you're great yeah that is that is a ridiculous idea yeah it's so lacking in self-awareness and so ridiculous I let me tell you what I would do if I was even if I wasn't a comic if I saw someone do that I'd be like what in the fuck do you think you're accomplishing with this I felt so much better today seeing celebrities singing imagine you made it better I was not really yeah I mean Grammy died choking on her own vomit but I feel like the world's better because gal gadot so pretty gal gadot and she started it off imagine there's no heaven and then at the end big smile she did it like a really like sincere look into the camera like look what I did for you did she I mean yeah I thought I didn't get to it she's like hmm I feel connected to you yeah there's some people man that get real self-indulgent and self-righteous with that fucking social media it's exposed a lot of celebrities for being real dorks yeah yeah of course you know they should be exposed for that but they never got a chance to be exposed before they would you know it's night show they do these things you do these interviews everything was real fluff yeah you just leave him alone with a phone or you get great stuff you see Tom Hanks wife singing along to Naughty by Nature I was really surprised yeah it was good though it was fun so me good exceptional yeah yeah no makeup she's having fun hip hop array here's the thing that that cadence and like that that rhyme pattern yes it's not easy to mimic no it's not easy to mimic no she did a good job but it's also so obvious that she wasn't trying to be anything other than have fun yeah well when you're drinking children's blood every night for dinner you have fun you know I think sure it helps you keep your rhythm going mmm yeah no she was just having fun that's revealed that she's super cool yeah with no makeup right yeah she's not trying to get dolled up no like there's these people that some people are doing these like quarantined like day five here we are day five and it's like so contrived and super contrived I guess they want to connected people and they want to talk to people but oh I mean what are we doing yeah I mean are we doing that what are we doing yeah we are we are but we're having a conversation we would have this conversation if there was no microphone yeah I probably talk a lot more shit about people yeah I mean that's always a big component of a good time it's fine what's the talking shit's fun I keep thinking about that meet we had fucking Vegas man oh so good yeah we're bizarre meets yeah fantastic that it used to be the SLS and now what is it forget they change the name though remember that yeah sans or something switch back to what it was yeah Sahara I'm Sahara I think it's the Sahara whatever it is the fucking that bizarre meets place god damn Azhar good yeah yeah you gotta have maan I would love talking dope yeah I've seen him on board Dane Show yeah yeah he's that that place was phenomenal I love how they cook over wood - you walk by and you see the the hardwood coals and the grill grates and they know what the fuck they're doing they told us it would take an hour to cook the steak yeah yeah we're like an hour yeah like yeah an hour and the stakes are huge so just order one steak I was like really yeah 1/3 pound steak okay anything dude we are the two though amazing god animals good yeah what a fun weekend just randomly we happen to be in Vegas the same time so cool yeah that's cool and something like that yeah yeah I was bummed we're to leave before the the last three fights dude you missed the Whaley's young Johanna you and Jay check fight which is one of the greatest fights in the history of the sport I saw you saying you keep thinking about it dude all day I'd be speed four days four days they'd be as close as a fight could ever get a lot of people thought you wanted one a lot of people thought Whaley won but it was amazing it was amazing fucking war really came down like you could have judged it either way yeah yeah he could have yeah yeah it wasn't I mean they gave it to Whaley was a split decision but it was you honest head it was so close her forehead ridiculous and never never even responded to it and it didn't react to it just threw bombs and we know we missed that knockout where you guys were like where you mémé doubt you and DC which one there was a knockout like third to last fight big ass knockout mm you know I'm talking about yeah just after yes yes beneil dariush and [Music] yeah I think we mr. Carlos joke are close it was a crazy battle and your car hit him with a right yeah just saw but kneeled are used in real trouble and then Vanille Darius came back and knocked him out yeah there it is yeah Neil was really rocked and your car is he only has one loss in his whole career and it was a close loss and he came [Laughter] those bunkers right next to him and we left for that shit was that the net that must been the next fight yes I'm sorry you missed it missed that yeah that's the main event - well you had a show to do yeah it's show your boy Josh Potter yeah he's hilarious yes he's really funny man it was my first time seeing him he's really funny good guy too I like hanging out with them on Buffalo's finest I love watching new comics new comics new comedy yeah I love watching a new comic that I've never seen her act before yeah and you get to see them like and he seems like a guy's been doing about 10 years uh-huh there's about 10 years yeah yeah that's a fully-formed comedian you know it is he's a fully-formed comedian great guy great guy and he's a headlining now starting to heaven that's great so he deserves it he's really good I was impressed yeah I've been I've been taken on the road for a few years now and he just gets better and better and he yeah man he is a couple bits that really floor me he's really good you can't even give away the premises no you can't no I do love amounts a the ones I was like the way he wants to die really no he's really good it was cool to hang with them too you know it's just hanging with comics is the best dude it's about the best the most fun I mean if you if we hadn't seen you guys we would've just hung out with each other all weekend yeah and then you're like oh there's more comics here okay hang out with them yeah so it's always and they get to eat chill yeah but it was the beginning of the coronavirus things were a little weirded out bro I also think about so what my manager was in town he had friends in town so after one of the shows I want to say was the second night we also went to a cigar bar and you start thinking about like uh all of us all the contact and get in casinos two casinos are just fucking that's another thing dude Las Vegas is shut down so it's so wild to think about how those you know those casinos are just active people and now how about all those people that count on that yeah dealers the people ever clean the play waitresses yeah I've done everything shut down for how long how long they plan on shutting Vegas down for they announced like last week they said they would reopen casinos may 16th then today earlier today Trump was like there's no way this is going past Easter so like he was about ripping and roaring again but he's not basing anything that he's saying though on science no or on viruses no of course not yeah yeah he should shut the fuck up he's going hunched well he wants everything to bounce back because he wants the economy to bounce back course the governor of Texas had to take on it too he's like I would rather put myself in danger and I'm in a high-risk group of catching this disease and have the economy come back okay yeah I don't know man I don't know I don't know when I you know it's like I had a take on it before when I see a Juris Elba I'm like he looks great those NBA players they look great all these people are Tom Hanks is recovering yeah maybe it's just like the flu but then you read that 31 year old Olympic swimmer and you know and you go oh that guy's 31 and he's a stud he's an Olympian yes literally an Olympian a gold medalist by the way he's a fucking stud right and he said it was the worst virus he ever experienced in his life and then Michael yo Michael yo getting really sick I was and there was two college basketball players who died they died yeah yeah not college basketball players now but they played College in the 90s and they died and they both died yeah it was a my my Apple newsfeed this morning I think about this virus too is that there's there's this uncertainty about you know when things will change when the curve will flatten when the economy but we also don't understand the virus yet right exactly that's the part that's really alarming that's the weird thing is like some people just experience no symptoms and it just goes through their system and they don't ever get it and then the other thing was someone was telling me I forget who it was IRA buted to dr. Peter a TA yesterday but I think I'm wrong someone was saying one of the odd things seems to might be Sam Harris someone's saying one of the odd things seems to be that the more contact people have with the virus the worse it gets hmm so some like medical profession yeah medical profession errs yeah yeah it's very strange you see the NBA player today said he lost his sense of smell yeah that's another thing that's one of the things that Peter attea said smell and taste going away yeah it's very weird people lose their sense of smell very weird it's it's uh it's spooky yeah because it's um it's like well it's also there's these crazy conspiracy theories that Wu Han is like some place where they have some weaponized virus lab and so that they're worried that one of the things that this that makes this so scary is that it could have snuck out of this fucking lab hmm but apparently they've traced it to a very specific type of animal I thought that this thing always transfers I think Moshe told me this that that birds need a pig the pig is the perfect conduit of transferring like the Burt bird disease won't come from like straight to a person it needs to go to a pig and the pig can infect what about avian flu I don't know avian flu came from Birds this maybe that's and I think bats gave it to pangolins do you know what a fucking penguin is mm-hmm Whitney was telling me this that a Pangolin is like the most the most what is the word you would use where someone is uh transferring animals I'm fucking slow today man my brain slow today yeah that uh the most exploited most exploited animal and the worth you know what a penguin is uh uh some weird fucking Hangul in Pangolin I think it is never heard of that yeah there it is that fucking thing look it up there this screen look that that thing that's called a penguin penguin yeah that is the most exploited animal in the world and they eat them in China and so this fucking thing is where shots China has laws to stop Pangolin trafficking yeah I think it's freaky minik yeah they're they have laws that they're they're imposing now to stop the sale of wild animals you can't sell wild animals in the United States but you can sell well you can sell wild fish but you can't sell wild animals the United States I some of the weird things about fish what about those like exotic people in like that documentary you know like why aren't those wild animals I mean for food oh oh oh okay okay I mean for food okay you can't like even in this country it's like most trafficked yeah adorable Pangolin is the most trafficked animal in the world how is that possible ask Whitney Cummings she's the one who told me it seems to be true yeah it's in the New York Post as well there it is the rainforest of the Congo Cameroon and Central African Republic lives an elusive mammal that looks like a cross between an anteater and armadillo and a pinecone and thanks to poachers the Pangolin is the most trafficked animal on earth in April of 2019 Singapore seized a world-record twenty five point six tons of Pangolin scales worth seventy six point five million from an estimated thirty eight thousand of the creatures in December the scales from some fifty thousand African penguins were seized by Chinese authorities why what do they do for it I don't know it's because of this scale this unique feature that makes them a target said Tessa almond a volunteer for the Sangha Pangolin project a Preservation Society the Pangolin buries burro to create holes so the scales are associated with circulation it's used as an ingredient in traditional Asian medicines they used to help mothers for lactation and for blood pressure but none of this has been clinically proven so it's like Tiger teeth and yeah yeah and tusks yeah there's so much of that shit I was talking to a Chinese guy about that yeah and I was saying well what do they know that rhino horn doesn't work and that they could get viagra I'll give it's make your dick hard viagra definitely works oh it's not even that he goes a lot of it is a status thing it's like so if you are a really wealthy Chinese businessman and you're into this kind of stuff like you want to show that you skirt the laws a right animal track shark fin soup right like isn't that wearily that tastes good but I'm saying that's isn't that something where there's like some type of probe it's restricted and then they're like yeah but I'm oh yeah I'm the man so yeah this yeah I think I don't know what kind of restrictions they have about that in China but across the world rhinos it's there but they want that tea that they make at a rhino horn because it just makes my eye come discuss business over rhino tea oh yeah I mean yeah I get why that happens but I don't want any well China's so weird right because it's a weird combination of capitalism and communism yeah and not just comment but a military the communist dictatorship it's interesting you know speaking of like the virus the way the way China lock down Wu Han yeah when they decided to mmm it's a there's no fucking around yeah no fucking around 11 million people in that city went through the streets spraying some distant they sent 40 thousand workers to Wu Han to be like handle this lock it down clean it up yeah just boom in one city and they what's it like now there it's there well here's the thing you can never trust with the state governor you know the state media says but they were saying that all their new cases are inbound so it's travelers coming in how convenient it's all these fucking Italians yeah coming over here for shark's fin soup and rhino tea fucking pasta virus cunts yeah it's the rigatoni virus now it is you guys did it well they're saying that the America could be the next epicenter yeah well New York is has more than 5% of the world's cases right now does it really yeah it's growing to well New York has 25,000 cases as of this morning that's 5 percent the world's cases that's what that's what the news was last night they say that for every one person that tests positive ten of them have not even been tested that have it yeah there's there's for sure way more cases yeah because it's impossible to get a test a test yeah yeah like try to try getting a test right now in LA LA had they started a website yesterday with all the information how to get it tests and they're like first of all meet this criteria are you over 65 I mean it's not really yeah part of it yeah Jesus do you have these symptoms you can't even order one online if you can get a test going right now you could be a great business it would be Jeff Bezos and it would be a great way to like you know figure out who needs to really be staying home did you see the story of the Senators that were in a closed-door meeting in January about coronavirus they just dumped all their yeah yeah Burt Lafleur or whatever name is yeah like that's not what happened dude you had that is the definition of insider trading that's what they prosecute but what's happening to them nothing nothing yeah what's up Jamie stuffs happening I guess it just isn't happening immediately yeah what is happening ICC said that there might be looking into it oh they might I'm trying to get I might be looking into that murder hmm I might be he's the chairman of the Intelligence Committee yeah and dumped all stock yep no they issued a sharp warning Oh a sharp ones are pointing stop don't do that again what are you supposed to do if you know that you're gonna lose all that money it's a good question I think if you have that type of Intel you uh you're not allowed to profit well you're not allowed to use that intelligence that's not open to the public debate tell the it goes public you know I mean like once that goes public then you can act on it otherwise you know the virus is already public the virus is public but I think the the scale yeah the magnitude of the impact yeah estimate what's gonna happen when it's closed or bang is like hey it's about to go down and then you go call my broker hey man it really is a movie yeah it really is some kind of crazy virus is really it is dude this is I mean like I was said to you we don't have anybody we can call and be like you remember when this happened in your life no nobody does nobody does yeah nobody does Bert was saying that he thinks that in 2009 he had h1n1 made sense he said he said he was so sick yeah he said he's never been more sick in his life he said he couldn't get comfortable somebody knew had actually verified that evening yeah yeah and that killed a lot of fuckin people much more lethal yeah much more isn't it interesting how they locked that down I don't know it never spread really I think it's because you got it and if you're contagious you knew it yeah this is a highly contagious yeah and again the big problem is we don't know how many people have it and then you have these asymptomatic people how many people died from h1n1 in 2009 50,000 is America that's not that much no but I believe it or not known about right but both the thing about the flu every year can kill as many as 90,000 people in America a lot yeah yeah and we never talked about it ever know this says 2009 flu pandemic killed 18,000 people good P yeah I think the the biggest that I remember reading was ninety one thousand one year one year ninety one thousand people died from the flu I'm not sure if that's the United States or North America the whole thing is kind of crazy it's it's interesting that Ron Paul was calling this a hoax before he was saying you know just a hundred people have died in America and they're using this to take away your civil liberties and then his son God son did get it his son did get it afterwards and then Nancy Pelosi's daughter tweeted that Rand Paul's neighbor was right the neighbor that attacked him like what issue from that attack yeah he's got a piece of his lung removed right the guy told him broke five of his ribs and they had to remove a piece of his lung and so Nancy Pelosi's daughter says that the neighbor was right like what is it what does it mean the neighbors right because the guy got sick the neighbors right to attack him like two days ago his Twitter account by his team tweeted out that he was feeling fine was asymptomatic and was not aware of any direct contact with anyone that had it don't know how he got it so he hasn't he's just how do they test these people they're testing these people you know when you hear about these people getting tested and they don't even have any symptoms like how are they getting tested and why they getting tested when some people are really sick I've been questioned that - I think there's a way up you can get a private doctor that maybe you can get access to a test like a private dock you can pay extra money to get ahold of the test really I think I don't know and I don't know if that's the difference between people just showing up at a dr. Singh hey I think I'm sick can you please find a test for me no like who you want us to find one we don't have access to that we have we're busy versus like I don't know I'm just guessing the weirdest thing about it to me is the asymptomatic aspect of it that some people don't experience anything and other people get really fucking sick it's almost like if you wanted a disease it spreads you have it let me have that have one we're like 50% of the people don't even feel anything and they just spread it to 50 more people or a hundred more people or thousands more people it's weird man it just doesn't make sense like a normal thing makes sense you know because we haven't experienced this one particular virus before we don't really don't know anything about how it's going to end where it's going to go and then there's the possibility that they could morph and that it could you know be more contagious or more deadly or more this or more that apparently some people who have tested positive for though are contributing and they're they're extracting antibodies from these people people that have gotten over it but it's still going to be the estimations there six months to a year before they come up with a vaccine I'm seeing rumblings of the false positives online I don't double up too much but I think that happens all the time okay false positives with all kinds of diseases what do you got there fella hand sanitizer of course yes everything spray it spray it baby pharmacist told me the other day that I don't know this is bullshit the farmers have told me that it's not effective unless you have it actually dry on your hand like when people go like that like you got to actually have an alcohol drop pharmacists told you this mm-hmm the people I mean I don't know you know I know if he's some fucking lunatic but that's what he said makes sense yeah he's like it's not because people like put it on then just he's like no no you got to actually rub it all the way in what is life gonna be like when this is done that's just gonna be weird what is life gonna be like we're gonna be paranoid now I'm someone weird al' yankovic tweeted everyone is Howie Mandel now I mean that's not theirs this is gonna I do think it's going to spur this whole generation of super germaphobes like oh yeah especially like a kid I was thinking about you know I said my kids are too young to recognize what's going on they don't know what's going on but any kid that's you know their grandma dies yeah or just is like I would say between ages 6 and 13 that childlike you know growing up age and you go like schools I'm not going to school anymore things are shut down we can't go to restaurants don't go to the movies or everything's different a lot of those kids are gonna grow up super anxious yeah and weirded out by this yeah scared to travel yeah yeah like traveling I think I personally never hesitate about any term stuff I'm not built like that but I have thought about getting back on fucking planes Oh oh my god we circulated here nothing you do about it nothing you can do min no what are those auntie VAX people gonna do what are they gonna do well they only want to take a vaccine what if they come up with a vaccine for this shit and evac people are the dumbest of all they're so fucking stupid do you have Eddie's number you want me to text him is he one of those too I know he's like it's so stupid I mean that's really idiots moronic yeah people get mad at you I know they're suggesting that there's something wrong with being an anti-vaxxer stupid you dumb you don't I mean just look at the the research look at that the evidence is all there it saves a lot of research is all brought to you by the mainstream media don't you understand how it works sorry yeah why don't you go call Tom Hanks yeah see you show up one of those meetings I bet he believes in vaccinations mm-hmm I bet he does now what do they do what do what does an anti vaccin about coronavirus if they Pro if they come out and they go we have the vaccination now yeah I mean I don't know pin him down fucking jab it in their neck it's a totalitarian big fan well one of the things that Putin is doing go to Roy Jones jr. his Instagram page because Roy Jones jr. is uh I don't know if you know this romantic Putin fan and that no that actually has a rush for what yes he's a Russian citizen Roy Jones jr. Roy Jones jr. monster gone someone on swinging sweet sweet Russian pool I bet it's the best I bet with a honey pot you with is just so best I've been it's like a fist Jesus Jones jr. Instagram page no Instagram and his Instagram page Pensacola Florida one of the greatest boxers of all time but not really well-read in terms of totalitarian governments and the consequences of make you say that this these they're threatening to lock people here goes you have to choose between staying home for 15 days or prison for five years and then Roy Jones writes simple crisp and clear and that's how you fix stuff give options a or be simple gotta love it I don't know if you gotta love that that's is that how they're handling it there I don't know it might be bullshit might just be a meme yeah but I think he's just pro-putin yeah Putin hooks him up yeah so I mean pictures of him hanging out with Putin Putin comes to his fights like some girls fighting over there all over there too oh yes right their buddies all that whole region loves to go he loves them back yes I think he's got a I think he's got a Russian citizenship he does too yeah he had an SEC violation recently free insider trading he didn't disclose that somebody that he was a big whore saying yeah he was didn't disclose it they were compensating him and I guess that's an SEC violation so let me ask you this while you're on this we're we're all on this hiatus how are you practicing your Spanish are you just practicing it by doing your podcasts yeah doing the podcast talking to Pete the the best thing you can do I mean I try to do it the podcast I try to do it once every couple weeks but it's by the best thing to do if you're ever trying to like get better at any language is immersion and it's forcing yourself to have conversations you have to talk you have to actually even if doesn't even matter if you're new at it or you're pretty fluent at it you have to talk and so do you call your mom my mom my cousin's the the tutor friends Richard via is a comedian friend of mine speaks fluent Spanish Francisco Ramos this is a slow state today yeah yeah Fabricio cabañal yeah Francisco Ramos hey Suz yeah those guys all fluent speakers yeah any conversation you can have is gonna help you you know maintain it or get better at it so when the when you get back on the road is the number one priority the Spanish special we get give the Spanish special rollin or is it just get your feet back on to you I think it's get the yeah because I mean I was at that last show I did March 11th was 20 minutes of new English material for like you know my stand-up right and so I was like feeling pretty good about that that I had like 20 new you know and you and so I was gonna go into like a bunch of work I feel like I would have had 10 more by now right now yeah 10 a month is doable it's doable if you're working so yeah I mean I I've been balancing both I did that 20 new while I was working on the Spanish some stuff so it's gonna be to go try to get back to both men just doing the Spanish stuff and getting my my regular English set isn't gonna be weird to do set the first time there's gotta be real weird strange it's also it seems to me that we we have this idea that things can't change so we have to go back to the way they were right that we have to it's gonna it's going to be that way again we're we're all we're all comedy junkies right yeah yeah I mean that's a I mean I've said this many times before but it's true I feel bad for people who've never killed they don't know what that feels like right I thought for a second like you meant killed a person no no I was like I feel bad for someone who's never rocked a house yeah I don't know what that's like to crush I think - you know what the perspective changes for them you ever have a friend watch from the wings yes so they they then they always it always feels different they're like that's what you write feel up there yeah because they get to actually sense that yeah you know now I'm remembering when I came to see you I was so exhausted I remember that I fell asleep in your dress you're him on my band I'm not doing so good and then I was thinking about this coronavirus shit about I better get back to the hotel yeah and I crashed so hard I slept for like ten hours that night which is nothing normal for you right no it's so weird yeah I was watching I was like goddamn I got to sit down and I went to your dressing room for a second I took a leak sat down on the couch and I was not I was hanging out with Jamie and I was like I think I'm go back to the room yeah like I'm hurting maybe I was fighting something off maybe man maybe but that's gonna be everybody from now to there I think I might have had it for a day or two yeah but my immune systems amazing and I shucks it off yeah this is it's so weird that some people get it and some people don't there's nothing like this there's nothing like this man well so I guess we just keep doing this we just keep doing podcast already popping them out as long as we keep our social distancing and wash our hands and stuff and I'm not touching my face at all no I don't think it's one of those things that you just start doing even realize you're doing it even on those announcements the doctor lady lifts a finger laid your finger and the other guys scratched his face I mean they're all touching their face but when she licked her finger right after she said it's like what are you doing maniac yeah of course what you what what when was that when she licked her finger it was about 10 days ago yeah it was only 10 days ago what did that yeah that was about 10 days it's today the 20 or the fourth yeah yeah what's up three weeks ago when she did that yeah Wow whoa oh wait I'm just moving fast time is moving fast yeah you can go the other thing is strange is that you consume the media you know like the news of it oh my god is going on and then you can walk down a street or drive down as for you forget but you know I mean like there's this sense of yeah what so I talked to another cousin of Mines a doctor and she's like oh I yeah I don't I don't turn any of it on I just just get it out of already know like what's happening so I just choose not to have be bombarded by it yeah you can be bombarded yeah you know and it also shifts your your view of the world so to heighten your anxiety and your paranoia people were anxious already people already have anxiety issues they must be a fucking wreck right now absolutely because they they're like oh my god I was right the world is ending there's a mandatory lockdown across the entire country except Montana it's weird to have this going on honestly and promote you know like it's like there's so many people at home so many people at home I mean I look I understand the whole marketing of and how that works but you're just like you know you're on these calls and they're like tell us making you special isn't it crazy there's a pandemic so what did you guys shoot it yeah what do you mean by ball hogs and why do you have all those pornhub girls they're saying ball hog yeah did you get those girls to say that are they already saying ball they're already saying it the you talk about my stories yeah yeah they were already that that's where I got the title uh-huh I was on the road that was Jay and my D well and I saw I saw a nice lady doing really extensive stuff - this guy's balls right and I was like I wonder there's a whole sub-genre dedicated to this you know so I typed it in and they're like you might enjoy ball hogs in that feature these ladies they introduced themselves and they go and I have a ball hog so yeah they all do it and they really work on guys balls like hardcore really bad and so in the special I at one point just reference I not that film but I just tell people that that their mothers are ball hogs and then and then I think I think the you're really good this by the way picking titles I think it's one of the hardest things you know you're like you're doing your edit and you just want your show together then we're gonna call it fucking no live from here it's just the worst but yeah you've had good ones but anyways I was going back and forth with different titles and it was suggested actually Josh my manager who was like what oh and I smiled ear to ear and I was like yes at that point what was your tour named take it down oh yeah you can't call it take it down you can't call it take it down no I mean you could but no no you can't the Hogs better yeah yeah yeah so it's funny when you call it tour one thing and then you call the special I know and people were like you should call take it down I'm like yeah but they they don't want it to be called take it down yeah they don't Netflix isn't like dude it'd be great if you call this take it down bogs perfect yeah yeah and plus it has that other meaning - yeah selfish sharing yeah yeah a couple layers to it yeah naming it and then but Dungey at that feeling - when it's over that's just like I just needed another couple months always always dude so we shot at the at Austin City Limits great place beautiful amazing venue the next day I had to move venues because we would have shot the next day as well the next day we had to we stayed in Austin and we did two more shows at the Paramount so if if we had had the opportunity I just would have stayed and done them because you guys started doing I love it the for show yeah would have done it I would have done it you just didn't have the the venue like we can't we can't do it so you just did one night two shows when I 2 shows and the next night switched yeah but but the next night you feel even looser that's what I was saying yes I forgot my train of thought the next and right you have the relief of like I shot it and then like this joke taking it here fine mm-hmm like I wish there was a way you could make yourself do that yeah well the way you can is by doing four shows yeah that's that changed everything for me when I started doing four shows it may all shows be like a show mm-hmm and like when I did Boston a lot when I did strange times the first shows where most this shit came from I only had a couple of bits that I didn't do earlier that I did that I had to sandwich in there but most of the set was from the first show because I was so loose through the next night I added a line to one of the kind of like table setting jokes yeah and it just fucking crushed so hard that that I ITEC I took it out as special I took the joke I go I got it I gotta keep this joke I was like I'm out so I can use it again well that's good that you can do that yeah that's good I had it trimmed down to fucking fucking haunt me makes you hate yourself you should almost tape twice tape and then tape again in four months I know it would change everything right yeah tape tape again in a month a month almost enough time yes yeah film and then film again and watch that in between there like it'd just be such a gangster that you're gonna pay double double taping money fuck especially today with all this fucking quarantine money oh my god if Netflix paid you perv you cashing in right now son no and then what'll happen is I'll go to negotiate next time it'll be like these views will be like that wasn't real was quarantine because you're a corona comic yeah there's uh they're throttling internet now yeah because so many people are online that's that's what they're really concerned about New York City because like New York City hasn't even hit its peak yet they think the peak is within two to three weeks mm-hmm so the cases you're experiencing now that's not even peak so in two to three weeks there's gonna be even more people at home taxing the the structure of you know all the services whether it's electricity whether it's internet everything all the underlying things that you use you take for granted because they don't never max capacity at this right never well never that's with fun with cell phones whenever there's an emergency and you can't make a phone call because everyone's on their phone yeah and then you realize like what are you selling you're selling phones where everybody can use the phone but you can't all use the phone at once you're planning your your whole the way your structure is set up it's only set up for a certain amount of people use it at the same time even though you sold 300 million cell phones yeah I can't really use them all at once well it's busy right now in a structure sucks yeah that's true that's true they sell whack ass fucking half-baked infrastructure yeah yeah and you don't realize it until something like this happens like oh this there's not room for all of us yeah well the last apocalypse you and I experienced we went to a nice hotel that's right during the fire when we stayed in the same hotel no let's leave together I'll leave together with you where you want to go we got to go somewhere Colorado get a Ranch Colorado be dope what about someone really hot hot hot is that bad I think so Arizona I have to I was told I know there's like a theory in it but like that the viruses thrive more in the cold setting hmm I don't know if it's factual hmm the virus just needs hosts what about like Fiji yeah I mean yeah but then they fucking steal your money what do you mean go to some weird whack-ass foreign government you can't keep your money over there that there's no corona and Papua New Guinea right now you don't think so because they're all eating brains dude they're eating cannibals they were telling that one of the guys told me he had a when I was in Australia like a month ago he's or two months ago he goes I was working there on some construction thing and he goes you don't leave the area that they tell you because you know things get crazy and lawless if you venture out somebody you know could fuck you up no one will ever know have you ever heard the semen Warriors from Papua New Guinea mm-hmm prepare yourself for this story there's a tribe where when boys are young they take them out of the tribe and they teach them that in order for them to fully grow they must ingest semen its anally and through the mouth and so they fucked these boys make these boys suck dick all all their life until they grow full you know full size and then they they turn around and do that young boys somebody else yeah the semen warriors of Papua New Guinea see like semen come yeah and they have these names like anal father and an anal son and yeah it's in the way they refer to it it's like it but it's a like some pedo like at one point time started this sounds like in order for you to grow you gotta suck my cock and like well I want to be big and strong I'm gonna grow yeah literally there's a there's a whole tribe that operates under that principle all right and people have visited them I think they're cannibals as well there's a lot of cannibalism going on down there it's a nice ribbon on the day you know that what is it called Crutchfield Jakob disease same thing as mad cow definitely two punches it's a prion disease the same prions are it's it's a type of encephalitis I think it's a type of in encephalopathy it's a freak it's not like a virus and it's not bacterial it's in its own category but it is a it's a disease that affects cannibals and the way they got its cows is and I might be if you're a biologist I'm so sorry I'm fucking this up I know I am cows got it from them serving cows cow brains so mad cow disease the origin of that was they would grind up these cows and the parts they didn't use and feed it to cows because it's protein well you would give these cows as cannibal disease that also exists in Papua New Guinea in these cannibals those cannibals get this disease and these prions they they can survive what thousands of degrees in temperature for they've done experiments on people human beings that had mad cow disease and the instruments they used to operate on them they ran them through these sterilization cycles to three times and the the prions are still alive what yeah yeah they're literally almost impossible to kill and there's a version of it that it's making its way through deer populations right now it's called chronic wasting disease chronic wasting disease is also a prion disease and it has not made the jump yet does that mean here to peep that's from deer eating deer or no they don't know what caused that prion disease but it is a prion disease they don't think it's necessarily from deer eating deer what was the tribe that was in the news like I want to say in the last 12 16 months where they have no contact you know what the I said North Sentinel island yes yes that's I have a whole bit about that you seem a bit no and this is like the guy who was like I'm here yeah save you put them up and then the Indian is it the Indian government's like we don't fuck with yes the Indian Ocean yeah yeah yeah there's a few places like that real uncontacted tribes and another one is there's a couple of them still left in the Amazon and the problem the ones the Amazon is these people have land and they try to protect these people because you know the land is valuable yeah and so then they you know people from these either mining companies or oil companies they'll go in and kill these people fuck yeah cuz I like fuck you we're taking your land this is a real issue with that in the Amazon without going to sassanid what's the Sentinel try it what's it called the North Sentinel island North Sentinel yeah middle the Indian Ocean direct descendants of people left Africa 60,000 years ago holy shit yeah yeah that's one of the most uncontacted places but they've all been contacted everyone's been slightly contacted at least historically but that one is a particularly weird one I don't think they're cannibals but they might be but the the ones in New Guinea are yeah you google seamen warriors of Papua New Guinea that's gonna be what I read about tonight yeah all right ball hog it's on Netflix right now go get it
