the Joe Rogan experience and they always have those kind of things there's all sorts of different classes that yeah you like yoga awesome they I've done one of those high-intensity interval training things at a yoga place too whether you do some yoga and some like really light weights but all these crazy little exercises that's fun too you got a dancer pose we don't say easy oh you try to do that don't hurt yourself easy yes oh that is that what's called standing bow things called standing bow we going no one can see you you supposed to grab both legs but that's okay do it grab that other leg bitch you got it no this is yeah come on son here he goes yeah nice and the headphones on take it to the new level like a NASA mission called again cry for help how often do you do it when I would go I would go to Hut you oh there you go a couple times a week or now I just kind of do it in my back yard to stretch out after a long flight or something that's good anything kind of like you at the tank like that's the time to think about life to think through a bit to think through a mission that you're working on some family issues it's like quiet it's about you for me yoga it's like giving yourself a massage it's more gratifying than going to your your weights I said I like to stretch out before sets you ever do that do stretches before you go yeah it was real good that like there's something about that that's very relaxing puts you in a good I think you carry around when you're tight you carry around a lot of like and your attention that you don't necessarily want pigeon pose that's where all the tension is pigeon pose that's the one where you're jealous what the fuck is he doing oh wow yeah that oh I've seen this one yeah I've seen that one that's called is that it's a good one hip opener yeah look so sad that's one like if you go to you hot yoga people will do that pose and start crying this there's so much emotion and anxiety release from the hip yeah that's not real Joe you're just crying because someone told you she cry nonsense they always want to say that this is opening up your colon you don't have any fucking there's no diagrams you don't know where the colon is like you better stop I don't know when I fight it's like I'm fighting and I think yeah it's a poor shield in a sense you know and sometimes if it hurts enough like when I got my ribs cracked I felt that right I can went through and they like disrupted my force shield and so sometimes that something would go through like I saw your shield so my force shield so yeah you're AB - your mindset yeah this is like you're fighting your you ready to accept all sorts of things yeah like I could die or even harder I could kill someone do you think it'd be harder to kill someone than to die and so where are you yeah yeah because then you think about their loved ones mmm so thinking about all the people that loved you we fight think about all the people that love you right yeah and so when we fight I didn't I didn't break any rules but I killed you right think about all your loved ones everybody that loves you that's attached to you think about that all that pain it's long because of what I did to you right even though I didn't break any rules have you ever been in a promotion where someone died mm-hmm but that's heavy right yeah I don't I think probably why a lot of Fighters I I have noticed like there's there's I don't think the majority of fighters look at what they do with the gravity that that it deserves hmm you know like you could kill somebody like you need to think about that and be okay with that not okay but just understand like all right that could happen and I'm gonna be cut I'm consciously knowing this and choosing to go forward they just think oh I'm gonna fight it'll be fun it'll you know whatever or it'll be hard or I'm gonna like whatever they don't think about these things is this something that you thought about when you were young yeah before I really got into it so you this is a something you've been contemplating even before you started fighting you were aware of all the possibilities yeah I okay all right I'll say it so I was um it was about 28 I think and I don't think I had my pro boxing debut yet and I took some mushrooms and I was thinking somewhere along the trip I started thinking about fighting and I started thinking about like what could happen to me and I think I started thinking about the death of me and then I started thinking about what could happen to my opponent like what's worse than that and I thought about I could see like if somebody had fight and I saw all the like like lines of gold thread attached into them like from their loved ones and then all the lines got snipped when they died yeah I saw this limb this mushroom trip and I was just like and so then when I decided to fight there's more intense you know and more commitment and more resolve that's heavy yeah yeah but that is what it is right and that's where I think rule there's more power this idea of enforced equality right ensuring that there is such a high emphasis played or placed on a quality quality that you have the equal amount of men the equal amount of women and the opportunities are absolutely available as much to women as they are do and this is enforced you know this creates an environment where there's less resistance now in an environment where there's less resistance perhaps women don't feel as compelled to say I'll show you yeah that is what seems to have but this is though well here's a Nicki look here's an example so there are fewer women mathematicians in the end the higher echelon it's okay but here's something interesting about math medical ability first of all it's very rare so that's the first thing to keep in mind now it looks like if you look in junior high that give mathematically gifted men and males and females are approximately as common now there's a little bit of debate about that because there is some evidence that maybe at the very upper extremes there's a male advantage just like there's a male disadvantage at the low end because the male distribution for intelligence might be flatter and so that's the greater marry male variability hypothesis there's been papers putting that forward that have been retracted as a consequence of pressure from politically correct people even though greater merit male variability is actually quite common in the animal kingdom for a variety of reasons men are more expendable that males are more expendable in some ways or you could say that males are more likely to produce to pursue high-risk high-return strategies you can look at it either way and it's certainly possible in any case the men the males in junior high who happened to be mathematically gifted are less likely to also be verbally gifted whereas that doesn't seem to be the case for the females and so if you're a male math nerd then math is a pretty logical pathway for you because you don't have as many other options whereas if you're female math nerd you have other options because you're all you're less likely you're more likely to also be verbally gifted and so that's enough to at least in principle account for some of the reason why there are fewer women mathematicians than men mathematicians they have other options they have other options and there's lots of complex there's lots of complex reasons like this and so we have this reflexive idea and this is very much the case because this is like the core idea among the feminist neo-marxist types is that if there's differences in outcome that's that's proof of prejudice and that's support for the idea of the patriarchal tyranny and that's like the core axiom of the radical left is the patriarchal tyranny as far as I'm concerned that's that's God for them the patriarchal tyranny it's like well if it turns out that many of these differences in outcome between men and women aren't a consequence of the patriarchal tyranny in fact even get bigger when you reduce the tyrannical aspect of the patriarchy and even the patriarchal aspect but then it makes that theory not only wrong but opposite of the truth which is the worst kind of wrong and so you know if men are more likely to produce pursue careers in the STEM fields which seems to be the case under conditions of optimal freedom for men and women then that's going to drive income disparities because the STEM fields pay more and they pay more partly because they're scalable like it's really hard to scale care for people you know like if you work in a daycare you're gonna care for three infants you're not gonna care for fifty because you can't it's not scalable but if you're like a software designer it's infinitely scalable and so there's there's a much wider range of possible of possibility for generating much larger much larger income pools and much larger pools of wealth you know and men are also more likely to work longer hours and if you work 10% longer hours you make forty percent more money there's a nonlinear return on that's a good thing for everybody who's listening to know if you have a job you want to be the guy or the woman who's working that extra ten percent because the return on that is nonlinear so that's a really useful thing to know and I don't know how it got distinguished we're proud boys became this evil group of people and and an tyfa is the good group of people now I understand that proud boy proud boys were infiltrated by like nationalists yes Nazi white supremacist whatever it is but those were constantly being disavowed by Gavin Gavin never wanted any of that happening but is there wow you get in though here's the question because this is my you saw my last comedy special this is my criticism about vegans it's not that they're that's anything wrong with being a vegan right when you have a group where anybody can join you're gonna get a certain amount of fucking idiots right if you have a million people for sure you have a hundred thousand fucking idiots there's no getting around that yeah so if you have a group where anybody can join and you have a million people in that group you're gonna have a hundred thousand fuckin it fucking idiots and those people are going to define your group the worst behavior in the group is where people are gonna call to as an example that's it I think this is also a symptom of the so from media era today especially with Twitter because you can't express yourself and explain things 140 or 280 characters it just takes too much time so they can say oh proud boys racist scumbag Nazi that's a Gavin and there are always a racist scumbag Nazi yeah and all sudden that's the narrative and everybody keeps pushing it and that's the videos of people punching little skinny people oh look at these people they beat up the ante fuck yeah fucking assholes and Gavin's an asshole yeah that's that's what it comes down to I've seen it presented well you ask how it starts and how it grows and how you become a member by buying a fucking shirt that's by buying a Perry Ellis shirt and opening a chapter dude there are chapters worldwide you see it it's like here's the be proud boys Australia here's the probability's England proud boys fucking Japan like it's everywhere and it never was supposed to get to that point and regardless of how these people act it now reflects on Gavin even though he wanted to hang out in a bar with a few people do his public speaking without being hassled and that's it and and I see the way the media manipulates things I've been party to it myself and I've seen Gavin presented in photos where you look and go holy fuck its Hitler like like they get him there's one picture Gavin that I was petrified by he's got his arms folded he's got a scowl on his face that hair you know the short on the side long on the top and he's looking like like he's angry and I'm like that that's not the guy that him and his wife who's american-indian by the way his wives American India he's got beautiful kids that come over my house and use the pool and we hang out and barbecue I'm like that's not that guy yeah no one knows that guy from the paper they're getting this impression he's a really nice guy he's generous just a really cool guy to hang out with and what you see them do in the media is just crazy especially when you know he didn't invent some goddamn Nazi group he was just trying to have a little outrageous fun and it ran from him it got away from him [Applause]
