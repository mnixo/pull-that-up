hello freak bitches now the reason why that upsets me is because it grants people a false sense of security and hope you know Islam is wonderful but we need to attack this separate thing called Islamism well from day one 1400 years ago Islam was Islamism now that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element that doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice a spiritual part but there is no set of doctrines in a separate book called radicalized Islamism it all comes from the same text it comes from the Quran it comes from the hadith and it comes from the serie the biography of Muhammad so so this kind of false narrative that people are promulgating so that they seem as though they're not frontally attacking the religion while laudable while nice I get that reflux it's false and so again to go back to our point of talking honestly we need to talk honestly there is only Islam some people choose to practice it fully some people choose to ignore the ugly part but there is no such thing as Islamism Islamism is part of Islam now you're a person that goes out of your way to say no we're not talking about the kind sweet Islamic people they just want to raise their children now so how do you sort of manage those two ideas that they're the same like when the term radical Islam gets thrown around right so radical Islam simply means I really take my Islam seriously right it's close but let's draw us a silly analogy if I don't eat pork my radical Jew or am i a Jew right now I happen to be Jewish I simply ignore the kosher edict that says don't eat pork that why do you do that though because in my case I simply identify as Jewish in the sense that Judaism is a multi attribute identity it includes a shared history shared lineage ish kind of a race it's what some could argue it's a race so it's considered in a lot of people's ideas so I could still in the same way that you might identify it's coming from Boston and there's shared history from all people who grew up around the time that you grew up in Boston and there is a sense of affiliation and tribalism with that reality being Jewish as far as I'm concerned and for most Jews is exactly that we don't necessarily take the religious elements very seriously now that doesn't mean that we are practicing a light Judaism or non radical Judaism we're simply ignoring those parts of Judaism that we choose to ignore so there is no such thing as radical Islam there are no books called radical Islam there is a set of doctrines called Islam and then I could do what's called cafeteria Islam which is I pick and choose the parts that I wish to adhere to so again the discourse is a false narrative I understand the reason for it because people find it rather gauche to attack frontally religion at least that Islam so they have to I call this the the ISM magic you wrist it right you add ISM for something it makes it bad Islam is good Islamism is bad if that's a that's a characteristic that I see in almost everybody that I respect they all think that everything they do sucks or at least they have very very high standards and an often disappointed by their own work well you know I think I have some of that but I also have that idea of like it's something that my thought I don't I talked about my dad with you but um he was my wrestling coach in high school he was also my resilence biology and environmental studies teacher really is my teacher what a drag went to school your dad's being the t doesn't fuck it but I learned a lot because he was no joke he didn't pull any punches for me he you know he drilled me as hard if not harder than his other students he didn't show any favoritism but one of the things it was always this thing on the mat and I'm kind of paraphrasing but basically you you either win or you learn especially in that high school college setting you're you're learning about yourself if you if you went out there and you got your ass handed to you then you just got beat and didn't learn anything well yeah you're a fucking loser you take the moment reflect on it build on what you did wrong and you now you're actually in a way you've won if now you know more about yourself you know but more your your limitations or what you need to improve and expand your talents or your limitations so I guess whenever I'm doing a thing I'm always looking at it from a learning perspective so there aren't necessarily mistakes unless they're fatal and then you wouldn't know anyway so whatever that really is the right way to look at everything you win or you learn yeah you know you have great experiences because you're successful or you have very beneficial experiences because you realized what went wrong yeah but you just one more wrinkle one more piece of information or one more experience that you can add to your database of knowledge and it'll make you better at everything video so that in a lot of ways that's my biggest frustration in life is when there is something that kind of goes wrong and I can't figure out what it was mmm that's frustrating for me because I can't I can't build on I can't learn from it but I don't understand what what went wrong what does a relationship or whether it's something I tried to build or something I did or how often does that happen ah a lot you know I you know there's a couple of times I've actually had an opportunity to do a vocal with somebody else as a guest singer and I think you know rehearsal was great and then you blew it you mean for the main event and I'm like what did I do wrong I did everything the same and until you can actually pinpoint that and figure out what it was I'm a fucking mess like I'm sleepy I'm waking up in the middle of the night trying to figure out what the fuck went wrong and then when you're done with that you've got to figure out a way to get that thing from dead deer to meat and all the other things so yeah it's just so complex how would you ever expect somebody just to be have like a desire you were like that at some point we can well Rinella open the door for me and if you ever tell to have yeah that right super lucky forever grateful because when he took me into a wild back country Montana you got gear the nuts the first videos it was very bright in the Missouri Breaks in October 9 degrees out freezing your dick off every night in a tent but like life will Stephen that's kind of what he loves it he loves suffering he loves it but I love that he loves it he's as legit as they come he really is not I think that's it right there is just this there's this big gap and my father got me into it but my brother doesn't doesn't hunt and but he has respect for and understands what's going on but he just I think at the time I was introduced to hunting my brother was more interested in going out with his friends and Saturday mornings were not for getting up early and and so we're essentially the same person but I just went this way and he didn't go that way right so it's a weird so he could be in the same house with somebody in two out a different way well renown has a real good way of looking at - he's like I don't expect people to go out and get rid of their own sewage why should I expect them to go out and hunt their own food like you don't have to well and he's I think he probably said this at some point or somebody smart did it was like I choose I believe it I choose - for me to be the one thing that I grabbed ahold of to bring into my to my skill set right I don't knit my own clothes I don't I don't make my own shoes I don't build my own houses you know we were just looking at some construction stuff a little bit earlier I'm like do I what yeah what are they doing what are they doing yeah I couldn't do that I just picked this one thing because it's also part of my passion so you couldn't just ask someone who's a construction worker to go like go hunt get some meat I know you have a desire for that so that's just another hard part about hunting and non-hunters by proxy are essential to hunting always an industry and opinion and because we could legislate ourselves out of being able to hunt that could happen money is a privilege man that's not it right that's in a lot of ways and so that's another whole nother can of worms but it could it could go away yeah I think the issue is that so many people are opposed to it because they're so removed from the realities of the wild and they just feel some sort of moral superiority by either not eating meat entirely or by not killing their own meat they're not killing their own meat is really ridiculous like my wife was having a conversation with someone they were out to dinner with a bunch of people while I was on elk hunt and the guy was eating a steak it got from England in England the Nohant or they do haunt these like foxes and horses and shit they were like tweed yeah pussies okay sorry England we love these guys carving a stink and my wife goes oh he's actually out elk hunting and the guy goes he hunts that's deplorable the guy said did supportable while he's carving a steak I was saying something the other day like and I got I got a lot of like we're looking at me like I was weird at work one of my buddies at work was eating a chicken sandwich that from chick-fil-a and I look on the bag and there's a cartoon chicken on the bag and in my mind I'm like that's like building a swimming pool by the lake it's nothing weird in irony that that we're like saying hey I'm eating the chicken but here's a cartoon version of it so we can celebrate the fact that we just murder this chicken and we fried it up like that doesn't make sense like a swimming pool with a lake that's mark which is Paris the rive rait wearing off [Laughter] you
