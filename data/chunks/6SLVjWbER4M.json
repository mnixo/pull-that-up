what's up Melissa how are you hello Joe we were just talking about caning and hanging in Singapore hanging now is that the new one no it's always caning is one of the forms of capital punishment but they still they actually hang for drugs what is Singapore like I've never been it seems like a strange place because it's relatively wealthy right yes upscale and very nice but also ruthless but you know what happened in like my generation I've witnessed it go from third world first of all in my lifetime really yeah yeah so it's one of those success stories of nation-building but it's it's kind of like you know those snow globes the perfect snow globes yeah yeah when you like turn it over and like everything kind of sprinkles that's what it feels like living in Singapore for me at least I I had to get out it's just it's a bit sterile it's perfect but it's too perfect it's almost like there's a somebody called it once Disneyland with the death penalty which is a pretty good and you get the death penalty for things like drugs right just possession past like maybe 25 grams or 25 milligrams or something marijuana trafficking so if you have an ounce of marijuana how many grams is the conversion I don't know I haven't converted it to 20 your sister 28 grams in an ounce so like that an ounce is a good amount of weed but 2 ounces of weed you're dead yep yeah my hanging Oh 2 ounces wow that's that's weird you can go down the street and buy that at a store yeah I used to show your driver's license oh you're over 21 and you buy that a store and it's Singapore they'll kill you for it how many people have they killed for pot I I don't I don't know about that but I do know like one time they actually executed a Australian citizen who was on transit so he didn't even get all the airport he was just kind of carrying the drugs on transit well to whom oh yeah I was hanging it's always hanging and what would do you remember what kind of it was he selling drugs he I he was carrying quite a bit he was definitely trafficking it Jesus Christ yep zero zero tolerance policy yeah that's great how did it go from third world to first world so quickly I guess the founder you know the country well now the founder of the founding prime minister mr. Lee Kuan Yew was probably one of the world's most famous modern statesmen he he was resolute like you know weeded out corruption he was kind of like very very tight controls on free speech but very much sort of neoliberal economic policies so attract a lot of foreign investment right because the highest income tax bracket is like maybe 13 percent it's very low there's almost no welfare at least in the sense of how we understand welfare but there's a lot of it's a hybrid system so there's there's a lot of like zero capital gains taxes zero state taxes very easy to set up a business so he managed to attract a lot of foreign businesses to set up their multinational corporation headquarters in Asia because the other alternative would be maybe China mm-hmm but China would probably end up stealing all your you know your your corporate secrets your intellectual property but Singapore's build us this is the country that protects rule of law also English he kind of made everybody speak English was the working language so if you want to do set up business in Asia that was your place to go you got a like you know if you if you want to try investment you say okay what's in mine what's in my region and how can I be how can I have a competitive advantage so that was that was how Singapore really developed and you know just gained a lot of traction as a state the average American knows Singapore because that kid that got caned now it's that stupid movie which movie crazy o crazy rich Asians right right yeah I never saw that was it good uh I didn't like it cuz I don't like rom-coms oh and like come on the premise is like a girl an American Asian girl is like dating this guy from Singapore he she doesn't know he's rich and she finds out on the plane there it's like the most bullshit things it's just conspicuous consumption I mean it's it's got some you know the city looks beautiful and in fact I kind of grew up with some people that that lived that lifestyle but I just don't like that kind of Moody it's it's it's a chick a chick flick got it you're not into chick flex your Instagram is hilarious by the way that's very Twitter your Twitter okay I get them confused sometimes your Twitter feed is really good it's it's both insightful but also very funny yeah I try to play both sides but the problem is like you know I think I think today there's a bit of a if you're if you're a girl and you're you're kind of funny there there's a bit of a sense that like people really take you that seriously so I've been told to tone down on jokes who's telling you that well I'm also you know I run I run this major nonprofit organization and I won't tell anybody what it is or keep it on the down-low no it's a it's it's a really well it's kind of right up your Elliot you know it's it's a organization that that really tries to promote pluralistic thinking and and you know basically exporting ideas to the part of the world that it's often censored and and you have narratives that are just not you know not exposed to people are not exposed to the Middle East so you know we thought you know we spent like what eight trillion dollars on the war on terror and what was the results right like we we marched in and say okay we're gonna bring freedom and democracy to people but if there were no cultural institutions to kind of nudge people to understand why they should value freedom and democracy is it really a surprise that it failed to take root there so that's what you know we basically the organization's call ideas Beyond Borders and it's kind of self-explanatory you know we basically take acquire the rights to books that are not available there translate them into Arabic for free and then we just like load it up on the library site anyone can basically access that and download it and we do Wikipedia - so like 10% of all Wikipedia it's an Arabic English Wikipedia mmm and so we basically try to you know like for example George Orwell doesn't exist in Arabic alright so like if you look it up would you even understand what the word normally means right yes so how did you get involved in this um my co-founder is Iraqi refugee and he grew up under Saddam and it's it's I met him when I was in grad school and I was really compelled by what he was talking about you know just like somebody who grew up in Singapore - we don't really have freedom of speech right so the issue was that like for me I just felt like growing up I was not I was kind of like all right you know what my issue is felt like there was no freedom of thought freedom of speech in Singapore the government just kind of controlled everything sorry my heart rate was like so high cuz super drinking this stuff is that what it is thank ya I was worried that you were nervous called Bank how many do you have my second one you a eight pounds the fuck are you doing you're so tiny this is so much are you gonna I know I know you're gonna be the first person to die in the show no no please don't sorry I mean this stuff is like caffeine I'm fuckin with it sorry my second one I have second ones of those you you probably weigh like 80 pounds so like seriously I'm fine come on right but you're very small that is a lot also heating me up right now sorry yeah your heart rates great I know I can feel it it's like I can see words I don't know it's it's getting crazy sorry sorry better just take some deep breaths time yourself down I know did you drink that to get pumped up for the show I this is my pre-workout so when I when I did my morning workout I drank one and then I was like you know what I didn't really sleep that much last night so I might need another oh my god yeah sorry I've had people come in here that are on adderall and that's always the weirdest one because you just like you gotta slow down like we're on different paces not you I need a downer I definitely need a downer spot but pot doesn't work on me oh right what kind of bot any I bet the pot we have a work on you up to 50 I've done 55 milligrams edibles that's ridiculously low I do 200 every time we go to the airport yes okay but I'm like Joey mm all right maybe I just haven't got my game yet you can't say pot doesn't work on you okay but I I so far have been unable to respond to really yep mmm in smoking it or eating it or both both Jamie is with you with the eating he's got some weird genetic disorder that doesn't it doesn't work with him like edible he can take a thousand edibles and just hang around people yeah but so that's a thing like people are immune some people are you see it that's not some people get withdrawals too you know I've talked to people that get actual physical withdrawals from marijuana and I used to be really skeptical about that but these are people that I actually trust and they're like wow I would you know when they would go on tour like if they have to go places and they didn't have pot they would get literally they'd get shaky they feel weird and then they realize that oh this is my body's withdrawing from THC apparently it's very rare but common enough so that it's in the literature they really they've documented people that have like a physical response to withdrawing from marijuana yeah I'm I'm I mean I'm looking forward to more research being done on this stuff anyway yes yeah we're headed there yes yeah but then Trump recently said something about trying to I know I'm surprised he was comparing the way they handled drug dealers in China with Swift fair trial yeah did he was he saying Singapore no but but that's how they do in Singapore with Swift fair trial and the death penalty is what he said there's a resurgence of this in Asia you see it in the Philippines as well so yeah 30 days has this extrajudicial drug war that he's been launching so it's I understand the concern with the plight I understand that people are really worried that people getting addicted to drugs ruin their lives the devastates families people dying of overdoses from fentanyl and all these different hazards that are associated with drug use and drug drug dealing I understand that but this sort of archaic way of handling it and death penalty talk in 2020 I know like it's and in one country completely decriminalized all drugs right was a Portugal yeah yeah the results low everything lower incidence of HIV infection lower drug addiction lowered overdoses lower everything lower crime rate I just don't it's just messy it's not like if there was one thing you could do okay if we do this thing then no one gets addicted to drugs and no one dies from overdoses well then you do that thing but there is metal Equalization no one would they certainly would though people definitely will die of overdoses if you make drugs legal across-the-board the one thing that you do that's good is you stop all the flow of money into illegal drug sales so all the people that are selling Dror most of it at least all the cartel money all that stuff goes away because the cartels are making billions and billions of dollars selling to the United States and other countries in itself to and they're doing it because it's illegal because it's a business they can capitalize on that American businesses are not capitalizing on and violence goes down term assuming there's a correlation there's if you go back to what happened in the United States during Prohibition what it did is pop up organized crime it propped up organized crime and a pretty spectacular way and it was because there was a massive amount of money to be made selling alcohol the desire for alcohol didn't go away the legality of it went away right so illegal sales went through the roof and the people that were selling it were criminals I just think it's part of the human spirit you know that if you say you can't have something yes we'll just there's an old Arabic proverb that which is prohibited it's always wanted yeah and whatever you you kind of like you just drive it underground if you if you try to manage it's the whole spirit of a punk-rock of like fu to the system and that just lies in almost you know every human heart we actually see that with our books for example you know a lot of books are actually like transmitted on these telegram groups in Arabic hmm looks like that sam harris writes you know richard dawkins these kinds of ideas that are really super censored and in the middle east so you you know that's kind of the gap that we're trying to plug right now it's that since books are not available in that language it's you know i think there's this crazy statistic more books are translated between english and spanish and one year then english in arabic in a thousand years wow it's kind of crazy that this kind of crazy so the exposure to those ideas yeah exactly yeah right the only other options get these people to learn english which is far more difficult time of course of course and and you know your your average person living in say syrian refugee camp isn't going to learn that quickly right you wanna meet people where they are right so i think the statistic when we first started 10 percent of english wikipedia what's actually in arabic which means that every time like for example let's say you you're like oh jamie go google this right and and and you expect an answer it's just it's just at the tip of her fingertips it's so it's so baked into modern life now we don't even like think twice about it but imagine if like you live in i don't know say saudi arabia and like okay let's just google it 10 out of every 10 times one time there's no answer because the page doesn't exists or you know it's just the word feminism doesn't exist in arabic so you can't look at what secularism doesn't exist it's kind of its how do you expect people to to kind of break out of their of their mindset of their indoctrination you know and it's it's not we're not saying like this is a top-down thing what you have to read this it's that i just want to live in a world where being ignorant is a choice for everyone because because there's a choice for us like let's say like we no way now you're like dumb and just just like basically you spend your nights watching The Bachelor or like you know whatever it is it's like I'm most amenable I do too I do but I know I'm judging but I know it's listen it's they also are into interesting things but I know some people do consume mindless non so my friend cam exclusive calling you shaming him yeah you know you know you watch that shit which one the female bachelorettes Oh God I only know that's still going on because I'm at the checkout line in the supermarket like why is that they're like it's so strange that people are even interested in that I know it's no it's a weird thing very weird thing yes that ignorant would be a choice would be nice right yeah so so what you're saying is that these part parts of the world one of the problems of getting them to shift their perception of the world is that they're not exposed to all the great works they're not exposed to the different ideas different ideas in different different debates and they have a monoculture so monoculture because of you know society is they have religions they have ways of life that are just so deeply entrenched right and then you also have a really really heavy censorship both from your authoritarian government and also from your religion mm-hm you know the first word for example the first word in the Quran is actually read really but they really mean just read this one thing and you know just the the sort of like the habits of a free mind are not really cultivated and also when you're taught I mean growing up not to question things and in part I understand because I think when you grew up in an Asian household with like you know tiger parents there's this sense of like you don't question my authority you know so it permeates culture from a very very young age and imagine like if you kind of grow up in that environment you're going to internalize all those things and that's why it kind of you know it follows you over time so when you were in school you're taught no questions is this yeah it's not like here it is like there's no such thing as a stupid question Chad there are in Asia there's different stupid questions over here - but you're told you're at least told that we're given Chad a break but I understand what you're saying and that must be really interesting for you to go from this one fairly restrictive environment to a fairly open environment correct and did that shift that happened in new and being exposed to all these different I did that spark this desire to help other people sort of expand their their their ideas and what they're exposed to yeah because well I felt like a fish out of water we're gonna Singapore I was always the person that like the teachers had a call like you know your daughter's asking too many questions she's disrupting the class what kind of questions all right I went to Sunday school to I was like I was that kid who was just like you know excuse me but why why do the dinosaurs what why is in the Bible that the dinosaurs and and and human beings walked you know basically like days apart when like we know from science that you know it was millions of years and fossils is about you of course of course yeah no I did we're like just keep her out of we just rather her not come to Sunday school really yeah yeah no answers there was no one that tried to like sort it through and say listen must be that God was testing people and this is why that's what my mom would say really but in classic it's just you know it's how there's no there's no culture of dialectics of of having dialogue and and and we're finding our positions is that it comes from authority right this is a very Confucian culture so it's like well I am your teacher so it is the way it is right and okay that's one level of it and if you say grew up in the Middle East asking a question could be death right if you if you even remotely like Satan Saudi Arabia especially remotely reveal that you might be having atheistic thoughts that's deaths was like we're talking about different scales and degrees of censorship and consequences for that and I think when I met my co-founder Faisal you know I was like okay I guess I have I had issues with the country I grew up in but for him it was he ended up almost being killed by al-qaeda for just like starting a blog talking about you know the importance of secularism and and countering violent extremism really yeah that's how he came here is their refugee so I'm like oh shit maybe they are you know how did he almost get killed by al-qaeda uh well cuz when when the u.s. invaded Baghdad and he was living in Baghdad at the time and al-qaeda took over his neighborhood once that was avoided said almost ousted right and he was kind of like you know roaming around and like telling kind of telling the US Army certain things like okay you know like this is where al-qaeda is Lisa's cellmate my friend here it has been like radicalized hmm and all kind of new they put him on a hit list you know because he was not sympathetic to their cause and so he ended up on the deathless his brother was killed just horrible story Bridget I she recently interviewed him on the podcast and and I get the sense that like oh shit like the consequence of saying what you think there is like at least in my case was just like hey maybe I might go to jail in Singapore well but in Iraq it was death I think it's hard for people in America to really grasp what that environment must be like because we're so accustomed to this idea of freedom of speech and it's so engrained yes it's so engrained yeah rebels are appreciated and tolerated here you know they're rewarded yeah it's the whole maverick thing I think you know as long as America still can celebrate Mavericks and tolerance not just tolerate them but actually celebrate them yeah we're we're gonna be fine right yeah hopefully hopefully the thing is that if it exists the way it exists in other parts of the world it can exist like that here like the worst cases of human behavior when you see you know any form of dictatorship or control or propaganda or controlled by the state or by industry that stuff that you see in other countries is human beings in 2020 I mean are we would like to think that our Constitution bill of rights and all of our ideals and what this country was founded on is going to keep it from deteriorating like that and most likely it will but the reality is those people in Iraq are human beings in 2020 and they're living in a completely different way than we're living right now at the st. on the same timeline because things did not go well there and they're stuck in this horrible situation where they are controlled by these religious fanatics and they are stuck and there's not a lot that they can do other than escape right and you know right now also like with the rise of China they're also you know starting to like basically some form of like electronic tyranny right they're able to just really censor the internet in the way that's been done president it you can't access Facebook Wikipedia it's what none of it none of these things that you and you and I can just like open on our our apps can be accessed in China so the way they just like control information and now exporting those same tools to other authoritarian countries or in the world is that part to me is dangerous because you know I think both basil and I came to America with this like alright this is the place that we can finally be ourselves and think for ourselves right yeah and we're starting to see that the whole world seems to be kind of going in the other direction did so there was a shift in China and the shift was it was initially a completely communist Society and now capitalism at least in a monetary sense is embraced yes so this is giant shift in what China actually is which corresponds to this huge growth is it possible that in the future this shift could move on to other aspects of Chinese culture like discourse or the way they view the government or even some form of democracy that was what we expected that's what we expected that was the theory but but the way China has behaved now you know they call it socialism with Chinese characteristics that's the official name of this long-drawn game - you know Institute market reforms uh sure in riches for the for the middle class lifts a lot of people out of poverty but in a very controlled way in the way that's like see that's the thing about like Asian culture people understand it's that the there's a fundamental difference between the China dream and the American dream right and si Jinping is outlined what he thinks is the China dream it's it's it's basically a top-down way to - it's a goal to national goal and and basically what they're trying to say is that okay we're gonna lift a lot of people out of poverty but you have to your generation has to make sacrifices it's not about the individual it's about building a strong China and implicitly also about you know ensuring that the CCP stays in power the Chinese Communist Party stays in power but it's it's that you might have to give up you know personal sacrifices for the sake of China versus the American Dream is is bottom up it's about your right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that's it and if you do that that's the American dream and if you achieve a certain level of happiness you achieve you know it's all like it's bottom-up it's not it's not centralized and it's not something that the Chinese government is kind of trying to stuff down your throat and China's willing to play the long game so it is still a Leninist Lennis Marxist government see Qing think still believes in all of that that's why it's all sorts of Tala terian but it's you know they know that like the way to get game power in the world is to get rich and they did it on some you know on the backs of on the back of trade with other countries through very unfair practices actually in many cases so if you think about like how they I think there's there are a lot of estimates of how much they've actually stolen from the United States in terms of intellectual property corporate corporate espionage now even like academia is being infected so how so it was arrested the head of the chemistry department at Harvard oh that's right yeah but wasn't that they didn't they think that that guy was in connection with some weaponized virus yeah no no I admit I didn't think about something else there was an article linking some Canadian researchers to the virus no but this was this was differently how the chemistry department and Harvard was found to have lied about receiving money from the Chinese government so there's this program from a thousand talents program in China basically they're offering a lot of money the New York Times did a really good expose you'll miss them they basically offer money to like academic cuz you know it's kind of sucks to be one here in this end so flake you're not paid that well but China's dangling like a lot more money and okay view if you do research here in China there's going to be like less bureaucracy so that's their way to lure these people in so he was hiding the fact that he was getting income for me okay how was he hiding it he just he didn't report it Oh and anyway right and so at the end the day when when you do when there's a relationship they're trying to own your research right if you're researching something sensitive that's a big issue there was an article today where they've confirmed that Huawei has some sort of third party backdoor with a lot of their electronics yeah there was a lot of speculation so why the United States was banning Huawei from the major providers from you know because they were very close to releasing some and they have some amazing phones and they were really crazy to use them yeah yeah just on principle in fact like one of my girlfriend she's kind of sponsored by iWay she's European wanted to take a selfie of me and I was like I am there's no way that my face could ever be you know in your phone really that tell me why like what is what are your thoughts on it oh wow way is is really another just apparatus of the the main party the government and you know I I really think that Huawei is with respect to the next era of the digital world is the next Sputnik like it is the Sputnik issue of our time and we should be doing everything we can to to to not allow our way to you know have this big market share and the person who started it was somebody that had a lot of party connections to to the I think it was in general or something and it's really they really operate in a way that's very opaque and you know anyone doing business in China will have to have connections to the government especially when you're that big and because it's it's a government that has such totalitarian control over everything you can expect that that whatever information or that they would have to answer to the government whatever the government wants if you're willing to put your privacy in the hands of an entity like that you know go ahead but know also that the Chinese government has enacted all these mass surveillance policies it's I just wouldn't trust I just want to trust them so what is different between Huawei and there's many Chinese manufacturers of cell phones and we shall me yeah it's it's the it's the government connection is the only one that has that deep government connection well though the founder at least was general that much I know um and just a lot of party connections and you know just it's also heavily subsidized by the government which is one of the ways that China has been competing kind of unfairly in global markets right whether you have you can drive out innovation in the United States by by making sure that your local version is so competitive from prices that they can't match you so in a way it's like a form of economic warfare which is one of the the issues that Trump is really pushed back on it's the China trade issue mm-hmm and he's been criticized by about that do you think he's correct on China yes on China yes I do think he's correct he's been pushed back on it's interesting because I think the Democrats were a lot more you know protectionist when it came to trade right there the Republicans and the libertarians always like free trade free trade everything like you know let's globalized the world where was the whole Thomas Friedman position when he wrote about it in Lexus and the olive tree that if we globalized the world that economic that you're at you lift a lot of people out of poverty or your economic pie grows but your politics shrink that was idea right no two countries that have McDonald's would fight a war or something like that that was his theory hmm and in the case of China obviously that didn't happen right like the part about the politics changing it was a quote by a Hanuman protester he said if the free world hasn't changed China China will change the free world whoa and if you think about what happened with the NBA yeah the whole daryl morey yeah explain that because that was shocking to me because the way they were capitulating to China I was you know I was a little stunned because it was so open yeah and can you explain what happened so Daryl Morey who was the GM of the Houston Rockets he tweeted out basically a little picture that that showed that he supported the Hong Kong protesters and the Hong Kong protesters have been added since July of last year 2019 they have been protesting the incursion of Chinese control into their supposedly autonomous region China promised them that there would be two systems one country two systems after the handover in 1997 from the British to two to China they slowly kind of eroded that in many ways and their freedoms have been kind of you know diminishing over time the straw the straw that broke the camel's back was actually this policy that they passed this law they passed that said that anyone can be extradited to China for trials basically it was after a case that happened the criminal case and the Hong Kong people knew that this law if it goes in effect basically gives the Chinese government legal right to disappear kidnap anyone and bring them for trial in some sort of Kangaroo or show trial in in in China and that has happened so booksellers it's always the booksellers in Hong Kong have been kidnapped because they were publishing these lights inside her accounts like dirty secrets of the you know the CCP whenever there was a leak because the the Chinese Communist Party's huge the political euro was huge and so there was a book seller called causeway books and they were publishing all these like accounts from within the Chinese Communist Party and the owner of that bookshop one day just disappeared he ended up in China I was basically a forced kidnapping and he he was released I think he was you know he did his jail time and now he's sending up another book book shopping with Taiwan but but that law basically would just have allowed China to do that legally this time so the Hong Kong youth were up in arms they you know they were tired of all their the ways that their way of life had changed since the British had handed it over and you know in a way they were kind of pining for the good old times the good old times when they were under a colonial you know an English colonial master which was one of those like moment for anyone on the left and so Daryl Morey tweeted this out and of course you know how big the the China market is for the NBA right like all these players have contracts with them in fact the Houston Rockets hit a lot of contracts with the Chinese CCTV for broadcasts they also had like merchandising opportunities sneakers that were made there and that caused a huge huge outcry in China they were just like oh he's disrespecting us and they were able to force him to basically make a groveling tweet that's it I'm sorry for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people and then like all the other some NBA players actually came out and and you know kind of took the side of the Chinese government like oh wait who are we to you know they kind of like did this backpedal thing when when they're so strong on other forms of activism here like when the NBA when it came to the North Carolina the bathroom bill you remember like the channel they were they were always on the side of the woke but then when it came to the China Hong Kong issue they stood with the biggest oppressor yeah it's always hard when someone does side on the woke like what do you are you doing this because you think this or are you doing this because you think it'll make people think more highly of you if you do it it's such a contrived thing today it's so difficult to figure out why people are acting the way they're acting so when they were acting in that way it was so transparent it was there was no Avenger votes about it like they were pressured and they were worried about the money they were worried about economic you know yeah whatever fallout yeah whatever fall will happen right it was really obvious it was like whoa this is not like trans people using the bathroom this is like you guys are threatened right exactly yeah but the number of companies that have count out to China's you know orthodoxy is there should be a list somebody should be keeping track of all of this they're companies like Marriott even like luxury brands so I think Versace or Dolce & Gabbana got in trouble because I think on the website they list it like countries that were in and it was like they put Hong Kong Macau and Taiwan and China said no no no wait what are you doing this is all China right if you don't change that website you're not going to be allowed to do business and everyone wants a share of the Chinese market that's the problem it's like the biggest market in the world maybe India's bigger but well at least in the future India will get bigger but everyone wants access to Chinese market so so they're able to use that as leverage to basically bully companies even movie execs to produce the content they want so several I think World War Z was affected you know the other movie was Doctor Strange the Marvel movie where the character played by Tilda Swinton was supposed to be a team and monk but you can't like Tibet is this like hot-button issue for China right like people have been fighting for independence for a while the Dalai Lama was exiled so they changed the character it wasn't a Tibetan monk it was this they changed it to a Celtic monk and they made it to be a woman playing the character instead to appease the Chinese government so they they changed it in the American version as well yeah so that woman well American version is right because the studio is they're all going in on these deals with China China's financing all these movies now Wow so that woman in dr. strange was initially supposed to be a Tibetan monk Wow yeah but they check they rewrote it to reflect a celtic celtic female monk yeah well and then I think the recent the the Top Gun movie that's coming out with Tom Cruise - partially financed by China and they have these like his jacket people noticed that there was a patch that was like missing and it turns out like that patch it was like a for some reason China was just triggered by it and it was gone just in the costume this is it yes it was the problem it was Japanese fire that's the time when he's like yeah the USS Galveston see it Wow but but that that's what that's what makes it so scary that they're able to pressure people to change their behavior from afar without no bullets this is just money money access so many whores that's why I think like one of the solutions to this is to really like start I know somebody should really start a website maybe me me so just track all this stuff all the companies that have kept our Kyle Tao into China all the ones we're standing the ground you know and so you can decide where to put your money so it's just a giant part of the market that's the problem with these films it's like it's probably the top gun over in China first of all China invests and then they sell those movies over there and they're it's an enormous part of their overall budget right what largest the in terms of the box office the outside of the United States the second largest market is China the third one is Japan and it's it's a crazy one-fifth of China basically so it's not nowhere it nowhere close and you know we're all driven by profits it's capitalism I think they try to get Quentin Tarantino to change his movie for China I told him to go pound saying I think so I remember yeah the new one yeah well yeah but so it's weird that it's not easy just just throw some money around and people change their culture right I mean Google was developing a search engine for China you know they well I knew some people at Google while that was going on and their their position was if we don't do this they're gonna copy our search engine and just steal all the intellectual property or we can work with them and provide a censored version of Google and I remember sitting there going this is almost like legalizing drugs like it's messy there's no good way here this is they're both they both suck like well it sucks if they steal you know the intellectual copyright if they they steal the ideas and create their own version of Google it also sucks if Google goes over there and self censors right and provides them with you know the ability to filter out information but I I think also that if there's also an argument that if it was Google at least maybe they have one tentacle in China and so therefore it might be able to change things or keep a pulse and you know have their pulse on something there's the argument well this they blocked huawei or it shouldn't say at least but it's interesting that they blocked Huawei from using all their apps so Huawei no longer has apps they didn't have no no longer have access to the Google Play Store so they're their new phones they have to have their own apps yes this is with the the mate yeah it's p40 this is what it's called their newest latest flagship phone then they can't they don't have access anymore there's some some apps you can side load from the web and you can download them directly to your phone but for the most part their access to the Google Play Store is completely shut off so the thousands and thousands of apps that feel like if you want if you for a lot of people apps or everything it's not the film itself it's the apps if you don't have Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and you know whatever the you know equivalents are in different countries you kind of shit out a lot I think reciprocity is a good policy to abide by right so like if China can influence us if you want because the Chinese they always use the their market as you look we'll shut you out of our market if you don't do this well we should be doing the same right which i think is what Trump had tried to do with the tariffs we're gonna shut you out of a market we're going to penalize you yeah unless you open up some things you've been you know there and unfair trade practices for a while it's hard for us to understand what's really going on because you know the news will show this anecdotal story of a farmer who's upset because there's you know he's losing money because it Trump's tariffs and then people go oh tariffs bad man you know I think it's a to have a really comprehensive view of it it's gonna take a lot of studying you're gonna have to dive deep and really try to understand the economics behind it all and I think most people aren't willing to do that so we get sort of sold a narrative on the news I think the same thing happened with like sort of so-called like industries that were important on national security like steel you know yeah those are things that we want to be careful how much we actually do outsourced to overseas because there might come a time when we'll need those you know I mean what happens if you globalized to the point that China's producing all your steel and then we have a war and where it's all steel gonna come from it's just so easy to be cut off he's really worried about a hot war um we're definitely in the in a cold war right now with China yeah feels but you know China does have military ambitions I mean the their actions in the South China Sea have shown that they do want to be at least militarily strong they haven't you know to their credit having taken any they didn't go into Hong Kong with tanks or anything right so no bloodshed on that account yet but it's one of those things also that in 2047 Hong Kong is going to return to China fully anyway so they're willingly yeah 20:48 cuz the handover was only like four or fifty years before this is just the transition so mmm the long game belongs to China and they know that you know that this is not good it's not it's not and there's no hope in your eyes of China eventually becoming what they hoped it would be once capitalism was sort of introduced if people got information if there were ways to resist the encroaching tyranny especially digital tyranny right there in all forms so it's not just mass surveillance all this AI stuff they're there sort of like collecting people's uh like facial scams yeah it's it's this is such a dystopian nightmare it feels like it's like a science fiction film frankly if I don't know unless the Revolution kind of comes from within and now people woke up maybe it can be averted but otherwise we're just gonna you know it's going to be headed to it's as weird bipolar worlds where there's a new axis and a new allies that sucks that will suck that sucks already' you've seen like their you know Russia has taken us out of China Pakistan has taken to the other side of China now so they're all there there is a you know an alliance kind of forming you can see it in you know what happened with the UN passed this resolution condemning China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims in Sindh young yeah and the signatories to that to that bill that UN bill was basically United States New Zealand the Europe a lot of European powers the so-called you know like these are countries that are often accused of being Islamophobes because they won't accept Muslim refugees or that many Muslim refugees but you have Pakistan and even some you know majority of the Gulf countries siding with China defending China on on their treatment with with the Uighur Muslims in Sinjar and it's one of those things that's just like what how how is this happening you know it doesn't make sense does anybody have a roadmap of how they expect all this to play out because it seems that this this could be a real problem in the future and most Americans up until this whole the up until this trade issue with the Trump administration most Americans didn't even think about China I don't know I don't think I think Hong Kong with the I think that kind of lit you know the whole bear to seeing the hundreds of thousands people in the streets every day weeks after months really young people - yeah yeah I think that the thing that has kind of like descendant to police brutality like protests against police brutality now but he's still going on there still no and now with the whole chrono virus you know flaring up there it's it's highlighting a lot of issues with the with the Chinese government Taiwan is another issue still there the three T's you can't really talk about in China now Kahneman Tibet Taiwan these are three things that absolutely you know go now what year did you come over here how old were you 17 17 what was this shift like going from Singapore to the United States you live in New York then no no your your hometown right yeah yeah I lived in Boston for 10 years really enjoyed it actually Cole was fuck it no I like it I don't know I'm a skier sorry I really liked it but there was huge culture shock in a way I knew was signing up for I I chose Amer it's actually easier for Singaporeans a plug-and-play into any of the Commonwealth countries because it was a former British colony so all your credits would just transfer kind of more easily to University in England for example or Australia but I chose America precisely for the First Amendment real it's very it was a very strong motivating factor for me and also just the the culture of like we said celebrating weird people yes because I was weird so I wanted to be in a place where I thought I would be what made you weird so a Singapore is pretty conformist in terms of you talk about monocultures there there is a conformist right like there is the right schools you go to the right paths you take very entrenched and I really rebelled against that like you know Singapore chewing gum is banned right yeah I have chewing gum because it was banned in Singapore it's one of those things just like stuck in my mind I can't I grown up here I probably wouldn't be chewing this right now it wouldn't just wouldn't matter but when somebody says I can't like like do not touch wet paint like yeah this has always been a part of your personality for the time you were young yes it was this nature or nurture don't know I I don't know I raised him really but so when you came to America when you're 17 said yeah was that like yes it was but it was also there were a lot of culture shocks that I had to adapt to you know first artists it definitely felt like a bit of a step back for me in terms of how in terms of comfort of living like standard living the United States was kind of a third world country compared to Singapore really yeah what Boston though when I landed in Logan and we were taking that drive to you know like at the time I was gonna be living in Cambridge we win my underneath like highways I'm like it's rusting this was kind of like just like me before the Big Dig was done and the infrastructure was kind of broken the potholes your health care what the hell is up with that so with a step back in material comforts for me and in Singapore you know if you grew up even middle-class like the 50th percentile family can afford a domestic helper so many Singaporeans in fact ninety percent of all the kids I know growing up all grew up with maids picking up after them doing their laundry everything so Singapore is no minimum wage no minimum wage and so if you measure employment in that country it's it's in some economic measurements the way they do it it's almost like it's over employed you don't have an unemployment problem everybody has a job pretty much no minimum wage but what what how do people take be taken advantage how are people taking advantage because of that well that's why we just are on average low and that in Singapore they're not that height the United States practices what you call efficiency wages which is you know they they kind of pay people a little bit more to to extract a better performance right incentives matter right but in Singapore that's not the case but in Singapore the streets are taking care of better bridges oh the destruction you know I tweet a maybe like last week seeing something like especially now we're in like political debate season I'm so tired of this whole left-right argument like small government no big government government's a problem got a solution it's it's about effective government and I think that's something that the the same poor government had really perfected its its effective governance it's not about the size we're gonna I don't care whether this is a policy that came from the right or the left it's what works people respond to incentives right and if you want to encourage a certain kind of behavior you there's carrots and sticks to basically encourage that behavior and so it's there there are things that the government would do in a way that we just would never fly here where you you know we treasure civil liberties too much in a way which I personally came here for that reason but I'll give you a good example social cohesion is engineered in Singapore so there's it's a very very multicultural multi-ethnic society you have Malay Muslims Indians Hindus Chinese who are Buddhist Christians and you know cohesions all living in on an island city-state that's about five million in terms of population and how the government manages this multicultural project is that eighty percent of people actually live in public housing that's very high it's like a socialist thing right public housing the government builds for you and each block has to mimic the racial demographics of the whole country so you don't have ghettos right so imagine like a housing state that basically mirrors like okay if the total makeup of the country if 60% Chinese 20% Malay Muslims it has to follow so you can't have basically an area like Birmingham in the UK where all the Muslim immigrants or or you know something like Durban Michigan or Minnesota with all the Somali immigrants you are forced to integrate it's a it's a way to force people to integrate and have you know neighbors that are just not not your own kind and that's how they've created this like national identity that's very strong that's interesting because everybody would want that but they wouldn't want an engineered correct you know exactly everybody would love if the country if all of our neighborhoods integrated and everybody just got along with everybody I think I've always felt like that's one of the things in New York has a large advantage over Los Angeles is interaction people are constantly on the subway and walking on the streets with everybody of all different classes all different backgrounds and I think that's really good I think it's good - yeah it's the contact hypothesis right like if you like if kids grew up with leave you had a black friend growing up like since you were you know three four you you won't never inure you wouldn't everything to be racist like it's just one of those things it's like early contact with different people and it's the same with that's what I feel about ideas too early content with different ideas really helps and that's that's I don't know I kind of devoted my life to to that call it was almost you know Daryl Davis's yes of course I wrote about him yeah I was at that conference that that he was speaking at we were speaking at the same conference and that's the conference that Darrell Davis was called neo-nazi that someone called him a neo-nazi yeah yeah how do they how because we explain to people who he is if you didn't listen to the podcast that I did with a Darrell Davis as a musician and he was doing some shows at this country-western bar and met some people from the Klan and through just communicating with them and being friendly with them over a period of many months he got them to quit they quit the Klan on their own he didn't request it and then over the course of several years he's gotten more than 200 people to leave the Klan leave neo-nazi organizations and he they give him their robes and their flags and he brought them all in here and he's an inspirational human being very much so but he essentially was reinforcing what you were saying that these people were never around anyone like one of the guys that he met initially was saying I've never had a drink with a black man before and he's like how's that possible he's like I'm in the Klan and he's like I've never I've never had to drink with a black man and so he's like this is the first time ever having a drink with a black man and like making this big deal out of it and then eventually Darrell was going to his and eating dinner with them and hanging out with them and then and then the guys like I can't do this anymore like why am I on the clan when he quit Wow and he quit just from Daryl being this really friendly articulate brilliant guy who clearly didn't fit their narrative of what they thought they were racist depiction of what a black man is right right so the incident that happened was this group called missus Milwaukee had organized a conference called me what what missus missus yeah that was the name of the group but they were kind of like a secular so in the mythos just believe that Jesus Christ was a like he didn't really exist as a historical figure that's what a mythos is but in any case it is it's a secular group that put on a conference and we've been doing that for years and they had a long side you know people like sargon of akkad you know count dank euler the guy who taught his pug to do this yeah yeah so these people all came for a conference and so was Darrell Davis and you know it was it was a good it was a bunch of people but on on the spec on on on the political spectrum basically and it was about promoting discourse civil dialogue that kind of thing and Ino was there as well so basically because you know after when the conference was happening and and and Tifa kind of found out about it they started protesting the conference they they called the the comp the venue to basically you know get it cancelled they said it was a neo-nazi rally Klan really ironically you know the greatest irony was that that Gerald Davis was there and he got tainted as well so I started calling this the political one-drop rule where it's like kind of what happened to you if you are associating or talking to somebody that or just a whole range of people like normal distribution of people you will be tainted by the most right-wing person you know that you're in orbit with that's just how it goes and that's what happened to Darrell so when we we have the after party to the conference and Kiefer was gathered outside the bar the Pittman New Jersey people cast in pool was there it's the Pittman New Jersey people had police had to stationed themselves outside of the bar and you know they were kind of protecting this event it was it's it's ridiculous because you know yes you might find sergeant's politics objectionable but why is everybody who's associated we know what the conference also lumped in with this and why is the response that this needs police protection it's just we're just talking about it it doesn't make any sense no this desire to shut down speech is very dangerous and it's very stupid it's childish and it's this thing that it gets it just gets reinforced in that culture that this you know the culture of either nt4 people that support nt4 they don't understand the consequences of shutting down speech you think that you're just gonna shut down speech and D platform people that have marginally offensive views and the problem with that is first of all you close the door for them to be influenced in a positive way or for other people to learn from them being influenced in a positive way right and second of all the way to shut down ideas is not stop the person from talking it's to combat those ideas with better ideas and then everyone around them gets to see the discourse when you have these debates online that people discuss these things online it benefits millions of people yeah when you shut that down it benefits nobody but your cause and your cause is probably incorrect like your your ideas are probably wrong and in the case of Darrell Davis you're definitely wrong he's not a Nazi so if you shot shutting that down and say these people are Nazis well you're wrong and you're censoring people that are trying to get to the bottom of things and getting to the bottom of things mean discussing things are trying to figure out tenable solutions or comfortable middle ground that takes forever this is not like you know you have Christina Hoff Sommers and she has this discussion and and and they pull fire alarms and and yell that she's in nazi-like she's a feminist you guys are crazy like this and everyone has to comply with woek ideology 100% with no deviance whatsoever and everyone has to take and impossible to pass purity test it's it's this is a dumb way to communicate you ever notice something - it's it's always that it's why is the concern always that if we have this battle of ideas that the person would shift to the right yes why is it why are you not concerned about the other way right it's it's kind of like reminds me of like cuz I grew up pretty Evangelic of my mom was very religious it was that she tried to it's okay if you're if you're a good Christian you might get corrupted by bad ideas so we have to ban I don't know like Harry Potter books a ban in my household it's a way to ban all the world because it encouraged witchcraft I wasn't allowed to celebrate Halloween it's pagan stuff satanic but but that's what I mean it's like this is satanic this is evil and it has taken on this religious dimension this liturgical dimension because it's well they're always so concerned that the corruption is just going like they're gonna drift to the right of course they're never concerned that that somebody might be convinced by the arguments and go to the left why I don't get that well the drifting to the left first of all they think would be a good thing the problem no I don't II think it would happen well they don't worry about it they're not worried that someone would drift to let you mean by looking at someone's offensive use and that they would be more likely to drift to the left is that what you mean that like okay it's like let's say we expose everybody to all ideas right why are we so concerned that that the individual that they're you know the target I guess would be would be shifted right and not shift it left yeah I know you're saying yeah I think it's they have an infantile perspective on ideas and they're worried about people being indoctrinated they're worried about what they're not worried look if you if you have someone talking and this this person is preaching some ridiculous thing and someone starts becoming indoctrinated and gravitates towards that the real problem is that these people that are being indoctrinated are gullible and they're foolish that's the real problem and in your eyes they're going in the incorrect way this is infantilizing yes there's actually patronizing it is patronizing yes I think that's that's what I couldn't those people are dumber than you you're smarter you know better you need to stop these people from being tricked into this right-wing ideology I mean I've heard intelligent people make this conversation about other intelligent people that disagree with them like ben shapiro that like ben shapiro should be deep platformed because Ben Shapiro is indoctrinating people towards right-wing ideology by having these salient points and articulate sentences and these these rants that he goes on or he speaks very fast he's got a great grasp with the English language and it's very compelling yeah and the idea is that he's indoctrinating young people well no he's speaking with passion well I don't agree with him on a lot of things yeah but I certainly agree with his right to express himself and he's not convincing me who is he convincing like when he's talks when ben shapiro here's a here's an area where we deeply disagree gay people he thinks it's immoral he thinks he would never go to a gay person's wedding he wouldn't have he wouldn't even go to the celebration the after party of a gay wedding and i'm like well this is all for religious reasons i'm like that there's I think that's ridiculous that's not convincing me so who is it convincing is it convincing someone that's a baby are you dealing with children are we dealing with uneducated people we're dealing with people that don't have positive influences what's wrong with letting him express these ideas these ideas are hot I mean he and I had like a long conversation about it on the podcast well I was like I think it's ridiculous like what do you care my perspective is what do you care and his perspective is he couldn't support that because of religious reasons so then we go deep into the hole with why yeah yeah but what are these religious reasons like how deep do you go with this do you think Jesus came back from the dead like he doesn't he's Jewish it's a different perspective but do you think you know this do you really think that God thinks that homosexuality is some sort of a carnal sin and and and and terrible if so God made everything why did he make homosexuals please explain that what kind of a weirdo is God that he gives people this urge to be gay but then he tells them fight that urge and then he makes this comparison that's like murder sometimes you want to murder people okay I think that's different because you don't want to murder people all day every day I know a lot of gay dudes want to fuck dudes all the time it's like it's God did a crazy thing to their system and for you to believe in God but have a problem with that to me is ridiculous so now we're banking on these really ancient words that were written by people with no grasp of science no understanding of biology no understanding of the culture of the world no understanding of the the sheer number of these people and taking into perspective that you know you're literally dealing with under what percentage of the population is gay but it's a significant percentage so you're saying all of them are frying in hell do you know dumb that is that's really fucking dumb like if they're your neighbors and they're just happy and loving what do you care the goal should be a cohesive society or people are comfortably being around each other with all their differences just nice people just nice to each other exactly it doesn't matter if you're gay or straight or trans or black or white or Asian or fucking whatever it doesn't it shouldn't matter the individual should matter and the way we interact with each other that should matter and we have to take any consideration that if you're going to live your life by these things that were written down thousands of years ago before people had any of these understandings of all the subtle nuances of humanity and all the differences that people have and and now the biological understands why they have these differences well you're dealing with ignorance your your your applying these ancient ignorant rules to a modern world where we have a vastly expanded understanding of human beings right but to Ben's credit I mean he's friends with Dave he doesn't live yeah but he says he's gonna cut them off to my weddings like I can't you're a sinner what fuck off but you know what a lot of us who have parents who are super Christian yeah like I understand at the end of the day you know where that's coming from she my sister is gay and and at first she didn't she didn't accept that and the reason for that it was that it was coming a good place like for her it was I don't want my daughter to go to hell so it's like it's like it's again the road to hell is paved with good intentions right and so so the only reason she was kept checked into it was because of this belief that she's gonna end up burning in hell so it's coming from an ironically a place of love right um it's judgy yes and it's based on Bronze Age ideology yeah but but you know I I don't think that that either of us ever doubted that she loved her right and it's so I kind of understand where Ben comes from in that sense even though I I you know it makes me angry like I you know reject all that stuff it's just silly and what's interesting is he's so smart when he talks about that it's all the sudden you see stammering and he gets weird because he knows it's nonsense I don't know if he knows I don't know he's just deep he's just balls deep in his religion which is I like the guy a lot I really do and I've gotten so much shit for saying that I like the guy you need more of that we need more of the hate the you know hate the sin love the sinner it's practiced on both sides but I think he and I only had we we disagree on some issues and some political issues but he's a decent person he's a nice person he's very friendly he's funny I enjoy his company a lot i like ben shapiro i really do i think he's a brilliant guy right i mean the gay things the biggest one cuz me that's the dumbest one like the my my my it always comes back to why do you care that's all it is to me like why do you care i don't care like why do you care someone's gay like if it if does it affect you how can it how can it affect you right you do you have your fingers and everybody's business like it's crazy yeah doesn't make any sense to me i mean that's the argument against the gay marriage like what why does it offend your heterosexual marriage exactly it shouldn't well the sanctity of marriage it's so dumb the sanctity of marriage how about Vegas you could go to a fucking drive-thru you can get it you get married drive-thru movie theater I mean that's really what it's like you can't get married anywhere that's so dumb so it's so ridiculous I I just I feel like at this stage of civilization that there's the we have to figure out what stuff we're gonna abandon from the old days and what stuff we're gonna keep and we've already abandoned a lot of things right in in Christianity if you leave you they don't kill you anymore you know we're not yeah they got rid of some of the things during the Enlightenment exactly yeah they changed a lot of the aspects of Christianity that we associate today with more repressive religions exactly yeah that used to be Christianity yeah I'm a huge fan of the enlight the alignment in general in fact be you know Steven Pinker wrote that book enlightenment now that was the first book we chose to translating to Arabic and then it became the like recently there were a lot of protests in the Middle East and we started distributing that book like it was actually somewhat the person was the coordinating some of the protest that was like telling us we want to give this book out to the people because a lot of these youths like they're they're really jaded by by theocrats in the region by authoritarianism and and they're like you know what you know what our religion had never gone through not the reformation we don't want the Reformation we want the Enlightenment because in Lineman was what could constrain Christianity in a way yes and it in it really if you looked at one of the greatest intellectual achievements of Europe came out of there right this idea of the social contract of you know eroding monarchy absolute monarchy separating church and state all these wonderful invent like innovations and ideas came out of the Enlightenment and it was you know promoted this idea of like maybe people should be free to have their own conscience and think differently and that's something that that really really is needed in in the least well I think the way that your organization is going about it is probably the best way to get books translated get ideas translated to people that maybe didn't weren't ever exposed to these concepts before right and maybe that'll help yeah it's just that's the thing so you know fluid pluralism but I see that as you know that's what we're doing promoting pluralism this idea that you can have all these competing narratives and so you ask me what my culture you don't like when I came to America like how what was my my experience is moving here yes was very freeing and liberating because I felt like I went to a place that that was pluralistic that tolerated all the weirdos and then maybe in like 2014 you know things started to change at least on campus when you know pluralism wasn't tolerated you started to see the rise of of this sort of more intolerant you have to you know kind of kowtow to this intersectional intersectionality incredibly so that was an interesting experience and and I think was ultimately very detrimental to the to the the actual project of liberalism it's it's countered it's you know working against that exactly yeah that's that's the really frustrating part of it okay what you're claiming to be preaching your ideology is actually working against it ultimately behind the scenes and you just can't seem to see the pattern right where it's going you can't stop people from discussing things and say that you support free speech right that's not free speech you know and one of my favorite things with Ben with Ben Shapiro is watching him talk to those people he is one of the best at taking questions and just decimating these social justice warriors gonna go and watch Ben Shapiro destroy I know I think that's so good I know I just hate the way very quick baby and it's not him he doesn't make those cuts as supporters but goddamn is he good at it I secretly laugh at it I know it's kind of bad for this course I did right out right out in the open he's great at it because he's you know he's logical and very intelligent so when these kids are saying these things that you know they just learned last month in their Gender Studies class and they're they're yelling and at him and he breaks it down it's just one of my favorite things but those kind of discussions are important first of all so that these kids realize that hey there is this brilliant right-wing guy that can decimate your argument really quickly he talks quickly to yeah you know it he'll smash your game he's very smart and so you need to know that your argument sucks it's like having bad kung-fu you know you're running around the world thinking you're gonna kick everybody's ass because you've never really been tested and everybody who you're trading with says your kung-fu is amazing and then you go into a gym where someone doesn't believe in your kung-fu and fucks you up and you go damn that's important I needed to know that's one of the culture shock things for me when I first moved to America it was that you know I think a lot of American kids were taught like participation trophy culture a lot of them were told that they were the best like you know like Tommy like you are yeah you're just like so amazing and I'm like dude these people it's like American Idol you know we used to get the the seasons and Singapore too and it's like these people can't sing and that's actually why they're putting them on they're awful yeah and nobody told them why are you telling me that like they've been telling their friends oh I'm practicing going on American Idol didn't nobody tell them that bro like you should just be singing in the shower nobody told them there's a couple things going on first of all some of those people are trolls they're going on that they know they suck and they're going on because they're gonna get on TV and the best way to get on TV is actually the suck shame like they want to do it they want to be on TV look I suppose the fear factor don't talk to me about shame okay I understand both testicles actually I think that's heroic that's definitely not heroic and it's now a show on the Food Network right well bull testicles are actually a common food Rocky Mountain Oysters our stuff is they don't taste bad both testicles does not taste bad they're actually the way they cook them they cook them well they're actually delicious okay but there's on there's there's no shame in doing something that most people are fearful the singing thing what's going on is first of all there's a lot of those people that are mentally ill that's part of the problem a lot of those people are delusional they're mentally ill they have like legitimate mental health issues and then they go and sing and they sound terrible and no one tells them because they don't have any friends it's one of the reasons why I think I think there's a happy medium see the thing is you know if you grow up in Asia you're told that you're just a dumbass all the time and you're kind of kind of constantly beat down you know if you come home with 99 over 100 for your math exam your parents are not gonna save pat-pat well done you're they're gonna say where was that one point what did she do wrong and again you do not doubt that they love you and care for you that's just how it is and and so you kind of internalize that and and have very low self-esteem and you know in general like but you kind of know your limitations right that's the problem like when I when I moved here was that I realize like a lot of the kids I went to school with man I wish they had that confidence you know it's like they are they're inflated sense of self-worth with was just so big but sometimes it allowed them to get the good jobs it allowed them to ace the interview they don't have to do stupid things like drink this and get nervous I grew up around a lot of Koreans because I did Taekwondo from the time I was and they I mean I thought I knew what hard work was and tells around these people and also you can never work yeah Koreans who and my friend jung-sook who was on the u.s. national team when I was younger was in medical school so he's going through his residency and training to be on the national team so while he was studying he would put his backpack on fill his backpack up with books and run up the stairs of the university run up and down stairs to get some additional workouts and he was trying to train for the US team while he was doing his residency that's it's insane incident he was crazy he would sleep three hours a night and he was like one of the best Taekwondo fighters in the world and it was all through sheer will and 10-bit but he was explaining that to me about what it was like growing up is like you are never good never never had nothing that were good enough you know no matter what you do you could have done better you could work harder you could always do more ya know I mean it's it's unforgiving but it's one of those things that it's a good illusion it's it's I think a very healthy illusion to have that like work equals success mm-hmm right and and that's why I think you know people of Asian descent generally are pretty primed to to to buy into the Republican politics right pull yourself up by your bootstraps you handouts the harder you work the more likely gonna cheat something that's why there's just such a natural you know a lie in terms of to rely on this group block as a political group that's the undiscussed racism in academics is the way Asian people are treated when they're applying for major universities particularly for Harvard like they they literally you have to score higher if you're Asian because there's so many Asian people that get in they made it more difficult yeah just trying to manage that yeah I mean it's not a meritocracy anymore like you've you've decided that they have to do better right then white people they have to do better than everybody else which is crazy I think the insidious thing in particular the Harvick case was that they started downgrading Asians on personality I mean that's the part it's like okay fine you you want to say that like maybe you know we don't want we won't want to like lower the scores a little for other groups and you know why but then to downgrade this personality that's a part that how did they do a downgrade personality what was the method that they used to do that so they said okay we're not just gonna rely on standardized tests okay so that's the thing like standardized tests you know they're they they can be easily gained that was idea that like you can just go for more tuition extra classes and you'll do well well we care about the holistic package of the applicants so you want to see more personality ultimately this is about you know what Aristotle called the Telos right what is the Telos of higher education what's the ultimate goal or essence of higher education is it to just produce perfect cogs in the machine of the global economy or is it you know to produce engage citizens or whatever it is right like so however you define that question what's the purpose of higher education you could tailor your entrance methods to meet that and in Harvard's case they decided well you know we're going to instead of just looking at your GPA your essay we want to see you want to interview the person want to see what your personality is like can you thrive at Harvard are you going to be a good contributing member of this yeah exactly and you know this is one of the areas in which consistently you look like the Asian population that was applying to Harvard was downgraded in that score they scored really high when it came to like extracurriculars academics they were so strong on on SATs and and you know all these other standardized tests but when it came to personality they were very consistently downgraded so do you think that that characteristic like that the seeking out that was that was applied specifically to try to limit the amount of Asian people cuz that's the argument right um you know I don't know it was done specifically for that but I think Harvard has a again monocultures suck in general so you know if you're gonna look for even for me like I was coming to study in America like you know ten thousand miles away right from the place I grew up I don't really want to go to school without lot of Asians cuz like I could have just stayed there frankly but I I was looking for for for something that wasn't a monoculture you don't have to just expand your mind right so any other day the issue with Harvard is that it was taking federal money and if you see Harvard as a stepping stone to a career to a future it is unfair it is kind of unfair if they were penalizing you based on race that's the hard part of proof whether or not this was personality or race or some sort of you know other thing that they were selecting for that happened to correlate with race that's the part that that's hard so is it possible that they were just trying to enhance the way people communicate on campus and so they sort of emphasized personality and emphasized associate social interactions and in doing so they penalized Asians without being aware of it yeah kind of I mean to be to be honest like you know when I was in college I only did my first jello shot like couple weeks ago and couple weeks oh now yes okay well I was that typical we don't need to do jello shots to be in college on a thing okay okay but I didn't I didn't have the typical college experience you didn't party an apartment you know a lot of international students who come from Asia will probably fall under the same habits like we're kind of like you know we've been told that there's only one way to succeed work hard and summa cum laude and all these things so so a lot of us kind of are culturally aligned on that and and you know the do we contribute to campus in the same way that you're active student union leader would who's involved in other curricula I don't you know I don't know so would harvard want a diversity of behaviors and interests yeah probably yes you know it's like boring stem people what you want all kinds of different stuff and you also want people that raise the bar really high in terms of performance you do yeah yeah I mean that's that's that that enhances other people's understanding of what's possible but as a private institution you you can make your student population up the way you want right that's why you have what Liberty University which is Jerry Falwell yeah and it's for Christians because but it's a private institution they're not taking money from the government so that's fine unlike UC Berkeley state institution they abolish affirmative action UCLA all the UCS did look at the population seventy eighty percent Asian interesting California yeah why is that this is the young comfortable you know this is the part where we just you know like I don't want saved you know cuz they kick ass they work harder yeah a more dedicated more disciplined people are very uncomfortable to talk about differences in group up come because we have to kind of make everybody right the same or else there must be some sort of systemic thing but I think that Asians because they're so hard-working and because they don't complain this they get people get away with this stuff where they get away with discrimination against them I think they're starting to complain the lawsuits were filed so yeah they are starting to but it's like it took that doesn't like alright you fucks and there's actually quite a big pro-trump asian-americans voting bloc mmm you know this this this particular issue of affirmative action is really driven a lot of Asians right word in New York City that has happened - under de Blasio really yeah because it's a public school situation there what's what does the same thing they want to lower you know basically in terms of the public high schools mm-hmm they they want to institute the same policies from live action hmm so that's that's become an issue I think I read an article recently that Andrew yang was kind of dragging Asian Americans back to you know to the left but no remains to be seen he just dropped out so yeah nobody's out I wonder what's gonna happen yeah I was bummed about that he was my guy he has some really interesting ideas and he's so he's so open minded you know his his perspectives are so uniquely non-politician yeah yeah and like how refreshing to finally have somebody who's scientifically and technologically literate yes in government yes that was really my attraction to know what the basic bitch intellectual duck web choice either him Oh Tulsi was mm-hmm but I really really liked him yeah this whole thing is so strange it looks like they're trying to fuck Bernie over again just like they did in 2016 they're just that could we watch that coin flip over and over again yesterday yeah from Iowa were like arrest that kid put him in jail that was an illegal coin flip the other terrible coin flip the whole thing is just so weird it's just seeing it play out and seeing it play out so transparently so many what the conspiracies are like about now they're they're kind of like pitting mayor Pete against Bernie mm-hmm he's talked to chat about Bernie he is who a Abood I yesterday remembered he was talking about how many billionaires so many billionaires donate timaya Pete I was pretty good Bernie it's not that good and you yang 20/20 dropout fuel speculation on NY Oh mayor of NYC holy shit he could do that he could win that fuck yeah I could he would house mayor Pete is he still a mayor yeah yes how you do that that's a bit of a complaint that's his giant complaint did he do a great job as a mayor he's like the bet did he clean up all the problems of that city he's he's done enough to make people notice but I think the african-american community is not happy about some issue stuff he talks really well in his handsome and he's a veteran those are good things they're like fucking run him rot him rot him but no people are really raking him over the coals for apparently like his you know again he's checked all the right boxes Harvard McKinsey like he's too perfect like he was 3d printed in the DNC headquarters you know yes so people are very concerned about that like it's so funny how like this whole optics and authenticity really I bet for me that's why I like Andrew Young he was if you hate politicians which I generally do he's the least heart to hate yes he's the one talking to him he's so normal he's like a guy who runs some tech company or something that's what he feels like when I talk yeah yeah and we that's the thing like you know with 24 hour exposure or social media and new cycle this kind of signal is so obvious in a way that was never before right we can see normal people now yes and we know the difference between grandstanding posturing and just like yeah so I mean I just but also normal people don't want to do it you know it's like the the whole thing of it it's just so invasive right it should disqualify anybody who wanted to do exactly but you know this is a system we have we gotta do this better than China right of course yeah right yeah yeah absolutely as dirty as it is over here it's still better than the alternatives that we see elsewhere around the world right I'm hoping things just continue to get better I'm hoping more you know more people understand the mechanisms behind the scenes and how all the stuff works and never question for you that way what do you cuz like you know you do talk a lot about like woke stuff kind of going amok great mmm-hmm doesn't not bother you though about Bernie that he aligns himself with some characters who are super woke I think you woke active isn't particularly yeah well I mean he also aligns himself with people at Cornel West was brilliant and has some amazing ideas about that and it like looks at it from a an accurate and educated perspective I think a lot of the the woke Ness is a sign of a cultural shift in the right direction less racism less homophobia less fill-in-the-blank all those all the things that we that trouble us about like evil behavior and even greed corporate greed all these these things that trouble us about the influence that money has on politics and Bernie clearly stands against all that stuff and I think that when you see these the this woke stuff you know it goes amuck you have to look at it on a spectrum it's like the crazy antifa people who demand 100% compliance with woek ideology or they'll hit you in the head with a bike lock versus people who want single mothers to be able to have free education and free health care and give them the economic support that they have to raise their family and hopefully give their children a chance at achieving a successful comfortable life in this world versus suppress them versus keep them in this fucked up system that just throws them in the meat grinder with everybody else treat this country like a community like try to do our best to help the people that are in a disenfranchised position because there's so many try to do our best to in some way economically uplift all these deeply impoverished sections of our country that's those are the good aspects of woek ideology see all woke ideology isn't just the you need 78 different gender pronouns and you have to comply with actually fringe probably it is fringe but it's also fringe right on me like it's there's nothing wrong with being conservative fiscally there's nothing brought wrong with being conservative in the way you dress or the way you behave you know it's like when you go far right then things get ugly right you know and it's it's the outside edges on both parties are the mess most people reasonable people if they could have conversations with folks even if they disagreed on certain things they find themselves somewhere in comfortable a comfortable discussion where you could at least sort through the ideas and try to figure out why you think the way you think and why I think the way I think why how we disagree and are you right or am I am I wrong like I want to know you know and and most people don't these kind of conversations like trying to figure out if the person who opposes your philosophy or your perspective is writing you're wrong it's very uncomfortable for people right so what do they do they just fucking shit on anybody who's on the other side and they don't talk to when there's a very little exchange of ideas in between the right and the left one of the guys I really like talking to is Dan Crenshaw who's a right wing guy it's very very reasonable he's so much for doing that thing on SNL - yes yes that was great I mean oh it was such a nice meal couple to see yes we and it's so rare nowadays like this you know dividing line between Brian Levin and things are just so so hyper hyper polarized so yeah I mean you can't like guys will go on a Fox News show and people scream at them you know why how dare you use that Blake Jimmy Dore just did Tucker Carlson show and people would just shit all over the place for doing that using his platform and what of course he's using his platform he's getting good ideas out there who Tucker Jimmy Dore Jimmy Jimmy door is an amazing YouTube I'm sure it's fucking amazing and the way he breaks down things it's hilarious but also funny accurate and from the far left to what yeah I mean I I disagree with him a lot politically but like he's he actually entertains me yes he's an angry far left guy who's funny and he laughs like wasn't much either that got the dog that has the asthma laugh oh yeah exactly I like people crazy laughs because their laughter makes me laugh so just watch for that purpose alone we need more discussions you know we need more people that in and the thing is if you like people gotten mad at me for having people on the podcast that are far-right people particularly in the far like many years ago and one of the things that's hilarious is and they said his show has had this person that person this person that person all the all the negatives and you're talking about 1500 plus episodes and you list like five or six Andrew as if that defines the show but like I said this is the another example of the political one rule like you in an interview like one far-right person so you the whole ignore Jimmy door ignored that you have had Abby Martin Edward Snowden all these people are like you've done this far right person your whole show is far right there for Rogan if a you know it's an all right person well it's easy to cuz I look like one like I look like I should be an all right person we don't why cuz you work out yeah yeah I'm a bald Cagefighting commentator you know that you know what that that's a terrible I don't know why this correlation has really started to exist but but it has I saw I saw an article I think was on the Guardian that said something like if you exercise too much your there was an article about that like exercise is kind of like a mask like again they're lumping off concept yeah they're lumping all these concepts together articles written by week bitch just taking the fire sorry no yeah it's it's silly there's a lot of like really brilliant people exercise all the time right they just enjoy it they enjoy having a body that works really well there's a lot of brilliant people who like racing cars to write their you know they just enjoy the mechanical aspect of racing a car it's kind of the same thing when you do you do something to your body to juice your body up to make it stronger and faster and work better it doesn't mean you're dumb you're toxic masculine but this stuff is insidious because it's bad enough to be in political silos we're now in cultural silos and they're mapping on each other right so one of the things that happened when I first moved here with it you know so high cuz I didn't grow up here I I wasn't I didn't know what I shouldn't like so people would say like oh you you're Boston like you know educated liberal coastal elite right but then I was like I love WWE and so they're like that's all people like you know I'm surprised you watch WWE and I you know this was the time of like Hardy Boys and Lita I grew up with that stuff so people will be surprised and and they will push back on it and it's it's it's increasingly become that way like from a person's consumption habits what they like yeah hobbies you're now able to map what what politics they will have or likely to happen that's dangerous like we shouldn't be we shouldn't be going down this road it's been very comforting for me to see how many left-wing intelligent well-read educated people actually enjoy watching the UFC so talked to so many of them like you're a fan like oh right and then they want to have these conversations with me about fights and about this matchup and that match amoral wow this is really interesting like people that you would never have associated with being like a fan of like Robert Downey jr. UFC fan and we're talking to him Wow Matt Damon UFC fan yeah any anybody breaking moles really should be elevated you know like because it's alright we just get more and more entrenched in these clusters right and people are scared to like things like WWE or like anything they like you know some some people love the fucking mosh pits you know it's entertaining did you not see what Vince McMahon did yeah but they don't want you to like what they don't like which is you know it's thought bubbles you know that's what it is it's like people love when you are we people love when you're predictable right it's one of the reasons why people love when people dress up in suits you dress like a suit in a suit in you act like a businessperson you you say words that are you know you you speak in a very very similar way to the other people that you work with and it makes it easy to map out what you're probably gonna do and how you're gonna react there's a very narrow band that you're operating in when you're wearing a suit in the tie and you're in office there's a narrow band you could be the asshole suit and tie guy or you can be the standard you know work language human being gentleman you know that that kind of stuff is that's people like that because they know that they can kind of predict you they know where you know where you're going from but when your accent when you're outside the box you're unpredictable and you have an eclectic taste they don't like it you have interesting ideas that are completely irreverent and don't fit into these patterns like what is what is she up to what the fuck's going on in her head she's out there watching wrestling Pro Wrestling she actually likes it yeah it's Pro fake wrestling entertainment entertainment yeah but some people don't like when you're unpredictable and they also don't like their own ideas being challenged it's one of things that I think that people love about other people that are deeply religious if if they if you're deeply religious and they're deeply religious they know that they can talk to you in a certain way well the Lord has a way of making things work out yes it does Tom yes it does and they know that you're gonna think yeah amen you're gonna think in this narrow bandwidth you're not gonna get outside that box you're you're good Christian why no Mike and Mike's a good Christian you know and all that stuff I hear about him just doesn't make any sense it's a good control mechanism yeah it's easy to hurt people who you know like exist within this narrow band well that's why politicians almost always adopt some form of religious ideology even Trump Trump was basically never religious his entire life never and I always got a religious that lady but that lady is amazing like she's so crazy that it's WWE that's what it is I mean Trump used to be in the WWE I know I totally remember this lady is basically like a wacky manager she's like a wacky manager in the WWE that talks to God and helps Trump out that's how I look at it I'm like this is his wacky manager he's got a character now I'm sure he's got the fucking crazy hair he's got this spray tan that doesn't go all the way to the outside edges and he's got this whacky lady who I don't want to say he's banging her but I wouldn't be shocked hmm no I be she's gonna hot she can hide a dirty old crazy religious lady way I am dirty milf irreligious lady I know she's fairly pretty isn't she look at that not bad-looking listen I like her yeah the way she presents but she's got the Karen our style which is not checked the Karen hairstyle lol look at that look at him he's not even he's deeply insult no it's so obvious it's fait accompli again you don't know he might be a changed man yeah someone's mine did you know I I think that's the thing that kind of ties all the threads of my life it's just that I definitely oppose you launching that picture go back to that picture please you know who I believe in that picture no that's not the picture you fucked me Jamie the picture that we were just looking at that doesn't matter see that lady in the the leopard skin I believe her face she's barely into this dots she's like what am i doing what is this nonsense and Trump was like I can't believe I'm president i won I'm gonna win again I'll have to do is listen this crazy lady talked to me about Jesus so people gotta buy into it he's it's a great move you know I mean he didn't go secular at all right but if you look at his past in his history look he's not a religious guy and all sudden he is and nobody even questions it it's just look service though he's in the WWE she's his manager yeah Lackey manager I think I think Obama was similar like I think is performative is church-going I don't think oh they get down I guarantee you they go back they do outer altogether they listen to a CD scene they fuck like rabbits she's got a crazy story does she yeah like addiction and she came out of it yeah used to be addicted good even better I think that's the thing of her journey no the new singer what do you mean which singer journeys Jonathan Cain no not the singer the singer is a Japanese gentleman have you do you know that journey like the what was his name Stephen was the original guy's name Steve Steve Perry Steve Perry from journey beautiful voice you know that yeah well now there's a Japanese guy who does it and he was a journey cover band guy and he's so good that when Steve Perry stepped away they hired him to sing the songs and it was fucking amazing doctor guy that's the guy that was the Paul the spiritual advisors the far right that guy's the singer the one in the middle oh wow he's amazing he's very racially ambiguous um in that picture but he said he's Japanese I believe he's Japanese isn't he am I wrong I thought I read he was Japanese anyway he's a guy from a what's his name hmm okay maybe let's Filipino it sounds like oh you think so okay sorry I my chances are anyway this guy sounds exactly like Steve Perry maybe even a touch better wow maybe not a touch but you won't hear a little play a little bit give me a little bit when jakey a few years back Steve Perry yeah Steve Perry wanted to bail so I can't do this anymore man and this guy's like I'll fucking do it and they listen to him like damn dude you can do it he sounds exactly like Steve Perry okay give me some [Music] either come on [Applause] [Music] brings me back to high school baby he's amazing wait that that was not now that's him that's this dude okay okay yeah a little I like the intensity just a touch just maybe just sound technologies that could be you're being very generous yeah give me a little more [Music] come on no idea it's amazing he's so good I love that that's a great story that's a human story you know I love the story like that guys in a fucking cover band all right well Sonny's a lead singer attorney I'm not surprised he smoked you know though a really good thing okay they paid little of care they're really good at pool who Phillips some of the best pool players of all time to see on my wall out there I have two photos of signed photos of Filipino pool players Efrain Reyes and Francisco I can't remember his last name but bata is Efrain raises and de Jango Francisco Bustamante Francisco Bustamante they're probably to the top ten Evans probably number one ever ever from Reyes most people agree with that and Bustamante is probably top 10 of all time I'm not sure we should be even positive racial stereotypes now or not those are blank oh sure I know but now they're not kosher anymore it's not that silly yeah the reason is what happened is in 1950s when American GIs were in the Philippines they introduced pool to the Philippines and they started playing under really bad conditions because it's very moist outside humidity the tables rolled really slowly and so they developed a lot of really good skills under bad conditions and then they would go to good conditions and they also have a gambling culture so there's a lot of gambling involved in pool and so then pools everywhere they've always outside cafes with terrible cocktails and these people got just got really really good at pool and some of the to this day some of the best players in the world come from the pillow fee Philippines like when guys would see guys in tournaments and they would have to play a guy from the Philippines they'd be like oh fuck here we go Wow yeah so it's like Chinese and ping-pong probably I don't know about that though I don't know too much about that that's actually true of even skiers right like so people that can learn done like I know the actually East Coast gears they're highly represented in the Olympics because they train on ice okay I get like again they're just tough it's the tough conditions that kind of move or just it's like fortitude then you can adapt to any terrain yeah versus like if you kind of you know grew up skiing the soft powder of Colorado can really switch that way I know that's the thing yeah we're making things easier for people or making easier people that's why that's why I have a you know one of the the solutions I have for you know you one of the questions of our time is how we fix journalism right yes one of the things I really think we need to do because I'm not one of those people that thinks like the msi more like the media is the problem I mean I'm kind of part of the media now I write for a spectator USA which is so so does Bridgette and some of the other people that that you've had on your show Bridgette fantasy all over yeah she's the one to actually pitch me she's aware she is really funny I I wish I had the freedom to be is inappropriate in Hawaii you say that I wanted to get back to that because you were talking about will go ahead with this thing about how to fix journalism so some of the best reporting that the New York Times really does is on the international stuff so like they've sent people they sent journalists into like these areas and seems young to like see what's up you know like and they would be surveilled by government officials and things like that or early even the ISIS files where you know this reporter in your time for Porter where Kamini had gone into Baghdad and like she just went in and I collected all these documents by herself and and then you know they came back and they analyzed it me the reverse-engineered how Isis was running their entire operation this is really good journalism and and when you kind of focus on the shit that's going on in other parts of the world gives you a lot of perspective you realize that like a lot of woke stuff is actually very America centric and and it and if you had zoomed out you would see that this wasn't a problem the thermostat issue of you know thermostats office temperatures you know being sexist for example because they're too cold for women that's not a problem when you have seen how the women in Iran what they have to deal with and if we just did a rotation in the newspapers where every everybody from the from the lifestyle or culture desk has to do a stint in you know Saudi Arabia something reporting from the floor like maybe they'll just maybe they'll have some perspective I'm sure well it is all perspective issue right I mean when in the absence of any real oppression you find oppression everywhere right I define in pencils and yeah like progress is the victim of its own success in a way and you know that's one of the things that because I had a big impostor syndrome when I first joined spectator and what they told me was I was like you know I'm not trained as a journalist and they're like yeah we know that but that's actually you know the chairman said like that's why we want you it's because you didn't go to the same schools you didn't go through the same journalism school so you don't not gonna think like all the kids are graduating from say like Columbia you know for in journalism so we want different perspectives and it's like in fact it's a policy that we don't even ask for where you go to school we don't ask what you study we don't care so don't even tell us well that's how I got like you know on board so do they just read your writing and say we just like how you think exactly no refreshing it is very refreshing it's wonderful Spectator USA Congrats to them yeah why do you think that you can't joke around about things and why do you think that that in some way is going to make people take you less seriously I think people put you in bins right so professionally like there's just he said it's this like signal of like how are you gonna act right how you dress how you come across and in professional settings that's there's an expectation of you as a sir behaving a certain way now when you're funny the problem is that that people don't know like you could say something but like be totally ridiculous and and it's it's a joke but but then other people might take that seriously and now you're a racist or you welcome to my world right right but but you're you work for yourself you're Joe Rogan it's it's very different if you are you know if you are tethered to an organization that you have to represent at the end the day people can't separate that so you know part of my job is is is negotiating deals with many of the authors that you have on your show right people like who write best-selling books trying to Inc deals with them I want your Arab Digital Rights for free you know I want to make videos of your books to video some reason all these thing we Inc contracts with them working with publishers agents and then also fundraising I have to go to individuals to say like hey you know it's gonna cost us $20,000 to translate this book you know which you want to sponsor it like you're a fan of this book can we get this in Arabic for free so when you're kind of like handling those things and going into offices and you know sometimes to go to penguin Random House and it's it's it's a certain expectation set of you and I I don't know if it's it's it's even more true of women though that like they don't expect you to be funny or like the funnier you are the more they take you less seriously mm-hmm versus then I don't know there seems to be a bit of a generator right there I can see that I could see how that would be an issue but I would like it to be their problem not yours I like funny people so whenever someone says that they're discouraged from being funny and that's one of the things that I like about your Twitter page is it's funny you're very funny so like discouraging you from being funny to me he's like why would you do that you can't separate they're not serious coming you know no one's gonna get you on how could that be true how is it true that someone who's just making jokes also can't be a serious person with a really well-thought-out perspective I know I obviously I agree with you but it's it's it's just one of the feedbacks I've got like you want to be taken seriously with these people people that are running things maybe you need your own show maybe you need to stop working for people no I I mean I'm still believe in institutions that's why I'm not like super you know I I don't want the revolution I still believe that the way we're gonna change things is through right now there's just too much power and I say my heart would like a revolution maybe what kind of revolution no I'm just saying I'm not the kind of person that wants to tear down institutions right I kinda want to work we didn't it to change things because they have the best shot at changing things so in in that sense I'm not I'm not that much of an outsider I love this quote actually Elizabeth Warren said it she said in life you have to choose are you going to be an insider or an outsider and insider doesn't have the freedom of speech but he has the power to change things and outsider can say whatever he or she wants you can bitch about the system you can you know be a whistleblower but you have no power to change anything and you have to choose you do that's what was her quote does that mean to Lakota quote actually no actually came from Larry Summers I don't know if that's accurate I don't know if you have to be an insider or an outsider I don't I think you have to have financial freedom so that you don't worry about someone taking away your ability to make a living so you suppress your own thoughts correct that's the big one but it takes a very you know a lot of things have to be aligned circumstantially to have financial freedom in the first place and but a lot of that does come from even working within the institution a lot of people who have you know huge financial backing that's why somebody I think Oh Sara hater who tweeted something like the the one thing that's not really talked about is the classs implications of cancel culture mmm right because it's going to affect the lower class more drastically right if you don't have them right you their capsules yeah of course there's a huge class yeah that's true it's also just a frivolous way of treating human beings and there's no path for redemption it's like the thought process of it is so limited because you're not considering the fact that these these are humans and these are people and people learn and grow and they get better than this not offering any path to redemption and lumping all yeah digressions and all mistakes into the same sort of pile right it's just it's a childish way of treating human beings and it's also there's a fear to it that it's going to come back on you so you go after them like some of the biggest creeps are also male feminists right they're the ones are like really where do you think that you know you shouldn't matter Andrew Doyle the other day it was funny yes he's amazing that book whoa katana astok - yeah - tawnie McGrath so I love retweeting those titania posts because so many people like what the fuck is this who is this bitch so mad they think she's real so but she could be in the sense that like sometimes she ends up predicting oh she's so close to real there's this like if you had a television show like one of them after midnight episodes is that what it is what's it what's the David Spade show called lights out I'm thinking the other one the one that Chris Hardwick used to host anyway you have a talk show well let's say Jimmy Kimmel if he had is this - Tommy McGrath or is this a real activist and you and you had the quotes backed by a lot of them are close you you know be hard-pressed you get a lot of it wrong we're at the point though in our history and culture that that we can't even write better satire than reality right and that's that's a problem it is a problem you know when when our satirist SAR actually ended up end up writing better stories than or even predicting you know what's happening like that well people are losing their fucking minds there was a video from the University of Phoenix I think it was where there's this kid on campus and there was some pro Trump group did you see that video the kids screaming and you the saying you're a fucking fascist you fucking crap you're out to cut and he's screaming and he's walking away from them screaming and making this you should all have your throats cut just completely unhinged and I was watching this I was like II Majan if this was some kid yelling about Obama and the Obama administration and the Liberals me because he's not saying anything he's not saying the reason why I hate you is because you detain children at the border in cages let's play this I could hear it and play it and give me some fuck okay that poor kid needs a hug yeah but imagine if he was saying that about Democrats every Republic or every Democrat can suck my balls every Republican slashed every Democrat slashed her throat that would be crazy I mean he's doing that because there's a pro student Trump organization there and so he's screaming that unhinged that's one of the problems I think we should not give you know like we should not give the right legitimate reasons to be complaining about disparate coverage right so one of the things that Eric Trump tweeted yesterday was which I didn't even know happen like apparently a van was was was driven into a GOP tents or something and you know they want the primaries and it got no coverage i I did so I I don't I don't know but it's there was a story about this and and you know Eric Trump basically tweeted saying that imagine if the labels were turned it was just the other way around right we would hear non-stop there would be analysis of you know the far-right problem in America and yeah so we you know the responsibility is on the media to make sure that these people don't have the argument right the media has to be open and they have to be unbiased in their depictions of these things and we don't really have that kind of media anymore we have left-wing media and right-wing media and everybody else is going what's going on is this who's right he's telling the truth you flip back and forth from CNN to Fox News it's like you're in a vortex of space and time you don't understand what's what right yeah it's weird but that kid screaming that poor kid like what happened where did you get this slot every Republicans slash their throat I know come on man who are you what happened to you and you're in school so you're learning something I'm so I'm so weary of sort of dogpiling on this stuff now I think I think when I first you know started on Twitter to I I was always in flaming like or like retweeting something that was like oh look at this super world on the fringe and I'm like no no maybe I shouldn't you don't amplify that signal may maybe this really is a French in that and that you know I'm just kind of making it seem like it's a it's a bigger issue because I I noticed I fall into that trap sometimes like that was this one story that came out I think when Apple release the the new iPhone that was like New York Post was like you know iPhone 10x or something was excited as was criticized as being a sexist and I think what why how how you know and apparently because like the phone was kind of big like they expanded the dimensions and so like it doesn't fit the woman's hands and its neatly yes the old version did and then I was like so I tweeted that angrily like yeah of course like everything sex is again like checks notes you know iPhone sexes and and then I realized I was kind of part of the problem because when I looked into this whole issue it was literally just like two Twitter accounts and so like an article was written based on like what somebody who's anonymous said on Twitter that was sexist and it could have been the internet research agency in Russia just fucking with everybody yeah or catania it is it so I kind of stopped doing that stuff is I become bitter account and yeah focus on different things I mean you we already have a lot of good commentator so I'm fighting this fight right people like James Lindsay a pedo coach and they're doing it very rigorously and they're doing in Peterborough oceans case they're doing it at great peril like universities trying to get rid of him yeah and his papers that they did those grievance papers are hilarious the heteronormative and queer behavior and dog Parsons cross yeah fucking brilliant right and then he got called up for apparently manufacturing data yes which of course that's the whole point of a hope yes and I know it's it's a political hit job yeah but it's they don't like that mirror of mockery they don't like that you know the spotlight being on them and to realize how ridiculous what you guys are supposed to be some higher Institute of higher education that's what you know this this is mirroring what happened when like the atheist the new atheist started debating there's the religious Christian mm-hmm it's like the new atheist were kind of mocking right like people like Christopher Hitchens there's bit of a mocking tone like what you'll believe is kind of silly yes and but the way they reacted to it was that like you're not allowed to laugh about this stuff right now it's it's always the question is which side can tolerate humor you're gonna get on the right side right I agree yeah as soon as you can't be mocked and like no one hates being mocked more than then left these days no one more than woke people right I I called my 2016 Netflix special triggered just calling it triggered got so many thinking mad right I'm like you fucking dummies do you know I just did it I just did it to you I called it triggered and you were mad yeah no it's just we're in a weird space right now where there's so many voices so many people have social media and so many people have access to complaining and so you get this bizarre signal it's like you gotta kind of wet let it die down a little figure out what how much this is real and how much of it is that kid screaming how many of those people so so I used to say the same thing because the you know you would see medical journals reporting the cancer rates are going up and it's like cancer rate it's is that really the case are we having more and more you know incidences of cancer or is it that our detection methods have gotten better like Diagnostics of going brother and we're just able to catch it at a much earlier stage so it's kind of inflating the the case number yes so it's hard it's really hard to tell and you know I it seems it seems I'm so you know buoyed by the fact in the last few months seems like mainstream culture even comedy starting to push back you have more and more people who are say you're kicking enough with this stuff well come to the comedy store that's the front line the comic stores the lease whoa comedy club in the history of the universe is it related to the cellar no okay the cellars really lease woke - yeah the one in New York stand-up is pretty unwell and the thing is the audiences want to hear the stuff that here mocking all this shit they want to hear it and they enjoy it and you know you get pushed back sometimes people get up and get mad because you said the wrong word no they'll leave but you're missing the point the point is to say the wrong word you know like what what stand up is supposed to be is mocking everything that can be mocked and if it can be mocked it will be mocked and if it's funny the audience will laugh and if you like you shouldn't mock that but it just did that's another yeah quite a bit that's a weird one too because you shouldn't punch down if it's not funny but if it's really funny and you're punching down there exceptions yeah yeah Sam Kinison one of his greatest bits ever was making fun of people starving in Africa what yep it was a bit about those television late-night commercials where you're sitting at home cooking you know and well Sam kinnison's bit is a like a real classic you know it's like what you helped would you please help and he's like why don't you help you're right next to him and he goes why don't you instead of sending the money or sending them food he'll send them something like me sent instead I'm someone who's gonna go down there go hey we just drove 5,000 miles with your food we realized we wouldn't have world hunger if you people would move where the food is you'll have it a fucking desert and it's like this long crazy bit of Sam Kinison mocking starving people right but it's hilarious cuz it's done the right way it's it's he navigated that minefield where you don't feel bad he goes you see that see that you know what it is it's fucking sand you know it's gonna be hundred years from now fucking sand we got deserts in America - we just don't live it up asshole and he's doing obviously that's not real these people are stuck they don't have the ability they don't have the resources to get out there's a real problem they've been there the climate has changed there's all these real issues there's all real issues but it's horrible but you're dying laughing particularly in 1986 when he did this but there's there's there's there has to be like a theory of humor like why that's funny versus another case where he's punching down and it's not good luck here here's the thing about theories theories are like theories are prop you probably could in like so you do a post-mortem on a joke yeah and you could accurately dissect why it worked I don't think you could predict how a joke will work because too many jokes are dependent upon the personality the irreverence of perspective cultural context time yes timing the the personality the person doing is giant yes and always had this little smile on this devious smirk and he could get away with more fucked up shit because that was his that was his brand you know like that wouldn't work with Steven right Steven Wright who has this sort of absurdist perspective and you know non sequitur one-liners if he had a joke like that it wouldn't work but with Kennison with the yelling and the anger and you know and he was fat and ugly and you know he's always angry that's like you know we talked about marriage and getting divorced you felt bad for him right if Brad Pitt was out there screaming about getting divorce he buddy that beautiful fuck he should shut his mouth he's beautiful but sick Anderson is like 5 feet tall and fat and balding he's got a beret on it's like let him yell yeah I know this this analysis like the anatomy of human really fascinates me like why somebody can get away with it why somebody cannot and you know I think I remember when just recently because Ari Shaffir did that joke about Kobe like right after he passed away and yeah he was that and that dub wasn't necessarily a joke which is also part of the problem it was a mocking of someone and the joke is in his mocking if people knew Ari they would know that he does that whenever anyone dies including people he loves that's all his thing and it's fucked up if you don't know Ari but even if you're like well I read it I was like oh Jesus Ari but that's it's I've come to expect it like he did it when Tom Petty died he loved Tom Petty he mocked Tom Petty mercilessly when Tom Petty died when Aretha Franklin died he mocked her a merciless Lee you know it's what he does it's sort of as his signature move and he takes pleasure in end his fans think it's hilarious but the best way to describe it is the way he looks at it he has a very niche audience when it comes to that and then that joke or that thing that he does that's funny to him and his crazy fans hit a broad audience yeah and that's when it became a problem it takes a lot of all through comedy I really respect that it's so much it's a strange way to make a living it especially today well comment re had a great point about that too Ahri's a brilliant guy you know you said love was amazing race' stuff I know no but it's not supposed to say it's like from 2030 old yeah yeah the one with the that's Asian driving instructor I would it drives me hysterical I showed that to a lot of people and he's a brilliant stand oh he's a very very funny guy yeah I forget what I was gonna say about him but oh yeah he had this point about comedies like this is a great time for comedy right now because comedy is dangerous again like it's really dangerous again there's actually yeah yeah it was you could get away it wasn't there wasn't as many consequences people could not like it but now with social media and the canceled culture and everything like people get really angry at comedy now whoo no it's not that he's a masochist it's just that he's an artist and he loves the fact that you know it's like it's very punk rock now you know wild comedy is very punk rock like you you're bucking a trend but you're also doing it the delight of audiences you know I mean if anybody thinks that you shouldn't say some of the things I say come see me in an arena come see 15,000 people screaming laughing at that I don't think you're right I think people understand what a joke is I think people understand that you're saying things that if you took them out of context and put them in a blog it looks horrible but if you're saying it in the context of comedy when you know that someone's just fucking around it's really funny and it's funny for a REIT cuz people want to release from all this nonsense they want to release from this restrictive way of thinking and talk they want to release it from being told what they want to release from these fucking kids yelling it's like god dammit what are we doing here and that's where comedy comes in yeah that my release was just moving yes you know like move to a place that that all this stuff was possible that we could laugh at ourselves again but that's probably why you have this really interesting perspective is because of the fact you came from real suppression yeah you understand real suppression real consequences you left that and then you're seeing these minor consequences and you're like okay you guys this is a problem like you need to go to Afghanistan for a couple weeks you need to see what it's like and like really suppressive cultures exactly how it changes your mind how it you end up self censoring you don't even need the government to do it anymore after Worcester you're scared but it doesn't matter if it's the government or the Twitter mom after a while the result was going to be similar even though the consequences are different and we should definitely separate that I rather lose my job than lose my life well it's also it's in with woke 'no sin particular like in the propagation of woke 'no sin in the the promotion of woken us and the very strict adherence this ideology and the aggressive takedowns of people that don't comply you are you're essentially instigating a sort of totalitarian way of thinking but it's just in a way that you think is good but it's still a totalitarian way of thinking you're implementing this very rigid ideology and you're demanding compliance security yes and people don't comply you're going after them that is everything that is against being a liberal progressive thinker you're supposed to be a person who promotes discourse and open-minded communication and if you write like Darrell Davis is the best version of that ever he's the best version of it because all he is is a musician who is a very eloquent and articulate person who had the patience to sit down with people that believed in really fucking stupid thing and just through his mere existence and who he is as a person he changed the way they thought that is so powerful and that's been more powerful than all the punk should not see people yes not see people it's such a problem my friend Kurt was talking to this guy who is a very prominent left-wing thinker a very powerful person and my friend Kurt was talking to him he's like and the guy was like saying to him what's wrong with punching a Nazi he goes here's the problem who's gonna decide who the Nazi is like we're not talking about real Nazis when you say punch in Nazi you might be talking about your granny who's a Republican because she likes Trump because Trump believes in God his granny a Nazi right well antifa thinks that well at least the New Jersey antifa things that Darrell Davis isn't Yahtzee so yeah you're right the concept creep but it works to your advantage if if this is you know it there are people for whom the incentives are are there to to make it seem like the enemy is really that big because then you can implement all the solutions you want you know the population gets coward and a fear basically it's it's a again it's another totalitarian yeah it's almost like you click creating intellectual false flags are you're propping up all the all any divergence from this rigid ideology is some horrible fucking thing that needs to be attacked squashed and poisoned and lit on fire but ultimately at the end of the day what we really need to do is just be nicer to each other and what part of our problem is lack of communication and if you go to these things like when you see someone trying to close down at christina hoff sommers speech what you're seeing is them yelling its yelling its it's like screaming setting off fire alarms screaming that people are fascists that's not communication that's just like if you're talking to someone like blah blah blah and then listening to you blah blah blah it's childish and the fact that this is all taking place at universities is so discouraging yeah yeah and the fact that people think this it's supported and here's another problem the people on the left that aren't that way but think that these people like auntie fuh are probably good because they're like the Bulldogs they're like the attack dogs of the left and they'll go after the right and they'll they'll they'll they'll they'll reinforce our ideas you don't understand the consequences of this you're just gonna with with all the energy that goes in a negative way from the left you're getting more energy that goes in a negative way from the right it's a yin-yang thing it's exact it's Gillian dialectic pendulum swings swing yes and it's inevitable it's been a part of human interaction forever the best way to communicate with someone is never yelling at them and screaming at them the best way is to listen listen to their ideas and wear them out with logic where I'm out with long conversations like the the best way for two people who have a separate view of the world put those put those separate views of the world together sit down you tell me your view of the world tell me and particularly we can keep it in a narrow scope we're both educated about what we're talking about and we're not talking about something when the other person has really no data to draw from have a conversation sit down talk her through it's possible we can get back to doing that the problem is we're so accustomed over the last 10 years to communicating digitally we're so accustomed to blaring our ideas out and then checking to see who agrees every five seconds checking our likes and checking our our comments this is a non social way of interacting through social media social revolves queues people sitting apart from each other looking into each other's eyes being in the same space as each other that's how humans are designed to communicate that's how we evolved to communicate so we're basically spending the vast majority of our time debating issues in an unnatural way I would say it's a bit of a luxury now cause like it feels like it's very easy and very popular to kind of shit on social media in general right great aspects for sure oh my well and you know without it I we couldn't be reaching part of the world that that censors things right now do you and I would have never taught exactly yeah you would never have this conversation allows you I think Steven Pinker wants word about this always like the difference between common knowledge and shared knowledge common knowledge is like we both know something to be true but shared knowledge is that we know I know that you know that I know something so it's recursive and that creates a very different environment like you know imagine if you are the one lone atheist in Saudi Arabia and there was no way for you to reach other people you would think you're completely by yourself that you're the only one that things different but in the worlds where you can reach out and you can read other perspectives all of a sudden you realize that wait I know that I'm not alone I know that you know that I know that I'm you know and it changes how you feel in terms of just I ideologically just just safety and it creates real change yes one of my favorite quotes of all time was was in this manifesto written I can't remember the name now but it was about the you know a free internet and he said the problem is that we cannot separate the air that makes wings beat from the air that chokes and I was like it's so poetic because you remember these cases of these girls that were escaping Saudi Arabia and then she got locked up in Thailand and she was saying like I'm trying to escape from my father he's I don't want to add a hijab anymore I want to break out my family would kill me if they find out I'm you know I don't want this arranged marriage or whatever and and the only reason she can reach the outside world and that activists you know lawyers heard her story if it helped her and she got asylum in Canada because of social media hmm so it's like the more we want to regulate these things the more we're making it hard for a lot of these people who live in still closed societies because the only way to get in is through the internet I think the Internet in general is like most things there's no it's it's not binary it's not 1 or 0 it's not great or bad it's both those things all together there's amazing aspects of social media I mean just the the distribution of information is so radically increased over the last 10 years but right now we're focusing so much on the bad yes you know there was seem too much on the the way it's used negatively and and really not accounting for the things that it has brought yeah I think you're right yeah may it's I think all of it is moving in a good direction this is one of the reasons why I don't completely hate this whole woke ideology a mock it like well saying like when I say I'm in support of a lot of people like Bernie and people that go with him because I think they want good things I think they want a society that's more kind and inclusive to be fair Bernie did him like as a person like himself personally wasn't a big identity politics guy at all in fact in 2016 not all you know times have a bit changed it's just easier to do it now so you slide right in you get more support it's just it's a weird it's a weird battlefield now ideological battlefield and it's causing the Democratic Party to split yeah it's cool what's kind of hilarious it's just I love fake shit I love when people like obviously fake I love when they give fake speeches and they do fake political things with their thumb in their hand like that I love that stuff I just love when they fall into those patterns just but it makes it oh it's so obvious yeah but that's why I got an you Andrew yang stands out in such stark contrast like oh who is that guy doing there seems like a regular guy I'm just really upset that will never get the image of Andrew yang doing the whipped cream bukkake thing in the White House did you see that was he gonna do the story cream no he was christening his New Hampshire office right and then squirting with cream in people's mouths exactly his staffers mouth right and it's what's the funniest thing like like nobody told him what the optics were right it's white cream and you're shooting in people's way and he's on his knees yes that's all that's wrong but but I'm just upset that this is not gonna happen the way I was like I thought that that's it's probably happening right now with Trump and his WWE manager you're probably in the White House right now doing that exactly that was a really bad hit piece on Andrea the New York Times that was so bad that people started like they had to disable the comments why did they do that why do they do those hippies they were finding disgruntled ex-employees of this to basically shit on him and like one of the complaints with that he purchased people to do karaoke well what a monster I know I'm like that's the worst we could find you know in 20 years of employment history no one is you should be past your purity test no one no one I totally agree yeah especially if you actually turned the light on them everybody's flawed and especially if you only highlight those flaws outside of the context of whatever the fuck they were talking about in the conversations they were having and what was going on and you could make a very distorted perception of someone by just snipping and piecing together that's so it that's why it's so insidious yeah what's also why it's weird when it's coming from journalists like you should know what you're doing you should know that this is not an accurate or objective analysis of who this person is or that's what I mean the person who wrote this article who you know was like saying oh he's uncomfortable with language and and there was something there was some implication in the piece that like he's clumsy with how he deals with women staffers right and it's like yeah okay this guy is a tech nerd you know like maybe got some social cue reading such issues I mean I do too and it's like to drag someone of you know to basically like sling mud at somebody like that it's it's horrible the thing is though they're doing it because that's what sells you know these magazines and newspapers have become sort of slaves to clickbait i think they kind of have to get clicks I mean you talk to people that are actual journalists now and the pressure that's on them to get a bunch of clicks for each article and you know they'll have editors that change the title of their articles to make it more salacious but that's why they did the whole paywall thing right so the New York Times transition to subscription for that purpose that they won't be subject to the whim so but they still are they still are because a lot of those things you get through your Google News feed and you know you have to click through to the pay wall if you want to read it but the initial titles what gets you to click the link and then you realize it's paywall you don't just sign up without reading anything you go there because there's an article that's interesting to you right and then you are that confirms your role of you yes yes or goes against it you get angry yeah yeah I mean I have to say it in that regard I'm lucky I don't have that pressure yeah they just let me write whatever you know there's no yeah there's no that's awesome of that listen I got to wrap this up but I appreciate what you're doing I think it's wonderful this idea that you're getting these books to these people and converting it converting the languages so that they can understand some of these great works and yeah I mean it's a step in the right direction and again your Twitter feeds awesome tell people tell people where they can get ahold of you on social media um twitter at miss ms milchin mal cagn my own website I know but like no that's my rebellion my millennial rebellion no Instagram okay yeah well thank you I enjoy talking to you this is a lot of fun a lot of fun thank you bye everybody [Music]
