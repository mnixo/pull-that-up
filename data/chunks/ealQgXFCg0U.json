oh shit here we go recording oh you know what what okay look good we're we've done so many goddamn enemies on a boiler fuckin Gracie we're talking we're broadcasting right now the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight if you go to Joe who's that so you Brian you goddamn rookie son if you go to Joe Rogan net and click on the link for the fleshlight and enter in the code name Brogan you get 15% off of the number one sex toy for men and with that said with the sound today the fleshlight but that 15% you know when I heard the 50% I just jumped on it maybe maybe there's a few frugal Master Builders out there I ignore 50% fucking off that never makes a difference even when I was broke ass motherfucker 15% off never meant really never not fifteen didn't mean any gonna make me get up out of my fucking chair and call somebody and order some shit so it made me thirty but I'm a member of I'm a member of all the coupon websites and if I had a flashlight web 15% off fuck yeah I'm like free shipping you know that to me is like oh I got extra free something whoa okay I think everybody thinks differently when it comes to money I think you're a lot like me and that you would rather not think about it at all I don't want to think about think about it as much well how much is it um would you consider yourself be honest it's totally cool would you consider yourself a really big tipper yes oh yeah like 20 percent usually guys are into coupons I don't know that many of the guys into coupons but usually guys under coupons usually generally don't tip well I I consider more of like that's human and you know like I'm helping somebody out compared to like fuck if I can get $20 off Amazon I'm gonna do that yeah I was on in the ass yeah or you know Amazon is actually hooking you up and giving you a way to make what is the reason for coupons I mean is it just to see what happens when when they offer people less money for things well I don't know what the grocery stores have changed they used to be relying on coupons now if you don't if you go to a grocery store without one of those Bard's you're pretty much paying a good 15 20 percent more than you would if you didn't have a card on you yeah what so what's the benefit in that for them because for those people that aren't loyal they just come in and just spend money and I think it charges the Barnes and I'm like advertising when you put up a billboard and said call now 15 because it's just it doesn't mean shit to them it's just a reason to have an ad like they don't have a like a storyline for an ad so let's just say 15% off we'll blow that up it doesn't really matter it's a reason to get the logo out you know that's make sense that it's sort of like an advertising move yeah but I've always thought it was probably to see like maybe our shits too expensive maybe we can actually make more money if we sold more of them at a lesser price well it's probably also averages out like if you have a product that's twenty dollars but you could also charge $30 for it then the average is off the people that use the coupons would probably make it more like 25 probably there's like some economics major right now pull this fucking hair out now by the way do we say this is any problem we open the show with it's a new day Ari's not even here [Laughter] to like whenever I go to like like Ralph's or something like that and they always say you know wraps our local supermarket do you want to do you wanna have a Ralph's card I might have a free shake on a rollbacks card or something I'll just throw that away so not good with committees are keeping all that stuff in a little bag worried about it it's a different mindset Eddie and I have this it's a modified stoner mindset hope you get a lot of shit done but you and I are both the same way in that if you don't have to think about something I'm not gonna think about it yeah and if it's not gonna make a difference in my life yeah I don't give up I'm not gonna fire you exactly not gonna physically feel the difference now come on yeah I I need to do that I guess in certain good it helps you you need to like save money oh yeah I need to make sure well how about if you just didn't smoke fucking cigarettes cancer boy yeah just throw those fucking things away you'd have a lot of extra money yeah that's a terrible fucking drug man you know I that is the number one thing when everybody anyone ever talks anything politicians caring I just say why the fuck don't they ever talk about cigarettes what was the last time you heard Obama talk about everyone should quit smoking getting on TV talking about the 400,000 people sure but doesn't he try to quit or hasn't he trying to quit yeah everyone has you know what I'll be honest every now and then I have a cigarette I don't have a property cigarettes be illegal yeah it's a you know every now and then you know what it does when you get high and you throw a cigarette on top of that after five minutes you get like a big head buzz that's pretty fucking cool you've been having this menthol cigarettes I could tell I really like cigars and cigars are you know essentially it's just pure nicotine you're smoking you know this is probably the same buzz they get off of a cigarette one way or another I don't recommend it but I have full control of my body I've been drinking since I was 14 probably younger than that and I've never drink alone I never I'm not an alcoholic I don't I only drink in social situations and if I don't drink for four or five months you know I'm not a rage hard in social situations I'm a temporary drunk yeah well you what you have is you have the ability to control your impulses and even though your impulses might be crazy you know you have ability to put them in check whereas a lot of people when they start drinking and blackout and become another person those people they can't just not do it again the next day the next day comes around they have a couple drinks in them they can't step aside you can stop at two drinks how about the pizza story and Phoenix oh yeah man we were we were out okay we were hammered five 2005 I did the improv in Phoenix and Tempe rather we had a great old time went out got our party on God drank on we were hammered and we were at a pizza place that's two o'clock in the fucking morning and Eddie Bravo was on the Atkins diet so he's blackout drunk blackout drunk and he still won't eat his crusts crazy Tony committed to that shit I also remember your cheat day was retake ridiculous now you have a sundae with pizza inside of it chocolate sauce anything you can think of you're just dudes are famous for the cheese days dude who trains a BJ Penn I apologize I forgot his name he's a wrestler and he would put pictures of his shit online because it was so ridiculous good he would go to McDonald's and get a quarter pounder and then he would go to Krispy Kreme he would cut a donut in half and he put the cheeseburger in between the donut he was just fucking up some food that cheap when you're on the Atkins diet and you're restricting carbs you think about bread like every day sometimes you dream about Bretting you're thinking about that sundae and you think you're thinking about food so much Wednesday I'm like damn all that matters to me is just a couple more days hold on and I did it for almost three years where I was looking forward to that Sunday oh man and when I well I would wake up and stuff my face and I'm like it's 11 o'clock in the morning I'm stuffed and it's my cheat day I've been waiting for this all week I want to get hungry again I start smoking a lot of pot getting the cushiest of course you ever throw up I'm sure I did I mean you had to have some of the shit I saw you he was just ridiculous I even know my fattest day never ate I mean I would extend it to Saturday night I go I'm gonna start early and then for like after a year I said Saturday night and all day sunday midnight and then I just and then I did that for about a year I would start Saturday night on midnight and just go off right and take it all the way through Sunday then it started Saturday afternoon around 6:00 UFC you know we're eating before the UFC okay but then it just became let's just do Saturday and Sunday and let's not think about it no more let's just wake up Saturday fuck it and there when I added Friday night crazy with it now I'm not gonna suffer and I'm like well it's not even making a difference now yeah you were doing that for a long time I miss those days that was fun but you were so insane with it I was disciplined very disciplined yeah you would just eat lettuce I remember you were eating bunny food you were just eating trouble and time yeah yeah people thought I lost so much weight people thought I remember at Abu Dhabi 2005 like people on the internet were saying that man is he a heroin I could Enzo said something had Enzo said something like on the internet were they thought I was on like drunk were you growing your hair out then no no no you has done that yes no no it was Mikey the way it is now and I was really skinny it was from the Atkins diet and people at Abu Dhabi thought I was on heroin or on underground talking shit on heroin it looks like the crazy thing is how much you train you eat you train a lot but you would eat so bad that you would gain weight you would just go off burritos and you would just go off yeah so now am I kind of diet like part of the day part of the day like how much the day a good 65 70 % well as long as you just maintain yeah you know it's when you let yourself go and then you got to get fucking skinny again that's what happens with dudes and it with girls it happens with everybody that's the hardest thing is getting back in shape you know it's not staying in shape staying in shape is not that bad one get some momentum you keep it going the one thing that's helped me a lot though is my girlfriend cooks for me all the time now she moved in so we rarely go out before man in the middle of Hollywood I choices all night you want Carl's jr. you want jack-in-the-box you know you can get Wendy's all night you can there's so much Taco Bell's right there you have so many choices in it all I gotta do is get in my car and what what got me fat was the place I lived at before you it was terrible parking you gotta sometimes got to punt four blocks down the street just to get a parking so if I had a good parking when I got home after jiu-jitsu I wouldn't didn't want to lose that parking it wasn't worth it that Carl's jr. was not worth losing my parking but then once I got my old official parking man you could leave it anytime just right there 3:00 in the morning ready to go that's right your place used to be brutal for parking yeah I miss that shit how do people live like that that sucks lives like that and I'm thinking like what if you had to poop really bad and you couldn't find a parking spot and it was like shave your pants it's like what we were talking about with all the area around the Improv everywhere you go and those side streets it's all residential only parking and like you're literally not even allowed to park there just you just sang sorry even though this is the street there's no room for regular people you have to live here to park your fucking car yeah because we fucked up and put too many people in one spot can't park that's ridiculous man that's the worst thing in the world about when you do sets in Hollywood I used to park my car in the improv I used to let the valets park it but they let some fucking chick she was she was drunk man and she fucked up my car she just she was pulling it out of a spot and you know it was a really tight little area and she just turned her wheel and hit the gas and just jacked my fucking car she didn't have no insurance today and I'm like why am i letting these people park my car they're obviously not looking after my shit so I stopped doing up that reminded me back in like 2002 when you tore your knee and you couldn't drive your NSX and putting in a neutral in the highway I was driving caravans and shit up to that point and 1972 Ford career it was so funny I've never been seen someone so like breaking down the effect the car has on girls his knee just tore he's sitting in his car I'm trying to help them and he's he's got pain here and he's like fuck he's grinding my clutch I'm taking him to like emergencies not surgery whose day we had to go to get an MRI yeah really the doctor game an MRI immediately we screaming on the top of your lungs cuz I couldn't my fuck my knee up I was just this was the real tears I've had a bunch of different knee injuries but the most painful one is ironically the one that healed the quickest that's the meniscus one once they did the meniscus surgery was like six weeks later I was on the mat again but when I had my ACL torn both times it's not that painful not nearly as painful the meniscus is what's really painful the ACL just kind of snaps and it's fucked and it hurts a little bit and then you can put your legs wobbling like what the fuck and then you go to a doctor and I go you don't have a ligament anymore you have to get an artificial ligament in place and it takes six months before you totally Ile up but the pain is nothing it's like it's not that big a deal the pain of the meniscus tear I had what's called a bucket handle tear and it's called a bucket handle cuz you know how a bucket handle can like flip up and it wouldn't like stop like in the center in the center position well that's what it's like it's like the handle bucket like literally peels up and gets locked in place so the sliver of meniscus is locked and it's tearing and it's just excruciatingly fucking like soft tissue pain it's a really thing I had I don't know what this is called where the top bone in the bottom bone like I twist my leg weird and it hit each other like the thing in the middle I guess the knee socket or something snapped out of place in the top bone hit that bottom bone and then snap right yeah do you see it still fucked up but it still it's still yeah it's it still feels like it's gonna happen again all the time like I'm so paranoid because when that happened I I was filming a home video and when I in the video you just hear me scream like like Bloody Mary and then Bloody Mary like murder it's it's one of those videos my dad has some VHS tapes somewhere fuck out your dad's closets have a video for this story son I never finished the video too so um you did you break a ligament actually say he said that I mean this was a long time ago but he said it you know he told me what happened and I had to wear like this cast thing for a long time maybe like six months or something like that just it ever since then six months huh yeah it was a while Wow yeah the body is so goddamn fragile I was in we were in Pittsburgh and we're watching dudes on motorcycles with no helmets they don't have a helmet long they're just watch them drive around my god you silly fuck like your body's so fragile you don't even know you if you knew what could happen to your head if you hit the ground would you be really in the world those dice would you really be willing to just get on a bike with a bunch of people and trust them not to slam into you trust them not to smash your fucking head off the concrete really you didn't just trust them the problem with motorcycles is that the reason you get it it's because you want chicks to see you on the motorcycle helmet they can't see you so that's why there's hardly guys they like hat found a loophole they have a cap of the fucking top yeah they want their face exposed man it always goes into that with you it always goes to press checks dudes were in that NSX hey we're driving right I'm gonna fucking pain and he's I've been dropping it down fourth gear on the highway and she doesn't know what the fuck he's doing right but while he's looking around he's like damn chick so looking at me man girls are looking at me they never look at me in my fucking Bronco look at me look that bitch right there she's looking at me man she's right next lure Explorer I'm sorry dude when we would drive we would drive your Barracuda the big fish a catfish six fish sick fish old man wanted a sucker day they were like pulling up going hole everybody that wasn't you know have you ever been in his car driving around oh yeah everybody says holy shit like 15-year old dudes that are rappers and shit look over and trip out you know it's too ridiculous it's too much it sounds like a Tyrannosaurus Rex sound like machine-gun rabbit yeah how does it sound do it forget my friend just did a photo shoot with that kick from the original Knight Rider car from the 80s though a photo shoot yeah yeah now it's like thinking wow some guy owns KITT and he writes it out like something yeah I think it's an Asian businessman and he rents it out and I'm thinking wow they actually let KITT mix with porn that's weird to me after 25 years it's like public domain or so I wonder if it is some things are right on some movies public domain and like books are public domain yeah you can do anything you want with those you can start your own TV station and just put nothing because no one wants it yeah it costs dude it costs more to just get to keep the license going then if they're worth really so no one owns them literally you can't nobody yeah nobody else really nobody owns the public domain how many movies you think dude I'm not an expert in this family I'm sure there's nobody in a public public domain you gotta get this shit registered every 25 years or so yeah and if there's no one there to register and most of those guys are in China and they're dead from like the Triads I had a friend of mine from my old Taekwondo days my friend Larry Jones Larry Joe was a theme for Chinese kung-fu movies and he would always go and he would like come to the gym the next day oh man I saw this badass Shaolin he's shouting seven months he would like every week it would be some new fucking kung fu movie that he just saw and loved and he would get together with a bunch of his friends from the gym and they would all go watch his kung fu mood they get excited and watch these it was like real fighters they were going to watch these shitty kung fu movies and I tried to watch them I never got it I tried man I sat down I tried that's the problem buddy you got Bruce Lee first is not into kung fu theater I don't think so how could you I tried you know today I think I don't know what it is really that's just my guess but after seeing Bruce Lee right fuck these guys everyone's trying to I mean that was Bruce lies he's more than one right how many eyes were there how famous was he yes was he famous like in China was he gonna throw a lot of models you know maybe for a couple of years he's probably got laid he was like dan Cortese that's how dumb these people think the people are that they could just put a fake Bruce Lee up and a good percentage of them are not even gonna know the difference is it because they he was almost playing a character would you think like maybe like he was almost like a James Bond well when they put our Game of Death they only had ten minutes of that movie with Bruce Lee true the whole movie is not Bruce Lee it's a if you want Game of Death the beginning is but they the beginning of Game of Death is the end of Return of the Dragon they start with the Chuck Norris fight so it looks like a Bruce Lee movie okay but that's another movie so they replayed that scene again the exact same thing Emma jig that's how the movie starts out Game of Death starts the only thing that's Bruce Lee is the end where he goes up and fights fights Kareem abdul-jabbar that's all him but everything the whole movie is an imposter I need to see that no I need to see that again - yeah and there's the scene where the loosely sitting at his dressing room cuz this is how they started they start the movie with the the fight with Chuck Norris and return of the dragon right and then the movie is about a famous soup martial arts superstar loosely based on Bruce Lee so once all the credits are over and the fights over they go cut and then Bruce Lee like a fake Bruce Lee walks off set like all of a sudden that was just a movie that fight scene and it's about a famous actor and the Chinese triads are trying to control him or whatever so from that point on it's a fake Bruce Lee the whole time he's sitting in his dressing room he's talking to this guy this mafia guy and they put a picture a still picture like right where his head's at there's a still picture so it's a Bruce a picture of Bruce Lee on a you could see the guys in the shoulders moving it's a moving picture that's how bad it was and everybody wanted to see this I was seven years old when that shit came up I don't know the difference they fooled me they fooled the kids one minute Jimmy Mac's in that special effect actually for adults too and the whole movie he's got big shades on and they never get any closer it's always from the side he's got I wonder how much that movie cost bucks ad how much does that cost to make and they probably made a fuckload of money with it too right because people probably said your movie they didn't have fucking Yelp back then they didn't have fandora you know I mean you can't like find out how bad a movie was by just going online like now well now you find out real quick if a movie's a piece of shit it's like it could be out a couple hours and people are already freaking out about it even before because people get screeners they get they get they get previews before people go to previews you can't sneak a shitty movie through anymore but banking that damn pathetic took weeks before everybody figured out that movie sucked yeah the kids I thought it was great as the end a class it's still Bruce Lee they ended strong he fights Dan Inosanto Kareem abdul-jabbar some Taekwondo guy all that shit's beautiful yeah that was pretty badass and that's it that's really the only seen people like remember when they watched as a kid you my memory Game of Death he's fighting Kareem abdul-jabbar that's really all you remember you'd remember all the bullshit but when me and my friends are talking about the best Bruce Lee movie move ever to what the the best Bruce Lee movie ever was actually done by the fake Bruce Lee your guy was holding him a guy was holding him like this he came from behind and held him and the fake Bruce Lee did a backflip kicked him and landed back on his feet it was a fake Bruce Lee the famously from I wonder if that one dude if that he still goes around you remember that seeing Danny looks like Bruce Lee's not Bruce Lee it's me we need a documentary on the fake Bruce Lee Bruce smiling all of us well we need the documentary on the guy who did that flip but that was that was cuts in it so it wasn't just some wild kamikaze type shit but that was in the top three if that's Bruce Lee moves ever it wasn't when I met Chuck Norris it was one of the few times in my life where I was genuinely freaked out like like I'm shaking his head I'm gonna meet him and he knows who I am he's talking to me and I'm like holy shit this is Chuck Norris like this is really Chuck Norris and the thing I thought about was that movie with him and Bruce Lee I'm like this motherfucker fought Bruce Lee in a movie you know what I'm saying I mean that is a crazy scene - he's like the badass karate guy and and Bruce Lee in him go at it holy shit that was a good scene it was hard to top Bruce Lee yeah I used to like just Norris because Chuck Norris was down with Bruce Lee cuz by association yeah like even though Chuck Norris wasn't as dynamic as Bruce Lee he was still in a Bruce Lee movie you know and there was some cool shit about him cuz he was American War cowboy boots and fucking cowboy hat and he jacked guys up sort of like a karate but American style you know I thought it was I was all right lone wolf McQuade him and David Carradine come on son you remember Billy Jack yes the cowboy with the roundhouse kick known for his roundhouse you remember he would tell the guy I'm gonna put this foot upside your head and there's another thing you can do about it I've never thinking of that is fucking a white guy talking shit nobody wasn't really white he was an American Indian nobody under 30 remember Billy Jack Lee there was always these hippie bitches they were like around him bothering him all the time you know he would like take care of the hippies and he was like half Indian or something wasn't he some more that'd be cool if Chuck Norris flew around in Airwolf you know like that was his modes of transportation if he flew around the giant a helicopter from the 80s remember those have been held do we ever talk about those it seems like we did where helicopters were really popular in the 80s and there was like blue thunder air wolf and there's all these sitcoms about helicopters drama shows drama shows yeah what the fuck was that it's like you know it's like sort of we were talking about Knight Rider fucking's you know a show about a car right but at least that car talk yeah this back then was just like no that's just a badass helicopter yeah remember was Royce Ryder Ryder yeah Blue Thunder yeah Thunder stupid movie about a giant hell what the fuck man it's it's amazing when you go back just a couple of decades and look at the shit that people are willing to tolerate people who so stupid no if you want evolution man you need look no further than human television look look look at TV shows for white 250s go try to watch like Andy Rooney I was watching a clip online it was from The Andy Griffith Show and it was um it was Jack Nicholson Jack Nicholson was playing a bad guy and Ron Howard was in it when he was a little boy oh yeah when he was Opie who knew before he was opening prio pre Opie what what was who was he was opion Happy Days yes before what was he on the other show on The Andy Griffith Show he was the little brat kid a little boy yes a little boy and Jack Nicholson is there and it's like it's and it's so stupid it's it's just so obviously dumb you know it's like if you had it on today you would just start throwing shit at the TV go what the fuck kind of acting is what the fuck kind of shows us who wrote this stupid thing but back then that shit flu that was those entertainment I can't watch fucking anything in black and white except for Twilight Zone I can still watch that because it didn't happen they never had they sometimes had happy endings but you never knew if it was gonna be a bad ending sad ending happy ending I love that but one show one ninety-nine point nine of any everything back then to me my opinion suck you're right I Love Lucy every now and you watch that there was some clever writing and I Love Lucy I mean that thing stood the test of time still showing it now it's still on no you're right most things suck but there's a few that fucking that really standout still like the hustler you ever watched the hustler with Jackie Gleason and Paul Nouveau the movie yeah with who the fuck played Bert the guy from shit I forget but a very famous actor as well and you see it's fucking incredible Horry you know that woman she played a chick in the movie it's a fucking great story it's like it's a good well acted movie and it's from like 1963 like there's a few Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf that's Elizabeth Taylor back when she was hot as fuck Elizabeth tail was hot as fuck back then and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a badass fucking movie that completely holds the test of time if you watch that movie today be like well it was a good guy moving and it's like from 1960 or something like that there's a few movies from back then when they really nailed it they really got it right do you remember that movie I forget the name of it I had I think Joe Piscopo during his big when he was kind of famous in the early 80s and it used to have like this little documentary in the middle of Johnny dangerously is that the name of it yeah and Johnny dangerously was um what the fuck is his name Joe Piscopo yeah Joe Piscopo and what was the other guy the good the guy was Batman the first Batman Michael key Michael key yeah yeah anybody remember the the cartoon uh as a kid I remember thinking how cool this was that your penis in you and it was like this animated cartoon of this penis and two balls walking around and check out this penis so time it's pretty George C Scott was the other guy who was in The Hustler it's a fucking great movie and that's 1961 man son leave it 63-61 they were idiots back then damn they were stupid really mad I mean it's it's a good movie but even though it's a good movie you could still tell I mean how goofy people were Beverly look at Richard Nixon you watch him talk if your bullshit radar doesn't go off when you're watching Richard Nixon just any kind of speech it like it's like George W Bush is gonna say if you if you yeah you can't say that because of Bush the real problem with with dump out it would write lying politicians is there's a lot of fucking dumb people out there man yeah that's and George W Bush is the master for sure he's the master of the dump the dummies but Richard Nixon was pretty bad - everyone else is not that bad Bill Clinton smooth Obama smooth as hell even Ronald Reagan was smooth as hell you know Richard Carter he sounds like he's a smart guy Richard Carter you know that fucking guy by the way Oh be Richard Nixon it just he sounded like a smart guy but he was oh he sounded paranoid and insincere in everything he said Richard Nixon Richard Nixon yeah he was a he was a piece of shit he was a terrible person yeah he was a he was one of those guys that got away with shit back in the time where you could get away with anything you know the days before they killed Kennedy you know till you know till Nixon's era and you know you go deep in the Reagan if you were getting away with all kinds of crazy shit you could never get away with now you know then they got away with a lot of dirty fucking politics back then to what Nixon did was totally standard stuff well he got impeached for at Watergate who's something they all did man we've been doing that to the Russians for ever you know I have a buddy yes we shouldn't say his name who used to work for the US Embassy in Russia and he would find all these it was like standard they would find all these audio detection devices all over the place or audio recording devices the Russians were listening into them they found these Russians things that they made were so complicated that they operated on the swaying of the building that that's what powered them the swaying of the building back and forth actually charged them up and powered them so they had no external source of power the days were like this was so complicated he's like when when they found that stuff he's like we didn't even know the shit existed so this has been standard people have been spying on people and listening in to people it's just what they do every fucking politician every president did it you don't think Kennedy did it you know everybody likes to look at Kennedy like he's a rosy you know beautiful figure from our liberal back you know a liberal past but Kennedy's family was all fucking moonshine runners they made all their money selling illegal booze and there was all sorts of people that were just like the tea party people were today trying to get rid of Obama going crazy about the democratically elected president a Democrat president rather they were doing the same thing for Kennedy they were wanted for treason they'd make posters with Kennedy's face on it nobody likes to think about that shit because it happened so long ago all the presidents I've ever existed he's the one who had the worst reputation as far as womanizing oh yeah dude if they found out what he's doing today he was probably just straight Clinton in bitches yeah more than Clinton you think he wasn't say Clinton because where Clinton Clinton move is Clinton moves you get a girl loan just whip your cock out yeah you know and then they scream and fucking run away from you and freak out and you go to jail that's a Clinton move he's the only president that probably rocked it that way he probably he's probably Obama in that shit you know fuck around with these interns offer them in their family a spot the underground cities when shit goes down they ain't gonna say shit was a firm believer in the underground cities oh yeah I mean I've seen I've seen underground bunkers and bases and shit like that but you're a front you're a believer in that chili you want to go there if the shit goes down I'm trying to I'm trying to give you a couple VIP passes dude the moment the moment the first the first atomic bomb blows or the first asteroid hits I want to be under that thing I want to be at the epicenter wherever that bomb goes off I want to be at the part where all they find of you is a shadow that's what I want to be I want to be no no look I'm gonna I'm gonna follow my human instincts and keep on keepin on but if I had to choose between living a life of fucking cancer and radiation and zombies or getting hit in the head with meteor yeah I'll take getting hit in the head by a meteor what's your take on the zombie situation it's funny how many fucking shows and movies and things there's people that believe they're real there's no show they're talking about preparing against zombies well yeah I mean look the reason why is because we know about so many parasitic animal in in the in the animal kingdom that changed the host and turned the host into something that it's not we know of there's a aquatic worm we've talked about before take a drink if you're playing the podcast we've talked about before reprograms a grasshoppers brain this aquatic worm it infests the grasshopper reprograms its brain and then convinces the grasshopper to drown to convinces it to jump in the water and drown so that it can be born and it busts out of this thing's body cavity so it makes it commit suicide so we know that there's all sorts of parasites that change the host and get the host to do their bidding and we also know about rabies we know that you know dogs get rabies that's a rap song they're dead that's it you got to kill that dog they did not even cure them you can't cure a dog from rabies you got to kill that fucking thing and if you get rabies you could die too so rabies will turn a dog into a vicious fucking animal like your own pet I had a dog that had distemper once and he tried to bite me man a Doberman Pinscher dolmen pictures snapping at me I was like 12 years old I was stuck in my living room with his dog that was sick and I realized like halfway through like looking at this dog's eyes there's something wrong here I'm like this thing is really gonna get me this is my dog my dog's gonna kill me I really really thought it was gonna kill me we had to get the dog put down scary shit people that are dead they're buried those people retarded that's not gonna happen but what could happen is you know look there's all these people that are getting their heads chopped off and frozen you know about all that cryogenics you know but all yes well there's people that are getting their whole bodies frozen as well like Walt Disney did apparently they freeze your whole body and so that one day they can bring you back I believe regenerate your body tissue I believe it well that might be when zombies happen yeah maybe your souls long gone and all sudden you just got this this tissue with no consciousness that needs food all the time and eats anything in front of it I'll just grab a person yeah yeah just start eating you if you don't see why I don't wanna be cremated that's the exact reason I wanna I want to kill people I could be a cool zombie zombies like the hanging out having flesh bro do you not learn listen to the movie and maybe maybe there would be the first generation of people that came back with a memory to life when candy died and so looking back yeah remember when he's playing video games in heaven to kill the Mormons right yeah but Kenny died like a hundred times yeah that's ridiculous but in within the episode he came back to life that's never happened oh oh really yeah hmm yeah every week he just came back and no one said a word about it Robot Chicken they had an episode where Walt Disney comes back to life and he became like this monster that just ate Puerto Rican babies that's pretty funny the real possibility is the possibility that was expressed in that 28 days later that someone comes out with some fucking genetically altered super virus that attacks the human body and literally turns you into some fucking freaky crazed monster animal thing like this hard a kiss yeah those fucking movies were awesome man especially 20 28 weeks later was okay it was pretty good it's pretty good but it was following one of the greatest horror movies of all time you know there was no way can fucking really top that that that thought it's very terrifying to people the thought that one day you wake up and the whole world's fucked and there's people out there and when you're sleeping they're coming and they have axes and shit they want to eat you you know I mean that's that's a terrible fucking thought the dot that you know people eating human flesh you know it's been documented very recently that they think that it was it was done like ritualistically for thousands and thousands of years and that people have been eating people like whether they killed them in battle or that small children they found small children with tool marks on their bodies that they're positive inside their brains that in the brain cavity that they're positive was someone scooping and scraping out their brains cutting off their meeting eating it so people have been yeah people have been preying on other people for forever that's look man when people are starving to death you know if you're living like thousands and thousands of years before written language and people are starving to death and you're a bunch of fucking skin wearing savages and you look over the hill and there's a bunch of other skin wearing savages you look back at your babies that are screaming in agony because there's no food in their body and you say I'm just gonna go kill these motherfuckers and eat them and people did that shit I bet did that shit all the time they probably ate their own babies too they did eat there I'm sure they did the animals do it all the time if animals do it for sure somewhere a human before it became the human being of circa 2011 for sure someone someone did everything that an animal's done animals always eat babies I had hamsters man and they got wet tail I think it was what it's called it's a disease I was a little kid and all the sudden our sweet mom a hamster started eating her fucking babies man and eating them brands first like just attacking the brain my mom was like get out of the room I don't want you seeing this get out of here oh and I had a pussy and this fucking hamster is just holding on to her babies and just brain are you kidding oh dude it was fucking deep man it was a real dude it was deep it was so hard to watch I was I couldn't believe what I was seeing this mom a hamster that I always loved you know we had the momma and the you know and the baby boy and they got together and they made babies in the baby somehow or another god this fucking disease and the mother just killed them in front of us killed them in a ton bro it was fucked I never looked at that bitch the same way again she was no longer my friend much you or you're you rocking it to different set of rules you know I can't really I can't just pick you up and pet you now I want to bash your brains on the sidewalk you fucking creep and baby-eating creep you know what the fuck man you ever have those balls where you put the hamster in and one let go around the circle and stuff like that yeah you know I was so mad at my sister once and I didn't know she had her hamster in the ball and so I'm like take this and I kicked it really hard thinking I was just gonna break the the ball the hamster just flew right out of it though and it was okay but it was the most scariest thing ever it was so lived yeah but was so gross is you know when you're a kid and you see something disgusting and you're just like how adorable hamsters this motherfuckers filming a video and he falls down screaming like a little bitch twisted uni in a funny way and this hamster you kick it across the room and it's okay Bob doesn't even need to go to the doctor yeah hamsters so speaking of people and their affection for animals I was in Pittsburgh this last weekend for the UFC and it was the same time as a furry convention said I don't know if you're aware of this because I certainly his fuck wasn't I had heard of the term furry I'd heard it like very very abstractly I never sat down had a conversation with anyone about it it was just something that I may be heard on the news or maybe saw you know an article on the internet or something that I never paid attention it was like oh there's some people that have a thing about wearing animal clothes and maybe they have sex with animal cause I I had no idea of the depth of this hobby or I don't know what the fuck you would call it you know the with this fascination this this thing that these people have and this is what the ferry does what a furry is is they want to look like a cartoon animal like Bugs Bunny I think the terms ant the anthropomorphic anthropomorphic and what that means is you know human characteristics in an animal's body and so they liked like Wiley coyote cuz he stands up straight and looks like a person you know what that's the shit they're into so they dress in these costumes that make them look like animated cartoon people that are animals you know like dog costumes and Fox costumes and cut ass they're like they look like mascots are things for mascots is the perfect way to describe them they look like mascots and I guess a lot of them are wearing mascot outfits and so that's where they get these things from and they all they do the whole weekend is get together and play like they're animals they don't talk they have their own language of like grunts and certain things that means certain noises like they've created like a sub language in a fake language and when they were staying at the Westin Hotel in Pittsburgh they sold out every fucking room in the hotel okay so it's like 600 rooms and since Berger to Western they're all furries and they requested a giant litter box in the front lobby that's they requested that the West and put in a fucking litter box so this is what these people do they go and get litter boxes and they bring them up in the room and they take shits in their litter boxes they don't use the toilet and they don't wash they like tours if you if you don't wash you stink like an animal and that's what they're trying to do they're trying to smell like animals not all of them some of them very no no there's women into varying degrees of depth to how far you go into this thing they're wearing this fucking crazy out the whole time you know what their bodies look like man they don't talk so you don't know you just know she's wearing a girl's outfit so you assume it's a girl and they have sex with their outfits on and they have a the opening in their crotch they like undo it or velcro or zipper or whatever the fuck they do whip the shit out and just bang each other right there with their outfits on they fuck all the time they fuck crazy my girlfriend's actually before I even heard about this my girlfriend's been actually recently trying to get me to go to our furry party and she's like you know we won't have to have sex with anybody else and they no one will know who you are and we can just fuck it's like an orgy by a bunch of Ferguson wants you to bang her in front of a bunch of other freaks that aren't showering and they're shitting in the litter box yes and she's just for the experience and I part of me almost would do it cuz no one would know who you are you know and and stuff like that and you see all these other but I think just seeing a bunch of people fucking in constitu met will be worth it no no it's like so bad some of them wore diapers too that's the other guy the owner of the hotel was saying that it's a real horror short excuse me a real horror show for the maids the poor mains go in there after these freaks have left those litter boxes and bowls of milk everywhere they order bowls of milk from not the hotel and they have them bring it up and like in a giant bowl and they drink it out of a bowl like a dog yeah I'd be a bunny yeah Eddie Eddie looks into my backyard and he sees just rabbit running around he's like oh my god look it's a bunny you got a bunny he runs and chases it and you you're like oh he's so sweet Bunny's bro that's so funny people would think that's a joke no that's do you think you could kill a bunny to eat it of course you could fuck no not really maybe nah man I don't even like those people say rabbits to jokes and all that shit I don't think that's funny really you really have that much of an affection for rabbits man that's a little loving creature man I mean we have a relationship going on and man I love that fucking thing man I love rabbits they look so cute they're so fucking beautiful and you know they don't they don't meow they don't bark that'll make any noise and they love massages man who doesn't love massage but you know what cats but cats love massages and they're more they asked for it they're more flamboyant and the way they asked for but you kept I've had a cat for I have two cats I pet him for 30 seconds to a minute they're gone they don't want a massage no more not the bunny I guess he's willing to go all night I could pet him he ain't going there's no way you you know my cat spaz yeah that cat you could pet that cat 400 days in a row oh really oh not my cat my cat about I pet him for 30 seconds it's on how they're raised if they're raised with people all the time like my cats been with me since he was a kitten so from the time she was little it's all like yeah and pets and every day it's affection so she associates people with affection but if you you know you're around a cat you just go to work all day and you barely pay attention that fucking cat then the cats like yeah you gonna Pat me and done with you I got shit to do yeah it's not how the cat grows up bunnies are so cute that even their poop is cute but the problem is that I know that was on fear factor we're trying to get people to eat bunny poop that was one of the objectives by the network that's bullshit maybe maybe it would say drink your own piss too there was another one the network rejected rabbit shit don't stink my auntie in it I would totally eat it what nonfat milk my ex-girlfriend had a bunny and the one thing I did notice the negative part was that there was bunny shit everywhere like little rabbit turds every yeah Wow how weird I love that motherfucker how about whole room dedicated to him you have a room in your house dedicated it's already he's got a whole room he doesn't even know he's captured I leave I leave the gate open cuz the gate goes around home because we can't let him chew the baseboard so it's a room but there's a gate all the way around in the room and we leave the gate open he doesn't want to leave he hates leaving that motherfucker I got a bar I got a castle for my got a UFO for if I caught a little internal swarm you were you would make a great dad dude yeah well you don't even know the the love that you have for this bunny is pretty fun it's interesting to see but the love that you would have for a kid would really freak you the fuck out yeah fuck that pony take a quick back seat dear every woman that says that she has I had you know I almost I thought I had it yes months you know that kid he's 15 now and did you meet him at a bar or like no look what happened is I an ex-girlfriend of mine when I was 26 she she got pregnant I thought it was by her you know I thought her new boyfriend got her pregnant but it was there was a kind of gray area when she got pregnant like mm I think you know maybe it could be mine she had a baby your sister calls me up and says hey Moretti had the baby you should come down and check it out it could be yours unlike mine it looks kind of Mexican the whole family thought it looked Mexican that's so I came down and I'm like oh my god I have a son I totally didn't want it we had broken up with her like it was around nine ten months ago or maybe longer and I didn't want to have anything to do it there I mean we were done I had a new girlfriend I was moving on and now this kid could be mine I went to the hospital look at the kid and all babies look the same to me I'm like you guys think it looks Mexican I don't think like yes look look at his face I'm like he looks like me so I go let's take a DNA test then but you had to wait three months before he could pull the amount of blood that you need to take that so I'd wait three months so I broke up with the girl that I was with and I you know I said this is my son I want to be around for the first three months you know so I'm gonna treat him like my son so for three months he he was my son and by the third month when it was we were almost ready to take the test I don't I want him to be mine so bad I'm like man I got a son it's three months let's do this like I was ready to do it let's go and then he turned out obviously that he wasn't mine and I stuck around for a while and me and me and me and the the girlfriend broke up a couple times and we would separate them to come back and see him cuz I was in love with them but um it was like a six-month stretch when I came back and he was around too after we'd break up he's around too and when I got to the house he looked at me and he didn't recognize me he wasn't sure his mom was like look he's the one who took you to the zoo and we're looking to zoo pictures and he's like looking at the zoo pictures and then looking at me he's like you may be like in a year and a half and that look right there I'm like man I got a I got a boat now yeah I got a house the time to do it he doesn't even know who I am anymore I love this little kid you don't know I am I'm gone so that was the guy in the picture no he was in jail yeah that guy was in jail so anyways long story short of course I think about him every now and then like you know I was in love with that kid how would it definitely he's 15 now he's 15 seats in jiu-jitsu I found him on Facebook and I went through all the names there could be I went through a bunch of guys and sent him messages I was like you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna look for this guy Wow so I found him holy shit so I I thought you know we went back and forth a little bit on Facebook and and did you tell him a story no we never talked about it whoa so he doesn't know no his mom his mom's remarried they got a little happy family going I don't want to cause any prob cause staying like that I just wanted to touch base and I you know he doesn't he looks like five or six hours away up north and and and I I got a hold of the nearest jujitsu school around where he lives and I said man you'd be interested in taking jujitsu it's a Paragon it's a Jeff Club you know Jeff Glover some Paragon Paragon affiliate got ahold of the guy I said um you know I I told everyone he's my nephew I didn't really want to get into details it doesn't matter he's not mine you know I thought he was my son for a while I thought you know what I'm gonna get him into jujitsu he's all into it man he's obsessed that's all he loves it so Wow what a crazy story did you ever think what would happen if you decided to just stick around with that little dude yeah man I do I do because at that point within those first three months that was my boy I treated him like you know he was my son I thought he could be my son I thought he could be deep down I was thinking I mean everyone saying he looks like me I don't think he looks like me that's everyone saying he looks Mexican so funny I did so right now you know I didn't even know Eddie was Mexican I thought he was fuckin with me for like the first two years cuz at The Comedy Store you're like I'm half Mexican like no you're not I'm four Mexican or you said something like that to me he used to say he was half yeah you said something else Japanese and half Eskimo famous one Mexican er yeah I used to say that when I was a teenager just because I was an idiot and I wanted to see who would believe it and I'm like wow they have people believe anything did you used to do that with a lot of things you used to like to tell people crazy stories and see how far you can go with it man it still happens I'm in the hole the hole why do you get into doing that man do you have a hard time not doing if you look if you look at qu'atsu and then you look at and then you look at what we did on the Joe show like with 10 foot submit screws let me tell people there's something don't know that's how you what we did we were in Denver and I was doing stand-up and Eddie and Tate and Brian and Duncan we were all hanging out and we were walking and we went through this little shopping area that what is it those six street malls and what it's called whatever the mall is whatever Street it is anyway we're going to this downtown shopping area and we see a wig store 2005 2005 wasn't and just as a goof we decided to go in this wig store and then first of all we were high as fuck and somewhere in this wig store we came up with the idea of having a fake band and that you guys were all gonna wear these wigs so we are everyone bought wigs Tate had this crazy afro wig and you had this crazy wig and everyone decided that we were gonna play a band called ten-foot screws and we even announced the band like as having an after-party in town so people thought that it was like a real band and Eddie goes on stage I get off stage the show's over Eddie goes on stage with fucking wig on and sunglasses we have video of it still right there was a whole show yeah we don't yep which episode is it seven seven yeah how do people find that one just type in Jojo seven but you know it's actually all the episodes were on your website but since you moved the servers now everything's kind of weird it was the word you probably getting too much bandwidth well the premise of it was Joe wanted to put together a reality show based on him going to all these clubs across the nation and his posse and me tade Brian donkey and Ari even Larry back then we were all Larry's our producer was he's an actual reality of origin of the word powerful when you hear me say powerful it's all because there's one dude our friend Larry so we so the show was that called the Joe show you had her on your website we did about 11 or 12 episodes or something and episode 7 we were in Denver we were trying to come up with a premise and then it was it was all about we just we just formed a band so Joe's on stage and we the way we sold it was Duncan would get on stage and would say who's going to the ten-foot screws show tonight that's what we called ten-foot screws and that was Brian's idea and so we wanted it so Duncan was getting everybody in the audience used to the fact that we got ten-foot screws backstage and they're playing a big show at the the whole adult 6-3 to no poyo so people were like oh shit there's a concert tonight I didn't know about this ten-foot screws are they big so then was Ari there too or who else was in there so Duncan was selling it like he would he was like the host he was selling it we got ten-foot screws tomorrow were gonna give away some tickets so I got a stack of half off drinks on Tuesday night I got a two stacks of him and Duncan introduced me I was the lead singer I was the total douchebag lead singer I was like just basically playing the singer of Oasis the backstage so we I got up on stage and said who wants these tickets to the show tomorrow backstage they were going nuts so like Paul Stanley I divided the crowd to one side I said just like Paul static okay this side let me hear the noise I got one too let me hear the noise it was wrong and then I stopped him and I go this side it was just a total Paul Stanley 1985 ripoff most bands who find that finally find that and queue it up just that part of it because when I saw reduced its into the audience dudes were flying headfirst over tables that were scrambling only to find at the bar Tuesday night half off drinks and you're some crazy man wearing a wig for a pair that doesn't exist yes so when the concert let out people had a walk by backstage it was a weird the club was set up weird were never walking out next to backstage so we had the door open and dudes are walking bike on where's that bad so we grabbed one dude and we pulled and we pulled in maybe three dudes and we pulled them closed the door now they're backstage with ten-foot screws and me and Tate or just bags we're total douche bags do you remember those fucking questions you got now that I'm thinking about it was a great guy who got down on his knees yes he wanted it he was astound to do whatever to hang out with the band he didn't he thought we were a real band so we got him to do crazy shit he just wanted to hang out with the best oh we're gonna have to get on your knees okay you're gonna have to pray for us pray with us like you know fans sometimes break it up before they go thank you Jesus any word replete thank you Jesus and you said for this dig about the suck he's like 6 foot 4 he was so intimidating the guy didn't want to like fire back right state sitting there looking like a monster you know and then we got girl you probably thought that you were about to try to get him to suck your dick I keep really probably thought that I mean you think about it you're some fucking wacko living in Colorado you know some dude who's willing to go to some green room for some band that he doesn't even know I never heard of before some fans doesn't even exist he's on his knees praying back and forth you in his head when you said that for this dick I'm about the son he probably thought oh I fucked up I done fucked up I'll do it but damn I didn't I'm not gonna like it and that was a great episode - and then the other good episode was when we were in Boston remember in Boston and Ari soul or Ari and Duncan they both sold to the audience they open up and they said backstage were we're auditioning for the Joe Rogan live stories they're gonna film and we're looking for guys to play Joe Rogan we want authentic guys from Boston so the guys in the audience are thinking oh shit they're auditioning to play for Joe Rogan I think you could do it you could do it so people lined up and we had a fake audition like I'm this bad probably shouldn't talk about this because I think what you did was illegal was it yeah I'm pretty sure you did I'm sorry yeah we probably just didn't really happen we deny though yeah yeah this is all in another we mentioned we deny this parody Bravo does not seek to get sued at this moment in time this is all fiction Duncan was the director never had with it he'd never happened this didn't take place he can't can be saying I think probably you just farted no I didn't know I smell it too no I did not did you fart you wouldn't do that would you listen this is not helping the podcast at all not one moment you're so seventies unfound a bull unfindable well we have it somewhere right yeah somewhere yeah it's not even worried that the location it was on was on your website oh I'm sure I do on is there a chance that you'd lost that forever yeah I really doubt it well I've had a hard drive died on me Wow we need to find that man because that was that was a classic for sure somebody saved it I've gotta be someone out there that's a I'm a hundred percent sure I have it but it's just finding it those on those things don't make me laugh anymore those tricking people things like jackass type things now shouldn't say jackass like Punk'd type things they don't make me laugh anymore they used to make me laugh you know like the Jamie Kennedy experiment I thought that show was hilarious guys gone nuts used to make me laugh but now I don't want to watch that stuff I don't want to watch people get lied to I don't know what what it is I became a pussy it became super sensitive I don't like watching that yeah like you know you're taking advantage of somebody for entertainment it's not a change I like I like my my poo bury flashlight joke that gets me every time somebody does that very flashlight yeah I told you to sigh I have a flashlight at my house and then this guy gave me this thing called liquid ass oh yeah make people smell your fucking I don't make it I'm just like hey you should try got the new boo berry flashlight smells like blueberries that's not that funny it is funny when you see them do it there I've seen video you think in real life it's funnier just cuz you get to watch the real sickness I don't know it makes me giggles the smell making some seeing somebody's face when they're smelling poop just used to make me laugh that kind of shit usually doesn't make me laugh as much anymore the premise has got to be good the best one recently is a teeb you know Jason Tebow his girlfriend Danielle she never did it so she opened it up and she smelled it she's like oh it smells like a homeless persons underwear or something like that and then I'm like put your finger in it and I had just poured a new fresh thing of liquid ass inside of it so she puts her finger and kids all over her handle and smell like poop you're 12 years old this guy's 36 years old do you believe that 36 year old 12 year old motherfuckers gonna be dressing up like Winnie the Pooh next week banging his girlfriend a room full of strangers she's gonna be dressed up like a little fog that would you would you admit though that that's going to be interesting to see oh yeah listen I would go no doubt about it especially if you know I knew for sure that the crotch and the ass of my thing was zipped up right nobody could get at me right you know I would go I would just think they'd be crazy though man I think they just do they shit to each other and they just like they could get like really uncomfortable I think some of them are probably pretty normal but I think whenever you get an opportunity to completely pretend to be somebody else you get to dress up at some outfit you don't even talk everyone agrees to not talk you get to see like how wacky some minds are some people's brains are fucking fried you know and you kind of put yourself at the mercy of being around those people without being able to filter them socially you know if we're all sitting around talking after 5-10 minutes we all kind of figure out how we're each other's you know vibes coming from we might do something that's prizes us you know if you find out someone's a little weirder than you thought but for the most part you get a kind of vibe and some people get a vibe immediately okay I don't want to talk to that guy well when that guy's dressed up like Wiley coyote you don't ever get that vibe yeah you're gonna have that one Wiley coyote guy walking around creeping everybody out maybe that's what excites him fuck yeah I bet a lot of them look I think like that would be like a great thing for a serial killer a great thing for a serial killer would be go and hang around with a bunch of other people that are dressing up like this fucking weirdo outfit you know it's weirdo animal thing and you could wear one of those weird no animal things and just infiltrate them and then hang out with them in a way that other people are never willing to hang out with the bunny serial killer like I would assume that most serial killers like you around them you'd be tripped out by them like most of them like you would get a weird vibe from them most of them right wouldn't you assume I mean you think that serial killers would be able to just like sneak on by you or do you think you would get like a weird vibe from I think I would definitely be able to get a weird vibe in somebody but of course I have no idea you have no idea where it's all speculation actually if you have a lot of friends the more friends you have in the more people you come in contact with you can spot those in a second like people that look at these all the time mm-hmm spot them fake ones good ones all day yeah yeah yeah you're right if you have a bunch of different friends and you run a bunch to people and if you're honest that to me I think is the big one if you're a real honest person and you're honest in the way you communicate with people you can you pick up deceptive behavior very quickly because it just seems off you have your guard down you're relaxed you're open and then you see something that's like just not quite real just something about what you're saying it seems like bullshit you know I think psychedelics also helps that sense too because you actually see the person's inner soul at certain points of in doing tsegga dogs or you could see their energy and ever since you see that you're that feel that feeling I think you kind of have that feeling in the back of your head sure you ever go to movies when you're high yeah you know how when you could tell that they're bad yeah dude I want I saw the Hulk of the Eric Bana Hulk an Eric Bana is a great actor don't get me wrong he's in a movie chopper he's a bad motherfucker in that movie but in the hawk there was some scenes where he didn't really have much to do and it didn't seem like was the most focused you know there's a few scenes where him and this chick are talking and I'm listening to the two of them talking later this is so not real like I remember in the movie theater going this like sort of Wars acting air is just so fake it seems like so you're not committed to what you're saying you're not thinking about what you're saying but it's because the weed that we just lets you tune into it yeah I know but it's it's that way with a conversation to you ever you know you've been high before when you you feel like someone's lying to you and you it feels like even more so it's even more shocking and weird if you if you're vulnerable and you're you know a little high maybe a little touch of paranoia and then you realize that someone's lying any like they just feels fucking gross yes yes yes I don't know how to break this to you though dude I got it from amazon.com okay it's guaranteed it's legit what are the word get it from Peru's conspiracy Crystal Skull that's what Big Foot oh no big foots not a bad one man you know there's an animal channel show right now so Finding Bigfoot or something like that on the animal planet or animal yeah I've seen the commercials because one video I was in Spokane this past weekend and as we're landing in the Spokane Airport you know you're like the forest and the pine trees and and you know I started thinking about soft squash and look like I'm gonna ask the guys at my seminar what they think you know so in the beginning of seminar I go by show of hands who believes in Sasquatch this is really kind of nobody to school the Eddy's running this is how he starts off in the car I want to know this nobody raised their hand so I'm like shit none of you guys believe in sasquatches holy shit so I'm thinking right there okay if these people live here in Spokane small city in the woods if they don't believe it then a couple guys start going well you know you never know because edition because that I go wait a minute so you're saying you kind of believe it and I go okay by show of hands who thinks that maybe they exist they all raise their hands whoa they all I go really they just didn't want to raise their hands initially because they didn't want you know they're probably ridiculed in school well here some here's some weird facts first of all there's 250 different Native American names for sasquatch 250 different names for this big hairy man that lives in the woods and the primary the the big predominant you know group of sightings is in the Pacific Northwest do you think if they had the internet back then one back then the only one name right you know it's 250 people talked about and they all made up their own name well no they had a bunch of different languages too that's the Indian name I saw Squatch McHenry yeah well the reason why it's interesting is because so many different names exist for it because of there's no other mythical creatures in the Native American like that I don't think they have like a mythology that has like it may be different Indians do and some of them do and some don't but for the most part I don't think it's like you know the Greeks had all these fake gods and all these different you know Griffin's and all these different things that they had created there was obviously a lot of fiction going on I don't think there's that much fiction in the Native American folklore so when there's all these different names for this one animal it makes you go who maybe there was a thing like that at one point in time and then there's so many fucking sightings of these things and that makes you go hmm maybe well what the fuck would it be you know how could there be an ape that no one's ever heard of then you find out that it's not an ape that no one's ever heard of there actually was an eight foot tall erect giant ape called Gigantopithecus that actually lived in Asia and lived in Asia as recently as a hundred thousand years ago and they think that this thing may have calmed down the Bering Strait along with American or along with Native Americans rather when people first came to America America ten thousand years ago half of North America was under a mile-high sheet of ice so there was a connection actually between US and Russia and Asia and animals would come across that connection that Bering Strait and that's how people supposedly got here and they think that it's very possible that at one point in time this now extinct animal that they know exists made that trip as well this animal they say it definitely exists that was just really tall cursing no it's called Gigantopithecus they have they found this thing because they found an extraordinarily large tooth and one of these Chinese markets somewhere and it was a tooth that they knew as a primate tooth but it was so large they couldn't believe that it you know it was a human's and so they tried to figure out what it was early man what the fuck it was and then they found some other bones and then eventually discovered that there was an actual animal called Gigantopithecus hmm so what about argument that you don't find you know find my heirs either man ever you don't find dead bears the bones if there's a small population of them if there's a small population of them and one of them died things that died there's a video a time-lapse video of Africa which is obviously much more predatory than the Pacific Northwest but in this time-lapse video of Africa an elephant dies and these hyenas start tearing this elephant apart and even some of some Lions actually scavenged a little bit the things gone into three days and 72 hours is gone there's nothing nothing exists and it's a fucking elephant who's eating the bone everything they're all just chewing everything up they all just take things away the hyenas smash bones hyenas they have like some of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom and the reason why is because they're scavengers they smash bones and you know bite off chunks of meat from the bones hyenas are just ruthless cunts they're just they're they're the fucking total cunts of the animal kingdom they're just mean vicious fucking horrible animals that screech and laugh and the females are larger than the males the reason being is because the males are so evil they eat their babies all the time so to keep the males from eating the babies the females have to be larger than the males and the females have a fake dick they have a giant faux penis and they mount the males and dominate them with this fake dick it's a giant like arm hanging from between their legs it's the creepiest shit you've ever seen this giant female who's bigger than the male humps the male and dominates him it's a matriarchal society I want a fake dick you've got a real one though Bryan went to if you look up Gigantopithecus though they have skulls about that I thought it was just like a caveman well you know they don't have a full skull you know but they have enough that they piece together what it would look like you know they have bones and various you know parts of jaws I know video yeah but then once anymore they probably don't exist anymore they probably did exist like maybe even just a few hundred years ago and they probably died off or there might be a few of them out there it's really possible the thing if you went to Spokane you know that as you fly over that Pacific Northwest it really occurs to you how fucking dense that shit is there is so much forest up there it's hard for you to wrap your head around it's hard for you to wrap your head around over an hour of flying through the air and it's still forests and that's what it is up there I mean it's some dense dense shit so if you think that they've absolutely done a survey in an account of everything that lives in that forest you're crazy there's no way they have they just killed the fucking Jaguar or a panther rather in Connecticut they thought that there was no Panthers on the East Coast for a long time they think the last one that believed they killed in New Hampshire and like the 1800s you know when the the settlers first came to the East Coast they eradicated most of the mountain lions but they just killed one in Connecticut a hundred and forty pounder and they saw it there was a spotting of one in New York 20 miles away from that could have been the same panther because they've known - they're known to travel like a hundred miles in a day sometimes so it could have been the same panther that went 20 miles away but they don't I don't know where this thing came from it he could have been a pet I could have been a pet but it also could have been something that was living in the fucking woods yeah it's really possible they did used to exist they're so hard to find man you know I I saw one when I lived in Colorado but you know it's it's fairly rare to see one you know I've talked to people who lived in Colorado for years and never saw one but there's plenty of people that have but they've got a documented population of thousands of mountain lions up there you know it's not like they're scarce they're just kind of crafty they're crafty animals and that's way more populated than the Pacific Northwest you know if you're living in a place like like you know Spokane or any of those areas where they have those Sasquatch sightings it's always like northern cow it's always like the rainforest man there's some fucking sounds that these guys have recorded but it could be hoaxes but people who have studied these sounds mm-hmm like primatologist have studied these sounds they said they're primate in nature you know they don't know what the fuck it is these guys are camping out in the woods and they hear these screams and these screeches in the night who knows the thing that has me curious is that there's an actual animal and there's pictures of this thing look at this this is this is Gigantopithecus I mean look at it it's goddamn Bigfoot man I mean if the real animal is a Bigfoot yeah it's an animal that absolutely existed that hoax is based off of probably it could be it could be it could be it could very well be a hoax for sure or it could be there's a big fucking ape out there what would you think if it did exist bro here's the thing if that fucking thing existed it would be in a cage right next to the gorillas at the zoo and nobody would give a fuck it's because it's a mystery that's so intoxicating to people we have this weird thing where we want things that are secret we want things that we don't know yet oh I don't know is it real is it real and we want to uncover these fucking secrets this deep desire to do that more than to accumulate knowledge like people have a much much stronger desire to find secrets like ghosts somthing retarded like that like who the fuck cares it ghosts have never killed anybody you know you know you don't get anything from goes you know you can't record them on film everybody that sees and they all sound like they're full of shit you know you really believe in ghosts man you're gonna dedicate your time to ghosts seriously there's what I was gonna say when there's all this shit out there that is real and it's fascinating some an incredible shift in discovering you know they believe that there may be small black holes traveling through our galaxy and that can pass right through the Sun then you go through the Sun and we won't even notice it we would see a little blip a little blip out there and they would just pass right through the Sun they know that there's a fucking RV sides asteroid that just whizzed by our planet just the other day just yesterday I think it was like really close between us and the moon went fucking flying by in the same orbit the same place as satellites are that's how close it was it's RV sized I mean you know that's pretty small as far as as far as asteroids go but if it hit if it hit a city or something like that yeah but that would have gone through our whatever shit atmosphere yeah mr. Burton now maybe depends on what it's made out of they don't all burn out the really scary ones are the ones that are made out of iron yeah you know there's some there's some that are made I mean comets when you see the trail of a comment that's because it's mostly ice you know that's water that's there's so much fucking water in comments at that trail is actually the water vapor like coming off this giant fucking hunk of ice those are not nearly as terrifying as the ones that are all iron you know the ones that are all water and all sorts of other other shit you know as they're getting close a lot of its gonna go away but you know even when it blows up in the atmosphere even when it arose in the atmosphere sometimes it still produces insane damage man like there's an area of the Soviet Union that was hit by a meteor in I think it was the turn of the century and it's called Tunguska you know that's the the area and there's photos of just flattened miles and miles of trees I mean it just has fucked like they got hit by a nuclear bomb man and there was no actual asteroid by the time it got to earth it had been eaten up by the atmosphere those fucking things were terrifying man I want to know if a ghost kills it goes then you die and you're on the same level as the ghost can you then kill that Ghost and he goes into another ghost level you mean if a ghost kills a person you become a ghost can I take that go SAS for killing you yeah and then you killed the ghost in Ghost World can't kill ghost oh yeah so there's no died in a movie that's the thing about ghosts that's so scary you can like get rid of them if you have a good priest a good priest who loves his mother but if you don't have that the fuck man you can't even can't kill him you have to be able to kill a ghost in a ghost level because it has to be a third ghost thing can't kill him bro that Ghost level would be really crowded then sing about ghosts is that they have to trick you in a dying you have to like get scared and fall down flights of stairs that shit you have to get scared back up into an open elevator shaft that's how ghosts kill you they can't really do shit there's just bluffers you know it's funny this Ghost Hunters is a real TV show one one this is like a bunch of is it more than one dude there's a ton of ghost shows there's a ton of go shows and they're all exactly the same it's all three stupid white people and occasionally there's a black guy with glasses and they're in a basement and they have night vision on and then they go did you hear that Shh and they cut the commercial fucking music there's nothing to see here that's the thing about a ghost there's nothing to see here you fucking look all day no one's the most you have is like some weird image you know whispery image and again it's only interesting because it's unknown it's only interesting because people think there might be a ghost might be real into secret thing it might be how crazy is I mean it all depends on like in what you define as a ghost you know something that isn't in this plane or whatever but you know you talk science the smartest motherfuckers that have ever lived were the Nazi scientists they invented missiles that were so far ahead of everyone else tech in science and technology doses good you know I'm sad like when they went down Russians raced in and took half their scientists Americans took the other scientists yeah a lot of people don't even know that our space program is based entirely on Nazi sign that was the smartest motherfucker man Wernher von Braun and they were down I mean according to ancient aliens I don't know that is maybe the worst reference you could ever say it's like according to Wikipedia you are a fucking skull and bones member yeah yeah yeah I'm very excited no I am me nice she's a nice guy I like the guy you keep because it's it's a show it's an entertainment show I mean talks about Atlantis maybe being a spaceship that flew off in this guy or maybe maybe it's a rabbit and an eight a giant magical carrot and that created the end of a yes I did it was fascinating it's fascinating the actual facts of what the Nazis were into and a lot of what they are into is like ancient Hindu scriptures like the Vimanas they studied all these you know Vimanas were like these flying things in ancient Hindu scriptures that from thousands and thousand years ago these flying ships that people have always tried to interpret like what the fuck mean by this you know and the the Nazi scientists were fascinated by all that stuff they were very much into the occult and very much into you know the idea of ancient knowledge and you could throw that aside and say they were silly if it wasn't for the incredible technological capabilities that they had back then BMW that was those were and they made engines for Nazis man I mean Volkswagen that's the car for the people you know there was there was so much they made incredible rockets their rocketry was so far ahead of anything in the rest of the world they were they were the innovators when it comes to the field of rocketry and space travel about Wernher von Braun's yeah the Wernher von Braun and Hermann Oberth are both quoted as saying all that technology came from help from beans from another solar system there were channeling there were channeling information yeah to build UFOs they built four different models of UFOs and they're saying that we're getting the information anti-gravity information by the virile society which Hitler was a part of and they were running the Nazis the Vril society it was all based on channeling from another solar system there were this this chick I forget her name Maria Oh stitch was the head medium and she was channeling ancient Sumerian texts and then they bring in a do two contrasting she had no idea what she was writing was an ancient Sumerian text there's instructions on how to build UFOs they built four of them it's on record of Hana blue one Hana blue to Honolulu they built UFOs and they're saying I mean they built spaceships they built UFOs well UFOs are unidentified yeah well yeah they don't anti-gravity so a lot of the sightings in the 40s and 50s and probably even to today are all based or not all but I'm sure a lot of them were German UFOs right but when they say that they build something that's anti-gravity well that can't really be proven because we can't do anti-gravity today so because we can't do anti-gravity we don't have a working model that they actually had that we could fly around and a lot of that is speculation but we do know that they were coming up with some weird shaped aircrafts means some photos of them with these saucer looking Nazi ships like we'll undisputable photos so they damn fly who knows I can make a spaceship well who knows if they flew or not I don't know do you know they didn't fly no I'm not saying I did fly me back then well they had planes man I mean they could they could make one of those fuckin thing flying I think which is so just a jet engine right you know I don't know if it would uh obviously would be any good I mean it might suck maybe that's why they stopped using it there's a funny picture online of Adolf Hitler with a with an alien I think he's just misunderstood Adolf Hitler dude don't even say shit worked on my podcast bitch don't you happened to fucking Tracy Morgan talk about Charlie Chaplin there's uh there's all these weird photos of these fucking these things that the Nazis built man I don't know how many these photos are hoaxes and how many of them are legit but it's a pretty fascinating man it's to me the most fascinating part is that they were using mediums to channel aliens from Bremen how do we know that that's true as an alien Stan you know you could you know it was probably the US government yes what are you doing what am I looking for what's the size fella yeah it makes me wonder if maybe they were just really dumb and yeah he's like yeah we're talking to aliens but they were really talking to our government and Reich oh yeah yeah well you know UK matters you can poo poo all you want the idea of secret societies but the bottom line is almost every single fucking president has been a part of one of those fucking things in high school or in college that's gone bullshit is so disturbing that these people get together in college and decide to run shit based on you know this this bond that they make when they're in college but it completely makes sense if you pay attention to how people operate man especially if you could mean the best way to keep something secret it really keep something secret is to have a bunch of people who belong to some exclusive group and they won't rat anything out you know it's like like like a group of buddy so we'll talk about man law like you know you don't say shit about nothing nothing - well you know what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas I mean that's this is that on a huge level you know skullenbones is basically what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas on the biggest level possible raping the world causing Wars doing all this crazy shit and doing it under this premise of we're all part of this group that agrees to be running the world in secret what happens in Iraq stays in Iraq and they're put they're asking you know they're asking each other to join this thing and so to join it they make them do some really embarrassing shit like you know you hear different stories from suck cocks to let guys piss in their mouths or it's all sorts of weird shit they get it all on film and this is how you become a member in this this group everyone has to do these things dress up like a diaper let dude shit in your hair like the just the most fucked up thing possible in a film it so that they always have you yeah look the fuck knows that sounds like that sounds like some shit that you're saying in your mom's basement and there's like wood paneling on the wall and you're doing bong rips like dude and then they totally make you eat shit really yeah mask my cousin says what cousin said that was real Eddie did you like super 8 who's all right yeah that's how I felt two people got mad at me we talked about last week I gave some spoilers away I don't see it I'd see it again I mean if I didn't know any better if I'd if I didn't know the plot I would go see it it was a fun ride the fat kid is a great actor all those kids are pretty amazed they were good but Elliott too was good they're probably gonna be spectacular fuck-ups later in their life yeah your bank on them they're probably gonna be amazing they're probably gonna be Macaulay Culkin esque they're just gonna they're all gonna be on dr. Drew show if you watch the new episodes Joey Diaz swears it's the best oh Celebrity Rehab I don't know I looked on my DVR the other day there was a couple of them so I was like oh jesus here we go again I love Lindsay Lohan's dad's on it and Amy Fisher is it really yeah Amy Fisher the chick who got famous by shooting someone she's on it like she's a celebrity she shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco in the fucking face and that made our celebrity that's hilarious what kind of a weird world are we living in man where every fucking show us Real Housewives and teen moms and Mob Wives and what the fuck are we doing man you want to see real shit that's not even real shit we want to size the UFC the UFC and all reality shows that's like real shit we don't want to see fighting movies but most of those reality shows are bullshit you know that as much yeah but we think it's real most people think it's real you know what I think it is I think our lives are coming more and more complex and people are more more stressful and they have more more real problems and they want to be distracted with a problem that they can focus on they have absolutely no stake in so they could watch people with the drama and get mad at each other and crazy and screaming and this girl's fucking his wife and he's going fucking crazy and they're going bankrupt but meanwhile you personally have zero stake in it so you can sit there and watch it and get totally caught up in it and you know and you don't your life doesn't fall apart it's like cathartic yeah makes sense totally makes sense right yep that's what I think it's going down this is if you want real proof that there's an apocalypse going down it's what the fuck is on TV that's the real proof the real proof is Mob Wives the real proof is Real Housewives of New Jersey you watch these morons living their retarded life their non introspective you know no common sense not thinking egotistical under the microscope and can't handle it the spotlights on them they don't know what the fuck to do they're acting crazy yeah their nonsense talking that's that's the that's the sign that's the sign it's all going down that's the sign any Bravo you know we should do Joey we should try to get tickets to that Comic Con that's coming up fuck yeah I would love to go down there and starts oh shit we should speak and speak at Comic Con about podcasts totally like we're experts we should speak somebody asked me to speak at the zeitgeist movement this is like guys thing a September 11th 2011 is the you want to go you want to go that I don't know why there's a series of them is like guys media event they asked me to speak in it which I'm down but the problem is man with with all of these things whenever you claim that you fucking got the answers all right whether it's like geist or whether it's Scientology or whether it's I don't want to equate zeitgeist of Scientology but it's too late it already did they they don't have the answers man and everybody's saying you know like like if you if you like look at there's a there's a website called zeitgeist debunked and you know there's a bond of shit that they got wrong man just straight wrong horse when it comes to even when it comes to the way they were backing up the the the the history of of religion they got all these these things wrong with Mithra and and it's been corrected on all these different websites all the things that they got incorrect about but they're so confident in these points of view that they can put these points of view out like guys in oh my god no no no no no psych ice is pretty interesting there's a lot of zeitgeist that I've lined one one right it's a lot of it's nine one one in there and also I have a problem with it where there's there's things when they talk about the towers and how the towers fell I just farted this time just done with me that was me if you smell this farting don't run away Brian don't be scared anyway the your your uselessness used to get up did you fart no I did I actually just had to go to the bathroom this it wasn't even bad but I'm just I'm since somebody didn't own up for the last one I felt like I should hide it man okay man maybe it was Brian maybe was nothing my cats in here somewhere and by the way she took a nasty shit in that litter box in the bathroom it might be that how awful when you guys shit what percentage is explosive and what percentage of solid loads well I'm Bonita lot of lettuce lately and I've also been drinking this new thing this this this vegetable drink it's amazing man I got this Vitamix you know Kevin James lost eighty fuckin pounds right Kevin I look great dude his face is skinny he looks so healthy he looks like vibrant it's crazy and he got a chubby at all well he's still got a gut he's so yummy look dude he was 300 fuckin pounds he's got extra skin you know but he's in way better shape than awesome is almost since I met him you know I met him in 91 maybe somewhere around then and this is about as healthy as I've ever seen it as far as like his diet and what's what he's doing and he got this Vitamix thing and he swears by it man he's like he's like he told me about this book some woman wrote this book on you know how are you supposed to eat vegetables and that the problem is you know your body spends so much time digesting food and breaking food down that it causes a lot he uses up a lot of energy so she has this she tells you to take this blender and you blend all your vegetables together so I blend like kale and I blend cucumbers and I blend like a pear and then some some some some ginger and some celery a bunch of shit together into this drink that looks like the Hulk's loads that's what it looks like just this green crazy drink and I drink this shit and first of all my shit flows out of me like a river so you're like us know nicely just nicely just slides out like like if you were logging on the river and it was a nice strong current to the river and you unloaded a whole truckload of logs into this river to take them down hill and they just went ah I'll just travel downhill that's what it's like when I take a shit my logs just travel downhill ah blah blah blah blah blah she comes out nice and but you don't ever have explosive no no that's probably Mexican for the five percent you know what that isn't a hundred percent that what that is it's a food allergy you should get tested with food allergies they'll test everything and give you a percentage up and down into how allergic you are an explosive shit its food oh yeah yeah you'll be surprised after you eat your body that's right yeah yeah it's probably most likely bread I bet you have a food allergy to bread and it might not be like you can't eat bread but it definitely be talking to the microphone more so amazing I think a lot of people have an allergy to gluten Jeff Jeff's wife s yeah that's exactly what it probably is man yeah it's a real common one apparently it's not that good for your body to be eaten bread apparently bread even though it fills you up you know bread you know it's great for poor people you know you take your wheat and you make it bread and it fills your belly and gives you carbohydrates apparently your body doesn't like breaking it down especially processed white flour kinda that's just just glue you know I was just like funky glue like you're supposed to eat like a zekiel bread like Ezekiel bread is really good for you I love that shit I have a zekiel bread with peanut butter in it I don't even feel like I'm doing anything bad you know I don't feel like if I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole wheat bread on my how much sugar is in this man this is all sugar you know but if I have like some Ezekiel bread with like some natural peanut butter I don't feel bad at all it's nice to read all the time great now we have a moment science for Fogo de Chao I love that place what okay silence why are you fucking a girl there's one in Los Angeles that went there two days ago did you get hired guys we need to do another death squad trip there this is what we're gonna do folks we're gonna take a trip to the Salton Sea Eddie and I talked about it soon as Eddie showed up I got a book here on a salt and sea and I got to documentary sitting on my desk because being the retard that I am whenever a subject comes up on the podcast or that I get said hip to I get fascinated by it and the salt and seize the thing that I've been so I'm so fascinated by it lately and apparently Eddie says that Sonny Bono was the guy that was trying save the Salton Sea trying to bring it back and apparently it can be brought back yeah it could be according to the documentary they which documentary is this is it any of those this one plagued some pleasures of the Salton Sea plagues and pleasures of the sauce isn't that a John Waters documentary I'm not sure but it's amazing it's got to see that play exempt Ledger's on the Salton Sea yeah I just received it because somebody sent me hip to a video online they linked it to me on Twitter and I tree tweeted it yeah it was a while back maybe a couple weeks ago and I watched this video online about this ocean inside I mean almost like an ocean this huge man-made lake inside a California's coast and I was like what the fuck this is nuts man and then it talks about how toxic it became because of the runoff from all these different farms and that it got saltier and saltier the point where like a lot of the animals of the fish just fucking died and these people still live there and the flood oh yeah that flooded that's what fucked everything yeah and when you see it man you're like what the fuck it looks like like some crazy it looks like some Mad Max shit like we're exactly it looks like Armageddon yeah so we're gonna do a death squad photo shoot for out there that's all we do people live there yeah there's 400 people that live there that's incredible its cheapest fuck you can buy a house for our property for like man it's it's it was a three it was probably three thousand dollars come on you can buy a lot time does it take to drive out there it takes about two hours we should build a death squad studio at the Salton Sea I just do once a month Salton Sea shows if I could buy a house for 300 or 3,000 bucks now you could probably buy it might be 300 yeah I think it's 3,000 some of the people that they show that live there seriously they're like crazy homeless people like meth heads yeah as long as we don't leave any equipment behind but what if we like to have a place we set it up we get some couches in there and shit get an internet connection bring our laptops so we don't really you know I have to have equipment there you bring our laptops in our mixer set that shit up and do like a weekly or a monthly show from the Salton Sea it's scary I mean there was a thriving mini French Riviera right in California two hours away I think the biggest man-made lake in the country yeah and is the shaking body of water in California it was thriving in the 50s all the river building all these condos and houses people were moving out there it was amazing they're like fuck Palm Springs you ain't got no goddamn lake they were going to salt and see and then they had a big flood like the levees broke and all the shit cuz it's all man-made flooded everything out people freaked out and there's still people today they're living there that were there waiting for it to come back they were back they are they remember the good old days and it's dark it's like it's like it really is a ghost town it reminds me of like California I remember Brad Pitt and and David Duke company remember the oh yeah ghost towns it's like this oh dude you've driven from California to Vegas before you've done that right didn't you go with me when we drove and you and me and Demetri and we stopped off in one of those little ghost towns where they had like a fake gunfight do you remember that shit that was happening it wasn't you it was that was me Demetri then we were headed to Vegas to see the k1 I thought we went to k1 with a couple times we did a caper did a couple k1 trips yeah well back then there was no UFC in Vegas is so old-school were going there was no UFC in Vegas so Eddie and I would want to go see fights we'd have to go see k1 in Vegas Scott Coker used to promote k1 and Vegas and there's like hardly no one there I need a little ballroom the Bellagio oh it's like it was as big as we're tuff enuf is yes just like that exactly well people don't know what tuff enuf is tough and I was a local amateur show in Vegas and we would go down there and there'd be you know a few hundred people and you'd get to see fucking Peter Aerts Peter Aerts Faust Stefan Leko you know a guy level top of the food chain k1 guys were going at it man there was some great fucking fights the kk1 in Vegas was awesome they should bring that back I tried to talk to Dana about that I try to take to it man maybe you should fucking get involved in k1 bring k1 in I'm telling you think about what's the most exciting aspect to the UFC it's striking right you get the best strikers in the world look I love watching Abu Dhabi I love watching marcelo garcia and and Pablo Popovich go after it I love in shock or a and Hodja Gracie go after it in in Abu Dhabi because they're the elite of the elite grapplers I also like watching elite of the elite strikers you know and just straight up striking there's a lot of guys you don't get to see their full striking skills in the UFC because they're always worried about getting taken down they're always worried about getting submitted they're always worrying about you know dealing with certain things so it's hard for them to relax and just get into the striking but if you watch like that k1 max you ever watch that shit I'll be honest with you man I try to watch it it's hard to watch it is it really yeah I'm not that into it man I tried to maybe cuz you don't have a striking background man maybe that's what it is to me it's exciting it's fucked that's all i watch when i when i watch fights when i have the garage you know i have to set up in the garage when I workout all I watch is k1 max so it's hard for me and Badr Hari fights I watched that crazy motherfucker those fights are wild dude all that fucking just straight stand-up man when they're late kicking the shit out of each other and flying knees and dude you can't watch that yeah well I want to I want to like it but it's boring us out wow it's so weird I want to it's got to be because that's not your background because like look I like watching pool I watched a professional pool I got hours of pool on my laptop I got like maybe 10 15 hours of pool matches on my laptop at any given time so if I'm ever in an airport by myself oh I watched Mika Immonen play F Andreas and I'll sit there watch a pool match that I already know the result got it you gotta be happily I want if I'm gonna watch the striking it's got a it's got a there's got to be a threat of the fight going to the ground I mean really if I'm gonna watch striking that's gonna be check Congo and Pat Barry that's what I'm gonna watch you know what I mean right there's a threat of going down they were on the floor they didn't stop it yeah I mean that fight could have been stopped two different times easily was that not the craziest end of a fight you've ever seen ever does the greatest comeback in the history of combat sport I was watching it with a friend who doesn't train he doesn't he didn't he was just tell me right before the match because I hate it when people when a fighter hurts another fighter and he goes down and then he jumps in his guard and then strives to knock him out why doesn't he just let him get up and stand up I go well a lot of times when the guy's hurt he throws haymakers and if you catch one of those haymakers while you think you're I'm hurt so many fights can just turn it at the blink of an eye you want to get him on the grow you know your natural instinct is I got him hurt let me put him in a spot where there's no way he's gonna knock me out exist so people just that's the natural instinct I got you hurt let me ground-and-pound you now and I know for sure that there's even strikers do that all the time man yes exactly yeah climbing a guy's garden we were just talking about that and it happened yeah yeah just took him down and pounded him on the ground that wouldn't happen did you ever see Diego Corrales and Castillo no you never saw I fight it was the boxing equivalent to that Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales Diego Corrales was fucked up he was getting dropped and batter to look like the fight was almost stopped bang he connects and Corrales goes out it was just like that I mean almost except there was knock downs and he counted the excitement level of this was higher because there was no counting you know it was like the fight was almost over at any second and literally Dan merg Liana got on top of them was gonna touch them and stop the fight like he had his hands over them to stop the fight but then Cheick Kongo went for a single and he changed his mind like a brilliant decision a lot of people do know there should have stopped that fight the fuck they should have stopped that fight look who won he won by knockout there's no way you should have stopped his fight he still wanted a fight he still could fight he still could win and he did win so there's no way they should have stopped that fight early on it was the absolute perfect stoppage look just know you had to stop the fight once Pat Barry was out cuz Pat Barry was unconscious that's why I hate early stoppages ah let him take an extra shot they they understand the danger they're in there because they're crazy freaks I don't like he's seen a guy getting blasted when he's already hurt because I know what it does to them I know the physiological effect did you see Hey pull this up man pull this up Roy Jones jr. can't say spectacular but you're gonna listen to this man this is traveling all over the internet this is a really uncomfortable thing I'm sorry my headphones yeah you'll see it your hear it in your headphones you don't have to see it because it's just Roy Jones doing commentary and he can't say the word spectacular you know he just got knocked the fuck out I by a Russian guy yeah Russian guy battered him in the 12th round just like I thought knocking you out you know its own let's not listen to play it play it this is this gonna freak you out listen to Roy Jones it's starting to slip the beginning if you see it on video it's even more noticeable like he really was yeah and you know what's dark about it all man is that Roy Jones was the guy who never wanted to get hit where Jones was the guy who never wanted to fight really dangerous fighters because he was always worried about brain damage because he was buddies with Gerald McClellan Gerald McClellan was one of the best fuckin middleweights and light heavyweights ever general McClellan was a fuckin animal but in his prime he got in a fight with Nigel Benn and he caught a lot of weight for that fight and during the fight the fight was ugly and he blasted Nigel Benn in the first round but Nigel Benn had mad heart and Nigel Benn hung in there and was there in the second and third and they they fought like dogs dude and they head-butted and they clashed heads and at one time Nigel Benn and him clashed heads after Nigel Benn was was jacking them with some punches like they were just they were just going after it man and he general McClellan took a knee he went down and took a knee and then quit and then sat down his corner and it was like whoa what the fuck is going on and then he just collapsed like he was obviously done like he was his brain was starting to bleed and he realized that something was terribly wrong so he tried to like you know stop he started trying to sit down like there's so much that a guy like him who's a just a furious killer watch like the Gerald McClellan Jillian Jackson fight Julian Jackson rather if you want to see some some crazy barbaric top of the food chain ko ko action boxers going at it because Julian Jackson was like one of the hardest punchers ever and general McClellan locked him up and it's a crazy fight it's a fun boxing fight to watch but so Roy Jones jr. saw that man and never wanted to be that guy he was always scared that he would be like Cheryl McClellan man he was always scared that he would have some serious brain damage and he would get really badly so he never took any damage man he fought so smart his reflexes were so good up until he fought Antonio Tarver he never really got fucked up and then he beat John Ruiz he went all the way up to heavyweight and who knows what he did to get to heavyweight because he was like 200 pounds and shredded and that's not normal usually when you do that you're doing some sort of testosterone or something you're taking something and when what a lot of people don't realize especially like fighters they don't know who to turn to they get their advice from you know from either shitty doctors or they get their advice from bodybuilders that are their friends or something like that what people don't understand about hormones is if you jolt your body you make your body like a hyper testosterone levels where they're far above normal what happens is afterwards your shit crashes so when you get off this testosterone if you take some crazy amount of testosterone in your system your balls shut down so you need double the time that you were on that shit to recover so say if you went on a cycle and you were Roy Jones this is hypothetically speaking and decided to gain 20 pounds of muscle if you were on a cycle of steroids for three months you need six months just to get your shit down to a normal level again your your shit is fucked up man your balls aren't working anymore you're doing something that your body's not supposed to have your body's not supposed to have these levels in it and so when your body has those levels it shuts off natural production and it takes a while for that shit to kick back in and if you watch the difference between Roy Jones's body from the Antonio Tarver fight to the John Ruiz fight the John Ruiz fight he fought it heavyweight and the next fight is that light heavyweight and he was like smooth he looked like you had no muscle tone it just didn't look good man he did he look slow and I'm Tony with Harvard knocked him the fuck out and that was the first time he ever got knocked out and and from that point on it was all downhill and then he fought Glen Johnson and Glen Johnson fucked him up Glen Johnson knocked him unconscious dead stiff leg you know just you know that arms up in the air when they're just out cold like that Glen Johnson did that to him and then ever since then man it's been a slow slide you know he fought scared against Hopkins he didn't it didn't go after Hopkins he just was happy to win a decision or happy to rather to lose a decision and did not get knocked out he never tried to win that fight you know Hopkins was just too good for him and you know and then he fought that guy Danny Green in Australia he got knocked out in the first round and then he fought this Russian dude and got knocked the fuck out in the last round and it was ugly dude he froze up like halfway like like was crumbling and the referee the guy looks at the referee and the referee wouldn't stop it so as he goes all right bang while he's crumpling well like Roy Jones is essentially slowly crumpling this dude tees off with two full power shots any face-plants completely unconscious and so then he goes on HBO a couple weeks later and he can't say spectacular we are we are watching the slow slide we are watching everything that that guy was terrified of when he was a 20 year old phenom when he was on top of the world lighting people up put it you gotta talk in the microphone we can you know must have forgot yeah we need to hear that yeah no I think we can man yeah but now that we're on serious we're on Sirius satellite radio we're not allowed to play music anymore at all we get sued you see this shit yeah our plan is about to get fucking flooded here's a question why is your shit why are you gonna pictures it obviously they've had flooding problems here so Eddie that photo cuz it's just a trip but watch see the photo why is a nuclear power plant bro why isn't there a wall at least the size of about maybe 10 times the height of the current wall around the whole entire place if it's near water or the ability to get flooded well there's a lot of floods going on man that nobody ever anticipated you know what we're finding out right now with Japan and what we're finding out with this as well as there's there's not they didn't do a whole lot of what-ifs when they built these fucking things you know they first of all they don't have any options to shut them down if they don't have any power when they lost the backup generators in Japan and every guys everything got flooded out by the tsunami they had essentially they had eight hours before that things started melting down they're fucked there's no way to stop it they've made these crazy things these fusion of fission reactors whenever they are fusion or fission which one is it nuclear fusion I think it's fusion fusion whatever the fuck it is this incredible amount of energy in this one you know one isolated area and they can't stop it they don't know how to stop it those what's going on in Japan right now man the michio kaku just wrote a really fascinating and terrifying article about it about how their three complete meltdowns and though in those plants in in Japan and you know there's people online that are in denial about this for some reason like someone in my my message board was you know a thread about this was like oh you know you're giving out misinformation about Japan it's not that bad like the fuck it's not man there's video online on YouTube of people that live miles and miles away that have taken Geiger counters and they walk around with the Geiger counter on and then they take the Geiger counter and they put the Geiger counter on the ground and that's when it's fucking terrifying because in the air when you walk it around it looks like yeah it's a little radiated radioactive but not too bad but then when you put the fucking thing on the ground there's a couple videos like this you see that the fucking levels are off the charts like way into the levels where people aren't supposed to be anywhere near yeah it's on the ground man it's on the fucking ground because that's where apparently the although the radioactivity collects it collects on the ground so this guy takes this read I gir counter and puts it on the ground so I'm freaking out man so I bought some geiger counters on Amazon try to buy some counters he said yeah especially after we have the conversation about Rocketdyne yeah Rocketdyne which is only you know fucking ten miles from here something like that it had a total meltdown so usually in the 50s that's probably where the Muslim bees would start in Japan yeah dude I think we should do what Japan is we tell those fucking people that are anywhere near that place help him get out and then use that as a place to store the world's garbage that place looks like your idea I've been saying on stage for weeks bitch yeah and I said you I'm the one that said that like dare you like two podcasts ago I said that it's like we should use nuclear places to put our trash you don't remember that dude I said that too okay do you think you said that before me yeah yeah I did but no it's not sure you said that before me before so don't stay never say I never sent I doubt that bitch you know cuz when I say it you're like that's actually a really good idea you might be right now that I think about it it's a perfect idea it's a perfect idea yeah I think it's an awesome whoever's idea it was maybe it was yours I smoke too much weed if it was your idea right ninja zombies zombie there's the movie right there a spot where we could just dump garbage garbage right into the hole of it fly over in a helicopter and just drop it right into the what would happen well hopefully this what is that thing called that's making a black hole overlay it turns into a really bad black hole and then we could just put the garbage on the black hole the Large Hadron Collider so we could little itter in other galaxies crying you know they have hyper Nova's in space they find these hyper nose that are they're basically these these like really super powerful nose that I have these Jets of energy spraying out in either direction what if that was garbage what if we got like really close we saw it cans and shit rubbers and it turns out that all that shit spring out was the garbage of another dimension they had figured out how to launch all of their garbage with a rocket ship into black holes the planets all clean that it's super clean like they'll walk around with a portable like connection to that black hole I saw another thing that I see and I'm on a report on this cuz this is number 9 for me this is the ninth time I've seen this a fucking guy in a Prius throwing a cigarette out the window god damn that drives me crazy this motherfucker pulled into a organic foods parking lot of an organic food store gets out of his Prius and throws his fucking cigarette on the ground I'm like you cunt you dumb dumb dumb cunt you stupid fuck what kind of a person goes so far to think they're helping the environment by buying a Prius he had a ponytail on so he's like I'm living natural I'm gonna go get some natural organic food and I'm just gonna throw my cigarette right there that was a king of the hill episode did it really do anything though you started working at Whole Foods and it's similar to that did he throw cigarettes out the window at Whole Foods they had Priuses and never ever just constantly contradicting themselves well it's people man I've seen nine times now nine times I've seen a guy in a Prius throw cigarette window nine over the course of my entire life this is the ninth guy I've been documenting them the last one was in San Francisco the last one in San Francisco I saw two in a weekend I was there I was there Thursday through Sunday working at Cobbs and I saw two guys in their fucking Priuses throw cigarettes out the window that's incredible incredible shit videotape put on YouTube you never know to have your fucking camera how like there's a guy in a Prius let's follow me I'm smoking I know he's got this fuck he's gonna throw it out the fucking window Gizmodo also has a article about LSD being used to treat what they call suicide head which are people that have really bad headaches to the point where they almost want to kill themself like migraines times a billion right so these two psychiatrists have been giving LSD to these patients and I think they said like almost all the patients all six patients reported decreasing the number of cluster attacks and five said this effect lasted for months after they had taken LSD well if they had the right dosage of LSD if you could administer in a laboratory and you knew exactly what you were getting there was an article really recently that said that MDMA which is ecstasy and LSD like far far closer to being available for prescription than anybody would really imagine really yeah far closer I tell you man is Sarah pretty cute that is one of the most beautiful drugs in the road incredible Molly pure ecstasy or whatever it's is it's I can't get enough of it but what's weird is recently I bought some ecstasy and I didn't feel the same abnormal ecstasy feeling and you came in talking like broad Jones allegedly and and so I was telling this other guy I know I'm like hey yeah so I got this stuff it looked like Molly but the guy said was ecstasy and and it did this this was my effects on it he goes oh yeah that's bath salts people are actually selling that as ecstasy a lot in LA right now oh I see that bathroom hey did that mess fast saw in the house you're retarded yeah just doing whatever people get and what's funny is that it felt it felt like ecstasy like it started like okay here it goes I'm feeling good feeling I guess I'm tired good night it was it almost got to the point so it got like euphoric and then euphoric body kind of feeling good kind of kind of like the ecstasy feeling but it just fizzles are does every ecstasy have that that the next day blah feeling well I was easing on it Labs calms roll-on and roll-off so I had no feeling the next day I felt fine this is stuff really works they on it stuff Ellen I gave that shit that the nootropic formula Eddie you know we're making a brain pill oh I got talked about we're making a brain pill we're making a neutral bra no no no me and Chris Marcus cream what Chris mark is doing all the work we're gonna help promote it but he started a laboratory when he left fleshlight started a laboratory for he's been on the podcast a bunch of times and twice and he decided to come up with his own business and one of them was that there's a bunch of different nootropics a bunch of different like supplements that can aid in brain function and what he did is kinda combine all the best ones and put them together dude they give you the craziest file that's when I had the Arnold Schwarzenegger what's on your dream my girlfriend I have been letting her have some of it nightmares really just intense nightmares and I didn't have nightmares but I had intense dreams yeah after you said that I started actually realizing oh it's because of that no not there not well I may be like that but this is gonna be much stronger and this stuff is like sorry I had one called brain factors and I like ginkgo biloba yeah everything everything for the brain all in one for me I don't know what his levels were and what stuff he had as opposed to what stuff Chris has had I would like to look at the two of them but whatever it is this shit that Chris has put together he's just thoroughly researched this and come up with this incredible formula it really fucking works first of all the really freaky thing is man you don't get tired on his shit that's the weird thing like if I all the way across the country you would figure by the time I get there five hours later I'm exhausted right but when I take these fucking pills man we did a show on Friday we threw it full of red-eye all right landed Friday morning I didn't sleep at all I slept a little bit on the plane I ate something got in the shower went to the UFC weigh-ins went from the weigh-ins to got some food ate food worked over my material went over some of my material got with Joey we smoked the joint went on stage then did our show afterwards went to hang out with Ralphie May afterwards went to a strip club afterwards came back to the hotel and I'm still awake I'm like how the fuck am I awake and then I realized I took six of those fucking pills six i took three earlier three yes I was exhausted I took three in the morning and then three like an hour before the show whoa dog doo I was figuring some shit out man that the the the the crazy thing is when you have dreams the dreams are super vivid and you can remember them and it's because your mind's eye whatever receptors awake is some things awake that's usually not awake because that's like when we were talking about nicotine where it keeps your nicotine receptors in your head awake when you're on you know I'd do a patch while you're sleeping uh whatever's in that shit has something that it's reacting to and keeping it away well what I was impressed with is that I had some good ideas and I didn't want to get up and write them down and I actually remembered them oh really that never happens yeah that never happened I feel sharper definitely I was going over that video you know there's that video have you seen it online of the Miss USA pageant contestants they asking them about evolution yeah have you seen it yeah pull that shit up cuz it's fucking fascinating pull it up and we'll just we'll play a little bit of it cuz it's it's the most ridiculous shit ever they get these girls and all of them from the deep south all of them don't believe in evolution they're all like and what I don't believe in evolution you know and I'm thinking while I'm there I'm of course you don't believe in evolution you're twenty years old nobody's ever caveman fucked you nobody ever gorillas fucked you you don't you don't know what darkness really is you don't know that they're shades - man there's a there's a whole progression there's a fucking spectrum of human behavior from really civilized and beautiful and nice to barbaric and animalistic and that shit's because we came from fucking animals hooker and you just haven't even experienced that yet and your your little cute life with your sash on your fucking I remembered it all vividly when I woke up in the morning what is that we don't really have to see it's really low yeah it's low-hanging fruit it's it's just really really poor dumb girls that are 20 years old they're asking them about evolution and they're saying things that they want people to hear well I think Jesus put me here for a purpose because they think that all the people from their church and all the people back home that's what they would want to hear you know when you're 20 years old you're indoctrinated into the world of religion what are the odds you actually have a real opinion of it you actually sat down and sorted this shit out most of time they're just spitting out shit that other people have been saying of them their whole life you know twenty years old the fuck did you know when you were 20 you know could you imagine if somebody had you on video talking about what you thought about the world when you were twenty do you got talking to Mike Brown I was an atheist at 20 yeah I have a video made 22 smoking weed with a bunch of my friends that's all I cared about was smoking weed and music yeah well you probably just you were stuck in Ohio - yeah you know what the fuck you were in Columbus you're all over the place now your shits blowing the fuck up your plant tent the planets are you ever at home are you going out to a different city every week are you doing classes at buddy tell everybody what you're talking yeah wouldn't you what do you were talking you were saying ten planets planets yeah Jesus schools but you you have them all over the place how many do you have no around thirty Wow and so you're traveling pretty much every weekend do a seminar at one of them I'm trying to do two a month and for me vacation is staying in LA staying home yeah I like I like being at my house I love hanging with my bunny and my girlfriend just relax and go check out a movie hmm just doing nothing I know when you have a day when you don't have to fucking be anywhere yeah so beautiful so I try to try to stay home two weekends out of the month you know that's why I quit the UFC as well if I was trying to make it to my schools and do the UFC I'd be gone every weekend just can't do it well that's good that the school your schools have become sick quite successful now and you know it's so funny I see your shirt your logo at all these places I would be just sitting there I'm like oh my god that guy has a ten planets shirt on and it makes me almost want to be like hey dude what's up you know like I feel like oh they all know Eddie's well I just take jiu-jitsu I got all ready to do it for a year well one my knee two time you need that fucked up it'll pop out of place in jujitsu probably I'm not gonna risk that it was the last time it popped out of place it's only if it popped out once and then once it was closed popping out where it felt like it did how long after you actually injury was this that popped out uh three years four years really yeah it was pretty far afterwards yeah yeah so it's still it was skiing too it was like oh my god did it just pop out to fucking hurt yeah you got to develop a higher tolerance to pain son yeah you know dude I just want time that's one thing you get from jiu-jitsu man you get a high oz tolerance to pain cuz you're always in pain you're always getting smashed Jordan your necks getting choked yours your face is getting smushed you know like when you get tattooed like some people get tattooed and they fucking scream in agony I fell asleep getting tattooed once literally nodded out just you get used to putting it out you used to putting pain and into any martial art anything you're hitting things and Muay Thai guys man dude you don't think they get accustomed to pain you leg kicks always hurt man they're gonna hurt forever but you just get accustomed to that you just deal with it you know your legs certainly toughen up especially your you know your thighs toughen up and your shins really toughen up they actually develop like little micro fractures over the surface of your shin from clashing and other shins and kicking fucking banana trees and shit like that like those those crazy Thai guys that are constantly kicking like banana trees they develop like shins that are like weapons man you know there's like a sport science on it well they showed Melcher gotta forget the last name his name his phone but is a afraid he's a Muay Thai guy but he's a former world champion and they had him kicked baseball bats he was breaking baseball bats with his shins dude dude there's so crazy to watch just just swinging that leg kick into a baseball bat snapping the handle off fuck that dude he did two different kinds did a Nash one - bat and a maple bat is the ash bat apparently is a little easier so then he moved to the maple one next oh yeah that is grabbing my shins yeah there's such a difference in striking the difference between striking and jiu-jitsu I mean you can get hurt in both of them for sure Miguel Torres former WBC bantamweight champion posted a picture worst BJJ injury ever at my gym and it's a dudes toe his toe got broken have you seen it you have to see it you need to look at it dude oh god broken and snapped off and the bone was sticking straight out dude it was haha hardcore and I was like yeah that can happen man do you can get fucked up but in striking you much more likely to get Roy Jones in striking that shit is that shit's happening on a regular dudes are constantly getting brained you know there's constantly getting knocked out there was a post on the underground the other day some guy was talking about getting knocked out in training you know and how much that pissed you off some new guy came and didn't really know what he's doing Swank full blast and he didn't get out of the way and he got knocked unconscious you know and fucking not good man when you watch something like Pat Burien Cheick Kongo does that shit does that shit register with you do you see that and go whoa look what's what's going on inside Pat Berry's head right now and check congos both of them got rained on you know yeah it was for a fan it was amazing but I would never want to do that sure I love watching it though but I'm not down for getting hit it'd be awesome if they could fix it you know it's like you know if if you tear a knee ligament they could fucking get another ligament stick it in there and screw it in place and they can fix you up nice you know if you like hurt your brain they go dude don't worry about it we're gonna put you in this chamber it rejuvenate saw your brain cells and it's you know you're gonna be a hundred percent a couple of weeks what if Chris Marcus stuff actually does that I don't think so Woods it's gonna be a lot more complicated than some herbs I think I would think that if there's gonna be something that regenerates brain tissue that's injured it's gonna be something like some nanotechnology something that rehabilitates or you know fixes to I should sponsor Roy Jones and see what happens speaking Shakespearean he's not even willing to retire he owes taxes apparently he was 3.5 million dollars in taxes according to my online sources that I how did this happen quickly googled how to someone with millions and hey man they don't fucking pay just don't have a business manager an accountant they just get stupid man they get stupid they get stupid they just they just spend all that money and they you know they

so fucking complicated isn't it you'll one of my movie drops I'll go get me an accountant when your movie drops what are you gonna do in the movie porn hmm person does not work any money in porn anymore dude you got to come up with another strategy that strategy would have been the shit in 1993 you could have been like Peter Noah Peter North drives a Ferrari and he did gay porn yeah how about that how about that he's the only one who got away with doing gay porn he did gay porn they're like all right don't do it again and then he came back and did regular porn from then on out they did a little gay porn I didn't believe it like people told me it was like No not Peter man no way dude you know cuz if you're gonna have a porn idol that's the one to have you know dude shoots these giant monster loads but then you go and find some videos online as a dude sucking his cock and like hey hey hey and this dude's boned him in the ass you're like hey hey hey and he tried to say there was like a body double son they ain't no CGI that good if you talk about the hungriest but award did we talk about the ready yeah we did yeah station time that you came on earth oh we did really yeah we

friend of ours uh was running a small mixed martial arts corporation and he found they did an internet search on one of their fighters and they found out that he had won the hungriest but award and then they googled him there was no Google back then this is like the 90s they found some online pictures of him with two dudes treating him like Chinese finger that goes how many dicks in your ass do you have to get to get that in that in a year to get that will award like I think it's just right Iria wrong again I think it's just what they call the video to sell it how much I don't think it was

famous at as onra where no one else is getting famous is there gay gang gang-bang because they're due to one to 5000 they DP or triple P in the butthole do they do that okay this guy says I only watched Brent Corrigan or this a woman rather amperes and she says it's Brent Corrigan that might be her ex-boyfriend let's see oh yeah this fucking clown I'm gonna I want to get cast okay let's see he's a male modern gay pornographic ass best known for his stage name hmm yep there he is for his roles in schoolboy crush and velvet mafia he has won six gave en they have the GAVI etc / kayvyun awards including best bottom award two consecutive years or they just talking about the shape of the but um best bottom is do you being on the bottom taking in the end o means yeah doesn't mean they

good surgeon said is it put the fuck right this guy's been a lot of goddamn movies alright let's let's find out what the number what would we what would you say record yeah Rickard let's see Greece holds the record for the biggest gay gangbang increase the movie No probably probably a dude this was 780 men Oh big luscious regular checks yeah going nuts on ass but 780 men but not one dude right one dude I believe they got a crush women because the women are doing like 50 maybe a hundred is arrested right but guys three - that are more adorable I think that the problem is finding these guys that get in line and film it gay guys finding that would be hard cuz it 10% of population it would be hard but if the numbers weren't a problem they're willing to ship people in I think guy gay porn would crush regular porn in gang games Wow listen to this though man listen to this shit the most ejaculatory orgasms ever recorded in one hour for a man is 1616 in one hour orgasms recorded in one hour for a man dude nice guy for the furthest a woman has ever been recorded to ejaculate was 9 feet 29 inches well and why would it be 9 feet 29 s were 12 inches as a foot that's stupid oh that doesn't make any sense guys came 16 times in an hour why does it say nine feet 29 inches oh it says three meters okay is that three meters was just nine feet right isn't it no no it's 3 feet per meter right roughly right so three meters is nine feet so why is it nine feet 29 inches it doesn't make any sense of 12 inches as a foot anyway whatever the fuck that says the greatest distance ever attained for a jet of semen that has ever been recorded is 18 feet 9 inches that's huge Wow why not it be Lexington still Horst Schultz that's the guys name that shot a load that went 18 feet in the in in the air that's incredible up up in the air or across we the ways man decides yes he's gotta be a distance no way it could be straight up dude 18 that's incredible a nice arc like a McDonald's sign type thing going on no 418 feet did they video it I don't know they must have just mean these are all world records this is the top 10 sex World Records on believe it or not the average speed of a man's loads what would you say your average speed your loads would be like 35 miles an hour what do you think Brian 82 28 miles an hour 28 miles an hour pretty close it's pretty close it's got do you think your car drove by you could tell the difference tuna cargo in 28 miles an hour in 35 miles an hour that's pretty fucking close having swallowed the most amount of semen ever officially recorded Michelle Monaghan had one point seven pints of semen pumped out of her stomach in Los Angeles in July of 1991 who is it pumped out by her ass that'd be awesome dude one point seven pints but maybe she had like a glass of coconut water see - oh very delicious right before and it mixed in with the loads maybe might have increased the size of the quantity of fluid in her you know when she threw up maybe she's throwing up loads and a sprite you don't know right right what are they gonna test it make sure it's a hundred percent loads no they just looked at it as light a pizza yeah she just came into a big one of those big glass baking measurement cups she just threw up in it it was one point seven the fuck is this podcast cop the female gangbang record is owned by a woman named Houston who had intercourse with 620 men I think that's been yeah that's Betty by then this is some guys yeah I don't think it really is 600 men no I think what they do is they do is the same guys and they keep rotating them may consider that yeah dick common and they come back oh shit yeah that's why that's not the real records like who made those records I think you forgot the girl fucks two dudes and they switch off a couple of times she can say she fucked 15 guys right this doesn't even have gay it has a male gang bang male gang bang world record goes to porn star John Doe who worked himself over 55 women in one day he had five to six ejaculations pretty good well yeah checks mean wild that guy committed suicide uh-huh that guy blew his fucking brains out I have four ejaculations

different thing right Brian it's DIF love this time you never find [Music] tech guy yeah well I just thought it was weird because I never thought it was possible in my life like I've always wondered how like guys I'm porn do it and somebody get some viagra in your drink it might because like I've already said that I think she's like do you think she's sneaking it in there maybe she got tired of you like memory you say you would fall asleep because you were too tired he'd go down on her and then fall asleep because you were too tired to do anything you do her and then you could fall asleep who talked about on the podcast you to yes you did my current hair off your shoe dude you said she was horny and you too tired to have sex with her she would go down no that was one time that was one time and one time maybe that time she's like I'm tired of this shit I wanna get fucked that's what she started crumpling up viagra and I'm gonna cook for you tonight honey she made you a nice viagra meatloaf in like 2001 I got third row tickets to The Cure I was so jazzed I was remember born-again that stripper sure is a long time we would all need a stripper that was a born-again Christian so you'd call her born-again that was so anyways she was only stripping just to pay for school but she was like hardcore Christian but we were going to the Cure so I'm like I need some ecstasy for this concert so I meet up with my buddy in the afternoon to get some ecstasy and I always have vitamin bottles with me and I put them in my vitamin bottles when I go when I eat I'm gonna take him out of the vitamin bottle and you know eat and take my vitamins it's one o'clock I go to El Pollo Loco we're sitting we're gonna leave around 7:00 I eat my chicken sitting there watching TV and I just got really horny I just looked at him like what fucking beast fuck this chick so I throw in the bed oh my god damn feels like I'm on ecstasy oh my god I jumped off the bed went open up my vitamin bottles like are you fucking verse 2 I forgot to blow him out of my vitamins I didn't know I was on ecstasy until right in the middle of sex that's all it was incredible sex like it's like come on e man that's funny I bet he is supposed to kill your boner didn't you say that you would take viagra and E together cuz you called after a while after a while it kills your boner but not in the beginning in the beginning you get really really horny but if you want to go yeah when you're on yeah well people are different no no people are different like for me if you know back in the days when every now and then I pop with a pill I would get a boner really quick how many times we've done e in your life how many times man back when I was younger I probably did E mm maybe 40 times whoa oh my a lot thanks a lot it explains a lot I was younger this motherfuckers taking shit he doesn't even know what it is he's taking bath salts yeah you gotta get your shit from reputable sources you need to find some friendly person that works at a club somewhere but excess is bad okay I don't it kills your brain and for sure does ecstasy is not bad like my problem is is that you don't know what you're taking yeah that's all boy shit exactly that stuff is supposed to be really have you seen to this this crocodile shit the shit that they're taking the Soviet Union if they're shooting it up and it's making your skin rot away there's all these photos of people with their bones hanging off literally your bones exposed wherever they shot it up like their flesh is deteriorated to point where their bones are exposed yeah it's crazy to look at man it's Chris what a weird world we live in man people will take some drug that will make your your skin literally rot off your body people take some shit that they think is ecstasy and it turns out to be some weird fucking and feta mean that somebody made in the lab you know who knows what the fuck is gonna do to you and it's not the end they're gonna keep coming up with more and more of these things thinking about the dummies yeah these bath salt that's you bro you took that shit right is it does that scare you what do you think of that yeah that you could have taken something really nutty now when you buy stuff like that if you buy like ecstasy doesn't that scare you like you never know like you might get it from some some dude that is scary if you heard about this cocaine that's making people's fucking flesh rot have you heard about this shit no some cocaine is bad cocaine that's in California it's in New York and it's treated with some livestock dewormer that's what they cut it with and you know let me look it up right now because it's fucking crazy and people you probably there yeah yeah yeah it's cocaine bad cocaine in Los Angeles in New York City tainted with a some sort of hereness a livestock dewormer yeah it's really fucked up what happened to you when you do it they're getting they're getting really bad noses ears and cheeks develop ugly purple swatches of dead skin this is like DS it's it's called love amma soul that's the stuff and the dealers are cutting it with this shit and i say like 90% of the cocaine in New York and California is is contaminated with is this this shit 90% of the cocaine excuse me 70% the US Department of Justice is reporting this okay by the way this is just the US Department of Justice they might just be saying this to cut out the cocaine business they're saying up to 70% of the cocaine in the u.s. is contaminated with this levan the soul which is cheap and widely available and commonly used for deworming livestock whoa what the fuck man what are they doing you would think that that would be something that someone who hates cocaine users would do you would think that that would be someone who actually wants to stop people from using cocaine would you know they would be like mix it in there so that people would stop coming back you know and I'm saying like why would you do that if you're trying to sell more cocaine that almost seems like something like the government would do ma'am like the whole stories probably fake and they're just putting it out there to scare you like people are on Pirate Bay like oh there's a buyers in this file no no maybe but it's on LA LA Weekly seems like they would do their due diligence don't you think yeah don't you think yeah you fell asleep on me you motherfucker no I'm you thinking about your girlfriend no I said Ellie what do you think anything do you think that they would do this who the fuck would do this do you think this is the government who knows do you see the UFO videos over London do you believe in those did you see that I saw what does that look like to you I just there's so many videos like that it looks like CGI to me this is too convenient the whole the way it's set up is too convenient there's a bunch of people standing there looking up and everybody's looking up and they they're catching these things as they fly in and out of clouds I've seen it but you know what really makes me think that it's it's too convenient the guy film looks up films some of the UFOs and then looks down at all these people watching which is the fucking last thing that you would do if you actually thought you saw real UFOs flying through the air you would keep the fucking camera on them you wouldn't want to turn it and point down at all these people watching maybe maybe you don't know what the hell it is like look everyone's tripping out you know yeah but he showed that before you showed everybody looking up at the sky actors yeah I think it's fake people get a kick out of doing shit like that they think it's cute so much fake shit on the internet now that's one of the fun things about the internet trying to figure out what's fake and what's not Brian's the master at that shit he calls fakes he calls fakes better than anybody but sometimes he's off sometimes it's just sound sync problems and it looks fake look at this cocaine shit look what it's doing these people it's making their skin rot off there like making my ear turn mic blue and black there's fucking fall yeah there's some people have suffered permanent scarring on their body from the shit you know I got the good shit yeah like your nose fell off this message brought to you by prescription pills it's called love a muscle yeah le VA am i Sol of amasau it's bad for you kids and on that note I think this fucking podcast started off real strong and then some we lost lost steam we got into game it was my fault we go to the gay porn and Brian started reminiscing about his girlfriend pictures tomorrow somebody I'm not sure somebody will be on the podcast the guy from ancient aliens is coming on the podcast and he's coming on at the end of July it'll be July 27 and his name is Giorgio and it's a tough one to pronounce TS o u k al OS I think yeah sue Carlos sucralose maybe sue colos Giorgio tsoukalos and he's the guy from ancient aliens with the crazy hair who's a self-professed whacky alien love and bastard because that's what I called him he said yes guilty as charged he's cool as fuck I like him and I'm excited to have mom because we're gonna talk about some weird shit you should probably be on that one man I would love to ask ya you know that one there would be a fun conversation July 27 yeah we might have to bring you in on that one we'd have to bring Eddie Bravo in with the alien do it would be on yeah because you know one loves aliens more than you and him you and him together be a fucking oh yeah we fuck people a tsunami of alien love don't you have like aliens all over your logos well my whole logo is alien saucers I bump down I love a lot of UFO DVDs and I do like 200 everything that's but that's why I don't believe in them I've seen so much stuff I think the way I look at it and this is not not that I don't believe in them because it's not that I don't believe in them I don't not believe I don't believe UFOs don't exist I don't believe that my mind is open about it but I'm not convinced either way but the way I look at it it's like everyone's got a goddamn camera with a on their phone everyone does now you would think that if there if I meet a thousand people okay out of every thousand people that I meet at least 10 of them are fucking morons extreme morons right if you meet a thousand when you say ten are just complete idiots pathological liars completely fucked up right a good solid ten right so I would think that if there's that many people that are idiots and fucked up and then you look at the number of UFO stories like what are the numbers the numbers like are similar to what you would expect from a population of retards the smartest people warna von Braun and Hermann Oberth there were rocket scientists they not only believe in aliens they're saying our technology came from messages from beings from other solar systems that's what they're saying yeah I would have to talk to them I believe that quote go Wernher von Braun quote beans from UFO beans from other worlds his exact quote as beans from other worlds helped us yeah I've seen that I've seen that written but who knows what that really is what he said you know it's so hard when the dude is dead and he died in 1977 you know who the fuck knows what he actually said you know well you know maybe yeah maybe but yeah two different guys no I think look it is entirely possible it's proven that the pot was actually legit like yes here's the video of him actually saying then what happens at that point that's that's pretty yeah maybe or maybe he's a troll maybe Wernher von Braun's big Nazi troll I mean the thing about Wernher von Braun is he was the head of Nazi of NASA rather but he was a confirmed Nazi and then the Simon Wiesenthal Center said if that guy was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity so who the fuck knows he could have been trolling but I don't I don't believe that it's impossible it's definitely possible so I'm looking forward to having this giorgio dude on it should be a fascinating conversation I want to find out how his brain works man now because he settled he says a lot of crazy stuff I want to know yeah it seems like I almost like it could be a character maybe a little bit maybe maybe it's fun you know maybe some of it's sexy I mean here on sex yeah it's sexy it's sexy to believe in Bigfoot you know it's sexy to believe in aliens it's it's sexy to believe in all that shit it's interesting who the fuck knows but that's coming up I don't know who's gonna be on tomorrow but we'll get somebody and then maybe Thursday is gonna be my friend Jana Ervin you know Yong dude who wrote all the books on on mushrooms and and and religion the problem is he said got the flu and I don't want the fucking flu let's give him a couple weeks yeah yeah he turned me on a lot of things he's a fascinating cat he's a real real odd duck and he's written two books now on psychedelics and religion wine he was with us when we first did DMT he was with us when we you had that crazy bad trip yeah it was pretty bad screaming gallon screaming Eddie fucked up and he ate food right before he went on his trip which you're never supposed to do you're not supposed to have anything in your stomach when you go on the trip because your body you know kind of freaks out so he in the middle of this trip gets up and I have to help him get to sink and he threw up in the sink you you hurled in his scent you know up all over the floor no no no you made it to sink you made it to the sink you you don't remember the story that could right it's probably thought it was a deeper Gale the whole time - I was like wow just hanging out with Edie burger because when whoever wrote this whole story on your message board didn't put any profit right that was John yeah change the names of every yeah and I thought was et per gentlemen why change it was a Johnny Rotten I think was Johnny Rotten maybe it was either Yan or Johnny rot and change the names I'd open the sink and your little bar yeah yeah yeah that's we threw up without screaming and I was screaming and I looked up at you and I'm like I'm alright don't worry about me and then like that was like me letting you know just let me fucking throw a lot cream I'm gonna be fine well the thing about bad trips is the real real bad trips happen when you're trying to control the experience yeah like the whole idea is to just let go and let this journey happen and you gotta
