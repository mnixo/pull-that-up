I like that Matt Hughes song country boy can survive oh yeah fucking love that song that's a goddamn I like R&B man but now everyone is too gangsta Erin piece at the end of the day some guys on the same I'm gonna fucking I'm a puppet Kathy's mother fuckas Hank a gangster R&B dude you sing yeah you're a singer for living do you know what would have happened to me if I told my dad when I was six years old daddy I want to be a singer you would have fucking get out on the street well they just don't like to think of themselves as being that that's a feminine thing so they overcompensate I sing for a fucking but rappings not singing right rapping sort of reppin is just fast talking to you horse shit tight spot Jesus shit talk like I hate everybody you're a rhythm to it yeah it is kind of like musical but yeah baby I like old Garn be like I love Marvin Gaye like that motherfucker just had a voice man but I don't like the new stuff cuz I don't believe them it's two kids and like just like our Kelly I love our calculus is funny man cuz it's so ridiculously gaudy your name sake she wore my mother fucking clothes he's saying that I mean though shit these things is like a ghetto conversation and he just puts it to song I'd appreciate that but you know and every second word is it's like a bad with the to be word MIGA you know we don't have that in Australia just yeah cool anyone that there's really black people in Australia but every 600 or doesn't even exist no it wouldn't say it really nah so it's like Americans call someone a bow a bow right Apple Aborigine Aborigine yeah I see a bow is about wood it doesn't exist over here because someone hey you fucking a bow no go fucking black on American a bow you go right right what's that when a nigra is gonna kill me but if you call an Aborigine in a bow it's the same thing as problem and they'll pour petrol on you and set you on fire oh but I don't know miss that's just a short version Aborigine yo you got to turn that shit off son teach me so long I don't know what five in the afternoons time to get your boss bothered by the toilet you got that shit a car you sick fuck but you're right it's it's it's an abbreviation it's like if you're Jewish and I say you're Jew doesn't matter fat right Aboriginal AB oh yeah Italian I tie is nothing right once I smell trillion Ozzy yeah what's wrong with that a bose hype being called a boy I made a mistake man once saying the Japs have created some insane shit and this guy goes do you know how racist that is you just said that I'm like what we're talking about NSX's we're talking about engineering like Japanese racecar engineering like they've invented some incredible shit their cars are so reliable and so I said the Japs have invented some incredible shit this guy's like do you know racist that is like dude I had this argument last year with someone cuz I called someone a jack back home and it's like it's it's like the world war 2 Alliance thing that it's racist is called Jack and I've gone gotta get past that I've been working around Japanese people for years and I'm sure I've called them jet to their face and they don't mind and it my mates like dude it's so fucking racist so strong you can't say Jap above ah so I went to Japan I asked my producer I said dude if I call you a Jap are you offended because no it's short for Japanese we go no offense yeah you know fucking stop thinking pill harbor and you know we use bombs on her and people thought the nips was far too effective me but you know born yes actually just that's how the Japanese say Japan they don't say Japan they say Nepal some people are retarded it's it's a strange thing where people don't want to step on people's toes over nonsense like what abbreviation of a name is bad but in Australia subtance is the only thing that's back in 10th it's all in how do you feel like you can you say these Japs are fuckin badass and make some cool shit or do you say these Japs these little tiny cock yellow motherfuckers coming over here to fuck all the white women and take all the land and you start getting angry well then Japs is a bad thing but it's the intent behind it that's bad it's an abbreviation man dirty the population so people are always looking for a reason to be pissed off we're so pissed off just about life itself about traffic and bullshit and bills and the constant menage where everybody has a fucking opinion this died man why can't some people just shut off the fuck up that's a fucking you see sighs I read on me to this uptight it's like what qualifies you to have a fucking opinion that I should pay attention for are you sitting behind your website fucking getting paid to put your opinion on it no well even the ones who are there's a lot of websites out there there is there's a lot of bloggers in my opinion that aren't nearly as good as some of the commentary guys who post on like mixed martial arts calm there's some fucking intelligent guys that I've been reading their posts for years and if their I know that if there's a post about anything like serious well this guy he post something about there's gonna be an interesting opinion I want to read this but how many writers can you say that about how many mmm a right well I think there's more talented people on forums now the other thing with him a might rod is is I they are blinded to anything outside of UFC all right and I love the UFC because I'm a fucking huge MMA fan josh grosses Josh crushed Opilio rush one of the rare ones there's a few that aren't but a lot of them are blinded 20 themed that he's not UFC they're very scared yeah they might be scared they're scared they're gonna be yanked the credentials from from from Dana yeah I forget what day today look great I know it's it's creepy but a lot of them don't even know anything about martial arts bro you could not sit down and have a conversation really not martial arts with them it's you know and Dana is so competitive that he does have this environment where you know he feels like they should pay attention to UFC first and then if they don't he's not very happy with that you know I would say you sees the one it's the promotion it is the one you go to plantations is and for much that attitude in the pushing it like that is the reason why this fucking sport is genetically reason why it's going Australia second he's not lazy alright nice easy he's taking on all fronts you know he's so it's it's tough for journalists you know in that sense you know but there are some fucking talented guys out this you know like Josh Krause is a talented journalist you know and he's honest about shit he's sometimes he's a little hyper critical sometimes guys get like critical about dudes abilities and characters and they try to say something bitchy because if someone puts in a bad performance they'll just they feel like you know it's their job to be critical and to be shitty looking better better to fucking rot about I I did the kyo he's a perfect prisoner of you what what do you say what about our like a cro cop in a mere fight when cro cop in me or fight man there's not a lot of positive things to say the positive thing to say is the end of of course Frank Mir landed a perfect knee and put cro cop away and then finish them you know jumped all over him so that's that's a good thing to say but for everything up before that what could a writer say you know so they just start going off about you know the just the worst possible shit that they could think of you know what's wrong with Frank Mir and how you know he's got this attitude and crow cops should hang it up and they'll just write the most bitter fucked up shit you know I think the human drama is far more compelling the real drama of that fight you know it's like need that was a strange fight man didn't feel me that fight liked each other or something Milko came out and he said even if I lose I'm not gonna get cut from UFC so when I read that I don't know if I can say this fully say that he came out and said one of the websites like medico says even if I lose I can't get cut well if that's the case I don't wanna fucking watch that fight man because already I know that I'm not sure if you've got to the back of your head I'm not sure if he really said that I these words when maybe misconstrued very could be taken out of context if you lose this fight do you think you'll be kicked out of the UFC I hope not Mirko says he won't be kicked out of UFC if you lose in this fight you know it's a journalism sometimes is that bad yeah it's misconstrued Easton shaved exactly and then trained for the role I supposedly said I was like I didn't say it like that you know you're missing that has been the big difference bro between commentating outside of America and then recently coming on to the American scene it's like you get people that sit there and watch the broadcast and analyze every fucking word and pause and breath you take and then dissect the down to the new 3d online it's bad and it's negative but I also think it's good for me personally it's good I've learned a lot from shitty people online saying shitty things because you know worst case scenario what can they attack you on is there any validity in this total piece of shit who's saying terrible things about you but do they have a point and if they do have a point then you can like snatch victory from the all their negative bullshit by using whatever site and improving it in white if you use a positively it X is a watchdog for your own abilities on your eyes appearances on a toe to total cunts though I get personal freedom out of like reading the shittiest nastiest things that like I know just some desperate angry fuckhead says and turning it into a positive thing for me like I have this little game because it's very difficult to do I want to do like sullen Bob and J star like hunt the fuck is there man when you reach it about to get mad get used to it man you know it's like and I tend not to read a lot of it because it's like what am I gonna do sit there and read it and and and go wow I'm so super and fantastic cause people give me these compliments and then you read people that'll bag you why well it's right it's good to know that people are enjoying what you did good to know and to know and to run act with them and I saw you did that recently on the Underground you made a have my first time on the ground yeah there there's plenty of cool people in there yeah I post on there all the time yes it's there's plenty of cool people there there's gonna be douchebags no matter what when you have an anonymous scream names and people could say anything they want whenever you have that situation is going to be dude it's just sad that well yeah sure dog which has got some great posts but also some literally fucking ridiculous bull fuckers on there as I can so many Pro fighters that I know in so many media guys just won't post on sites like that anymore because of the reason that people just attack and attack like fucking piranhas yeah this a lot of hateful fucks out there I'm hateful fuck its but it's a fascinating thing man because we're finally getting to see that like everyone gets to see that now yeah it used to be you never got to see that of your star you know stars I think just 20 years ago were were much more likely to be believing their own bullshit yeah like yes for the one yeah I'm worried right back that they never saw shit and if it got a magazine they approved it you know if I got a newspaper it had to be like big news like Roman Polanski I have news to make it in the newspaper but now man they're all up in your shit every day man everything is just taken apart and dissected Twitter I'm getting used to Twitter I went what is not be in Australia dude like what do people in Australia who know about Twitter no one's with everyone's on fucking Facebook oh no one tweeters in Australia some people are still stuck on MySpace both Twitter and Facebook on mine are connected so if I send something on Twitter it goes to to Facebook it says it there to do a certain about technology your house is like fucking Nasser in Yemen shuttles and shit like I'm a technology junkie dude I'm bombing fascinated by what's going on with technology and then can you seriously leave any higher up on a fucking Mountain or whatever yeah yeah when I was living in Colorado nosebleed drawing up here man this ain't shit this civilization compared to where I was living I was living down I was living 8 miles down a dirt road on the top of a mountain in Boulder fuck man that's why I like to live I like to live up and above so that when like waves of water or wave when the retards and I got either waves of water or aims and retards you see them coming up the hill I just I don't I just like being away I think I'm very sensitive to people's energy and people's thoughts their lives and their bullshit so I like to be as when I sleep and when I'm at home and when I'm riding when I by myself I like to be as far away from people as possible I like man it's cool because all the houses here are different than all the same and all the guarded communities I've seen here in the states because we don't have guarded communities in ours the houses look all the same though and up here they're all different and on the guard gate there's two guards how's this two guards name Ralph hmm at once on Judy I read the on-duty sign that's three of them two of them I named Ralph don't you ever get maybe the Ralph really and maybe it's a conspiracy there's a rule man in the world like those coca-cola inventors that had to be at least fifty feet apart from each other at all times you know it's like you never see to relabel what is in the South Nikola inventors had to be fifty feet apart from each other never hear that urban legend is a kid know like the inventors of coca-cola or the inventors of KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken with the secret recipe that they carry around on them all the time must at least be fifty feet apart as one of them dies the other so one of them dies from the other one survives Wow could you imagine if a recipe was that valuable the KFC secret of living birds gonna spices nothing will fuck up your KFC appetite like watching one of those PETA videos I love fucking children's urban legends man rear school I'll told you about about being a black belt when the kid said to me in grade five all talking about martial arts and he's like you can't be any more than a third down blacked out in Australia or you've got to get out of the country because you're then lethal weapon and have a license to kill and I believe that for years man I would probably believe it too wow you just can't get too deadly I guess yeah speaking about urban legends do you get the same ones that we do here did you guys get the Richard Gere gerbil room Oh in the ass yes I didn't get that mad cuz I we didn't know what gerbils work because we call them uh I think it's what we call guinea pig we have guinea pigs - guinea pigs are much bigger though what's a gerbils are wrong it's almost like yeah it's like a mouse now people genuinely stick mice up there if I'm so look if you've thought of it someone's put it up their ass that's a fact and I knew about this I didn't want to know about this but I knew but my buddy Steve Graham who is a friend of mine from back when I was like 15 years old and still still good friends he's a doctor and he did his residency in Miami and he said you got to see everything oh dude my students tell me yeah gunshot wounds and every day they'd be pulling some new thing I deduce asses doctor Nicoletta's back in Melbourne so doctor friend of mine great doctor to go to dinner with because you'll tell you our stories for hours right here's people to a working duel though the dildo was still on in a guy's colon it was lodged it went so far up his insides cry and he it's a milk it out of the guy's fuckin colon and shoot it out of his ass and the dildo was still on some other go in there and had a fucking brim a fish up his ass river fucking dream up his ass the thing that shocked my friend the most was glass he said a lot of oh hell ass up their ass those thick bottles and jars and the jars break and oh no the freakiest one man what doctor he told me was it wasn't about ass was two gay guys that came to see him no one gay guy came to see man he had problem with his cock his cock had all this passing shit coming out of oh so dr. Nix had a look at his cock you know he's gone I just don't know what I'm seeing here dude if I did what have you been doing what would the reason for this be so the gay guy proceeded to tell him he thought well this might be the reason what him his gay lover were doing they were getting thin pieces of pipe thin pieces of piping like this like long pipes he would stick it into his urethra and then connect the other end to his gay lovers urethra and then they would piss before I would peace between the cocks so he was pissing it to his lovers cock and his lover pissing back into his cock and he's gone into the doctor saying doc my cock go fucking pass over it why a doctor looks like why the fuck do you think you are you ride with another human being you dirty with a medal through your deck it's probably the metal rod through the dick that fucked him up more than the past you seen back in full this is basically sterile oh I was the other all the other people retold me and this fat chick the came in one day like mega fat like you know what sitting goober grape that fucking big fetch 500-pound huge well you guys use kilos use kilos kill us so she'd be like people would fire 280 kilos who hunted Akebono size 500 pounds better though yeah 500 pounds that's like yogurt size cool kilos is just too big so this this fucking gargantuan behemoth comes in right and she came in and she'd stuck a tampon too far up her pussy so she asked dr. NIC to get it out so here to get other fuckin pliers the tongs and go in this girl's fuckin cavern right but she got through all the fat no thighs and pull out a tampon she came back the next month with the very same problem and she was coming back for four months in a row with the same problem of sticking a tampon too far per cunt to be able to pull it out so eventually dr. NIC realized that when he was because he'd never looked her in the face when you don't look her in the face really pull he should have a cap on this time he had here an inkling so I was like he's sticking tongs up at pussy and because this girl's a fucking animal a fucking beached whale no one's ever gonna touch her vet right it's probably never been touched and chill so that felt good I heard so for her he's he's going inside she's like that oh my god he realizes realize that she's not found tampons up her pussy so that he'll go get them so who'd got fucking fishing there and get the tampon for a girl like that there should be a place where you go with guys just finger you I'm all for that you know when I talk about being for prostitution I'm all for I'm for dudes doing it - I'm forgiveness eatin girls pussies and fingering school kids me the bro I never understood what the big deal is about getting a handjob you know you get on whatever although it's way more of a big deal for a girl what I'm saying for girls is that would be a sweet spot for them like a store where they could just go anger and there's like a hole in the wall and our hands go through in just that way the cleat you don't have to go out with some dude just cuz you need sex you can just fucking you know you'd be all right we get it when you really want to get into a relationship you clean sterilized

professional Zelda scroll and if I go inside the professionalized I kneel on a Pew okay yeah so you're in this little phone book type phone booth type situation and you have a monitor in front of you

self-fulfilling prophecy too like they literally manifest their own war against the Liberals and did it wasn't a Fox News it was that whole thing about when Bush was voted in for the first time and Fox News did something about the voting polls you know when Bush big gore and gore was actually the guy that won at the Guardian and Fox News had something to do with the way that they told voters that Bush had already won but some votes somewhere had it mean Donald counted right how can our works here in America but nobody knows how it works I Detroit something about it man ok David he cried something about it want to be spokes yeah you know what I love I love when one when politicians get busted for something sexual anything deviant anything sexual Fox always makes them a Democrat they

the head twice I'm not kidding man I'm not kidding he shot himself in the head twice I wish I could remember lobst all the bogus details this story but the that's the coroner's report was it he shot

when I'm jet lag for 4:30 in the morning there's not a car in sight for fucking miles and I'll be standing next to a businessman and he still will not jaywalk never at 4:30 in the morning we'll wait for the little man to turn green why is that they're fucking weird like zombies over there everything is regimented on the streets no one screams no one swears no one beeps their horns there's no graffiti everyone's smiles to each other everyone is courteous to each other it is like a fucking a mind-boggling overly polite utopia if you're into that sort of thing if you could speak English it it'd be it'd be amazing if they spoke English it isn't insane the realtor is insane at the fight shows you've seen the fight you hear a superhero drop yeah you can hear a pin drop ste thousand people forty-five thousand of dynamite last year we used to do 80,000 for K 180 sales were enos our cutters I still they appreciate Mooji to get golfclap why do I get a fucking golfclap it's it's an amazing culture manda the Tokyo experience I want you to come with me one day in your fucking well I would love to to go see k1 I've always want to see k1 grand prix live i've always want to see that yeah it's gotta be I'm a big fan of it and that's one of the reasons why I love HDNet fights you know it's like fuck you know finally you know mayhem and I were talking about it when we did inside MMA I saw that out Cuba is not Cuban on that that was great we were talking about how it used to be if you wanted to watch k1 you had to get these fucking grainy VHS tapes or get some shit off the internet but now you can watch in hi-def you know it's fucking awesome scary watching some of the people don't know how exciting that is who don't know okay no idea most of what people like in the UFC is striking that's what the average person likes striking I feel like people boo when shit goes to the ground happens all the time for those people that are just like they just want to watch some violence what the fuck is more violent in k1 and what who the fuck is no Valen than Alistair Overeem man fucking hey Gary there's somebody in cracked cracked calm wrote that he looks like he was genetically engineered to fuck your girlfriend pretty sure was crack calm I hope I'm crediting the right people oh man that's exactly what he looks Tootie's fucking freak which leads me to the question now cuz when we spoke like last time on the voice versus the whole rage then was phaidor versus Brock and we spoke a lot about fatal versus Brock yeah and you know I have to fight all these never dream that fights lost its luster completely yeah so now everyone is like Overeem vs. Brock yeah what over I want to see over in versus fade or two I want to say that Alastair wants that fight badly like he is alive we did the voice versus Alistair Overeem we shot it in Korea and man he really wants to fight fine I know what here's the thing with our all-star over him you got to fucking take him down there's all that talk of standing there's all out the window now it used to be the guys could stand without al star like Chuck stood with him forbid Chuck actually shut in for a takedown with him you know the problem down star was always that he was trying to make 205 yeah I was always the problem yeah and he wasn't dedicated like he is now but once that motherfucker went up to heavy weight and started getting dedicated he's he's scary is far the thing is like last weekend he knocked out Ben Edwards Ben's and Ozzy and I've been commentating him for like six hours tough fucker though right tough to go tough go Alastair dropped him three times but three clean shots and the thing is that usually Alastair would get away with a lot because if he strength and he sighs alone but now his technique is just superb man and you know he was training in Thailand for like three weeks of the golden glory gym in Thailand doing proper muy Thai training though the Thai trainers there helping them out and you can tell that he's just lifted his game to another fucking level - he's spooky right now.i spooky his stand-up is spooky yeah you know I love the fact that he goes back and forth though I love the fact that he goes into MMA and to respect I had for probably only God doing it at that high lip no one else of course and level sure not even know no question there's no one even that compares to the level of k1 that he's achieved and the level of MMA because we've always had guys who say like oh he's a real he's a really good striker and you know they are for for MMA yeah but how stars a really good striker for k1 exactly but who can adjust to MMA striking which is very impressive because you know the distancing the footwork is all completely different from MMA structure by one striking so to swing between them at the two highest levels is this is an insane attitude when he put it to Brett Rogers I was like God through a man you fucking through him it was it was that but it was before he threw him he was fucking him up his feet he hit Brett Rogers with the he ducked under a right hand and hit him with a leg kick and then and then popped out of the way and you could see the look on Rogers face seems like there was a it was like was a fuck Joel am i doing here it was a jolt to work oh shit like you know nobody ever kicked him like that before tamils just luck you know what I'll just bend over to get fuck me in the Oscars gonna be less painful than the beating you're about to die motherfucker just digs that shin into that meet Bob bomb and it was that look on Rogers faces like for a second you saw this flash like god damn he just got hit by lightning fuck Ellis says break now I'll be cleans up on the cable that's a big problem to me that there's all these organizations if there was just the UFC we don't know who is the best right but a star would not have got gotten to become a star if it wasn't for fighting all these other organizations yeah yeah I mean there's not enough fight for in the UFC there's not enough that you know there's long enough shows there's there's only so many shows like we need other organizations but I just wish they could fucking just figure out a way to work it out where they get to fighting just don't come together as friends for one night for one night my problem is and then maybe you and I could come on tight together finally for one it would have one night the problem is the UFC is such a much bigger name and there were so much more money and Peter and it would lend respectability to Strike Force which is like build up the enemy like yeah you couldn't really do it unfortunately business-wise but fuck but yeah I mean Rock bro you know Brock is like the perfect guy to like sell as like a heavyweight champ oh fuck you know the fucking screen you know what worriedly man from rakh you think Brock fighting Alastair and the way that he turned on those punches from Carla oh my god what if yeah if that was Alastair and how about those knees oh no one's got knees like our star our star knees you into fucking the one he fucked Fujita with on yo put Fujita into a mini coma he was out for how long it was fuckin out for ten minutes at least then they took in the hospital and he went in the mini coma at hospital he was fat and Alastair said to me because I said to him I go dude do you ever feel any remorse for just fucking smashing people's faces and brains with those knees and he goes yeah he goes fujita he goes I actually felt really bad after I did it Wow what about to share a man you almost killed that fucker in the Grand Prix I thought Sarah was dead he's like yet to share was how she goes but fujita he actually was troubled by it he felt really sorry well I think was cuz Fujita had already been knocked out and then stopped a few times he was old religion and others like the sellout of even man that was body clearly didn't look the same anymore didn't look like an athlete anymore I was just fuckin violent man when he fought James Thompson in dream yeah the standing guillotine yeah they just said the muscles is there you walk back he's fucking beautiful man he tapped eat or suelto stab me toilet with a guillotine you know okay I'll start nasty bro he's a nasty fucking and nasty you know what brock lesnar vs al star would be a dream match but Brock's got to get past Cain Velasquez so that doesn't mean he's right for I don't I wouldn't put an upset tokima say is right for an upset but I don't call it an upset if Kane beats bro because Kane has all the weapons to be able to beat Brock Kane might be the motherfucker yeah he might be the motherfucker yeah you know I think Brock is a handful for any man on the planet he proved in that last fight that he's got like a serious ability to overcome adversity and and and still you know like gut it out and make it through he didn't tap he didn't freak out you know he covered himself up he protected himself he was getting bombed on but you know other than him the biggest strongest fucking guy in the division it was definitely the best puncher in the division and no one punches his heart as Carwin colony he's got wrecking balls you know he just dropped bump so he got through all that made it through that first round and then came and want it immediately into the second so he's he's overcome adversity believes in himself he's a winner that's all well and good though Cain Velasquez he's a fucking storm that you know here's fucking some was something that Bob cook said they were we're talking about one of the fights that Cain just fucking I think was Rothwell just ran him over you know and uh he said well you know the thing with fighting Cain is you always think that you're just gonna ride out the storm he goes but the storm doesn't end yeah that that is what that guy does we as storm doesn't end it just punches and kicks and punches and kicks and fucking takedowns and punches and kicks and punches kit and you're like where is this motherfucker getting all this cardio from does it all with power man that's the scary thing it's all fucking me pal and he doesn't fade yeah he doesn't fade he comes out strong in the third when he molested Cheick Kongo and that's what that match was that was like three round molestation I mean he took bombs bombed big shots on the jaw knees buckle he almost goes down and then three seconds later he's executed to take down his inside control and he's smashing him you know I mean that was just like that was overwhelming man it was overwhelming what he did to that guy man motherfucker dude I can't wait for that I come out to CT to come back you know I'm looking forward to that as well and but man Brock right now is gonna be nuts sorry Brock and Kane and then man I want to see Alastair mrs. Brock one day course you know Ellis tickets I want to see Alice Starr I mean I would like to see how I start clean-out Strikeforce - I would like I think if al Starr can beat ver doom that would be a huge rematch I think there's anyone in Strikeforce honestly that will touch him well we'll see man for doom gets him on the ground I bet for Doom has a say in that I bet he would try to tap a star I bet he thinks he can he did you know he's capable of doing it didn't he do it before did he tap out star he did it like what pride 2007 right doesn't funny that's true look like guess what different Werdum - yeah for doom just getting off of that a victory over phaidor he thinks he could tap anybody yeah he'll jump in fucking Garden Hill Climb guard on you may she try to lock you up in his leg you know was there that night in it strike force when fatal tap that was surreal watching that resize that was surreal I bet like it already no it was sad it was crazy why sad no big deal just got caught it's happy it's happy that we're doing pulled it off invar dooms all add motherfucker for the do man and he's awesome it'll sad to actually be present of the one night where fight or actually loses now as opposed to never have been visited if you love a fight yeah that's not sad though you were there it's no big deal you can appreciate all the other ones too yeah you know means a special athlete is a very very interesting guy to a lot I'm very fascinating personality but you know the bottom line is the only way to get through a guard like ver Doom's is you got a train with a guy like ver doom yeah if he was training with guys like we're doing we would hear about it we would hear oh you know he just went down and he's you know spending three weeks with Minotauro my note I was gonna work on his guard yeah you know you don't hear about all that shit so he's basically working with these guys that are pretty good they're decent and he's you know got so much confidence because he's undefeated in ten years and he thinks he can just fall into Verdoux guard you'll be just punch them in the face you can't do that with ver doing it was a cattle mistake man and I don't lie that's on another level yeah you don't appreciate I've rolled with guys like we're doing before and not not not that level but like Jean Jacques Machado he's at that level as far as like international and they just run through you yeah I mean just their slap shit on you and if you haven't felt that level if you're not in there all the time training with that you know you can get overconfident like I bet anybody that phaidor puts in his guard or if it get in you know in fate or gets in someone's guard in his camp yeah I bet he just runs through yeah I bet he just put postures up breaks free up nobody probably taps him a triangle no but he slaps that shit on likes like a fucking octopus from hell's just just like bitch you ain't going nowheres fucking just address tax and exhaustion attacks and everytime phaidor defends he gets deeper in the hole and phyto held on for as long as he could man but when he was a get is like oh my God he's fucking tapping okay his arms were about to go fade horse you know he's a bad motherfucker but he just made a mistake yeah he need everybody needs to work with the best guys it used to be that everybody was you know you could be able to have like this little camp and it was just you and a couple other guys that you train with but I don't think you can rock it like that yeah I think the levels just gotten too high everyone's got a train with the best guys this is the reason why Golden Glory in Holland have so much success in k1 and also mixed martial arts because the best guys are there not only in our fight each other and they'll fight each other and like seven Scheldt now start they're gonna fight each other they're gonna fight each other and they'll go for broke Errol Zimmermann fort Semmy Schilt earlier this year he went for went for broke on semi you know they're both from the same gym and when they spar together over in Holland they're sparring sessions are as hard as k1 fights they have like this day they call meet Wednesday and everyone on Wednesday this goes in the gym just beats the fuck out of each other like a k1 style fight and these guys are best mates our sake will beat on Zimmermann the two best mates will beat the fuck out of the other tomorrow you know that's how they train in Holland but that's the only a Golden Glory that's at every Dutch stream it's always been the Dutch style the time card a completely opposite the guys will go late into boring tires will go light inspiring heavy on bad work ties are always ferocious on fucking pads and on bags but inspiring the Thai spotlight the Dutch go light on the bags and the pad but they fucking gain each other inspiring that's such a rich way of approaching things it's just a mate and then you got guys like you know one of the sparring partners is Ramon Decker's man right I mean Ramon dick is maybe the greatest Muay Thai fighter ever and he's Golden Glory one of the head trainers him and call him errs and it just it's an amazing checkers you know bad motherfucker dude Wendell's Dicker's and Rob common my days with Rob came around a bunch of talk of Legends and he elbows with phenomenal yeah everything about him his leg kicks everything and the super cool guy Rob came is like the nicest friendliest guy more my mates trains are used to train with him Costas Mandalore the actor uh-huh you know yeah I know that guy is I'm gonna make Kazi in New York he's over there promoting saw the new saw film but he's going 3d so green ketchup and man he's been friends with Rob for years I was like dudes fucking bad-ass such a great guy yeah yeah a lot of Holland people are nutty man Holland's a plate crazy place huh red light district to the red-light district we've lost two miles there was 2007 and you can just get weed in the coffee shop and I've never been Peter it's took us out for the 9p deluxe to party right took right no Peter says he's a multiple time k1 treats on k1 world champion bad motherfucker I'm still in there slave what is all

beings I've ever fucking Melbourne I like greets me with a hug all the time is always laughing yeah just you know he took us out in 2007 was me Ray Sefo and a few of Peters mates went to the red-light district due to other stories you've heard about the red-light district that true well Peter answers it smokers ate all day Peter words had a fucking case of joints in his pocket that he would rip out and his best mate open the third ever coffee house in Amsterdam in like 1967 so he was like a pioneer of weed in Amsterdam right and don't you think people be surprised if they found out how many high-level fighters and MMA guys smoke weed ridiculous it's a big number to the show there in Amsterdam a damn steer marina and midway through and the having to mission you go outside to the smoke

difficult to grow there it's like it's harder to grow than indicus is like it is sativas is like space weed yeah well you go to the the place near my house ten different variety or really that's seeing how different varieties of sativa that's it's hard you sativa in when you live it in the east coast where it's illegal hard it's fucked to get a good sativa you got to know somebody who's a grower it's willing to take a chance to make a superior weed it's like it's it takes more time and so cost more money in the yield of small did when I was in Amsterdam I smoked a Viper eyes ball it fucked me cuz pitty goes hey Mikey try this try this subong and I hate smoking but I don't smoke much anyway and I smoked bonds a couple of times up to me they feel dirty right right so you put this

out of it invisible you cannot see it I know sort of see it I didn't know breathing yeah exhaling any smoke nothing were to see it but it looks like not much this doesn't like a you get used to like see smoker join you take a deep breath you blow it out there's a big cloud out of you yeah this is not a big cloud I was expecting big clown I was like fucking I wanted to write a clown it's a pure sensation - it was crazy it was like right there's something in the burning of the plant - I wonder if that has a psychoactive effect like I wonder if there's a psychoactive effect from the actual burning of the leaves like maybe together those things like there's maybe it calms you a bit or something because there's like hundreds of different you think this is Hollywood you see their leaves out there though and shit out there that no one has thought to smoke that is yet to be discovered as smokeable do you think like there's like mud or dirt out there that someone could maybe roll into a fucking piece of paper and smoke her mind no one's like smoked that mud or the seashell or that fucking a sea urchin that you can smoke it this is gonna be shit out there that no one it does not be a few things most yet for sure plants I mean if you look at the end was on wasn't marijuana discovered like we discover from goats eating it real like fucking in ancient days go to idiot and then go to

Facebook I go on Twitter I do it all the time you know anybody could be doing it hit me I know there's a lot of like you know like Aston Kutcher really doesn't he really goes who's yeah Justin Bieber's on out there Twitter and chicks I don't think that he's twittering a 12 year old girl in Melbourne maybe yes maybe I was trying to set it up baby junkies who got pretty guys four down on the tour probably back yeah about 24 months but then I'll be all blowed up baby finally you don't and I mean I have it going oh baby come to America the carnal age is only 15 in Australia you gotta wait another couple of years how old you have to be not sure I don't know uh you can fuck it 16 but you can only fuck someone who is under 18 Oh can't be over 18 and fuck a 16 year old that's smart yeah that's good move yeah that's that's that's see you gotta stop 16 year olds from fucking sorry come on but you guys have a more relaxed attitude towards a lot of things over there yeah it's much more relaxed when you got out of high school let me ask you this because this is the big thing in America's you know America or I grew up in Newton Massachusetts and Newton was uh you know a lot of successful people lived there no a lot of people who were like you know doctors and lawyers and they were very into their kids academic career years and like I was like it was a school worse like it was a very good school like really highly rated and everybody was super ambitious to you know to get out there and to go to college and they get things done when you guys graduated do you feel like this enormous pressure to like to go make something of your life no not really the college system that you have in the States doesn't is eastern Australia what is how do you guys do so we go high school right then after high school go to university but we don't have France we don't live on campus and we don't move interstate to go to university in fact in America wherever I go no one is ever from the state where I meet them so you're from Massachusetts right Boston we originally 50 Massachusetts yeah okay so you're from Massachusetts you live in in California right everyone is from a different state to where they were born right we're in Australia everyone pretty much remains wherever you're born really you grow up you're born in Melbourne you grew up in Melbourne you work in Melbourne have a family in Melbourne went to university in Melbourne you'll die in Melbourne no one ever goes to much to universities interstate and moves around everyone is pretty much where they're from and there's not really that that feel of I've got to go out and conquer the world and become a politician or change the world in any way it's like no fuck it I finished high school I'm gonna relax what sunny brings so much go out and conquer the world it's don't be a fucking loser oh there's a lot of pressure go out and you know get a fucking job let's go get no the problem is in Australia because our economy is really good at the moment yours is a house is really good a little is really strong against against the US dollar but the thing that thinking Australia is well you the dole is that easy okay the doll is easy to get by so you can be a bludger and just claim the dole every to doll meaning welfare oh don't mean in welfare yeah annotation the dolls I know people that live solely off the doll really that's it they get my shaking it up how much you get maybe a fortnight man you was before tonight what are you sorry for topples bills kid before tonight you don't have the winner I can't be your motherfucker oh good night for daddy's milord maybe if I'm my chicks watching The Tudors and I'm trying to get some pudding a fortnight you know like 200 in my time fuck you and fuck you in a fortnight in the are styling yes might be 200 bucks every two weeks 220 bucks every two hours highly livable my ball that yeah I guess you yeah dude that's for doing nothing that nothing what we call in Australia a dull bludger Wow yeah and there's a lot of those does that keep everybody calm so there's always something even if you're a fucking loser you always have something enough to rob and steal and yeah do you know an argument for that is there an argument for the idiots are always going to be idiots losers always going to be losers just if you give a little bit money you know who cares this is this way at least they have something how do they get invested back into the economy but not it's usually invested Bob unless you in your search by chiseler yeah drug dealer will purchasing alcohol yeah but it's far too easy that if there's too many don't is that a strategy though that it you know like let's let people be fucking losers and just take care of them and then there'll be less crime does that make sense yeah I could ask him I don't know I don't I don't think it's a strategy the dole didn't come in until like 1975 when there was a like they don't have it that if people are forced to catch up right people are forced to pay their own way and and you know yeah it's a bad thing is though I know a guy who's on the doll and he will not get off his ass to get a job he will not even go for job interview he claims it he's got some disability or whatever which he hasn't and it's like dude my fucking taxes that I work hard for my money and I've got to give mine to the government pay fucking taxes then go in your pocket to pay you to drink alcohol I said I'm all done but I would rather give my tax money to losers and drunks and idiots and people with no ambition whatsoever then to war I would rather oh look I don't you know say my boy goes to war and there's nothing I could say I'd rather put the fucking loses to work man it's like you know what you want the doll you're gonna fucking go and work in this plant you're gonna work in this factory you're gonna fucking send these mails out you're gonna do shit you're gonna go volunteer in fucking a hospitals that's a grater you know or in canteen or somewhere where they need you in volunteer your time in your services ready wait fire killed are losers per capita in America or in Australia like what like the percentage of losers as opposed to regular people what you qualify as a loser is a homeless person a loser just because they're fuck you you lost I can't homeless you lost I mean it might not you're not going to be a loser for life I'm not saying that this is a death sentence I'm saying America I've got a lot it disappoints me for the most paths powerful country in the world I was right America dude it's Saturday man you know there's a lot of insane people you know one of the reasons why the homeless population rocketed in the 1980s is because Ronald Reagan in his administration they changed the definition of insanity so there's a lot of people that were in fucking asylums man like well you're all right we were wrong you're not crazy - I just fucking sure yeah get your freak on I never understood it man and it's there's been a mental illness my only exposure to people being homeless when I was a kid growing up and watching American TV was watching the Brady Bunch and how they still run away from home when you're a kid I have to think that's how people ended up homeless by running away from home some people did man you know how many people ran away from home and just became fucked up fucked Hollywood this is the play of you driven around down walk down Hollywood a little bar the other night is awesome Irene's holding my hand really tight so last place last placement people look at Hollywood Boulevard this is the center of show business in the world the fuck it is it's a shithole I will give you more fucked up have you been to Italy you been to Rome no no never you want to see the most fucked up site in the world brother and this is sad you go to the Vatican the most opulent place on the planet you have no idea the money that is fucking dripping off every building in the Vatican and the Vatican and the Catholic Church as a institution but immediately before you set foot in the door the Vatican on the street there are the most disgusting disfigured nailed up beggars you will ever see arms missing fingers curled around eyes missing and shit on the fucking streets outside the Vatican door it makes me fucking sick Wow all right because you've got that there there is a Vatican you can touch it there is some nailed up disfigured gypsy woman who is 80 years old and has to sleep on a sturdy cobblestone Roman Street every night while the church is right fucking there Wow and they don't offer anything that I'll take them in they don't feed them how was disgusting that's so strange you would think that you have to just for show you couldn't even allow that right just for show you got a the main strip walk is only one Street you go to to go to the Vatican that main fucking via that main strip and they're there and they're just the most downtrodden repulsively disgusting beggars you will ever see and then you're at the doorsteps of the most opulent place in the world that's it does my hitting man so strange it does my fuckin hittin it's just so strange that they feel like they could let those people be out front it would be bad for business man you would think so right now apparently Berlusconi when he came in term it's like selling BMWs and just people park wrecked BMW dealership exactly the thing is that apparently someone told me that since I've been there Billis Coney has cleaned up all the beggars and the gypsies and moved them but I want to know even where he were wait a minute - we suddenly relocate my pages it was like in in Beijing the Olympic Games because I contacted the Olympics you know wait did you really yeah did all the boxing at the Olympic Games really Wow fucking 272 fights in ten days a while by myself are you a big just by yourself by myself really fucking it you can talk up a storm Ironman word being on Beijing they relocated 1 million people 1 million people 1 million we're relocated suddenly to build the IBC the international broadcast center for the media and the carpark well 1 million people lost their homes virtually overnight it's like they wake up one morning and they go you're out of here that's insane 1 mil how the fuck could be more the entire population of San Francisco that's usually overnight did you have an idea after going to the Olympic Games and spending three weeks in Beijing I came back and I told everyone if the fucking Chinese ever want to take over the world they will do it in the space of a fucking month the way they the amount of people they have and the organization they had and the manpower and the ability and the technology and having seen that in Japan as well that whole region Korea Japan China they will fucking take over the world easily in a month and we may as well just bend over take the fucking rice up the arse and go ok we are your slaves cuz seriously the Olympic Games was phenomenal it was incredible what is it about them that makes them so dangerous why is it their willingness to work hard yes it is their life for their for their job it is their pride self pride and national tour I do willingness to work extremely hard for very little money and just for self satisfaction and add to that the sheer number that numbers they have the manpower is extraordinary did you go to one of those yeah that is kind of just on our level that we can relate to you go to one of those k1 shows in Japan right and the amount of people they employ to set up the arena and set up the ring and the cameras it is insane people that I see set up jobs for Fox Sports back home that'll take two guys to set up a particular camera will they'll use ten guys to set up a camera and they'll they'll get it done in like a quarter of the time and the ring is taken apart not by let's say a group of 15 people like a show in Australia but you'll get 300 guys that as soon as a show ends they come in in helmets and little cars and that ring is taken down in ten minutes it's like it's like it's like vultures going in stripping the flesh do nothing that animal it's because they have so many people there that they work harder like what is it so many people they work hard but they work diligently and they work together it's like it's like a colony of ants all the ants are pulling together for the colony no one ant is just on his own working on his own agenda it's like we're all pulling together and therefore we form one giant colony of just take over wherever we want it's fucking amazing it's scary it's amazing well what they're able to do with getting people to work incredible hours and live in dorms and share them and that spookiest Japanese if you ever been inside a Tokyo apartment this room here would be considered a fucking mansion Berlin I once went in Nam a room in in Tokyo I take your apartment the bed was in where the kitchen was was in where the toilet was or the bathroom one big room what one big room well we have that here we have studios you know you can get a studio that's basically that's it's just a spot to live from the end of the bed to the front door was from here to where that knee is on you Wow that's how much room you had to move and the stove is there so you could literally turaga the worst hotel room ever worst hotel room ever and then shrink it like Rick Moranis honey i shrunk the hotel room down it's you can swing a cat in there it's crazy yeah I've seen some of the guys apartments when they show those clips for k1 and for dream and they used to do for pride where they show the guys apartment showed tiny man whether train and just is there's no room to do shoot you know a tiny ask gems to me right you see sucker Rob is Jim where he trains or Aoki's Jim there they're fucking tiny and this so little room over there that no one not many people have pets what that fuck is it about people where we want to stack everybody on top of each other like that what is that I have no idea is that good is there something good about long used to it cuz in Australia but it reads happening yeah I mean it happens in America it happens there I mean there's in Australia everybody still lives like you do here in a house with a backyard in suburbs and the whole high-rise apartment thing is slowly building in popularity but still Adi yeah not everywhere look nice yeah I'm telling you that West Side Highway Drive is gonna freak you the fuck out but to everyone stacks you kind of pets you know you can go and rent a pet in Tokyo just to pet one two so you can go rent a cat or a dog for an hour she can take to the park throw a fucking little fucking Park throw a little frisbee feed it take it for a walk then you return it to the shop you rent a dog you rent a cat for an hour that's ridiculous what if you don't you get attached to the dog don't you develop a relationship to the dog then you could maybe rent it for two hours but yeah you just rent a pet that's a strange world man they almost are like an alien race yeah it really is I mean that the writing is so different so completely unrelated you know if you look at like the writing of you know all the European countries except for you know except for hungry Russia yeah a couple of it they all share an Arabic alphabet your honor we use yeah yeah they all share it and well you could go to China and Korea and Japan it's like whoa you guys are alien yeah this is alien stuff this isn't even related to like this grew completely independent of the European style writing it's so different what a bit of will the place would be if everyone spoke one fucking language but it didn't I don't know man I think it's cool to watch all the different branches nah man I think it's all the violence arguing at war if people could actually reason with each other in one single language people would go to war over eye color people are retards all using this fucking blue eyed cocksuckers a church and dude people are dumb they find they want to be on teams no matter what you always wanna fine I trying to invent one universal language once was look something called s parens or something like that maybe someone can clarify and tweet it to us hmm it was like years ago they tried to invent a language called s per and or Esperanza it was meant to be one global language and it never took off obviously I don't remember that yeah yeah that would take a long-ass time we have to get it to the tribes in the African forest would take generations because you'd have to school generations three or four generations you get it down pattern you know Incan coltd among the masses yeah most most countries in the world you know a good percentage of the people are bilingual in America people you know just English or Spanish that's it yeah it's that so everyone's like English I mean there's of course there's immigrants in here that speak all kinds of languages but as far as like people learning things very few people I know how bad the immigration problem here was til I was driving to do a king of the cage show in New Mexico and the driver was telling me about it because we're driving along the border there from El Paso to luck Mescalero and he's putting it out and mayhem was in the van with me you know and the guys like this is where the Mexicans run the border this is where they're on the border I'm there myself why the fuck did you call if you're complaining why the fuck you call the state New Mexico seriously of course you get a fucking run if you're Old Mexico is shit and you want to accept but I'm going to New Mexico call it something else that doesn't matter what you call fix know there's a big rush over here there's money over here I appreciate ambition man I think it's kind of fucked up that there's spots in the world that's suck and you can't leave them you know I think it's kind of fucked up that you can't just travel from one place to another and just go wherever the fuck you want live where you want you know we can't let them in we can't let them in it's like really you know we carry brother I got held up in Toronto for five days recently because I'd visa problems because something wasn't done properly or might work later so I've got held up in Toronto and the way they treat you like you're a fucking like you're a criminal like you fucking got a rag on your head in your ID I can with a fucking bazooka yeah seriously cuz I got a beard like

douchebags they don't yeah what's our battery fuck you get out of here Canada recipe bland high but you know I think you know I just think as long as you have aware if you're aware of someone's record I think you should be able to go anywhere if you're not a murderer you know it scumbag you have real papers if Mexico had real papers you know in America you do a know you run numbers on people in America chances are in 2010 you're gonna know exactly what the fuck they've done we do about people in Australia man that's our big problem people sailing boats from East Timor in other places they rock up on boats and Oh Australia and they run off into the fucking jungle fuck yeah cuz I'm sure is awesome eight easels you got I appreciate that I mean it's like why shouldn't they be able to do that they're people I feel like if you may you have the the means the willpower to get somewhere that's better than where you're at we should all allow that you know what kind of fuckin hippie commie
