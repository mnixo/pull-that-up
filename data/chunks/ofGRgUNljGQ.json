oh hello freak bitches don't you know if you like reads ah here it is yeah this is just so interesting to approach the approach to combat and everyday life should be the same they pretty uh well that's that's a approach to combat and everyday life should be the same that's it that's intense yeah it was a little too intense I have a real interesting one on my Instagram and if you can pull it up is that the guy who touched a girl for the first time that video no but it is a lady with the holiday one but it's interesting you know yeah yeah who is that guy that touched a girl did you get permission to put them on your no no yes I probably take like one that you made me put up the Christmas one yeah this is that that one's pretty interesting the one with a girl the one that you should oh when you ho ho ho it up for xmas I mean it's interesting watch it okay what are you doing man shut this off what is wrong with you you and your wife but first of all you're both fucking hilarious cheese but yeah it's also specific yeah you have the you guys have the funniest silliest fucking show because you're both so specific Thanks yeah like the things that you just decide like you're wearing a shirt Tom's wearing a shirt it says just glass and on it I'm just glass now glass and is a term to like hunters use when they get up on a ridge and they look for things yeah so when I saw that I was like what that's weird like what did you maybe you bought that it's an on vania story you're in Alaska right for something like that yeah this would be a silly gimmicky shirt Tory but no this is a shirt like from your fucking podcast it is yeah it's no story okay so silly every week we get submitted hundreds of emails with links to videos like that right right I mean so many emails have you seen this everything and the end the Internet's this endless pool of stuff to pull from and then we have this our producer blue band I don't know if you know that that's our producers name blue band yeah because it used to be red band it was a yellow band for a while and now there's blue van so so blue band then we'll go through a lot of this stuff and edit down let's say like a five minute YouTube video and to like maybe six ten to fifteen second clips and so we're just always looking at stuff and it's you know the we like a range of things are engaging to us well we got this hunter his name is Fred Highclere I think yeah he's an avid bow hunter he bunt he um hunts with the traditional bow like a recurve bow that's right the one of the most preeminent recurve bow hunters yeah it's either a recurve bow or it might be a stick bow what is it yeah no it's it's a totally it's incredible but how that technology evolved yes so there's a lot of these guys like this guy you're talking about glass and guy he still uses like one of those primitive bows but he's just so good he can get away with it it says I mean this bio is incredible but in this video it starts with him he shoots a moose and it drops quick and he fucking comes close to coming in his pants right like he he makes a sound that you don't even you can't he goes like like like like he's king show it to us uh yeah but you are you allowed to play it online would you get pulled from anything not playing on you - no and and we also play I mean the audios is what's incredible but then he starts talking about Glasson and he's like we were just coming around meadow were just classic glad and then we were like let's class that's class and he gives keeps going glass glass glass glass and glass which is looking through binoculars which we discovered but then we played it so much people like I would post a picture of myself like I'm about to go on stage like are you Glasson and like or you know like if you talk to somebody like what you do today I got hung out and they're like glass and you look good so then it morph into meaning like just cello yeah and I don't know it just kind of picked up from there you guys have so many of these dolls I would have to ask you okay what's the deal with jeans yeah calling everybody jeans like when you guys were on that and yet explain it to me yeah you're the latest thing is with that first we had an electrician over at the house and whenever you're in the house you know you're calling your spouse I'd be like James do you know because that's what I call her then she walked down the stairs and he goes Jean would you like me to put the so heat and we just let it go we called her jeans but then we started going to Starbucks and ordering our drinks it's just like a stupid thing like that we told our listeners we do we do this regularly just to amuse ourselves which is we'll call them jeans and then say thank you mommy or I love you mommy at the end and no one ever the order happens so fast and it's so like programmed that they never catch never stay like what did you say so like when I when I pull up like welcome to Starbucks what can I get for you I'll be like hey jeans I want to get an iced coffee extra ice and what you want a double tall selected okay that'll be a 674 like thanks mommy and then I just pull up so we told them we did that people sent us videos of them doing it fucking hilarious like a guy like getting his own he was talking to a bill play place he's like hey mommy I don't understand what this bill means and the other guys like yeah so that first section like they don't even dress that you're calling someone mommy or jeans or saying thank you mommy or I love you mommy like okay have a good day like they just it speaks more to almost how pre-programmed customer service becomes you know yeah they're not even acknowledging that you're saying something ridiculous to them no no they're not it's hilarious yeah but also like what are you saying when someone says something like that to you you probably like you're so scrambled I think so yeah cuz it doesn't make any sense it just started off not making any sense but then it picked up and made a lot of sense it's like well clearly you can talk English right then it gets to the end it calls you mommy you're like whoa what happened one time we called the the Renaissance in Cincinnati the hotel the hotel because the year before before a few months before my son was born we were there for a wedding and Christina had like a 30-second fart so we she's very pregnant we came back and we talked about it and we decided it deserved its own names what's called the Cincinnati fart oh Jesus and we figured out what room number we were and we called the hotel and I go like I help you like I want a book I want to stay there but I want to commemorate the Cincinnati part and she goes I'm sorry what was that and I go I want to stay in this room I think

significant than a bull no no unless he only had a tag for a cow Oh depends on what why he shot a cow not a not a bull sometimes it depends on the unit depends on how many cows they have versus how many Bulls they have they might want people to kill cows they probably want a certain amount of cows to be killed a year they have weird who decides that yeah it's Fish and Game Department and they go do we have too many of heads entirely on where you are depends entirely on what part of the world you're in and then do you report it yep yeah you tag tag an animal we say if you shoot a moose that's a moose like this one I shot in British Columbia really yeah and you you have a tag and you take that you know you you have to pay for it and the certain amount of them some places they have what's called over the cow you [Music]
