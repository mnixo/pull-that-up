boom and we're like you're the first guy with a high top ever to wear these my I was wondering whether that the microphones were gonna sit well it's perfect yeah it's just writing this like a little crispy like a little rest area does that have this this having that much hair on the top of your head is there any benefit of that I think we get like elbowed or anything like that I think it helps out a ton like if someone if you have someone in their guard and they're trying to elbow the top of your head I would imagine yeah it's a little cushion on it so it I think it protects you and I kind of grew out the beard for that kind of the same reason but it doesn't get as burly as I kind of wanted to but it works I think in boxing they used to make people shave their beard yeah that's probably why in pana I you know that kid desi green I used to live with him he's a new UFC also mm-hmm and whenever I put that guy in the Gita cuz he has these big dreads and he would always get out of them because the dreads were like it gave his head and made his head appear like it was bigger so you wrap around it and you squeeze the cushion and it just compresses and then he just his head just slides out of it completely so it's like a cheat code slippery slippery dreadlocks I would also imagine though that having a bald head if you get sweaty would make it a little greasy ER like if you have stubble like on the top of your head that would provide like a little bit of friction yeah it makes sense I follow you I follow you on that I haven't had a bald head though so I don't I hard for me to know I like how your shirt even has a gold chain on it I was gonna wear the big-boy chain today but I'm not I don't know I don't know you only carry that out when you fight I usually do I try to keep it not like too ridiculous all the time you know try to be like only in character like make it for like it's like a special occasion type of thing there's even though I would consider this a special occasion but should I make it more of like an MMA thing oh there's something extra special about a t-shirt with gold train on it might be more special than an actual gold chain itself it works so it's the kinda silly yeah man how much does that thing weigh the real one um not very heavy nothing he's like 10 pounds now I wish it was 10 pounds I'd be 10 pounds of gold but uh it's not it was like an Easter Easter Bunny follow yes this heart what is that thing is massive right so is it hollow there like hollow tubes yeah you think they'll be so heavy you think I get a lot of people that come up to me and start grabbing my chain I'm like oh yes this is supposed to be a mystery you know today the human mind you're not supposed to know what this feels like you know I spent like $25,000 on the vs go rope chain but uh nah we remember when rampage used to wear the motorcycle chain yeah the links yeah real heavy links around his neck I was gonna actually go there was two routes I was gonna go the old-school route with my chain like the way my dad used to wear it and how we used to wear when we were kids or Rampage Jackson and be like the new generation of Rampage Jackson even I wasn't like slamming people but I would have to like somehow yeah that's rage still fighting crazy crazy you know still competitive after all these years I mean rampage was a fucking pioneer man yeah I remember his fight with Chuck Liddell his fights with Wanderlei Silva even the one he lost in our pride when he went through the ropes and then he came back and got Redemption I was like god that's got it feels so good because that's like the bad highlight he came back and got a highlight of his own so I think he lost to variability twice and yeah he got stopped twice in Pride and then flatlined Vandelay in the UFC yep I also think man it's speculation but I also think the Vandelay that he fought in the UFC was the one who got drug tested yep a hundred percent different Vandelay yeah I think there's a lot of that for a lot of people too a lot like don't like saying yeah I don't like saying because you know what it is I feel like I see these people and then it's like I know you might have heard me say this so it's like that little awkward tension and I don't like that man I know yeah yeah your good guy gets weird but it is a thing that if you look at it historically if you look at the sport in terms of like like when people look at Barry Bonds and when they look at Jose Canseco or they look at was the other dudes name the dude Mark McGwire yeah or Sammy Sosa everyone knows the to reduce heads that's just a part of the things so you go with their amazing baseball players incredible athletes also we're on the sauce yeah fact does that take away from it though that's the smile was that's it's hard to say right because everybody was on it yeah do you know there's a great documentary that's out right now by Billy Corbin he's the same guy who did he did cocaine Cowboys 1 & 2 he's got a new one out about a rod ok what is it can I can I check that out screwball screwball it's hilarious but it's about the fighter the the players that was about how of debt how owning a roy doctor some money who turned into this horrible revelation where they found out how how these baseball players were getting their juice from that guy okay his they owed somebody some money this guy and that guy didn't get paid so he went public with everything so it was like a small amount and they had a bunch of kids like these little kids play the doctor and play a rod so like in the movie the reenactments the reenactments were all done by children that's hysterical you gotta check that out it's hilarious it's a funny movie this is yeah they it's really fun that's a rod as a child it's fucking really funny man and what's it called a screwball screwball yeah well Billy Corbin is a genius he's a really really great director and he like I said he directed to my favorite cocaine documentaries of all time cocaine Cowboys 1 & 2 oh yeah he knows ok don't even look at screwball yeah oh I'm like I'm trying to catch up there's so much somewhat content on this it's hard do you fuck with stranger things I got to get into that too guys I just started black mirror I'm on season 3 and that just started like opening my eyes I'm like man technology he's like could be using such fucked up ways it's crazy Unabomber was right the Unabomber was correct yeah that show fucks me up more than any show because it's so close to possible yes especially episode 1 season 1 with the pig oh yeah that was the one eNOS was crocodile that one where there's the the car accident and they hide the body and then the lady ones up doing all these different things to cover up a crime not anything read people's memories you can get people's memories and watch them play oh rewatch I that when I saw yeah when I was freaky yeah with the one lady did terrible things yeah yeah I'm like oh okay you're gonna be gonna shit but I didn't even ruin it it's that good there is one though with the with the memory yes the guy in the girl from the girls cheating yeah yeah it's fucked up yeah it's fucked up that's how come in man that's all coming I've been talking about this on stage like how good is your memory you know because my memory is not that good like if I try to remember things that happened yesterday if I had I draw everything I saw yesterday it's not that good now even if you say your memory is good it's your recollection of actual things so you don't have a video memory but if you had a video memory wouldn't it like that's what that would be a first thing that we surrender if they could put a chip in silent remain listen wouldn't be amazing if you could pull every technique and and see it exactly as it should be done you could see it play out in front of your head you can see all of your memories all of them exactly so you'd have no like if your girlfriend says you told me you're gonna I didn't say that this is what I said I'll play it for you right now that that's gonna they're gonna that's how they're gonna get us yeah but it's kind of scary and they showed it the guy was able to freeze frame the the guy's memories with his wife yes and then it was like that's my that's my picture in the background and she was like oh it was only like a one-week thing that is like only like a one more thing that turned into like yesterday let's fucked up it was fucked up it's good though yeah I don't think I want that that would be I want it as if you speak I wanna know deal with we're gonna I don't think it's I don't think we have a choice I think it's coming I think it's inevitable little Rebell you're gonna have a great rebellion I'll be the leader magic like they just figure out I mean when you're thinking about people that have CTE and brain damage and car accidents football and fighting and all the different things what if they say listen listen we'd fix all that fix all that with this chip it just it rewires the whole brain you're fine and it provides you with that video memory so you can have your entire MMA career never worry about CTE you could just swing for the fences like right like Louis and max Holloway did yes down the middle yeah can swing no worries just bang yeah but then if you did that then what about like Parkinson's or anything like that would that still be a thing or I mean if that wasn't a thing to not be all for it but also oddly enough I think that part of what makes MMA so exciting is that there's crazy consequences are the reasons why when you see like Maz Vidal knocks out Ben Askren with that flying knee part of why I was so exciting like oh he's hurt bad yeah it's not that he's gonna be fine nothing's no damage from this whatsoever there's no that's real damage like he went out cold instantly and then he got punched in the face twice it's part of what it's terrible but it's part of what makes the sport so exciting is that you realize these guys are so brave to face these potential consequences you know makes it it makes it it's like an added element of danger that makes it exciting it's very true but it's man I feel so bad for him with that when I saw that because it kind of brought back memories for myself I was like ah I know exactly what that moment feels like I don't remember it but I know exactly what that moment feels like when you fought more eyes do you remember what happened up to that yeah and you just don't remember it landing I saw like right before lens and it was like you know in those movies when it goes it was at this very moment he fucked up and out like a light man and I didn't like come to and like I mean I woke up but I didn't come to like actually remember like shit I wasn't a fist fight and I lost like really bad like really quick when I got to a hospital that's when you realized it yeah I heard Ben say the same thing I was like this is not just me I guess it's just a really bad knock out him shooting forward and Maz Vidale jumping into him like a car crash man in monster dolls running full clip that's a 40-yard dash running full clip and perfect placement the knee I mean you don't get a cleaner knockout no and just the way he did it like he was showing the video of him practicing it and saying he had like three different scenarios of how that situation could have went that's like masterful thinking tactical like there's not a lot of people who are that's to reboot when it comes to the game and I think the way he broke that down was just super impressive and he kind of lulled him to sleep like his hands behind his back I loved every second of that because you weren't sure what was about to happen I was on the edge of my seat that was my main event fight and then he just comes out takes a side stuff like just drifts off to the right and then boom 40-yard dash and finding chaos it was just as much a main event for me too because it's so important for the welterweight division yeah whereas like John Jones versus Thiago Santos it was an interesting fight and turned out to be a great fight but it was an interesting fight because you're like okay how is John Jones gonna beat this guy and is this guy gonna be wild enough to catch John Jones but when you looked at it on paper John was a prohibitive favorite yeah when you looked at a screen versus moskvin all you're like man I don't know yeah when I looked at Holly and Amanda I'm like Holly's a great champion and she's a great fighter but Amanda's so goddamn good it's almost like she doesn't have anybody else left to fight it's not like Holly had made this incredible case for her being the one to challenge Amanda next it was just that Amanda's kind of cleaned out that bantamweight division yeah she fought one person she beat me and Anderson and I felt like she struggled with that fight the only way she I felt like she done really well when she was able to get Megan down to the ground but when she was in a clinch she ate a lot of knees this is Holly and and she tried to do the same thing the previous fight was cyborg and she ate a lot of knees in the clinch trying to slow cyborg down it just didn't work out in a favor so when that matchup was announced I was like Holly's gonna either stay on her bike the entire time and just try to point fight or it's just not gonna end up good and sure enough that's what happened yeah I thought she was gonna probably try to stay on her bike as well and throw kicks from the outside but I guess a man that had planned for it that's why she caught her with her leg up you know if you see the way she landed that round kick she caught her with her leg up like she was like like pressing with that side kick and then boom yeah that roundhouse kicked right across the top and Holly is such a good girl she's such a good person yeah I was almost too nice but then you feel bad for yeah but I know what you mean is she did I she didn't make a great case like you said for the title fight but there was really no one else for her to there's nobody well once she beat up Raquel Pennington the way she did and then when she goes up and destroys cyborg it's like who else is there I mean Raquel Pennington is like as tough as they come yeah and she she was battering her the way she wished she put away Ronda the way she put away Mischa she just smashes people it's scary I think it's it's her Siobhan Coe cyborg and then everybody else I think you're a hundred percent right I think that's an interesting fight she might just saw I don't know if she can make 125 but if she just I don't know she's a big girl yeah but if she decides or Shevchenko decides to step up one more time to 135 and tries to become champ champ and beat her I mean they had a really fucking close fight especially that second fight yeah if I was very very close I didn't know how to even really score for but uh yeah and Valentina made a case at the end that she thought that she had won but it was a very good fight as Shevchenko obviously when you see her knock out Jessica who used to be a top bantamweight contender herself she's one of the rare girls that like Amanda and like cyborg can flatline women with one shot the scary man is scary those those ladies hit hard yeah and her kicking technique is just exemplary you know I'm a Valentino it's just so good on her feet her kicking is so nasty man she's one of the cleanest spinning back kicks in the sport you don't even see it coming yeah the way she just I like the way she hops up and down it kind of reminds me of like a little Cooper you know my heart your brothers cuz she's like hopping and she moving sidestepping I cook boom boom spinning back-kick out of nowhere yeah it's like she's a weird combination of Muay Thai and karate yeah she's got traditional martial art techniques but like rock-solid muy Thai too it's the dancing I think yeah thanks to dancing you know that's Loma Chico's secret that's one of his secrets I think amazing boxing technique his dad made him dance like traditional I think Ukrainian dancing make make sure that's right I don't want to fuck that up it took some kind of traditional Russian dancing for like four years yeah now I heard that he's made him stop boxing for a bit so that he could focus on yeah dancing that's what he did for four years yeah that's uh crazy makes sense I guess the footwork and everything is gonna do that though if they said I'll Jemaine listen how old you now hold you know I'm thirty at the end of this week okay thirty-four is your prime this is what we're gonna do next four years you're just gonna dance the hunt for the title right now yeah that close yeah that close especially after Henry cejudo just beat Marlin more eyes like holy shit doors well where are we where are we yeah this is a hole we got a double champ situation here right yeah it's crazy crazy so Christ divisions wide open I love how much the pain weight division has heated up it's been such a crazy ride for myself and just being a part of this and being able to see like the wave and generations of different fighters coming in and out you know I you know I was talking about it like El Nino you know Gilbert Melendez is seeing like when he was on the top and now he's kind of like his fight last fight we're on Islands kind of like you could kind of see like the passing of the guard or maybe maybe he's just not a because I know he puffs fists are some type of PDO so so maybe that was something to do with it or maybe 35 I think or six yeah and Arnold Allen's 25 and fucking nasty young bull yeah and he's being trained by Feroz a hobby who I mean I don't think there's anybody better yeah in terms of trainers I think there's like just as good or in the neighborhood of good but he's the fucking man as far as I'm concerned yeah and there's a lot of just a lot of hot prospects she's coming out and you got the core East and hey gains even there I know Rivera lost two fights in a row now but he still has tough as they come he was beating Petey on until he got dropped that yep grounds one and two he won round three even having his nose busted up and everything po3 on though man he is a seasoned striker it's really interesting to see him with a guy like Jimmy who relies on his power and his the toughness and you know his bulldog tenacity to see him get in those two rounds so yon just set traps and look for openings then when he finally found them he just called her Aksum yeah I mean it's a really exciting division right now real exciting that might be my next fight though him for the belt I would hope I would think that would be the next fight and I kind of liked that matchup he actually tried to Punk me at the u.s. CPI Center last week it was kind of it was funny at the same time I was like dude I I'm not really understanding and then on my left side I got I'm getting worked on I got unica skaia whatever her name is she's on my left side and she's getting worked on and then I didn't know there were teammates so he comes in he's at the mirror he's doing like the thumb things like slashing his throw I start busting out laughing and I show him the bell and then I start slashing my throat I'm like yeah you know I'm gonna get the strat whatever so he comes in he comes in with this camera crew and it starts to go a little bit back and forth but I can't understand he doesn't really speak English right so I guess he says something and then she translate out of nowhere someone getting ganged up on right now and it she's like he says why you afraid to fight him in Moscow and I was like whoa what did I just come from but they I look back at him like no one's ever tell him no one's afraid to fight him and then after I thought about I was like wait motherfucker who's ranked higher you don't call the shots I call the shots I was like you're not doing away you're not Sean Shelby you fight where I say you're gonna fight or wherever Dana says we're gonna fight so don't don't stay here to try to like act like I'm everyone's afraid to fight him like what I don't want to go to Moscow to fight that's one he lives and I thinks he's from Siberia from what I know but I know he trains taiga muy Thai okay that's right so he trains in Thailand and he lives or he's from the coldest most dangerous part of the world great yeah I'm not looking to go there and fight there guy I'm like I mean if I have to I will is there a Moscow card scheduled there was talking's of it and I think November Oh upcoming yeah yeah oh wow cool experience but it's not not an ideal thing for me in terms of financial situation and getting out there paying the taxes I'm like dude this just I just rather be home not you know somewhere locked yeah like I don't care fuck where he fight I fight him in the fucking bathroom I would have fought him into PI Center if he was acting you know if he if he deserved it but it is what it is I'm like dude no one's afraid I'm a fighter I don't understand what fighters try to intimidate fighters and make it look like we fight in a cage right you know it's like dude but it does work the thing is like fucking with people's heads is real yeah this is true ladies true like the best example Josie all was one of the greatest fighters of all time yeah I really believed that he was out of his composure when he fought Conor and that's one of the reasons why charged after Connor and Connor cracked him with that straight left it's like Connor was in his head that he was working in the back room when he was like that's unreal unreal unreal I mean he planned it out he knew it was coming it's like Maz Badal practicing that flying knee against ass current it's really similar yeah it's like you know tendencies and you also know emotions and he just wanted to get at Connor so bad yeah I mean it Connor knew he was coming so you like give him some faint hop around throw some side kicks hopper yeah knows he's coming back and as he's coming catches on me perfect isn't coming in well again similar because they're both coming at each other yeah charging in and gay ah crazy car crash but I don't think I don't know if he really thinks he's gonna intimidate me I I don't know if that's what he thinks or what he's trying it it's a time-honored proven tactic yeah get inside someone's head they get angry and one of two things happens either they fuck you up more because now they're really personal you know like like Maz Vidal yeah or it bothers them and they lose some people lose genuinely lose their composure if they don't like a fighter yeah you know that we used to have I'd say that cowboy and Nate Diaz that was an insane fight and that was a thing that's last time he probably ever let himself get mad he's a learning experience you know he realized that like that shit talking fucked with his head and you know but there's some guys who do better when they should talk yeah I think I perform better when there's more in the line like when Pedro was talking shit to me I didn't really understand it I was like dude all I did was ask whatever happened with the results have you drugged us and that turned into oh fuck him he's a bitch if he said that and what happened to did he have a pop for something in 2015 when he was four in Nova Scotia was it it was that year there was like three or four guys from Black House I mean made that all pop for something and I can't remember all the names I know Kevin Casey was one of them Pedro was one of them and I think it was like two more other guy I think silver might have been one of them yeah and it was one more guy did you ever see Anderson's trainer no no Jackson dude he's not just jacked he's jacked and he's like 68 yeah he's uh he's old as the pyramids and get up like a brick shithouse this dude is fucking stacked I mean full six-pack giant pecs arms I can see Wallace fuck Jimmy we'll pull up a picture of them picture him doing a selfie I mean look at that guy come on come on son that dude is Jack m'f I'd do his abs look like a turtle shell look like a ninja turtle yeah like you'd roundhouse kick him there and he was he going nowhere for you that's like a dude in 300 it comes down your head with an axe dude that's serious yeah so that was a nurse's trainer that dude is most likely aware of some Mexican supplements probably yeah I mean come on man that guy's oh yeah apparently a very good trainer too so he was the strength conditioning guy for Anderson for a lot of black house guys giving him a lot of strength it gave him a lot of strength just are you getting straight here Mark Coleman and Ken Shamrock are gonna fight in some new granduncle boxing promotion I don't even see that announcement just today oh my lord you know I was like oh no how do we save this thing kitty Bravo sent it to me I just looked at I took a deep sigh like oh I don't like seeing stuff like that it it makes me sad it makes me wonder if I'm gonna be like that when I get older and I'm like I hope to god not hope when I walk away I just fucking walk away I hope so too but then again if they're in a situation where they need money and something comes up like this and they're willing to do it why do I give a fuck like why why is it a thing where I I'm cool with young guys doing in if they need money but I'm not cool with guys that are 50 doing if they need money like what is it I see your point I'm saying but it's like seeing the guy in their physical state and you're like dude you should not be doing this right so he's like you you're watching I don't know it's almost like I don't know it's hard this I don't really have an analogy for this right yeah I know exactly what you're saying no it's like you hope that they find a better life and they hit the finish line they're like thank you very much during the hall of fame and then they move on yeah that's what you hope I'm hoping that's what I do get the fuck out some people can do it you know my favorite example in all combat sports is Marvelous Marvin Hagler yeah Marvin Hagler when he lost Sugar Ray Leonard in a very disputed decision said that's it I'm done just walked away never came back a rematch with Sugar Ray Leonard would have been bananas he would have made so much money he was a middleweight champion yeah this is one fight he's like I'm done I'm gonna be a movie star in Italy Italy and there's a lot again he talks perfect now when you hear him talk he's got no brain damage or if he does you can't tell by the way he's talking he sounds fine yes probably I mean a lot of this stuff they say like sets in like later on in life so a mountain is like late 60 Arden s I hope to be him yeah I hope to be that guy you know yeah I tried to you know try to do a good job of bobbin and Weavin moving my head and slipping off the center line he just kicks - you keep guys on the outside you have a weird style man it's a closed mark yeah fuck oh did you start out from I mean I know you have a wrestling base - yeah what it just right what have you start out with was your first martial art I didn't have any we we you know the karate kung-fu like VHS tapes I shit you not I have a family of this I think there's 20 of us now okay my dad just had a newborn son I shit you not and he's 57 the guy is out of his fuckin burn but uh I just had you born so I haven't met him yet that's one and all the boys grew up we had these karate tapes VHS tapes and we would imitate the characters and we'll be like where the drunken master or where the white tiger white lion and we have to do their fight styles and we're like look here so we're still flexible and you know malleable we like don't break as easily so we just start beating the shit out of each other but we do like spinning back Cakes jumping off the couches and shit like that and I think that might have translate because that was like we did that for years but that was the most combat we did we didn't do any like rustling no nothing traditional at all before I ever got into martial arts I used to do that same thing I stood throw kicks with my friends I didn't know what I was doing but yeah you like watch a Bruce Lee movie and start throwing kicks or some Chuck Norris film or something like that yeah you learn how to do stuff by watch the big you'll also develop some terrible habits yeah you don't look like you developed any bad habits like if I had to guess I would say you have a traditional martial arts background and what the way you throw kicks like you throw kicks like a guy who started throwing kicks when you were really young yeah but they're right what's wrong right which ones would you say like holy shit your roundhouse kicks your front kicks you have great front kicks man you're really good at keeping guys off of you you have good movement you know like you know you got a style that's a unique style like so when when guys have to fight you they go this guy is gonna be kicking at me from the outside he moves a lot he Bob's and weaves it's hard to hit you got a lot going on with your style it's very tiring because we call them your last fight like the third round you were kind of slowing down a little bit I'm like imagine all the energy this guy's using yeah because you're always bobbing and weaving and moving and kicking and moving and kicking and moving and Moon dos is just you know bobbing towards you and and you're throwing traditional type shit bobbing his head to lift it like energy output like how much more energy you must have put out in that fight than he did yes concurrence of the amount of kicks you throw an amount of jumping back and forth and leaping in leaping out like yeah that's all like a sigh electrics it's a ton and the good thing is credit to like the training that we do you know we get I get to Gert the right work I got that guy in my Rob definitely who's a freaking psycho that guy does not get tired we call him the Machine for a reason guys he was finished sparring with me and I'm like I did my rounds championship work I'm done we get on the bike or hit the pads whatever it is or bane work just to get a lot of extra cardio push and he'll be in there and grab two three sometimes four more bodies to spar with and I'm like this guy this doesn't fucking stop he's out of this fucking brick this is no exaggeration this guy is out of his fucking bird but it's the reason why my cardio I'm like you want to get your cardio top-notch get yourself a fucking my Rob he's a manager he's a good dude he's a good dude sometimes too much of a good dealing like morale I can't carry I could carry my own wallet you know it's like he gets a point like that like dude thank you but I appreciate it but you know but um yeah it's a very tiring style but we do a lot of work and I do my own stress the conditioning just from having a background in physical education in SUNY Cortland so do your own yeah so I've been doing it since I was amateur like writing my own thing my own program because they told us how to like work on like isometric squeezes and different type of like explosive muscle endurance workouts and stuff like static holes like holding on a pull-up bar and going out to punches so I I put together a pretty decent program it's been working I can't complain so when you do it how do you design it uses the designer for the entire camp like do you set it out every day like where you want to be and do you adjust it depending on how you feel and injuries like how do you schedule that exactly like that so in when I'm further out from camp or not in camp at all I'll do more lifting and I'll lift heavy and I don't really do like benching no more that I think that shit's like stupid for for fighters it doesn't make a whole lot of sense I'm not gonna benchpress somebody off of my back you know you know I'm whatever but I'll do that and I'll just a training camp and just the the the programs when I get close to the fight and I don't mind like sharing this because I think guys they make it more complicated and what it should be like I sometimes I see all this crazy shit I'm like I just don't understand the whole necessity behind needing that but I know I'm no physical strength conditioning doctorate or anything like that but from what I've seen that works for me I just try to mimic everything that I feel in the fight and implement it into a workout and I figure out which ways I could do that whether it's bands push-ups box jumps wall sits I do wall sits get ups with two plates so I'm sitting down on my butt and I'll do like a technical stand-up and I use the wall and I push up so it's a lot of leg works a lot of cool work and two plates with two plates it's fucked up it's man sometimes I like I come there and I can do about myself in the morning I go to LA man made by myself 9:00 a.m. and I'm like why am I putting myself through this like it could be so much easier and more simple like just to do all the other stuff like the plyometric stuff and which is a little not as much impact on the body but this is what I enjoy I think this was what translates to the fight because this what I feel and I feel when I do this I noticed a drastic difference from one sparring session to the next but to answer your question like I adjust it I'll do it by my legs on fire and I feel like they really beat up from sparring I'll do more upper body and then if my feeling my upper body is more beat up I'll switch it off to the lower body and if I feel like I'm fresh like I had a good week maybe I didn't spot on a Saturday and I'm coming in fresh on a Monday I'll hit it hard and do full body everything and I'll give myself five rounds of pushing it but I'll separate it in two rounds simulate the fight we round so I do every single minute but I'll do about 40 40 depending on how far I am from the fight if I'm like just started trading care I don't kill myself mmm I want to ease my way into it so I'll start like anywhere from like 30 35 seconds to like 50 seconds and that 10-second window or that other 30 second window is my time to recover and get to the next station and I'll just wrap whatever I'm doing burning out burning out I'll do the Met Ball between my legs I'll do the foam roller in my arms and I'll squeeze it I'll simulate the rear neck the choke and I do it for two minute intervals and I'm just squeezing the piss out of it and obviously you can't do it but you do it to failure and your arm guitar you switch you go to the other side and you switch your legs you figure for it you scissor the legs so you give yourselves different type of stimulation to your body to kind of account for everything that you may possibly be in for the fight and you never know it's like something this fight I did a lot of grappling but I also did a lot of punching because I thought to myself there might be a chance I might be a possibility that do not get paged to the ground and I almost happy I didn't force the takedowns because that would have fatigued me even more I was like if it comes it comes but we did I did a lot of output just burning out their arms getting that muscle endurance kind of using that Floyd Mayweather structure of a workout just getting the heavy back count like high punch count in a 5 minute round and I'll do that for a couple of rounds and we did a couple times a week and I think you implement that with the lateral footwork that we do in a cage and just staying on your bike and how many people were like like stalk you and like just not going crazy but control like that don't punches like hooks or they throwing a one-two and you got to like bounce side to side and get out the way so it's a lot of like at least I think it's practical for what you're gonna actually see when you get in a fight and I think sure enough a lot of the things we did pretty much happen in a fight there's a thing toes long squeezes is a great idea I was insane is that something that comes up often in a fight where you maybe got a guy on an arm triangle or something like that and it's that close to whether you get it or he escapes it's like much squeeze how long can you keep it down you know when you're caught in something yeah and it's like you're almost got tapping the guy let's go long squeezes like my friend Scott Epstein Einstein he teaches at a 10th planet West LA he's always been a big fan of slow slow workouts like he'll do chin-ups like this like super slow I think that's what they call it super slow and he'll do chin-ups like he's doing a chin up it might take him two minutes to do a fucking chin up yeah for the entire time so like when you grapple with someone's like you trying to squeeze it a follow them in you slow that long term squeeze endurance like quicksand yeah it makes sense yes if everything is fast and exploding but then you get a rear-naked and you have to like continue to compress or a guillotine we continue to squeeze it's different it's such a different such a different feel is kind of remind not kind of reminds me it is exactly am i Bryan caraway fight although I did do three workouts on the day of that fight before the fight even mat told me in the back room he's like Al Jolson for the fight I was like nah man I'm good and I'm just going crazy I was like in my head I'm like I did all the work but I I just wanted to be so prepared so I knew was the biggest fight of my life I knew if I beat him and finished him I was probably gonna get a title shot for no undefeated coming off three finishes and I knew if I finished him I'm more likely gonna get and they lined me up too because the next week I went to Fox and I was supposed to talk about the Dominick Cruz fight versus your I favor fight which I went but the fight didn't go my way so it kind of had like a bittersweet taste to it so do you think it had anything to do with the extra rounds you put in or the extra work Oh a hundred percent I think if I had just done my one morning shake out 15 20 minutes was what I do now I just get the food moving through my system so that my body can get like just feel like it's more alive again like it does during training camp I think I think that fight easily done in first round or even a second cuz he survived the first but I think the second round I think I get him out of it but it's just experience you know learning and becoming more mature about the game and trusting your training do you think that has anything to do with you training yourself do you think that you if you have a legit strength the conditioning coach monitoring your heart rate are you monitoring your heart rate no stuff no I just started doing stuff with the P I Center and I try to because I saw that guy Brandon Davies he's 45 a foot to beat and he's a beast 135 now which is insane to me so I don't know how he makes it that's what I said so I'm like dude if I'm gonna have to be finding these giant guys I need to figure something out and like they they explained how he was able to cut the weight like he was running like ten miles or something today I think which was insane to me I know he's saying like some of it was like walking but it's all about your heart rate your resting heart rate where you burned the most fat and calories or whatever you want to call it he's so big when I was standing next to him I couldn't believe he makes 135 it's insane I I was actually pretty upset I was like fuck this guy go back up to your weight class right there and didn't he say to me wait I think I asked him what he weighed in the cage I think he said somewhere around 160 yeah I don't get that big what does he say it's bananas man he's so gigantic and he's what are you like 6 1 or something like that yeah I don't want to fight a guy that's 6 1 I got it I got the unfair advantage right now you take ass back out to 45 there's a there's a device that I've been using called a whoop and it measures your heart rate variability it measures your heart rate and measure your sleep cycle you wear it while you're sleeping and if they think they say that that's one of the things that really determines whether or not you can push hard is monitoring your heart in a daily basis so that you see what it's like when you wake up I'll save you wake up and your resting heart rate it's like 40 beats per minute or something like that if one day it's 50 you need to chill yeah that that Davis may be active recovery maybe just do some light drills nothing crazy but you can't push it that day because you're already 10 so you might be getting sick or you might be you might be worn out and you need to give yourself enough recovery I've gotten sick a lot in my last three training camps yeah which is something I've never like experienced or dealt with before tonsillitis twice I'm like this unreal I've never had to do anything like that before in my life that has something to do with it man but if you just had monitor your heart rate and make sure that when you're waking up in the morning it's not too high yeah sometimes you just say look you're a fucking profession no fighter man yeah you're tough there's just no you have to so assume that maybe sometimes you're too tough for your own good yes fighters are so fucking tough they not complain about shit they're like time to go to work I'm not a pussy I feel like I want to work I'm going to work that's my mindset yeah well I even talked to Tony Ricci he does something to strengthen conditioning with like Caitlin Chu kick in and some of the other fighters Okazaki and the other guys at the gym and I always pick his brain like whenever I have questions because I said I'm not this is not my field my expertise I just been using the same program just changing it up and I still workouts from other people not ask some questions and ask them so for some things that could tweak with a my training session but of late I've been I've been doing better with taking more days off like two days back-to-back there's one time I even took three days off and I was like so nervous like you get in your own head like dude you're taking off way too much time and sometimes Ray has a way of like breaking my balls and you go like this is a big fight I don't know how Joe you're gonna take another day off I'm like a god don't do it though don't do that to me because then I feel ice I know he's just playing but sometimes I feel like it's hard to know if he's playing that I think you're being serious so so old-school he really is him and Matt Serra ray Longo Matt's hair in the corner of the most entertaining corner of all time they're the best reality show just them in the corner give them fighters instructions yeah they're amazing I'm hoping I'm hoping they could get some that would be sick if they ever got a reality show something with like the team I think that'll be fun got a bunch of characters oh I'm sure yeah I mean every fight camp does right I mean you have an interesting person to want to do that for a living yeah sometimes I would just listen to the eyeless like listening to the feedback so I can hear them screaming in the corner and you can just hear Matt going off like there in the corner together I always say I always tell the guy in the booth go to Sara and long go go go I want to hear them do that last one was great the ESPN guys they posted like a little clip of them corner when Matt comes in and Ray comes in he's like fuck yeah yeah I got pumped up and they tweeted something like get yourself a corner like like a Madden Madden ray best that was the know they're amazing people they're just they're just great guys too yeah there's so many great corners now it's really interesting to see this sport evolve and that's why when you get a bad corner it stands out like a sore thumb when someone gets bad advice they don't get good technical advice or they don't get honest advice in their corner it's like wow and all the other fighters get the chance to see that like yes your advertisement right like when you're like ferrata hobbies like probably my all-time favorites he's really abuse when you hear him in the corner between rounds in many ways it's an advertisement to go train at his gym if you're a top fighter because you hear him talk he's so technical in his description he's so aware of what should happen and when it should happen that he just knows what to do and when to do and it's like that's excellent advice yeah Jamie shut your mic off very fucking rapper you know your mics gotta be on is that loud was that made out of paper chips the rappers made out of potato chips yeah it's like a corner is in many ways it's the advertisement for the gym yes when you hear you're winning you're winning you're definitely winning just go out now box I'm like it's not winning like we're in the corner like that is not good advice it's not and you my thing is you got to give some type of instructional feedback something to correct or something to do better or encourage them to keep doing the same things that they're doing or something something where there's instruction not like get up you all really you think I need to get up I think I know I need to get up but like how the hell do I get up with the weirdest shit was Diego Sanchez oh that census is his last fight I don't know who we trained with he left Jackson Winkle Winkle John I don't know if he had training partners I don't know what he did I he had the one guy in his corners tell him be like Tyson go out there and be like oh fucking wait he's given a weird advice Diego was getting michael Chiesa was just blowing on him yeah his flowing and every time Diego was able to capitalize on a position like a slip-up or an window of opportunity to get on top he just fucked it up and then he had just got right back up creative scrambling and he was right back in a dominant once again I was like yeah this is not gonna end well I thought who's gonna get the finish but the way you saw like Diego Sanchez manhandled McKeague all crazy then the way you see michael Chiesa manhandled Diego Sanchez he levels Wow levels levels in size chiesa isn't talking about a guy who cut too much weight it is incredible that that dude ever made 155 pounds he's so large that is a big man so big and when you put your hand on him like I'm interviewing it's like a fucking piece of wood man yeah that's some grappling constrictor strength you know yeah he's a big dude man I saw him before the fight in the PSN's outside to it and I told him saying things like I don't know I really do not know how the fuck you ever made 155 it's like probably counterproductive for you to even go down there yeah you just got such a big frame you I think he would Excel a 70 I think so too but what's interesting is like he's done way better at 70 than Kevin Lee has and Kevin Lee beat him at 55 yeah so it's it's crazy how like you got to go up and wait but you also got to do it the right way yeah I think he did it the right way when he's at 170 he's super healthy yeah strong dude man is so famous fit like flows like the way he was flowing with Diego he just he didn't like tighten up he was in total control he would take chances he would roll in the crucifix positions he would lose it and get a hold of him again again yeah come down I was like he was like a black belt rollin with a blue belt that's what it was like I was like wow this is crazy - white or a papal belt easy to watch it's different man it's really levels to the game and it's also sighs sighs takeaways 169 like the day before the fight wasn't didn't have to cut any weight at all but as chaos are probably in the 190s you look huge I I wonder what makes him want to go down to 55 then investigate not go down to 55 what is this Jamie this is voodoo coach oh no one else this dude has no experience as an MMA coach by the way so this is the dude that's telling them to be like Tyson he's being like water right now slip the slip bro well touch but touch but do such a strange guy man he might believe that this dude has mad magic powers cuz he was talking about but I think a big part Diego success is his belief system right Diego just believes things dude this guy's amazing what technique oh come on son show me that bro so good imagine looking at this guy and go listen fuck Longo and Sarah that would be that would actually be a good like skit like yeah I'm going out to Train like just had the whole thing leading up to it and then let him know like I was just fucking around you know well I think that's what Anderson Silva did when you brought in Steven Seagal complete joke I'm gonna people were buying it well the Gaul was selling it he was selling it you know I was like that's a technique that I taught Anderson Oh bro front kick everybody knows that one that's Jay one white belt class oh man that I can't believe people bought it for so long it's almost like the Ronda Rousey - yes look at this ooh karate change the head son imagine these dudes standing there while he practices all this shit there's George George they all had to do it with a straight face oh yeah she's like the ultimate trol look Anderson's practicing it is acting so good this is like a you know what this is like this is like like a break diverse circus clown given Dave Chappelle comedy technique there's some dude who's like a it's really what it's like it's like Dave Chappelle getting comedy technique from a clown the that reminds me of the Napoleon Dynamite Wayne he's like would you want to get kicked by me in these pants break the wrist walk away yeah but the thing is Seagal was a legit Aikido specialist like if it was just Aikido like that's what people just because a guy seems kind of silly you forget like he had a real legit history it with a key no he was the first American to ever ever teach at a dojo in Japan speaks fluent Japanese and he's a legitimate Aikido master like 100% absolutely JIT Amanda Kido Master the thing is Aikido is just not something that translates perfectly to to MMA what is this Seagal best Aikido with Russian national Aikido team yeah bro I'm not bullshitting man his Aikido is 100% legitimate well you see I would have I would like almost discredit everything just based on that one parity thing you know a joke that should show of a joke yeah but I mean break the wrist walk away but this is all nonsense someone's gonna give you their armor but if they did he would fuck you up better than this because this is Seagal as an older man who's overweight go to Steven Seagal when he was really young there's black and white footage of him teaching at a dojo in Japan there it is he is a hundred percent legit and kiito's not the best martial art for self-defence it's just not but it has its applications and in its applications he's a master at it much like jiu-jitsu has it's applications but it's not great for kickboxing right yeah Taekwondo has its applications but it doesn't work if you kick the legs and punch the face yeah but if you learn how to do it those techniques can apply if you know all the other stuff well if you know all the other stuff this motherfucker has some real shit it's just whether or not you would have to be so good at all the other stuff that you could utilize this I know obviously he's showing in this tech thing he's showing knife defense and stuff like that but this is all 100% legit technique he's good man I mean not good not good he's outstanding his Aikido is outstanding the real question is how effective is Aikido yeah I'm still like I can't get past the the joke of the front kick and it's hard to get past that fart what I didn't know this I don't know it's hard to get past someone who doesn't have an objective understanding of how people view them yeah like I just me and George CPR George CPR wanted to learn how to throw a turning sidekick for me you're an animal at that by the way I felt embarrassed teaching him though because I'm just a comedian yeah and I'm a you know I'm a commentator but I was like I know this sounds crazy that I really know how to do it and then when I did it he was like holy shit I was like yeah this is what I used to do so but but me showing him that I mean I'm under no illusion that I could kick George st. Pierre's as he would fuck me up every day of the week but I was like I have this one thing that I can show you that I bet you can't do the way I can do it and I can show you how to do it but I'm not like you know like what Seagal is doing like sir that's a front kick man front kick you know and even a spinning back kick you can teach someone it but having them having the confidence to confidence to execute that to choose to do that like you're in the situation the guys come forth you choose to spin you got to be so rock solid with your understanding of that technique you're not gonna get that without years and years and years and years and years of drilling it that could be a death sentence in a in a live combat fistfight yeah so even like when I throw some times I'm like man I throw a lot of shit man like I do like the tornado kick see shit no yeah and uh and I do like did I did one time to page on this fight where he came at me and I stepped back and I did like a hopping spinning back-kick like the one Uriah Hall hit Gegard Mousasi went oh yeah I did that but it hit him like right on the belt not exactly where I wanted to hit to land and a pitcher my foot slides now it looks like I kicked him in the balls but it was like right above like the belt line I say ah man if I just got a little bit more to decide not him in the heel i would have probably dropped do you practice that like in front of the bag oh yeah but then I will have someone holding the shield mm-hmm and can I just go for like 20 minutes yeah I just have it like control like I'm like yo I want to have like a stationary target but also somewhat moving so is more practical because no one's just gonna stand in front of like hey just spinning back-kick me to the ribs all the way I learned how to do it was swinging a bag I would swing a bag then the bag was coming close to me I would jump up there and spin and it's not gonna do it that way the only fight that I have from Taekwondo at all was me winning by knockout with a jump spinning back it really is on YouTube yeah I was like 19 Jamie could probably find it but that technique if you do it right if you do it right it's fucking devastating but you open yourself up whenever you turn and you jump in especially so I'm doing an attack on know where you can't punch to the face it's it's less risky you can't take to the legs you can get away with it more you can't punch to the face be good kick to face kick to the face okay which is ridiculous what do you oh here this is me when I'm 19 oh that's you yeah tells me but it's like the same thing coming forward and I caught him as he's coming forward but that that technique in MMA mean if you got like Valentina does it better than anybody she does it you don't even see it coming Valentina Shevchenko yes Lord that guy if you hit somebody with that it's like getting hit by a car yeah you know that mean that's what I was telling George I was like if you do it right your weight is going towards it the problem with the way most people do it they're hitting it and bouncing off of it you're not even like going all the way through it you're not following through they're going bang like that they're hitting ain't going back I'm saying go boom through it your weight should be going through it and it seems awkward but once you develop the technique and do it properly it's not awkward it's the best way to do and you get so much weight going forward that's another problem I have and I was talking about this earlier today with some of the guys like I normally try to like rewatch all my fights and then take like a notebook or my phone and jot down notes of things I could do better or things that I think I fucked up or I want to clean up that type of stuff and one of the things I'm noticing I mean I've noticed for a while but now I think that's gonna be like the next evolution of my game is sitting down on my punches and my strikes more so that it has more of my body weight behind it because I punch a lot in transition and it's cool it's fancy it's hard to hit I'm super elusive that way but again like we were talking about a minute it's a lot of the work rate it's just high you gotta be constantly moving but it's fun to watch do you think you're gonna stick with doing all your starting conditioning yourself or do you think you will move to like a professional like strength and conditioning group I mean as you move into five rounders - yeah right well I train for five round fights when I was doing this - but I mean obviously the level of competition wasn't the same ROM that was on the regional circuit before I came up and I mean I had success in training when I was sparring with five different bodies in five different individual rounds you know and I and I did pretty good in terms of my cardio but I was also a young bull back in now cool old I still think I'm a young bull but it's a difference when you're 21 22 compared to 29 even though you know I think I'm right now in my prime years I think also you're aware of like all the damage you're doing to your body all this yeah where you 21 you barely aware of it I just you just go nuts yeah your brains I'm fully formed just throwing kicks and punches and going crazy yeah but I I mean maybe I mean that told you reach a guy at the gym he's pretty he's pretty good it's just I feel bad taking up his time because I he helps out so much and volunteers so much of his time I feel bad cuz I it's not like I'm I'm not he doesn't he doesn't ask for money so it's like I feel bad if I'm not paying for your service I don't like doesn't ask for money nah hate oh not from the from the fighters you know money he likes just seen like the local guys do well and he likes helping out that's amazing yeah he's a professor I forgot the school he's a professor at but um really really smart dude I know he goes down to the PI Center from time to time to like I think share some knowledge and learn some stuff from those guys as well so maybe maybe I'll go that route it would be nice if I was able to train at the P AI Center you have that entire staff on hand like oh god those guys that's such a thought about doing a camp there I mean if you did what do you think Longo and Sarah would be interested in do another thing all right they can they got family they got the kids too got their jams yeah I always tell them like yo can we like move to like somewhere warmer like a Florida or something no no state tax you know bring the whole team bring the whole team bring the whole family get a bigger house they don't know it's little shacks those Long Island dudes man they got roots I know that's that's what it is varies like he's got everything here you know they both do they're so used to that community too it's like that's their family their friends everybody's there all the guys would come to the gym it's like yeah I get it I get it but man if you're a professional it seems like every little edge that you can get can mean a little bit of something and that performance Institute is a real edge yeah that place is amazing well I look at it like I got my striking from Ray I got my my jiu-jitsu format and all the other guys Jason around those guys and the hens okay Jim whenever I go to hens I was in the city and then I had the wrestling with my own background and then you know I teach the rest of classes at the gym and then I go down to Hofstra sometimes and I borrow some of those guys some of the I mean they're not like the Penn State's but they're still solid rustlers and all they give me pretty damn good work compared to what a lot of the rustling looks like in MMA now right so I'm getting solid work there I think the main part is my nutrition and I really don't sleep I have a I sleep I'm so fucked up I really don't sleep I mean housing the CBD helps me the most but everything else unless I'm like hammered and I just pass the fuck out then I'm like yeah I'm like fucked up the next day you know that sounds like counterproductive totally counterproductive yeah have you heard of that chill pad no this is something I haven't tried but mark Sisson is who's a he's the guy from he wrote that book the primal primal blueprint and he's a nutrition expert and he's a former endurance athlete but he's a giant believer of this thing where you put it as like a mattress pad and it chills your body to a certain temperature you could set it for whatever temperature makes you most comfortable but apparently he said it is a game changer in terms of your ability to sleep through the night like I woke up in the middle of the night lesson I must have been having a crazy dream I was sweating like a pig and I woke up and I'm drenched with sweat I'm like fuck why am i so sweaty like what the fuck's wrong with my brain but with this apparently when you keep you at a chilled temperature you just snooze he said he sleeps hard what do you I got that bad you did I mean it's coming out of chill pack so I don't have it yet but it's will be here by the time we get back into another show have a review for you works amazing yeah so you order like one full bed though it's not just a pad like literally there's a tube that got like an air conditioner tube goes into the mattress whoa and it's connected to an app and it can regulate your body like us what is it called this one is called like eight sleep I believe or sleeping the same thing same thing so this is the actual mattress itself so how much is that thing not it's I looked at the prices I was surprised it was not as expensive as I would think it would be especially compared to like I heard has passed a she bought one of those like Sleep Number but yeah she's 40 is fuck oh my god oh my god it starts at 2,000 bucks I guess which like probably goes up depending on size they give it to you for free I do have a promotional offer oh I believe shit Jamie working in the promotional game I don't have a coat or anything you have anyone I don't have a bed why I have a test I have a pull-out couch what do I have a very unique way of thinking was it your a top bantamweight contender in the fucking UFC it's fucked how do you so if you sleeping on a pullout bed yeah what I'll Jemaine that's outrageous you need to be able to sleep no wonder why you have a problem sleeping well I I feel like I still always had the problem I got I think I might have sleep apnea i smite my girlfriend Rebecca she's she's had me she's recording me like oh my god I was like yeah baby's got to deal with it you just gotta deal with it I bet you have it dudes with big necks get it I have it yeah thing that I put a mouthpiece in that I got from this guy how's your Kuro pian it pushes my tongue down no the mouthpiece is like sits on your bottom and it's got like a tongue like someone left like touching yeah your tongue pushing down on it and it keeps my tongue from slapping throat over my ear hole okay so how how much I want to excite I mean I got it I just got one for my dentist that I'm working with and uh he has the one that pulls your bottle and drill for like these bands cuz it helping you it's been helping but um it's just my jaw was just really tight in the morning so I'm like good then you gotta wait for like like half an hour for it to kind of reset and adjust back but man being able to sleep I feel like I could be so much more efficient with my day cuz I always hit that midday crash which I'm not sure if that's normal but I wake up I have the most energy because like I'm just taking a bunch of power naps mmm cuz I wake up so many times in the middle of the night with this a company that I know that sells them that you could just buy and it's like a boil and bite mouthpiece ton of thing and it has a bar that keeps your tongue from sliding back that's what you use no this is a different one there's a couple different why there's a couple different versions here no no which one you wanna I never see different door these are different there's one that I'll pull it up real quick this one goes around your tongue looks like a nice a fire a thriller that looks really weird yeah it was like a octopus not octopus what's those things jellyfish that's weird I don't think you're saying that like you bite down on that no there's one that's different hold on a second I'll find it here tomorrow yeah this one is the one I guys mold it to my teeth and in the bottom jaw just gets pulled forward so when I did relax my tongue is not like fault like it's not covering my my airway it's a really conscious mission with guys who are like football players and power lifters and wrestlers you develop out here this Jamie it's a long second it's called z YP a much I've heard that before the z YT p zu z YP bah is it 2 Peter 1 P 1 2 P P 2 pz z YP b HC that's it so you see that thing there that has that van that band sort of lays on your tongue and it keeps your tongue from sliding back and then you breathe out of the top and bottom just like an over-under mouthpiece i'll try like a vision this right now it's just keeping your tongue from sliding back that's that's how it helps you know there's a band at the bottom the band the back yeah that's what it is I remember I went to a dentist and H I told me like yeah we could get you a mouthpiece for like 5 grands like it some guy in the city and my friend my friend is one who connected me with him is like yeah this guy's gonna do right by you as a guy told me 5 grands like dude get the fuck out of here 5 grand for a mouth yeah that's so crazy and then he made me to mouth guards and they were both shit anyway he was like 18 mouth guards I don't want to bash his clearly not bash this guy but well shout out to the mouthpiece guy he made mine guys awesome yeah he's got a Instagram page that make you we don't shark he makes it what's Shaq snoring sounds like that's like a reality show they've been real all asleep in the room you wait for Shaq to sleep and then you gotta go in the room and fall asleep like think about how long would it take you for if it was like a game show like if Shaq is alko [Music] just away you got a lane next to him and it's like a timer ready go possibly fall asleep I'm tired I'm not though and he's 800 pounds he's 17,000 feet tall he's like next yeah this is not happening it's not that would be a hilarious like Fear Factor type show try and fall asleep next to Shaq could end up in a hotel room next to him and play that game on accident chandeliers clinking yeah yeah a giant dudes like him he must have a crazy snore under the giant probably oh yeah I mean Yao Ming that stuff it takes away so much from your recovery yes you're snoring you're not getting the proper oxygen in you know this doctor Kuro peon that I go to he puts this thing in your mouth and he has you breathe in and out it actually literally measures the output of your breath like how much comes in and comes out and he devised this thing to hold your tongue in place to open up your airway almost like a resting vo2max kind of thing yeah similarly Z yeah and some guys wind up getting up I know a couple guys have got an operation when they open up your throat hold better and they remove your tonsils and they remove your adenoids and it opens up the area really yeah they literally get it their fucking neck operated on they cut some of the meat out so that you have more more air I wonder how does that work in terms of being an athlete like would that be you definitely wouldn't be able to get choked for a long time it's like oh fuck me up for a long time imagine someone getting you in a guillotine after you've had your tonsils and adenoids and all that show you'd be months months afterward we'd be able to really train hard I would imagine yeah maybe I'll heal up not gonna do that maybe I won't go there house but if it works but the thing is like doesn't your tonsils don't they play a part in your immune system I don't know I mean they're they're just hanging out they're not like in appendix right they're there for a reason it's not like a leftover vestige of a different time then people get it removed too yes what Jamie it helps by isn't part of the body's immune system location at the back the throat stop germs from entering the body through the mouth or nose mmm and they contain blood wipe a lot of lot of white blood cells mm-hmm need those yeah so maybe just get a mouthpiece yeah well I got this guy this guy Andrew he's making these new dental mouthpieces um it's like it's called dental impact so I'm supposed to help you for like MMA fighters supposed to have like a little extra cushion for you can you know that you ever have you ever try the double padded mouthpiece mm-hmm and it had like that little slit and you're supposed to be expected to breathe through that right but once you open your jaw the mouthpiece falls out so this one is supposed to have like a little bit of a layer like a gel where you bite into it and it helps like almost like pull the gel for so that gives you like a little bit more room for impact so you could bike down and I think it's gonna be just be better for like combat I haven't tried it yet he's supposed to send me one so I could try it out like and give some feedback and see how it all works he used to be a company called shock doctor yes still around um I know they do like cups and shit like that I think there was like a shock dr. mouthpiece that had the same the same idea behind it but I was super skeptical oh there it is yeah shock doctor but I think there's real science to that look at that fucking thing what is that shit like lip guard the mandible man he's for like football players use use that hand shield a lip guard oh so you don't get your mouth your lips busted but mm-hmm so there's a what's that air flow once grown up a little bit there the white one what does that say max air flow football mouthguard huh that looks stupid gets that lets air through the middle like the hole yeah but that's fine with football that's not fine for a five-minute round that looks small you don't mean like it doesn't the hole you have to like go all the way well the part you bite on right right right it's not a far enough back yeah dig into it like what are you biting on just the top part with your first few teeth I think they used to have these kind of things and there was making some claims maybe not shock doctor but maybe another company I think was another company that was making a claim that it would allow you to take shots better reduce concussion I think it has something to do with that those two like nerves on top of the jaw the mandible bone like I guess I looked like clips to nerve and that's what shuts the lights off in the brain what is that one that says Fang double braces scroll back up that's four brace like people have braces oh I was wondering because my daughter had braces and she was going to jiu-jitsu she get choked and her mouth would get shut off as a bunch of holes in it not just one big one oh you're not a lot of Russell's without if you have braces in wrestling in high school you're not allowed to compete unless you have a mouthpiece it's like a new rule that should they should this shouldn't be a lot of compete without mouthpieces anyway you don't to fuck up your lips yeah even now when I Russell and I bite down when I'm shooting sometimes and I get my jaw like smash against my teeth I like so much yeah chief that way yeah it's not good now I wear melfi's always I always wear a cup too and I work up cuz I got kneed in the dick once my dick was bleeding oh yeah again my friend Scott Epstein Einstein same dude he goes past my garden it's just an accident slammed his knee into my dick flattened my dick right on the deck it's just sometimes it happens where it's like you Zig they zag pop and when I took my jock off at the end of rolling there was blood and my jockstrap I'm like oh no what were you guys drilling we going live because V not really alive yeah we're going live it's just accident it was just an accident it's just shit that happens yeah but it was if I had it now I wear one of those diamond MMA cups you ever fuck with those are the compression shorts so here's my thing with those guys and I was gonna say something earlier but I didn't want to I just don't think one cup fits all I just can't see your dicks too big I understand Al Joe no my crotch the doc you come is too big for my crotch man make it changes it like chase uncomfortable was and I tried it I was like do maybe I'm wearing it all I tried upside down it's like just be making different sizes they told me you know dude is one size fits all I'm like dude this just doesn't make any sense wait a minute wait what Frank ah no Francis and gone oh and Henry cejudo cop get in the fuck that's what they told me what'd you say that's not even possible yeah they've already they've come up to like the fight advantage I've actually seen him in a Chicago so I'm in Chicago again like handing out like samples and he asked me like how do you like the cup I'm like I don't want to be a dick I don't like being a mean guy but you asking me this question I feel like I got to tell you the truth my man just didn't like it he's like I what was wrong with you tell me one size just doesn't fit all I just what I told was like it just doesn't fit it's too big it's too big down there you don't want something that's comfortable so you could kick and leg squeeze your legs together and nah man that's just gonna be crushing my sac all over place mm I get it well for me it fits perfect but I get it everybody's a small guy different size junk area and if you have fatter thighs too right like I like dudes with like you know giant like Shawn Jordan guys a giant fake-ass legs like how you gonna get you know yeah it's gonna rub against it but does the compression shorts would help with that because that's the whole idea is that instead of like the way everybody used to wear it was just like a jockstrap right you'd have a cup in the jock strap and it kind of floated around like I'm gonna talk about dough Turner I got kicked in the balls once and like cops slammed into my nut ah and I was convinced I was convinced my balls were useless after that cuz my shit swole up like 2 times the size it should have been and it was all purple and I was like I broke my balls did you have to get it drained or did just like a commis I was 18 I didn't do it god I think it to make sure it worked once it still work - Mike we're good broke my dick I waited that not upbeat often just to make sure it worked we're good we're good that's funny man like chicken embryos in my toilet bowl it just came out pissed came out bloody - my piss blood for a couple days that's the worst pissing blood well I knew it was all just dick blood I was just like the moment I feel like any sort of infection or it feels like it's sore it didn't hurt so I was like I'm not gonna be nervous I'm gonna treat it like my nose I'm like I don't want my nose to fall off either but if my nose is bloody I don't freak out so I didn't want to freak out off my dick was bloody I don't like let me just treat it like it's a normal thing just don't freak out and it was fine it's like ignore the lion in the room keep moving if I'm pissing blood I'm freaking the fuck out I was a little freaking out it wasn't like I was not nervous at all but I was trying to rationalize and I'm saying okay this is no different than my nose if my nose was bleeding right now and I ran to the hospital freaking the fuck out it'd be a bitch right right for some things you definitely do I definitely wasn't I mean I wasn't ignoring it I was like the moment it feels like if my nose was infected I probably walk it off but if my dick is in fact that I am going straight to the ER oh man it's dangerous man infections are fucking dangerous down there anywhere infections are terrible enough a football coach today I guess he publicly stated he would cut his dick off for a Super Bowl win well don't say that yeah then they're gonna have the female Super Bowl League when the female NFL comes along you could you could join up be a champ and nowadays you can just do that you just decide I'm a woman and I'm a champion someone make that argument that they said Dennis Rodman should be considered like the first dick like she wanna make girls girls he doesn't even pretend to be a dresser so easy or crushed I guess I don't know it's more of a cross drew yeah but even that's like more for show he does it for fun you know still big to be doing all that shit to North Korea he's friends with a dictator they fly him over there he's playing a basketball with that dude partying with him and even giving him advice unlike how to get along with Trump and everybody should get along yeah yeah I guess I mean if it's working they're not gonna bomb us and shit so he was my favorite dude him and Eric Roberts were my favorite dude on Celebrity Rehab cuz neither one of them had a real problem like Eric Roberts would smoke weed so he stopped smoking weed you see him every morning he's fucking reading the newspaper drinking coffee - no problem in the world fucking Dennis Rodman's on a treadmill he's running my house and she's a professional man so he's not drinking he's not partying anymore he likes to party was he gonna live forever if he doesn't party yeah Eric Roberts smokes a little weed what's the big deal so both of those guys on that show we're like I don't see the problem better okay okay okay really check again Robins doing miles on the treadmill everybody else is going through seizures detox and they're freaking the fuck out and rod was just sweating whoo getting it yeah he's fine that's funny that is funny man how crazy is that kim jeong-hoon dude loves him that's a weird relationship there's a lot of guys who there he is like Heidi not crazy the guy loves basketball man crazy why would to his lip though Rodman yeah doing a bunch of stuff putting Barb's stuff no but it looks like something happened like he got bit by like a rattlesnake big lips and then on top of that he's got a hole in it look at that fucking hole that that ring that's pushing down on his lip that's crazy but I feel like when he was in his prime years in the NBA it didn't look his lips didn't look like that they look like burnt out look like if it looks infected I think that barb makes it look crazy there yeah crazier I think it's like that picture I look at with his lips and it's like a fucking witch lip would you have for the rest of your life yeah the trees like weird down turn lips gigantic infected lips are little tiny tiny tiny lips yeah that's a hard call it's a hard call yeah if you have to take whose look for the rest of your life kim jeong-hoon I'm gonna go with Rodman cuz at least he's a professional athletes got a great body you know well it's weird when dictators get really in athletics right like that Chechnya guy sends a lot of MMA fighters out oh I heard you talking about this yeah why he was telling us the story that guy's like nuts I heard I'm sure he's nuts like he likes he said he I don't know if this like okay to talk about it um but he thought horrible powerful man yeah but he said he's liking jurors powerful man he told that he told Wyman to like fight the other guy and it was like dead serious about it I don't know if they like how to I don't I think he figured out a way to like get out of it or something and then one was like one of those guys I think it was either one of his guys or Werdum fight either Verdoux him with one of his guys I think that's what he says something crazy like that was like don't bro did I say him to do it ah I think so but it was kind of like one of those like just super powerful is kind of like what he gets what he wants you know oh yes I do you that's like something get the fuck out it enter the dragon shit right he flies you out to an island yeah you you fight fight and he sits there and this fucking giant throne that's crazy asking people to fight yeah yeah I guess if you that rich and that powerful you can kind of get away with that but it's happened before we've had dudes out there and they made an agreement all right let's fucking fight this go after it right I mean there's stuff like that makes me nervous to go to places like that I'm like I just came here to enjoy the culture not to do all this extra curricular shit imagine if you go to Moscow and you knock out peel tree yeah I'm running the fuck out it and then then Putin wants you to come over mmm mm-hmm Castle yeah I don't know that's a Vanessa go in there and pedro muñoz there and shorts pretty much yeah fuck yeah it's a crazy I was saying the bed though man I got a pull-out couch yeah why do you have a pull-out couch the uh yeah so I be my house I got my real estate license back in March I finally finished my I did like one flip before in Arizona it didn't go so well but I gained the experience I used as like the cost of doing business so I learned a lot man learn a lot about like developing and you know agent now know we took the course together the same hair how to flip houses there's actually a bus tour going on right now and I guy hit me up nickel manya he wants me to he wants me to come down probably tomorrow Stan Irvine but those guys they kill it man they doing like crazy commercial stuff they're doing stuff in just residential Hawaii all right Quinta doing all right yeah I got awesome for him I got my license I haven't sold a single house yeah since March what was training for a fight you know it's gotta be hard yeah well I don't know how to use the fucking MLS yet so you asked me to show you something like send you houses like listings I should be able to like comprise like some data of like things that fit your criteria and then send it to you unlike an automatic email but I got to learn how to do that so kind of just sitting there but to get back was saying I like I bought the house after the Cody statement flight before the Cody statement fight so I'm like shitting bricks I'm like trying to close the house was about to the deal was about to fall through the day of close I was like get the fuck out of here you're gonna close this deal one way or the other even if I gotta shell out extra money out shell out the extra money so I get the house next year on my mortgage is 3 grand so 3 grand plus my utilities I'm looking at about like 35 36 hundred now when you equate like the salary that I make from fighting and everything in New York taxes and all that it's just not very lucrative yeah it's not sustainable there's no way I could do it unless I'm fighting like three four times a year like guaranteed if I'm not I might be in some trouble I don't have health insurance right now we long yeah that's and this is like crazy that's crazy shit that's always you're fighting in a cage without health insurance if you get injured in a fight though you're compensated right I'm compensated but if this is like an illness I'm not compensated for nothing like that so it's a little different so that's um like yeah I gotta I gotta make sure I like I don't get sick I got to make sure I'm doing the right things look both ways before I cross the street like little things like that but uh yeah so I bought the house whatever I it managed to close so I'm trying to figure out ways to sustain this because then my mom's in a situation where she's like facing an eviction at the time she's going through a five-year divorce now it's gonna be October is gonna be five years and it's just my dad he's the fuck he could be a pain he has to deal with in terms of just using his rationale humanely side of thinking he just doesn't get it and uh I've been trying to like somehow be like the that the bridge between the two because you know it's been a lot of fucked up years like domestic abuse and shit like that so I grew up with a lot of that man and my day and not to get off subject but that shit fucked me up in terms of like my confidence like this is a kid I mean he would just call us stupid and and all these names for whatever reason and I felt like even till like dating in middle school and high school was tough for me because yeah I was the good-looking kid but at the same time I was like I didn't know I hold a conversation because I was never taught I was never taught by my dad how to do certain things and that made me like very self-conscious and like approaching females and stuff like that like they didn't approach me with my friends in it start the conversation forget about it if I see any chick that I liked I had a crush on forget about my talking tonight even my girlfriend to this day we went to the same high school never talked to her we never spoke and I thought she was wondering the sexiest prettiest most beautiful females out there in the whole high school and I just never talked to I just always see her I was smile I'm like yeah we'll talk to you but I can't I just can't do it she can't do it but now we're dating whatever but um yeah man so I had to learn how to do a lot of that stuff on my own but uh yeah I'm trying to bridge the gap between the two of them and it's just been really tough so she's facing the eviction I got to figure something out now and I in a but long story short I don't want to like go too crazy into details but uh long story short I won the fight with Cody stammering so that was huge for me if I didn't win that fight I would've been fucked in terms of like really trying to help my mom cuz I wasn't trying to take my money my hard-earned money and thought went into something like a rental I'm like it just doesn't make any sense because she doesn't have a green papers so she wasn't working my dad paid for everything he was like he was a sugar daddy you know he fucking you know he did his Street pharmacy stuff he had a street pharmacy ways and so he made his money the way he made his money you know and um she never had to work I mean she's an interesting way of putting it Street farmers yeah I don't know like what's like okay to say before there's people knocking at the door so yeah just uh confessed to like using years and years of hook no no band-aids but my mom would help him and I just felt obligated as a as her one of her oldest kids I know she's got two kids older than me on her side alone she has ten kids just with my mom not with my dad like just her alone and when my dad she has eight I'm the oldest of the eight with my dad and then the two other kids are from another two different guys so it's just our family trees like fucking wacky it's just all over the place like my family has even met my girlfriend's family it's just like it's it's I don't know how the wedding's gonna go if we you know we ever decided get marry like yeah do I invite like who do I invite who do I not invite to make sure there's no like this just low we did it last minute guys ran off to Mexico and have a party though this way the wedding doesn't get ruined yes then you have a party afterwards and then everybody goes sideways we had a great wedding yeah yeah yeah you just go you just you and her and maybe like a couple other people just go to fucking the Bahamas or something see that's what I want to do but you see what she wants to do she has a huge family too so she wants everybody there she's got family in California in Texas back in Salvador I'm like Hills my specialty it is that I'm probably gonna be paying the entire bill for isn't that great that special days so nuts you spend so much money but shouldn't we not spend this money and just go on vacation desperately that's the way I live my life and also more than that like you a lot of weddings are like a fucking car yeah a cost like a brand-new car it was a kid's tuition you should finish a child's tuition that you spend on a wedding you know what are we doing with all this money Society man I think you see everyone it got the way they dressed it up in a program that brains too and if you're kind of like stuck in your ways and that's what you want us what you wanted I get it I want everyone wants to be the princess moment I get it I get it yeah exactly very important to me I mean yeah I can imagine her listening to this right now like sorry just joking I'm sorry look I'm married to like I should shut the fuck up yeah you want to be happy they said that expression happy wife happy life just yeah whatever what I got to do I was like my house I don't have a goddamn thing on the walls in my house I don't I'm putting nothing up it's all my wife that's why this place is so crazy this to know this place is free how she look like the elk skulls and American flags Mitzi shore and Thai Buddha's Richard Pryor the Ghostbuster girl that's my fuckin house this this podcast studio but if you go over my house you'd be like oh we're in the wrong place John live here honey this is like a woman or a gay guy I hear you man that's how my house is except my McGuffy hasn't she doesn't she hasn't moved in yet so she hasn't been able to like put her own special touches bring her mattress and get the fuck over yeah yeah pretty much I need a fucking bed I'm like baby we need new guys say we're just gonna take yours everybody's actually pretty comfortable what about one of these maybe make a deal with this company that gave Jamie that bed what's that company again it's called eight sleep brother eight sleep reach out reach out to ALG Amane to make something listen if there's something that really does work like that I mean I need to try it that chill pad is one of the marxist and recommends he said it's incredible he said it's a game-changer it cools your body down you sleep way better yeah oh no it's gonna hold my apnea but it might feel better Wow got a pillow where your mouth is now like falling forward yeah like if you if you can instead of sleeping on your back which is your tongues gonna fall back sleep where your mouth is kind of turns forward cuz if I forget my mouthpiece and I go on the road that's what I do yeah and it's fine as long as I make sure that my head is pointing down it's like an awkward angle I wake up my next killing me and I got bad neck like from like voting discs and herniated discs of my neck just from wrestling and jiu-jitsu so everybody does yeah and yes fucked up do you ever use one of those harnesses we hang from your neck a little bit and compression I think it's told my one that that that sleep mask thing oh yeah that thing looks ridiculous I tried that my everyone was laughing at yeah I can't I can't go to bed with mice you know but if you breathe out of your nose does your nose work good yeah I think so I don't think it's deviated it might no I don't know can you go do you do a yoga class ever and just breathe out of the nose only mmm I thought I think one yoga class and that was in college that was a long time ago but if you can these neck things if you can you can find them on Amazon they're just a neck harness it's not expensive and it straps to adorn the top of the door decompress about like a little click click click you pull it and it pulls your neck and you get it's relaxed and just stretches your neck what's cool it's I mean I'm like I know decompression harness yeah I probably get one of those they'll help you I feel good to relax your neck when you do like the incline bed and you hang upside down even though the blood rushes to your head which sucks yeah I have one of those too yeah that's the only thing I don't like lower back yeah thing right there that's what I have some things to shit I gotta do that in a post safe setting my safe space yeah Quinn always looking at me yeah it's definitely that but you pull on it and click click click click click and it relaxes your neck what's the clicking is that the spine it's like the lever little notches each notch it like pulls it a certain amount yeah click and you pull it more click click and then when you want you just sit up and you release all the tension I just had a terrible thought in my head with that jerking off no that's like people died from that's all David Carradine from kung fu he died strangle himself I was beating off allegedly he might get killed by the mob yeah yeah he he died of what they call auto-erotic asphyxiation remember that ban and a and not an excess in excess in excess yeah I was thinking of this the car and SX INXS the lead singer same thing he died from autoerotic asphyxiation there's dudes who try to choke themselves where they beat off was a preacher a preacher they caught this preacher wearing a wet suit he had a dildo up his ass and he was choking himself and he blacked out while he's beating off and died ray Donovan yeah something might have been they might set him up to you know he might have been banging some kids that's all he got back oh yeah no I've never heard of that that's that's that's a different way that's a different kind of uh was it what's called SMS or yeah SMS is box IDO masochistic right that's sadomasochism and bonding SM whatever the fuck it is they get off on it they say that something about being choked that it accentuates the orgasm so well I mean come on hey babe fucking ridiculous give me that look you know you know lasso stopped roping cows and wrap it around your neck we'll give you a full report woman take it back this is Alabama minister who died in June of accidental mechanical asphyxia was found hogtied wearing to complete wetsuits including a facemask diving gloves and slippers rubberized underwear and a head mask according to the autopsy report 51 year old pastor of Montcalm was insane bunker Maurice his death was not caused by foul play if that is not foul play how do you play and can I read your rulebook - it seems foul yeah yeah hit a dildo up his ass right didn't he this is bone of his bone reason condom covered dildo Hey don't want you pregnant covered dildo his ass well he was beaten up I mean that's that's from like kinda like hold back all your sin pretending that you don't have any sin cuz you're a pastor and it just bubbles up it's illegal to sell those in Alabama really stop hating on dildos have a dildo in Alabama I just heard two like I think Mississippi is the only state you're allowed to drink while you're driving as long as you don't cross over the point zero eight that is goddamn hilarious Oh beer in your front seat Wow Mississippi yeah mississippi also has the fucking confederate flag in its in its state flag yeah yeah part of the state flag it's like yikes wild laws down there the waa waa west of Iowa South I don't think if I ever been to Mississippi I have it I don't know if I've ever been I haven't even been to New Orleans I still want to go there and New Orleans is wild hey here it's nothing but good things great people I can't wait friendly people and the food is outstanding yeah I kinda decided I've been trying to do for like years now and I haven't been able to make this happen cuz the financial situations the whole thing like when my mom is and shit like that like trying to get the house for her and whatnot but I want to hit like every do like a cross-country tour and hit every state in every capital and document the entire fucking thing like a one two month like escapade or some shit maybe after the next fight I would like to but then I'm also thinking like I was at some point like to maybe have kids or something but then I'm like if I have a kid and I can't leave her while she's pregnant and unless she just comes along like but then she works and she's in school my damndest everything just nothing ever works out unless like just go I feel bad if I would you just leave for that long you gotta win the title time like y'all I'm out cuz I get that that's a big scratch what would you do if you won the title would you would you bake eight and just say enough but do you have an idea of when you want to stop fighting ah you know what it's very interesting that the accident it's always been you guys the guys that gym two has always been 32 32 so we're close I'm close whether or not I'm gonna feel the same when I'm 32 B now I'm out to be 30 and I'm realizing how close that is if I you know realize my dream and I got the real estate thing I got a college degree in physical education I'm trying out for the FDNY I'm still unsure how that's gonna work out it's just the flexibility of the schedule and actually being able to have health care benefits for myself and my family whoever that is you know talk to Steve Bay um no but I have firefighter friends back home I know I actually I think I have one time and he told me he loved it anyway Island too right yeah Eddie one that I think I was talking to him about that briefly in Chicago shout-out to the mustache mafia yeah yeah yeah he gave me one of those things yeah I didn't know he was fighting on the car and I seen him pop up and I'm like holy shit and then yeah he had a crazy eye sprite that crazy like then you guys yeah wild wild fight man any wounds a tank he's one of the more unusual fighters when you watch him move like he's one of those guys we could see him in a silhouette you go oh that's Eddie Wineland yeah yeah yeah chance and everything crazy crazy weird style to try to sort out like he's so unusual in his movement first WEC champion right yes yes way back in the day oh sure that's back when it was in Northern California right yeah yeah where was that the little cage yeah it was like well fuck was the original original WEC was like I want to say Lodi but well I don't think it was Lodi but it was like the war California something like that was weird spots yeah I never looked at the location like now I start to pay attention to things like that now like more like where I fall where the fights gonna be held and things like that cuz I I always end up going to the events from time to time it is a little more W 20 which Sony one was in a little more Calif yeah then this would be used to have him out there that's when Reid was running it yeah yeah Reed Harris yeah I love that dude he's good dude he's a great dude yeah yeah I mean those those pioneers of the game man those guys who you know like but Brett's been used to run king of the cage and these people that run these little small organizations but everything started yeah actually when we used to do it in California when the first started doing MMA shows in California they had to do them on a Native American reservations because you couldn't have it anywhere it wasn't sanctioned yeah yeah then yeah so like when we would go to see king of the cage when Eddie Bravo used to work for king of the cage and I would go with him out to these events we would have to go to the middle of nowhere man he's weird-ass casinos that's the only place where you could go to see the fights yeah for my reservation a couple times in New York because we could have light in New York yeah I still came to fight in New York because I got some like medical thing they're not sure if I was born with it or not but I'd even know about it until I got my I had my UC debut in Vegas UFC 170 and yeah had to get a cask and got the Cascade and I had like two spots on my brain so they just kept monitoring and I had to go see a neurologist and all that and they just want to make sure I wasn't going like bleeding out I wasn't gonna like just die in the Octagon randomly oh and you know so they were looking out for me but I've been able to fight everywhere except for New York and I'm just hoping that these guys do the right thing so I can least fight one time before my careers or sudden all said and done in my home state I think that would be something that I've dreamed up for like a very long time you know I never knew this would have happened until my debut to kind of just do a wrench into everything do the neurologists say it's okay yeah I'm clarify it's just the wording in this in the New York body's sanctioning rule whatever and like so what do you guys have to do to change it I think they said just a doctor has to go like rewrite it or some shit like that I'm like but why is this taking so long it's been years now I mean like just every time I see Kim hey que ma you is the doctor gonna go like change the rule of something so I could fight in New York and I nothing you know I don't know then I'm I guess they're not moving the needle for me so that sucks I guess New York they probably don't want to take any chances cuz it's so recent that they even got it approved right yeah five years right how many years three now 2016 16 I was there for the bill when they signed it no yeah that was a fun time those fucking Madison Square Garden cards are Budman yeah yeah I always put bananas cards on in msg yeah I was there live for the Conor McGregor Eddie Alvarez just the Wayne's were electrifying I was like young man kills selling out that building yeah you think about all the amazing boxing fights that happened in that building I mean that is the most famous arena and all of combat sports Madison fucking Square Garden I remember the first time I walked in there for the UFC I got chills I was like I can't believe we're here right here I get chills I'm getting goosebumps right now just thinking about it like you walk in that place it has a special feeling man yeah and I just hope to god I could get to fill that one day at least one day come on New York I hope come on so right now you're dealing with a bit of a thumb injury right yeah this cast that you have on your arm right now is um this is to isolate your ligament yeah so in the fight I don't know at what point where one of the punches I threw I guess I landed with it down because the UFC gloves they don't protect the thumb there's no padding on the thumb I don't know if I like it or don't like it but whatever I've been fighting like that with these guys for so long now at this point I don't really even notice it just the first time I really really banged up my hand but it's like the the ligament on the radio and on the side I hold the thumb to keep it from like turning out like my thumb on this side they compared it and he saw how lakhs it was on this side he's like dude is it does this hurt it's like nah that's just normal that's my thumb so they think my thumb being able to do that's on the other side maybe it's just my anatomy do it again but um yeah it's like it's kind of freaky yeah but yeah but does it hurt at all like 15 degrees more movements but I'm double-jointed in my thumbs so I don't know if that's what it is yeah that looks like it hurts do you see Craig Jones and Anthony Rumble Johnson had a grappling match I saw biting it didn't get to catch the match try could go to Craig Jones Instagram he wrapped him up quick yeah mumble took him down and Craig Jones got to hold that leg it was it's gorgeous it's a beautiful transition if you're a fan of leg locks she's scary Craig Jones who's Rumble Johnson is obviously a gigantic man he's in like he's like 260 now and Craig Jones is probably only about 210 but when they rolled but there's a video of it on Craig's Instagram if you find it yeah that's right and that that's probably it try it right there versatile I if ya could Jones versus Goliath was this it let me see it's a repost he put out here stood in for ya okay make it like a little larger attended by Chael Sonnen submission underground this seems like just to advertise on birthday is it just the advertiser I sent it to him I sent him what congratulations and a sad day well maybe it may be me lights not on his maybe yeah let me find out real quick because we could imagine about the fight so when that big and the big guys like I'm gonna fuck you up and then all the guys just like I'm gonna break your fucking ankles it's like damn that's a yeah and then he goes out there and he actually does it you know know it says here I'll send it to you Jamie oh yeah hang on a second - G - okay [Music] all right I sent it to you you get on the Instagram it's actually from Craig Jones BJJ from his Instagram yeah I don't know it wasn't showing here it is so watch this so rumbles on top and Craig elevates with that right pasen pasen boom locks ahold gets the heel hook tap but hey he even fight the hands nothing he didn't even wrap a hole the heel yeah like you they were still in transition he had the legs lake laced up he had inside control you see this watch he gets it flips rolls it he's got the leg and rambles like I get it fuck that fuck that I'm walking out of here alright well now I know I walked in here and I'm walking out that's the more amazing thing about leg locks is smaller people can get away with things from the bottom that it's very difficult to get away with cuz you're using both of your legs to control a person's leg it's like you have so much strength in in leg locks and so much control with those two legs around one leg I mean it you're obviously one from the hens Oh team which is that that is that where it all started with John Danaher with Dean Lister said so the Danaher and Danaher refined that system and Eddie Cummings and and all these fucking animals that are coming out of there now there's so many leg lock specialists out of that part of the gym or that part of the world like that one gym that hens Oh Gracie Jim is responsible for a gigantic evolution in in leg locking yeah those guys are phenomenal to work with whenever I could get down there to get some training is always fun it's always a battle that Nikki Ryan kids super youngster ordinary tone a very toning leg lock machine yeah Damien Jason rod Nick Nick Nick Ronan those guys oh those guys are animals salaries scary the company's apart but you know they say why would you ignore 50% of the human buddy Wow why would you why 50% of the human body he's such a weird guy to talk to you he studies her exam Johnna too smart Hey he makes me feel like shit like I said nothing dumb what do you do from here he was making photo you a tenth planet black belt I want to know I want to learn God this is a judge Freeh's oh damn it but he's so smart in his analysis of positions instead of just rolling and getting better and drilling and comparing he's done just like a systematic analysis of various positions what you need to do what you need to master where are you going from here and III from what I understand from everybody Eddie Cummings is a big part of that as well all right if it lets him out yeah Eddie coming some master he's a master it's just so good at leg logs so I watched that guy compete multiple multiple times online it's just like his transitions are so smooth it's like it's it's amazing yeah first time competed the at Eddie Bravo's Invitational 2 at EBI pretty sure I was there for him like that uh that rule set is an interesting rule set and I think that's the best rule set for like if you get a stalemate at the end of you know the initial time period then from there you have a chance to you go at it for a certain amount of time still someone gets tapped and you start out in different positions you start out either with back control or what you call spiderweb yeah you like have your on side control your legs across the face and you have the arm trapped inside but you don't have an arm bar fully extended and you like ready go yeah you start from there and then they calculate how long it takes to escape versus whether or not somebody tabbed so if you tap somebody they have a chance to tap you and they have a chance to get back to that same position but if you tap them quicker than they tap you then you win yeah great it's great the only position of that I just really didn't like that much was uh the back control position because you see a lot of the times the guys will escape and let the guy end up in mount and then that would be considered an escape but it's like but was that really an escape you know in a fist fight do you really want to be there at that position mount you didn't escape shit you're gonna get fucked up it's a good point like right you should have to escape escape yeah you should have to get out of Mount but did you I'm saying it's like we think about it in the concept like are you training guys to set them out right is that what happens so I'm not a hundred percent sure on the this Gio Martinez Gio who's a beast he's one of Eddie's black belts actually caught Cummings in an armbar he's one of the few guys that I've ever seen tap Eddie yeah and this was from spiderweb but you notice when he goes to spiderweb he controls that right leg yep that's very notice that it's very very important that for the bridging yeah what's also you you just you could keep control of one part of the body so there's no movement side to side right yes he's not moving around towards the head he's stuck in that spot so whether or not he extends or doesn't extend you know whether he catches the arm there I mean you could still defend it's possible but it cuts out a lot of the pathways he creates a lot of control yeah there's no rocking yeah exactly look even here even here he still got that leg he still got that leg and you were always in a bad spot with a guy like Gio who's a he's an armbar while he's it just to Jiu Jitsu master but what weight is this 45 I think it's 45 I believe and Gio like his brother Richie they started out as break dancers these guys are strong as fuck they're crazy physical dexterity they could do all kinds of nutty shit with their bodies and now he's got the nearside leg yeah that's going back to the far yeah and this is a bad fight to showcase Eddie companies he want to get caught but he got caught here because they started out from my tour yeah you know you he's not starting out from from a neutral position they're starting out from a disadvantage and this is one of the rare times he's so he's got the arm in that spiderweb and now he's got like a figure four but he had a fig for us like a little loose now but he had it was yes really loose it's called the arm crush yeah so he was going for like an biceps mm-hmm okay and then really it almost snaps your forearm nice socks tremendous tremendous pressure on the forum it's awful so she can go big guys yeah but it could be a bicep slicer as well that uh those positions were terrible I said just a crushing of the limb like that terrible feeling but he eventually catches him here dude your arm is so shot after getting out of that I know you know what compressed you know it's it's a horrible feeling - it's like forearms and your leg in the leg the back of the calf is crushing it and the other leg is squeezing down like a triangle it's oh it's awful - just is amazing man everyone I love it amazing martial art I would probably forever do it some like my late forties fifties yes long as I'm like still able body and all that you know if you find good training partners you can do it yeah as long as you the thing about the human body is like you only got so many explosions in you you know so many times you could push a guy off you so many times you die forward so many times you could just thrust up from the bottom but if you do things with the right technique like John Jacques Machado I think he's at least 50 John Jacques still roles and you don't have any injuries yeah no role but he's you never see John Jacques just like he never goons out of anything I've gooned out of things before explode and you catch them when they're maybe resting a little bit you'd goon out of it it never goes out it's like this smooth within technique it's all defense it's perfect yeah yeah that was just flow it's not like that oh yeah that was what's interesting about watching michael Chiesa and Diego Sanchez like he flowed it just flowed there was no like he didn't have to do anything crazy he was in control like from the moment he clenched him got ahold of them he's just moving constantly chaining you know chaining control submission attempts control submission attempts it was just beautiful yeah yeah I got to rewash that fight I was at a wedding when I was watching those fights ah so I was like partially with my dancing shoes kind of won't be like disrespectful so we got the fights up and we're like hovering over the table oh so I'm looking a which shit I told Eve Edwards we would watch that shit while it's on the background Oh turn the TV on and put it on ESPN though if it's on espn2 or is it on eventually goes to ESPN Plus let's see if it's on espn2 right now he see okay word to mother and I love that yeah I'm glad he's making his way into transitioning into commentary - he's excellent yeah really good well he was such a technical fighter data he's really good at transitioning into tampering with by the way just I forgot I never finished my arm bed story yeah well not even a bed like so let's go back real quick and just to finish it because I people probably like whatever happen with your mom and whoa yeah so so after after the Kodi standing fight I need to I need to win that fight otherwise I would have been in a really bad spot because of all the renovations I did to my house in my house smell like cigarettes it was like it was pretty fucked up but I got in a short sale in a really nice neighborhood and Massapequa I'm in I'm in the hood the hood of Massapequa now it's not the home yeah so that's nice you get the short sale like some other ones folly and fuckup yeah I can sneak in and take a nice house and disrespectful little bit they were there they were kind of happy to get rid of it to be honest I think they were struggling with the payments or whatnot so it was cool but I loved my neighborhood I don't have real like neighbors I have side yards so I'm not in anyone's way but to make ends meet i air B&B my house so I sleep in a basement so that's why I had to pull out cuz I don't want to make it all packed up and me like you know like the little cricket guys I'd be jumping around all over the place I don't want like a ton of shit for them to hide and start like making a little cricket babies so I just got the pull-out couch right this is a lot easy to clean got a rug whatever kind gets in your house are so fucking annoying if you can't find them they the worse they are the I will find you I know I love you but I don't kill crickets when you do the time most the time I grab when I throw them outside I don't know why I grab what you have I'm prejudiced against certain bugs if I find a spider it's dead you're dead if I find a cricket I'm like our little fella come on let me get you they don't bite I heard they bite your hands cricket just trust me bro I'm just trying to get you outside and try not to kill you yes I get the little traps the sticky traps and I feel so bad because they just wither away and they I'm like it's such a fucked up way to go but I'm like you came to my hood you came to my territory this is my land that's right you know so snakes in my yard dead all of them sakes yep rattlesnakes Brown snakes dead dead all of them people say you shouldn't kill it shut the fuck up I have kids yeah out here man yeah out here in California for sure rattlesnakes are everywhere I went to look at a house and I stomped a rattlesnake to death in the in the front yard of the house of this house that we were looking at poison yes there was a fucking rattlesnake sitting there in the front yard and I just I just saw it I said okay I'm just gonna go this is what I would do if I lived here I'm gonna stomp this motherfucker I wouldn't I knew I was in a position on that fast okay they're that they're fast when they strike but if a rattlesnake is flattened out and he can't see you it doesn't see you coming I'll stomp that mother I just crushed his head that's badass cuz I would not fuck with that thing like I didn't I would I wouldn't if it was like pulling bags like but I saw where it was and like these people live in this house that they were sellin and I was like they don't want this fuckin thing here no one wants a rattlesnake they're in a fuckin yard I would have been scared shitless man like I'm going to sound calling the exterminator well I've developed a real anger for them when they bit my dog's I've had three times I've had to take my dog's to the veterinarian that their face all swole up like a water balloons going on the side of their head cuz they got a bit rattlesnakes are fucked up too because what their venom does is it digests your tissue it's one of the it's something about their venom is how it helps them like eat rabbits and things that they kill because the the venom not only does it kill you but it kind of breaks down your tissue yeah so when but when people get bitten by it real bad man they have to get these horrible skin grafts and they get necrosis where all the tissue around where the bite was all dies off it's like sometimes you can see the bone like it a lot yeah not for the weak heart that's why stop its motherfuckers out you guys a go fuck you sounds me off or you yeah and I see I'm not big into like the wilderness surprisingly because my parents are from Jamaica so you know we have like that that Caribbean upbringing we weren't like raised in a traditional American home like the lifestyle so we have a different like rules and everything and we never really experienced like that's the type of stuff in like Jamaica and shit like that what's going on Jim well one I can't figure out why the DirecTV is not coming through the TV but two it doesn't even start for another 25 minutes so oh ok 5:30 alright well we'll check it out in 5 minutes 25 minutes was it to start on ESPN Plus in 25 I was looking for ESPN Plus it's not on there it says espn2 at 5:30 and must be the previews though or the prelims maybe there's things but it's not oh here we go well I like that the PFL is doing what they're doing what go just go up to the machine and see if you could remote control please Pam Plus won't work on that TV I'd have to go through my laptop well will be idiot ESPN Plus at 5:30 no espn2 at 5:30 Brice's that probably had it even with him when we were trying explain it so it should be on ESPN Plus right now I'm gonna get it on there and then espn2 right we've got 30 V but I can't even get I don't know why DirecTV is not working on we'll figure it out we'll figure it out Eve Adwords shout out I like the fact that doing that though the PFL is giving away all that money I love it I love it six or eight people each year I think it was six he said on the show put a million dollars if you win the season by some hey more money I think there's more money than I've made in 13 UFC fights thing about job and chip uh no no you know what it is I would need to before I would ever do that I would want to win the belt and I think that's a very obtainable and realistic thing for me to to be able to realize that dream before I would ever jump ship because it's almost like what Mighty Mouse did here like okay with leaving because he was a UFC champ super dominant he didn't really lose that say you to fight in my eyes I don't think he lost that fight I think it worse at best it was a draw I don't think there was any real clear-cut loser but I didn't think say you don't won I didn't think Mighty Mouse lost but for him to go to another organization and if he does win the belt it's like arguably like you really can't deny the guy he's one of the goats if not Vigo you know so that's the way I kind of look at it and I probably be retired anyway just 32 is close now you can't deny him anyway I mean no matter what happens from here on out my mouse in my opinion technically is the best ever best ever technically the thing about him versus John Jones in my eyes that John is face stiffer competition yeah I think John just fought more dangerous guys and also John is completely undefeated you know has that one loss - Matt Hamill which is a disqualification in a fight where he was totally dominant in where I think was a bad call anyway yeah I thought Matt was fucking them up but then I look at it like this see now that Mighty Mouse is removed and there's new life at the flyweight division everything is super competitive now right so it goes to show maybe it speaks volume on just how good Mighty Mouse just really is compared to everybody else maybe that's why the division just looked like that people like oh you just little guys not like fighting the big guys I get that but it's like the same thing with John Jones but now there's like closer competition now you see John Jones going to decisions a lot more as opposed to finishing the older veterans who the pioneers who were the the Shogun who was the rampage Jackson's the who else says he murdered Vlad that mata'utia I mean he wasn't no champ but um Vitor Belfort like those guys even though Vitor home will snap that arm in half was crazy fucking insane I jumped out of my fucking well that showed you what an animal John is yeah didn't tap he just let his arm get fuckin jacked and then wound up tap and Vitor the next round yeah John is he's not just talented his mind is just unstoppable you just got incredible his ability to overcome adversities ability to get out of bad situations ability to press on we saw that in the Gustafson fighting he wasn't in shape for that fight at all yeah they said he was barely training well ice i party with John not like the hardcore party that he does that he has done let me say he has done I'm not sure party I'm not sure if he still parties like that but when he was partying I would see him at the bar in Ithaca or he'll come out to Courtland college cuz ethica was right down the road this is like when he was kind of going back and forth between Jackson's and our gym when I was upstate at bomb squad right before he like officially left and then he was just coming home and going back to Jackson's coming home going back to Jackson's and it would be like a couple of weeks before his fight this guy would be out there shots and he'll be like asking me if I want a drink I'm like dude I'm fighting like for like four weeks I can't I can't do that I had to have a hard time cutting weight for him I was like dude you don't like you know it's not hard for you to cut wave you get fucked up like this I mean I didn't ask him that but I was like I totally know I got a fight coming up I'm like but I know you got a fight coming back clearly does not fucking matter because you're Jon Jones you just going out there tooling people anyway fine was it what he said of Daniel Cormier I've beat you when I was on cocaine yeah yeah cocaine's a hell of a job so the crazy thing to say to someone I beat you and I did cocaine yeah that says laughing that says a lot don't man it does DC's a fucking animal you know so I was like it's just John Jones DC and then everybody else you know he's that good man but I'll tell you what man that Thiago Santos is a motherfucker yeah he kicked the shit out of John's legs put him in real danger and you know I think John would have made a way easier fight if he decided to take him to the ground but he never did yeah see and I talked about that fight on my podcast this morning I do it on Wednesday it's funny what your podcast is where they get it oh the weekly scraps you can get it on itunes spotify google play tune in and my website i'll just on that come back young'n so what you say but I was see the way I broke that fight down I was like John was always the guy the aggressor pushing forward walking him down cutting him against cutting him cutting him off and pushing him back towards the cage and then Thiago looked like he was just kind of wait and waiting to pounce like he was looking for John to take a half step where he could time it why he was off balance and try to rush him and blitzen with those big bungalows he was doing as a rampage Jackson calls him so I didn't feel like he connected on anything significant besides the leg kick early in the first round where I kicked his leg I was alright this fight is gonna be interesting because he's attacking the legs early but then he who started attacking the legs more but I felt like some of it wasn't really like it didn't seem like it was really affecting John the way people like watching it live I thought it was landing a lot more and then when I rewatched it I was like I don't know I have to really like I'm looking at it I put it in slow-mo and I'm watching the fighting like well that punch did to connect that punch did connect to anything he did the one head kick that John got his Hannah by at the very last second it was able to block it the one Dana White posted like a picture on Instagram was saying how tough he was fighting on the torn ACL the PCL and like the MCL and MCL and meniscus his fucking knee is gone yeah I don't what was that the first or second run was that service round first round might have been a sec but yeah that's a kick and we notice his knee buckled yeah okay and um that was the first round was the first so I wasn't fractured Jenn yeah tried to shake him I thought oh that was one team too when he buckled and he threw a throwing that motherfucker's crazy like that's hardcore yeah that's the big one that's the big shin bone not the smaller one the fibula yeah the cc's of blood right god they're pulling out a quart of milk out of his fucking me who look at and they've already got a bunch in that little bucket yeah dr. Sanders did that right holy shit man from the UFC yeah who did that operation ah oh my god yeah that knee is mangled so he had a immediately go into surgery after that yeah his knee was mangled and bastard well I tough guy yeah I just felt like John was still controlling dictating like the control like the wounds like like it looked like there was moments where it's like oh but he didn't really hit him well he definitely kicked the shit out of his legs John had to be carried out in the wheelchair landed some shots to the with punches but John moved with them yeah bowling yeah he rolled with them he kept his hands up he got caught but he moved back he's amazing and he's the best ever at controlling distance he does the finger at the finger range the pokey rage but I'm like dude no one's gonna get past those lawyers fucking go-go-gadget inspector arms you know but it's dangerous when the eyes get in them yes because they have happened it happened to a bottle he's claimed you know how they have Ronda Rousey collecting arms on the show like they did those pitches John's got like eyeballs the whole light heavyweight division is in a strange state right now because it's like you got John Jones and then who else you know you got Johnny Walker who was looked fantastic when he knocked out me shirts her crowing off but then he fell down and fucked yourself up his shoulders still fucked up man just they've showed him doing rehab like real recently on his Instagram page and I'm like whoa this was like six months later if that's all he can lift like that's like stabilizer muscles and stuff that's around the shoulder that shoulder might be fuck you did you show that I did my shoulder my labrum yeah I've had all a bunch of stem-cell shot into my shoulder that healed it up but I had some pretty significant shoulder injuries yeah you did you did a labrum surgery rotator cuff another little surgery I put on a full length rotator cuff tear okay and they used exosomes and it was gone the next MRI have the the tear was gone yeah just it goes it just seals up they did exosomes with platelet-rich plasma and they mix it together and shoot it into the injury and I went through the rehab and then I got another mr MRI like six months later eight months later whatever it was when it started feeling good they said well let's take a look at it and they were like holy shit like dr. Roddy McGee from Vegas who did a lot of UFC stuff he goes do you know how crazy that is he's like your tear is gone doesn't exist anymore that's I gotta see that it's like fucking next-level shit why don't they offer that to us when we have fucked up injuries I'm like my neck my back like I mean that help you well I mean if they really think that you need it and date my I don't know if they know that you have this injury like maybe you have to ask for it but I feel like if you you're one of your top guys you would want us to be back healthy best as we can possibly be so it's not prohibitively expensive for the UFC either if you talk to dr. Davidson or talk to DOM you know connect you with dr. McGee yeah no they were too close with McGee yeah he's got the good shit he's a doctor Roddy McGee in Vegas is always at the cutting edge he's that guy is like every time I talk to him he there's some new thing that's going on there's new stuff now called Wharton's jelly that is even more powerful than any of the previous tim cell ones and i had that shit shot into my shoulder too and that's all in the states all in the States yeah cuz stuff in the states now is way more potent than it was just five years ago okay exactly more you had a guest on and they were talking about going to Neil Riordan yeah animal Panama I sent my mom down there yeah my mom has a pretty bad knee and it sent it down and it helped it but she's gonna go down again it's a it's a heavy shit man they can they do IV stem cells to they do a gang shit down there yeah so so let me ask you so what exactly does it help does it help with like regenerate soft tissue so like would that be like a tendon ligament tendons ligaments muscle injuries things along those lines they can regenerate ligaments regenerate tissue tears you know like stuff where you ordinarily would have to get things sewn up but here's a perfect example my friend John his wife had a labrum tear so shed a tear in the labrum of her hip yeah and the doctor is saying like most likely we're gonna have to fix this it's gonna be a big deal it's gonna be like months yeah off your feet like you have to you can't put any weight on it for I think like six to eight weeks or something like that well she got exosomes shot in there and then when they went in for the second MRI there's nothing no injury to God it's freaky freaky so she had a little bit of a deformity in the bone of her hip that was causing an irritation against the labrum they sanded down that part of the hip that was kind of bothering her they like cut away the part of the bone that's intruding on the labrum so yeah it clear the path so was not that invasive a surgery and in six weeks later she's good to go I mean she's rehabbing and everything and she's still like they still had cut her open a little bit yeah but the big one was the labrum tear and all that was fixed so I had a bicep tendon repair now my bicep rolled up I don't know if you seen Matt Serra's on it's like rolled up never got his 15 ever got it done he just took the fight and whatever and I was contemplating doing the same things after I lost the cryin carry weight I was like the most devastating time of my life that was like I went off the fucking rails but that's not off the rails that's another story I was just binge drinking I was just out partying non-stop my girlfriend I went through a pretty bad breakup at the point too and it was like it was two fights in a row we got two fights it was I beat Johnny Eduardo we got into a fight at the hotel and it got bad like real bad to the point like my brother's seen it like she got she has a nice she has a good right hook let's just say to the back of Moscow yeah got physical they got physical and like but it's not unfair it's super unfair because she knows that you can't do it back yeah but she knows how I kind of like not kind of she knows how I grew up mmm and it's good thing my one of my brothers were there Troy he fights all these pro I just he's he's done sorry he's actually a pretty good rapper but I think that's more of his calling than fighting in my personal opinion he's more dedicated I just I would just say that so he saw it but he said I remember I would tell him stuff like nothing sometimes girls crazy but I think that's all females whatever but uh he's like dude if I never say if I wasn't in the room to see that I would never have believed you that she would ever do anything like that I'm like now you know I'm not fucking lying I'm a fucking crazy I'm a full of shit but it was only had one girl swing at me ever yeah I couldn't believe it as she was swinging at me I was like oh god but right hook right okay I don't believe this is happening it was real Telegraph she has zero trains you weekly I just ducked I was I can't even believe this I had duck under and just get a hold of Mike what are you doing yeah is it's yes I cover it up cuz I didn't wanna find anyone argue I'm like yeah I just came up the biggest win I finished Johnny of the water I was like it was a boring fight but I got to finish it's what I did the like the decapitating hangman thing and then I start doing the Milly rock whatever I don't any blood so I was a cloud 9 you know I'm like celebrating and the way the fight started she kind of like she got more drunk than me at my own at the party and I was I was like you pay I'm not in a mood to be holding your hair tonight in the toilet because mine's my night and I get you you're happy for me but let me be more happy than you let me let me let me be the one really really enjoying this moment and I just thought like maybe slow down like can you drink a little water and that turned it just spiraled out of control it went it got crazy hey got crazy well then uh long story short she right hook right hook left hook one of those I think i hain't still fucked up from from my til this day he puts that hashtag on everything it's the greatest fuckin to this day yo people to see flatlines every penny yeah to this day but then then the next fight caraway another big fight and we're still like shaky again two arguments a lot I think we were kind of like it's like six years in at this point know it like five years in so that we're still figuring things out you know we're young figure things out and I'm still like enjoying the the fruits of my labor like I'm on top of the world right now I'm ranked fourth in the world about to have the biggest fight against Bryan caraway potential title implications on the line and I'm you know I did a lot of dumb stuff you know I was like talking other people I'm a very flirtatious guy but I don't I try not to cross the line you know and sometimes sometimes something whatever sometimes you cross they by accident it's not like an intentional thing you know I love her or whatever and um but then after that fight I lost my first loss and you know I I cried in the fucking bath my after party I was like Trey's all my boys and friends were there my some of my sponsors and it was it was a hard moment you know cuz it wasn't I mean wasn't devastating loss but it was decision laws I never thought it would happen like that and especially not to that motherfucker I was like did I talk so much shit trying to build that fight up no this is like I can't believe I did all this work and then came up short because I just fucked I just shot myself in the foot whatever and the next day we went to the pool because it was early and she likes to sleep in she when she gets the opportunity to work she's on vacation she could sleep she sleeps the fucking me I'm like I'm up eight nine o'clock I'm out I'm having a drink and by the pool feet up I'm under my umbrella because I try not to tan I already got enough of that and she comes up where you at and I think I'd go back to the room and turns it to another fucking fight and at that point that's when I kind of like you know what I don't give a fuck talking anybody any girl I see I think that's hot I'm gonna talk to them and if I get cold I get caught I don't give a shit anymore and I can't get caught and uh it was a rocky very rocky time and I was like I said I was just drinking non-stop and I was just I was just kind of being a fuckup man I ain't mind I never did like hardcore drugs anything I you know I was smoked but this is hardly psychologically to handle like a big loss like that is that what it is I just throws you off you know what you know I've lost a lot of my life you know I would think that I battled back from a lot of adversity just dealing with the stuff with my dad and my parents them going through my dad going through a few divorces and the domestic abuse and you know being the first one to go to college and finish college becoming a two-time all-american like I have a lot of things to be proud of and a lot of things that set me back but I was able to overcome those obstacles and then to have that happening and I thought this was my call and I thought it's gonna be the Floyd Mayweather of MMA man well you know sometimes when you come from a background where you have a lot of losses and a lot of bad things have happened but then all the sudden great things are happened and you're moving forward you got progress setbacks or sometimes even more devastating because you're thinking about going back to the way things used to be or the way maybe your parents lived or the way other people you know lived and when you see that life you know like fuck this I can't believe I lost yeah because you had anticipated that you were just gonna keep moving forward yeah so when it does happen sometimes it's more devastating than someone who doesn't have high aspirations and isn't on a roll you know sometimes when you're on a roll like a real roll and you lose it's like the worst thing that can happen yeah because you think fuck I thought everything had changed I thought I'd read just reshaped my future yeah yeah hundred percent right and I thought I thought I was on the cusp of really changing my family's life this is before things really got crazy with like the the divorce and my my dad my dad came out of jail 2014 in October and from there just been a shitstorm like damn calling the cops on each other and getting order orders of protection I had my brothers even like writing like you know Jamal the guy on juicy Aris smokes male or the guy who made up that fake thing like he got he got smaller yeah with the with the hanging thing and say like people jumped in and whatever so that guy they would put like his like draw him on my on my door like on a picture and post it on my door whenever I would leave for fights or leave their training I'll come home me and my brothers were bumping heads and it was like my dad and like his side of my not my mom's kids like the other side like the other half it was like them against like me because I it was such a with you they were fucking me in the house and I was like dude I don't understand how you guys see one person like really really trying to do something push for like to be successful or something and you guys just want to tear it down I mean our relationship is so much better now so let me make sure I say that but back then it was so toxic man and I was dealing with that at a point eventually I just get the fuck out of the house but my girlfriend was there she was there for from all that chaos and shit so when she was like being the Negative Nancy and I felt like you know this is just so so much burden going on in my life and now you're adding to it by stressing me the fuck out I was like dude I just I just rather just be alone you know and just be a fucking bachelor with a bachelors like this is the way life was supposed play outs like I guess this is what happened like I thought she's like showed her true colors but I knew deep down she just cared about me and she just wanted me to do the right thing and she didn't know how to handle a boyfriend being in the spotlight you know I'm pretty sure you've probably had your fair share of like battles coming up like it's challenging and for the for the male the person not even a male guy or female whoever is in the spotlight being able to handle that and do the right thing in certain situations could be very very tough sometimes you know and I think a person in your position to where you're so close to a shot that Idol there's so many things that could go wrong that could fuck you up or go right and could elevate you and it's a delicate balancing act with personal life economics your health training trainers training partners like everything has to kind of be in place if you're eventually gonna make that next step and and gain the title it's like yeah there's that weird and there's a lot of stress involved with something like that well you are managing all these things and so any problem that you might have in your relationship goes sour that fucks everything up because then the whole system is all wacky if the system is smooth like you and your girl get along good you and your training partners get along good everything's good we're all positive moving in the right direction you have less ripples in the water we're good we're good we're good and then that good or bad can have a significant impact on your future right now yeah no I agree 100% it's uh it's bitch it's just been a really crazy roller coaster like you know and like even going on in that binge I that's when I had the injury I remember trying to spars like you know what I looked at my life I was like - I just been partying since - my loss it was it was in May 29th or 27th Memorial Day weekend on a Sunday and ever since then I take a pride drank like almost every single fucking day for how many months all the way to July ha when I had when I had this the surgery and no one really knows me and I was like I was in a bad way like mentally and to be able to pull myself back together was it was tough man and uh I'm just happy I was able to do it but then I remember I came back I was like you know what let's get out let's get our shit together I think I think was maybe a lure somebody else had a fight coming up and that was like kind of like the catalyst for me to have the newfound motivation to get back and then I come back and I tried spar and I popped my I popped my bicep tendon because I'm just I'm just on this bingeing drink I'm just going nuts it bodies probably we dehydrated yeah and I go when I throw a long check hook which I always do I don't know if you've seen in the fights when when I step back and I always counter with the opposite hand and I hate guys on my own that transition going backwards and that's all I did connected flush pop and then from there it was another setback and I was like how many wants to take for that to rehab three I didn't I didn't feel comfortable taking a fight till probably like the third month and then I was like I write lists I didn't fight for the rest of the 2016 so I didn't fight again until I fought a Sun sound January what do you do during that time when you have a giant gap like that were you're not making any money I went back to teaching for a little bit I was coaching the wrestling team and I was coaching at the high school program at Baldwin high school doing that and it was cool but you know you're not making any real money so to speak because it's not like a real full-time job so I had figured I had to figure things out real quick and that's what I always thank myself for not being like when these guys who makes the money just going these spending sprees and just blow their money like people see me like traveling after every fight which I do enjoy but I'm smart about it I always try to do it on like the UFC's dime I try to be a guest fight for every single event I enjoy these things it's not it's not a burden for me to go out and sign pictures to get a free flight to go to Liverpool and just extend my trip and have everything UFC they just let you do that if you want to go what you ask if they have room to pay for it and I went to Poland doing that oh that's bad yeah so I take advantage of these things you know how long do you go for ah it depends I was in London for seven days but I went is that whole trip was two weeks so I started in London I had my grandma's dildos out there and some of my cousins and uncles so I went out there visited them hung out we got shit-faced and then uh we went to Liverpool watch the fight Wonder Boy versus a dare until all right crazy fight and then um the last three days I saw a Kavanagh I actually have a video on my phone I don't know it might not be on my phone might be on my laptop but I have a video of him and I grappling drunk in the lobby of the hotel in Liverpool after the fights and I tell them I was coming out to uh I tell them I was coming out to Ireland and I was like they are my introduction to him and now we became like pretty cool ever since and then I went out to Ireland to go train I got to work with bracket owner James Gallaher for a little bit and get some work in and toured the island a little bit so that was fun but then I went to Poland so I've done a lot of these trips and even Corning oka Sasaki when he fought in Singapore I extended my trip and I went to Bali right after because I have some long island friends and I stayed out there for a week that's an amazing place that's a place I want to go to Feliz Bali like because I almost went there last summer we decided to go to Thailand instead I have you surfed before no it's a it's a it's a great place for surfing - are not a 30 feet long five thousand pounds Wow what yeah we dislike jaws is really dislike jaws is really the biggest shark ever right it's gotta be what it when did this get sauce someone said to me yes I just remember watching on my phone you just like said it and popped right in my head what's the biggest shark ever just like the Shaq of human beings I've been exaggerating those numbers but that's what it says here what is this from Twitter someone or Twitter Martha's Vineyard jaws does exist watch how big this fucking thing is okay there's the tail right here Martha's Vineyard isn't that where it was yeah oh my god dude it's so big oh my god Wow oh my god oh my god that is so big do you not just fuck what people heard that big it's hard perspective why that's why I like those numbers could be slightly yeah listen that that 25 to 30 feet 5,000 pounds how do you know who's saying this who's posting this what is this Gregory long what does he do I don't know what do you do Gregory what is this what is his actual credentials he doesn't seem like to be a shark guy but it says Wednesday wisdom how's that wisdom Craig are you talking about great he's a guy he's just a guy Greg Greg's drunk at work that might have just been fifteen feet it might be a regular grave fucking giant might not have been really I wouldn't Hawaii that the ditch monitor right they have a chip and it's called like deep blue or big blue or something something like that yeah and that's the biggest one they know of correct yeah but I thought that was significantly smaller like 20 feet bunch of websites ran the story oh but we're user Gregory long posted a video but there's no perspective though it's it's there's not a boat that you can look at we can say oh this is a 15-foot boat look at it's 10 feet longer than the boat yeah come on Greg stop being drunk at work either way fuck sharks man yeah but you I think you would enjoy it because it sure I love it there's training there too my guy Anthony Leone Donnie Donnie Karl Klaus and his brother Andrew Leone different Long Island but they've just been moving hopping around to different places and they set up a gym and they started it in Thailand I guess they had like a little falling-out and he told me like they tried like they threatened to kill him or or like threatened to tell him like you can't leave like in a way where I was like threatening like you you're not leaving this place but they left they got out of there and I guess in Bali they have like a law where you Outsiders foreigners can't buy property unless there's like an Indonesian like leasing it to you or like joint partners or something like that huh something interesting like that which I thought was pretty cool cuz they have some you can live in a very nice place to better a very nice place with a pool with a garage get a scooter for like $2,000 for the year which is like what's insane insane a year for like yes for you I asked the guy Donny how much he paid I don't want to misquote him but I want to say he had to pay twenty five hundred for the year or for two years something like that why I was like yo bro I could come here right now live like a fucking cake is black parents everybody I see you laters well I think it's really attractive these young guys that go to Thailand and do their camps out there well not just young guy this isn't Valentina Shevchenko didn't she do a lot of her training down in Thailand to take him which I was the thing she did yeah it was either that or put a Phuket top team I forget which one but I'm in aka my Mike Swick he's got aka Thailand there's so many places down there where guys going train and you see like a great result to like Khalil Roundtree he went down there and came back a fucking assassin that was a fun episode you guys had what he's talking about his training yeah yeah yeah I was great yeah but they say all these destination gyms are popping up but that's what they have over there in Bali they call Bali MMA but it's been they got the food like right on site so you don't you don't need anything you go there there's the showers there's the the food shop and it's all healthy stuff too which is pretty sick what's going on Jeremy people think that it most likely was a basking shark which is an average size of 11,000 pounds I think it's a basking shark because it's because of the size of it but it didn't look to be a great white thing there were a lot of great white sightings in that area over that weekend so fuck oh yeah so who knows yeah yeah man sharks some fuck sharks so basking sharks get that big they get giant mouth they're not dangerous they got a weird face they suck in krill and stuff like oh look at the inside it's all bones no yeah it looks like a tube that kind of looks like the same but could be don't have that why that looks I know it didn't but that might be a wide ass mouth while it's open right maybe if the mouth is closed hey Greg do you know what the fuck you're saying let me see that looks different the mainland more time yes the girls would be on goddamn great wine I don't know shirt that might really be a 25 foot shark dude that looked really show that again sorry for calling you drunk Greg look at that whoa imagine being in the kayak that's I'm surprised those things they don't fuck with people man like you see a ship you just don't just start charging into Italy I'm gonna fucking knock there's nothing get a snack little snacky poo I'm I saw the episode like the little snippet that Dana White in a message I was put out I was like get that fuck out if you really go into the waters with sharks get I could never I could go surfing but never leave Dean did it like he seems I'm supposed to be spotted in this deep it's Sarah Jones in there too everybody jumped in there did you talk to Matt about it no I just saw the snippet as I've been out here so fight and it looks like there was like blood in the water too like they threw pieces of meat in the water that's Matt jumping in oh yeah look at this fucker yeah see there's the pieces of meat in the water and they're all my god they were counting like 1 2 3 fuck everything about that yeah everything about that could never I could never do that shit it's just a dumb way to die Dana White's looking for a fight how did Matt Serra die ah he's fucking this YouTube show it fucked up I don't know White's looking for a fight yeah why would they do that look at that yelling screaming the Tina's laughing right isn't funny Dana White's worth like a half a billion dollars and he still gets his kicks doing silly shit like this yeah I mean that show was a fun show because Dana's not doing that for money not by any stretch of the imagination he's doing that to have a good time yeah I mean I love that I love that aspect of what he does like Deena is a fucking legitimate wild man yeah I used to hang out with him I wouldn't I love him maybe if I win the bug I get hangout privileges and next time I'm hanging out with him I'll invite you yeah Dana he's crazy he's a he's the perfect dude I always say this when I you know I do the the announcement at the weigh-ins when Dana comes onstage I always say without him none of this would be possible because it wouldn't yeah you needed a wild man to take control of this fucking crazy sport because most people would want to tone it down or change things about it or yeah I mean he's and the only reason why I did commentary ever is cuz he asked me to do it I never wanted to do commentary that wasn't my idea that's Dana White's idea I'll tell you fucking what fucking killed it I got lucky that I got a chance in the early days when no one was watching to learn to work and get better at it yes I wasn't that good in the beginning it so it takes a while to figure out how to do it yeah but you doing fit fact before that I was doing Fear Factor and when I was doing Fear Factor I that's when Zuffa had just purchased the UFC yeah so I came to watch when Tito Ortiz fought Vladimir Matyushenko and I went to some of the earlier fights like when Matt Hughes fought Sakurai I was in the audience and everything and Dana and I used to have conversations about fights and I would say hey you know you should check out these guys and this guy in Japan check out this Russian dude and and we were just talking about fights and I was just I would always be asking questions and what do you guys got coming up next and I thought I was exciting because the sport was trying to take off and they were risking all this money like I was there hanging out with them as a friend when the pay-per-view cut short because they had a window of time for pay-per-view when Tito Ortiz flat valve radomir my ischenko right after September 11th so it was this big patriotic thing and everybody felt terrible like this is right after 9/11 Tito comes out with the American flag and it was this big deal and then the pay-per-view the time stopped in the middle of the fight and they just the screen went black and everybody wanted their money back so they lost a shit ton of money and I was hanging out with them as you know just a friend when all this was happening and then somewhere around I think it was UFC 37 and a half Dana talked me into doing commentary because they were doing it was in promotion with Fox Sports in the best damn sports show remember that show best damn sports show period they were helping promote it and so all that stuff happened together and then they talked me and Dana talked me into doing commentary and I did it ever since yeah so when did you actually meet him like met him in like 2000 right when they bought it like 2001 what happened was they bought the UFC then they started putting on these events in Vegas and you know Eddie Bravo and I we had always said what this sport needs is some crazy billionaire who loves a sport who just dumps a bunch of money and to make it to make it big because when I first started doing commentary was 97 it was when it was presumed dead when Bob Meyerowitz owned it and Bob hired me and Campbell McLaren and I was just doing the post-fight interviews I did interview guys you know after the fight was over and then I quit I did it for like maybe two years but it was just too much work it was actually costing me money it wasn't there's not a lot of money in interviewing fighters you know and it wasn't money in the sport back then and I just did it because I loved it but it got to a point where like if I took a weekend off to do that versus do comedy it would cost me like a few thousand dollars I was like I can't do this anymore and so I quit and then when I got Fear Factor I wound up going to one of their Vegas events because the UFC just bought this and they were giving out free tickets to celebrities and so that's how Dina and I met yeah and then we just started talking about fights and he talked me into doing it that's crazy it's crazy I never never in my wildest dreams thought it would ever be a sports commentator yeah you know no desire to do it whatsoever and I remember early on someone I remember who it was was telling Dana like hey he's got to stop talking about weed and his exact words were I don't give a fuck why he talks about as long as he talks about the fights yeah I mean no one else would say that like as a CEO or a president of a giant billion-dollar organization ya know it takes a wild man he's different man giving up on the TV I have it on my computer on it's about to start here hey you got it out here that's cuz Oh Rick Cooper there we go he beat up his cousin Oh ray Cooper's about to fight John Howard he beat his cousin up he beat whose cousin oh he fought his cousin his last one hey Cooper dude yeah oh my god the other Hawaiian shields he fucked up Jake Shields twice in a row that's one of the weird things about that organization are you doing this through your computer are you doing it Oh clever boy he fought he fought his cousin call those dudes oh no going through my computer uh-huh so I don't no one really talked about that why is that thing in the middle of it Jane I'm trying to switch the input oh he's uh you know they're their thing is weird the way they do it is weird the way the PFL does it yet like you have to fight the playoff to get into that to get into the playoffs this should be wild as fuck cuz John Howard can crash he hits like a fucking he crackles they both crack and John has fought a lot of high-level dudes sitting on the bottom line that guy he got his arm ripped off in a crash over the weekend yeah just got started in the crash it was his contract right what the fuck unless they can rebuild them like Steve Austin the billion dollar as a defensive tackle said offensive guys know they can't you can't have one arm well the one guys playing with know if like two fingers Jason a uh yeah fireworks accident a couple years ago what you hear about that he was like gigantic to contract but he's still been FL he's done now yeah yeah yeah he's done no he got off now like as of this season I think damn my boxing coach in Boston has finger bitten off in a street fight and he replaced it with his second toe not the big toe but the second one and they had it curled permanently so he could always throw right hooks that ref can Jeff Campbell I was like what the fuck is these big guys on his face that's they're gonna show up on the screen to like striking speed and how much they move around the ring Ray Cooper moving in quick boom big kick taking down ray Cooper is also state champion wrestler from Hawaii yeah I heard this his ass off hey I was just found it weird that he fought his cousin I guess they had like a they he was mad that his cousin accepted that to be in the tournament knowing that he was in the tournament first Wow probably not the best idea yeah but then it's so goddamn hard he has hardwood you fight your cousin no well I fought my cousin when I was seven we got in a fight King Kong vs. Godzilla I was a I was a King Kong man my cousin's my brothers used to beat my fucking ass we used to beat each other's asses though they would jump me they would jump me really yeah we jump each other though how many tough guys from a family with their brothers beat their ass probably a lot but a lot the numbers got to be through the roof yeah think about it right like tough guys with brothers first of all Matt Hughes and his brother Mark whoa beautiful takedown oh he hit him with a nice left hook there that was a clean left hook in the transition the Millers Dan Miller and Jim Miller the other Miller's Cole Miller and Micah Miller how many fucking animals have brothers and they fight with their brother yeah yeah it's like a lot oh shit I don't very Cooper man in a Big Show with a big left hook oh my goodness Joe that was we were just saying that man John Howard can fuck in crack down
