what we're sneaking the sin on people they didn't even know I just tweeted it just now yeah we're sneaking it in Duncan's the best way to do it you think so sure so tip that way for for people that didn't expect it and then just like going through their little computer and the Twitter comes up that's to squeeze right there and he's got a solo hunter shirt on yes by the way don't get Duncan has gone gangster poser I'm a poser hunter I'm wearing a camo hat and a hunting shirt and I keep it honey once I've been hunting more than well I've been running a few times and I this is a controversial statement I think fishing is a form of hunting so it's hunting for aliens they don't even breathe our air I know they're weird they breathe air are the water yeah you know you got it we just went fishing we had those popping corks where you got to make the sound of a fish eating so that it's truly trying to communicate with an alien because they hear that oh yeah like a like a lure of a surface yeah yeah a popper SAP pop yeah it sounds like when they're great grabbing bugs on the surface so you're communicating to them you're making their noises and then wrenching them out of their dimension and holding them and taking a picture with them because the ones we cowards use someone throwing them back in yeah I was with Ari and we went on the salmon run we caught some salmon and the Aska and it was one of the most bizarre experiences ever because you know that these animals they're gonna die essentially yeah they're swimming there so they can fuck and then die yeah and you're you know you're taking part of it and they're all over the place and they were giant like we caught some like 30 pound 40 pound salmon it was so fun I love salmon man that's it those are the that's the worst marathon of all time which is you you are you fucking the beginning of it right that's what it is you're fucking at the beginning and then you're just running don't fuck they never fuck they just come on eggs so you're just good right you're going upstream to jerk-off jerking off all the way up while being ripped out of your universe by bears and you Birds fucking Raptors are coming down snatch do you imagine the last thing you hear is like the whoosh of air and slobbering sound of a bear eating just hearing your body crunch yeah you flippin up this river trying to go up this little embankment just trying to get up this little waterfall yeah just doing your best flopping around and you get caught in midair by a monster wild dog that weighs like 2,000 pounds I bet there's salmon I bet there's like inspirational salmon speakers who has everyone's running they're like we can do it you can do it just believe in yourself and we'll get to the top of the stream where there's heaven no it's a mad genetic - that's all it is just a mad dash of genes trying to get through this weird pipeline where these giant bears live they're the biggest bears in the world by the way the biggest bears in the world and as far as like brown bears it's between Kodiak bears and polar bears polar bears eat like seals and shit yes but the brown bears the biggest brown bears in the world and live all near the salmon rivers because they just fatten up oh yeah that's I love watching bears that seems like a great incarnation when you think of the incarnations to get a bear as one of the good ones especially one of those fat ass salmon bears they just lay around they fight each other they're always dirty and covered in flies but they don't care I would say yes except they're almost a hundred percent cannibals I mean who are we to judge maybe it's maybe they're it's delicious to eat another bear seals by the way I know you probably saw this but it does need to be mentioned it just hit the internet you've seen the seals raping the Penguins right I heard about it I didn't watch you need to watch it man I can't watch it online because it'll fucking get us pulled from YouTube that's like a statement now get us pulled from YouTube so you can play it up there that's not online what if it's on YouTube we're gonna try the new thing this is so nice man yeah we have some new setup that we just started look at that Sam Kinison louder than hell what to watch you could watch on YouTube now that's incredibly nig my greatest hit yeah so what's going on is that seals are sexually harassing and raping penguins this says no this is not this is that not harassing this is rape I didn't see any why is that seals are pinching their asses or like hey sweetie no they're they're raping them you got it listen like if you saying sexually harassing is an interest attempted rape it's just they weren't successful because it's not like they're communicating so how else can be the they could be sexually harassing harassing is like I think that's putting way too much intelligence on these seals well once once someone's trying to rape you that's assault all right sexual assault at the very least so even if you don't fuck you that sexual assault these aren't these seals aren't eating on the Penguins man there's for like texting them too much well you got to see this man look at that office this is crazy this fucking poor penguin get the other big would be just listening to this this poor penguin just sits on the seal and starts trying to fuck it it's awful it's awful it's no there's no seal brother sits on the penguin all the other penguins are kind of watching in this embarrassed sad way cuz they could be next they can't do anything about it and this seal is just holding this penguin down look at it trying to peck at him and is that Paul Simon playing - this is so fucked up man this is so fucked up and this is like you know this is like when monkeys figured out how to use tools there's no going back man once these seals they've been living with these penguins for so long horny not knowing what to do and that seal is the equivalent of Tesla seals because he figured now here's the big question when it comes to animals we we're attaching our idea of what it would be like to be fucked by that seal you know this humiliation the you know the social ostracization yes the word ostracization what where the the horror the trauma yeah of all that but do they register those things the way we interpret them like we're interpreting them in sort of a social contract construct right yeah we're interpreting if that was us that was me and I was on that beach and it was a grizzly on top of me raping me is essentially the physical equivalent right your friends kind of marching by I would be super upset your friends just stand there watching you get fucked by this grizzly bear I would be really upset hang in there Joe but I mean once they want this what's the seal that's that penguin up he's probably like the pen was just like psyched to be up like I don't I he probably just happy lived you know I I bet they don't really feel embarrassed I bet they're just like they don't want to get fucked but they deal with it we don't know man it's one of the great mysteries what do you think I mean the it probably doesn't even care if it's a male or a female penguin it's like fuck you you're all girls to me you know it's goddamn giant see a warm and oily that's what needs we attach all these ideas to animals we would love to do that and one of the big ones we attach to animals is like our own interpretations of what something means our own versions of it well yeah and it all goes back to the idea that the big question is is our brains the things producing our sense of awareness and self or is there some other disembodied awareness that sort of goes through organic matter when it has the right kind of nervous system and creates the sense of self but if you believe in the mechanical idea the materialist view that's just a you know bio computer then the Penguins experience is probably just a very something is hot and warm pushing it down it wants to get away and when it gets away it's not like waking up at night screaming it probably will avoid seals even better it's like the most kinky penguin of all time yeah maybe he's just playing hard-to-get Oh like something wrong my flipper oh it's gonna fuck me again you asshole he gets really into it he just like starts leaving himself by the shore falls asleep by the shore hope and seal finds him he falls in love with the seal it turns out that that's what he wanted all the long you know he always thought he was a top but what he was just a really strong bottom he just needed a seal to show him the way it's like that terrible intent that website stop Prison Rape gorg not fun terrible website man yeah that's the one where it's got that poem the ninth one the ninth one who raped me yeah you know how much that's trolling you know you know I'm saying who is that seems like that's performed at the battle the the roast battle I have a CD in my car the the singer find out who it is find out who it is the guy who played that song that awesome song at the roast battle yeah find out what that is he was a fucking hilarious anyway his song that he played at the roast battle which was unbelievably funny was based on a guy falling in love with I don't anyone I shouldn't probably tell the premise I probably probably stop right there it's just really funny and but it's obviously fiction total fiction right whereas we were reading the Prison Rape thing we're assuming these are actual stories it could very well be somebody that's fucking around but it's it's like that South Park I don't know I think it just came out the one with the the South Park kids try to get their parents to stop watching what they call murder porn which is like Forensic Files and stuff you know like you lay in bed no one is watching Forensic Files because they're like I really want to gather more information about this case to see if I can solve it people aren't watching Nancy Grace because they're like I'm gonna help find this missing child people are watching these shows because they're getting off in a deep visceral way at other people's suffering and that website sting so that it's that kind of like just one table that's one option the other option is feeding paranoia right right like if you go over grandma's house and she's constantly has you know those wanted shows on and when the guys come hold on hold on Shh she shushes everybody trying to get a look at the screen trying to memorize this dude's face you know if I ever see him boy I'm gonna call that guy ya wanted he's wanted yeah I don't know man I think like whenever I watched Forensic Files it's just there's this kind of like a terrible pleasure that comes from realizing that this world is like that and I'm safe in this nice hotel you watch it you get this kind of like wow that's fucking crazy it's like that it's like that you showed what he calls shoten freud or whatever it's like that for whatever reason human beings and the deepest part of themselves if you're really honest with yourself when you watch some awful thing on the news it's not like your heart explodes initially with all this sweet compassion you're like what the fuck Wow look at that explosion that's intense but it's not like you're weeping it's not like tears are falling out of your eyes you're just sort of in awe and a weirdly excited way about shit blowing up carlins got a great joke about it but it's this is like a bell curve a shove there there's a bell curve created where when something close to you is suffering like if your honor if you see an animal that's sick or if you're something awful happened around you you would be like fuck that's awful and try to help you wouldn't be like this is weird and kind of cool but somehow this bell curve happens where if that very same thing is happening outside of a certain proximity to where you're at outside your neighborhood usually in another country it goes from being this kind of morning horror to a weird kind of creepy enjoyment and that's what the news is making money on because if people watch the news and felt terrible when they watch disaster nobody would watch the news it wouldn't make any money just people like to sit and stare into the apocalypse because it's entertaining to entertain apocalypse there's definitely something to that for sure there's definitely some draw a part of it where we get this weird charge about watching inevitable destruction yeah just not ours yeah just not ours don't want that but when you see it whenever it's somebody else you kind of feel like you dodged a bullet I mean it's like it's a it's a terrible thing but it is true people don't want to watch stuff that makes him sad like the Humane Society commercial you know the thing that pops on when the eyes of the angel were in the arms of the angel saw you you can barely watch that because it's so terribly sad people don't want that but somehow the anesthetized war reporting the anesthetized or the sort of like foamed down aerial shots of a fucking drone strike with that kind of weird flash of smoke you see the shapes oh those are those are trucks with people in them but you don't see that like smoldering twitching human corpse or the guy limping away with his femur jutting out as he's like hit one of his eyeballs is out and he's thinking about his wife and he's wondering if he's ever gonna see her again you don't see that you just see this like gone and only how you see it like the shade that's nothing like a shade that you would ever see in real life you've seen that weird gray greenish like you know I mean that when you the representatives they're all heat signatures so all the people are just sort of white yeah and then they're like it's the weirdest most abstract thing if you think about like how advanced our ability to film things is in 2014 why does all the footage in this like weird black and white you know radar looking fucking footage like you don't really see video of those exact same things in HD I don't know if it's see because you can't get it or because they're doing it at night I mean I don't I don't know well I think probably they don't want people to be like hey this is just terrible let's stop that like when they show the drone strikes imagine if they did start playing Sarah McLaughlin or something they don't do that the military doesn't put that kind of music to their drone strikes I feel when you what when you smash a bug like if you smash a bug in your house if I smash a bug in my house I feel there's more of a sadness when I my god I'm sorry but you're a roach I gotta take you out my friend you have to go into the next incarnation now and I kill it sometimes I take them outside I feel more intense about that then when they show humans being exploded because they do it in such a quick packaged sweet way that we're all numbed out to it we're all numbed out to the fact that those fucking explosions that are evaporating people are a hundred percent being funded by the money that is siphoned off of us every time we buy lattes or whenever we sell our life energy to other people that is being converted by some invisible power into human evaporating devices we know that that doesn't like occur to us at all it's just like yeah well it's all right oh look they fight for freedom so that we can have freedom over here it's true it's true but the problem is some of them do man some of them and in the real heroes site they go over there with real good intentions and there's it's also it's not as simple as black and white no because there's a real issue with all sorts of spots in the world with this human conflict it's not like if we weren't involved in Afghanistan all the shit that's going on in Africa wouldn't be going on right now but it's not like any of the conflicts that exists all over the world the conflict between North Korea and South Korea like there's everywhere you look the Russians are invading Ukraine there's everywhere you look people are fucking with people everywhere you look it's been going like that since the beginning of time yeah so it's idea that like if we weren't involved it wouldn't exist I don't know I don't know about that you know I mean it would be nice if everybody was Canada that's what right if everybody was Canada we wouldn't have to worry about shit everybody would just chill the fuck out Canadians are pussies but they're nice they're nice and I think smart they're smart as shit I think one of the problems one of the one of the things that's going on with Canada is that Canada doesn't have this history of trying to conquer the world in all this history of like being involved like if you get involved in a conflict then you're involved in reverberations of the conflict the rebound from the conflict the post-conflict rehabilitation of the area you're involved in a bunch of shit back and forth back and forth it takes a long time to not get to not be financially and socially and culturally entwined in that conference crazy people never think about that no once you get into and in any sort of conflict you set a whole process in motion that's nuts yeah not just in war and life general yeah whenever you get in a conflict with somebody these terrible it's like it's like when your fucking ear buds get tangled yeah you guys my resolving conflict feels so good yeah realize we both just got untangled from some stupidity that didn't have to be there in the first place yeah but when your whole fucking nation has been doing that for 200 years man it's it's hard you know in noble wars you know what getting involved in World War 2 and trying to stop the Nazi Empire which was legitimately and like an evil empire run by a madman and if you really want to think about how crazy war was in the 1940s you have to take into consideration that this was for everyone knew that they were working towards some ultimate weapon okay everyone knew this everyone knew this was one of the first wars ever that was fought with airplanes boardwalk one world war two they figured out they could fly over two places and start bombing them so people on other continents were at war with people I mean it was some high scale shit really for the first time in human history right because before that is like everybody had to come over on a boat it took fucking forever get here when they got here they got scurvy you fucking pick them off at the beach it's like it's not a big deal oh we brought our cannon so good luck getting to the shore fucking sink you before even get close to us we got cannons over here too stupid right and you gotta take your boat and go far where the cannons can't shoot you I mean it was a really short place a short distance warfare yeah then all of a sudden it becomes the 1900s and people could fly fucking planes yeah and they're just flying and dropping bombs not just dropping bombs but dropping a fucking nuclear bomb on to cities so they're just saying fuck military fuck military no we're at or war what it war war means is not like we shoot your plans and you shoot our plans no we're just gonna drop an Annihilator of a bomb a bomb that doesn't give a fuck who it hits we're not thinking about collateral damage we know we're gonna kill a hundred thousand women and children at least yeah and we're willing to do that we're willing to go think press that button to stop this bullshit yeah whoa yeah that was a big leap in the direction of the apocalypse they're terrifying that's a timer you know man I was just talking to Matt Staggs not two hours ago because I was trying to get him to explain the the fuck is that called the Fermi paradox you know the idea that if so there's to equip there's the Drake Equation in the Fermi paradox the Drake Equation is the equation that a bunch of people at SETI came up with which is like these are the components we would need for there to be extraterrestrial life in the universe let's gather all this shit up and we can get an idea of the you know some random number of where this could be it's kind of a shitty equation or because there's it's based on one sample which is us but still it's an idea of like how many civilizations are there out there and I can't remember which guy it was one of these guys said he I think Drake said he and this is before Kepler discovered all these other planets in the Goldilocks zone this is before that he said ten thousand civilizations equivalent to ours and then that gave birth to the Fermi paradox which is wait if there's 10,000 civilizations just in our I think in the Milky Way then that must mean an infinite universe there's that you know exponentially more why haven't we seen them yet and so there's all these reasons of why maybe civilizations don't make it into turning into Canada which would be a class to civilization and that is because like as I'm sure you've all talked about before we blow it would blow our fucking asses up and that was when that's when the clock started taking right there when humans started dropping nuclear bombs on other people that's the beginning of that ticking clock that sets this terrible truth in motion which is that here we have invented these devices of absolute destruction and we are believing that our civilization our society is going to last long enough to keep these things in our hands and not in other people's hands and so in Pakistan India North Korea Russia all these tumultuous areas of these devices that evaporate human beings in masse and clearly if you look at the world right now you could see with these masked fundamentalist Psychopaths but heading people and the you know what just happened in fucking Jerusalem with a hatchet loonie coming in and just hacking up people while they're praying and then that'll be followed by an insane attack on them you see we are existing in such a tumultuous civilization that there is a very high probability that nukes are going to get out into the world and that it could shut the civilization down the implication being this happens in all developing civilizations moving from type 1 or class 1 to 2 which is what we're doing right now and that's why we should be putting a fuckload more energy into exploring just how important are all these various cultures everyone's adhering to that's making them feel like it's ok to and evaporate other people how important is a culture that says it's ok to kill these people because they're of a different religion or they live in another country or wherever like this is a mental disease man we are already Canada we're Canada filled with a bunch of different colored people who have mental contaminants in their brain that makes them at believe in various version of ism is an invisible megalomaniacal doom God you know and so that's creating all this problem that's the big frustration man here's devil's advocate though of course yes devil's advocate is just because we are involved in all these conflicts all throughout the world and just because you know they definitely done some shit that most people would agree would be horrific yeah most people most reasonable Peter if there was no military if we had no involvement whatsoever we could just pull out and erase all of our contacts with anyone all over the world would we really trust that some new crazy fuck wouldn't rise to some extreme Kim Jong ill type of power Yeah right like if we're like suddenly like okay no more military everybody go home melting this we're gonna turn all of the guns and all the military bases and utopian civilizations or human beings can have access to infinite marijuana and flow tanks like what you write and that happens just in the United States meanwhile I mean all these people man that to their little butthurt to put it lightly now you guys have your super telescopes and your utopian civilizations and your beautiful palatial gardens that used to be military structures but remember the time you accidentally killed my entire family and everyone I know because you drop the bomb in the wrong place cuz I do I just can't seem to forget it guys I can't seem to forget it and there's a lot of people that feel like that and so now we've created this terrible terrible pendulum a chain reaction this bouncing back and forth of war there's the essence of the problem Israel and Palestine how the fuck you just hacked up my grandfather motherfucker he was praying and you fucked to a you psychotic fundamentalist motherfuckers came and hacked up my grandfather and my grandmother while they were praying right after my wedding you just did that to the rest of my life I'm not gonna forget about that motherfucker and over there like oh oh that makes you sad how about you the time you guys devastated my entire city I just as I sell fruit that's my job I sell fruit you guys turned my fucking family in a hamburger meat so I'm not forgetting back and forth back and forth infinite war infinite war so the the question is how do we fix that my question well yeah but if I agree it seemed like the only way well it seems the here's the scary prob man this is the this is the scary shit that makes a lot of people's that will make a lot of like can make if your conspiracy theorist for some reason that scares people but if you do look at that it's obviously the israel-palestine thing I don't see how that's gonna fix itself and if you read zealot by Reza Aslan which you fucking should because you would love it that fucking conf that place is just a that place is like been having flare-ups for like thousands of years just these tear that's the part of the human biomass that has got some really really sensitive hemorrhoids man and one slight little friction the wrong way and that shit flares up with war all the time well we've talked about this before that's the cradle of civilization yeah I think they're the Townies of the world those are the people that never when civilization evolved in you know Mesopotamia and Sudan Iraq and sumaré and all that that whole area is like the oldest stuff that we know of really like the written language and mathematics and all that shit they called Jerusalem the Romans called Jerusalem a hole in the corner that's what they called it because they just thought it was this isn't this great book - so good but they you know yeah that's what they thought of them - and they invaded them and they thought it was like quaint what the what was called the Jewish cult which is that the Jews it's so good man the description of the temple you know the where the Wailing Wall is now that got destroyed it's so beautiful describing how that religion worked and the way it is so good articulating the strangeness of it which is that you have this structure with all these levels that you are different people are allowed access into so like you've got like this outer area which anyone can be at and that's where everyone sells shit right and that's where the money changers are because if you were going to buy animal sacrifices in the temple you could only do it with the Jewish money shekels you couldn't do it with any other currency so you had to change money there to buy whatever animal it was that you're going to sacrifice and you'd give that money to the priests who had purchased their position from the Romans and so you would give that money to the priests and then the priests that you would be able to if you would be able to get into certain areas but there was one area the holiest of Holies where once a year a priest is allowed into this place with a rope tied around his body in case God strikes him down they could pull his body out of the holiest of Holies an idea was that the Spirit of God on earth was just blasting out of there like some kind of nuclear reactor of spiritual energy and so that place was constantly constantly being invaded constantly being overthrown constantly improving fucking problems man always having problems and Jesus this book it's called zealot and it's about the historic Jesus and usually that's pretty boring to me but this is real Jesus was one of so many people back then who was saying it was the end of the world and he wasn't saying it was the end of the world because he literally thought as the end of the world they just that couldn't accept the fact that they worship the greatest God on earth and that the Romans had invaded so therefore the answer was this must be the apocalypse the world must be ending so it's just this incredible place man and it's fucking always in that state of turb it's out of balance the place is out of fucking balance you know it's always this they're always getting invaded and it seems like I mean if you think about countries that are as far removed from war as like Norway yes Iceland yes Greenland people live in Greenland hmm they should it sounds like a beautiful place robbing out really green I think it's getting greener which is global warming I think California that's gonna be an amazing Hawaii I think it's called white land right now yeah well you know there's they found a map of Greenland from like the 1500s or some shit where we didn't even know that Green was a continent apparent 1800s like the Western Western civilization but they found this crazy map and believe it was Greenland am I right or was it Antarctica it was one of those but they found this really ancient map that seems to suggest that there was some people from a long time ago that knew a lot more about making maps and about where continents were and then maybe the continents were different you know once we know about like you know we know about the Stone Age for like ten thousand years yeah or the the Ice Age rather we're like ten thousand years ago North America was like covered in ice well they think that it's possible that sometime before then people got good enough so they can make a map and then they sort of passed these maps down there's the map is this it it's what it comes up when I searched Greenland ancient map no it's um just it was like it was just of the continent and it was really unusual because the continent up until that point had been like covered in ice forget the story god damn it I hate when I have a half a fucking story in my head like that but it's something along those lines but point being when you when you talk about like Israel and Palestine and you talk about the Saudi Arabia and Iran that those ideas to Americans sometimes seem so abstract it seems like that shit is just over there they're like if that was your neighbor can you imagine if the dirt was closer and your neighbor was just fucking lighting your neighbor up with bombs yeah people are flying in with flying jets yeah man that don't even have people in them but you know this is the thing when I worked at a summer camp if a bunch of kids by the way every great story starts with when I went to this summer camp you know kids would get in these fucking fights man they get in these ridiculous fights and they begin like they've become like arch enemies it's amazing how much venom can spring up between you know you know two 12 year olds but they would become arch enemies and so one of the things that you would do after they've gotten in a fight is you make them sit together on a bench for two hours you just there's a bench you guys have to go sit on the bench together nobody's around them and inevitably over that course of two hours they usually will make up and they'll become best friends for the rest of the summer they'll talk and like they whatever the fuck the thing was it just naturally heals itself right so now God forgive me I'm I know that that is one of the most awful naive oversimplifications of a thing but eventually the people who aren't blowing each other up on a daily basis who are sharing a planet with the people who are blowing each other up on a daily basis and it's a planet where nuclear weapons exist and we're also deeply connected and getting more and more connected every single fucking day at what point does the planet say guys we got to put you on the fucking bench man we've got to like stop this war we just have to swin when does the civilization wake up and realize we are not Americans Canadians we're not we're not based on the landmass one where Earthlings or Earthlings and we're all living together sharing the same resources and somebody's got to recognize that we can't leave them longer that we play around with we're all different and that's great we're all different and we just are gonna celebrate our own cultures we're just gonna celebrate our own cultures into infinity and part of our culture's involves worshiping goddamn warmongering death gods that somehow make it seem okay for us to murder other people in the name of it eventually you gotta be like guys sorry we're not doing that game anymore well it drives me crazy when people start talking about religions as something to be respected you know like respecting other people's religions well there's a lot of shit in religion that you can't respect if you're a rational person there's a lot of shit like stoning for adultery yeah I mean if you're really if you're really advocating stone stoning people hitting them with rocks until they die for having sex with someone they want to have sex with yeah you're fucking crazy yeah you ever seen those videos I can't watch I'm getting links I'll never watch there's a father and his daughter and it was so awful and he was treating his daughter you know I mean it was it was sick it was crazy it was he he wouldn't talk to her wouldn't say that she was his daughter he wouldn't look at her he wouldn't wouldn't touch her she wanted to hold her hand he wouldn't hold his hand she wouldn't touch him or he wouldn't touch her rather I mean I'm getting flustered talking about it cuz it's hard to watch because you realize this is a father he's gonna kill his daughter with a rock because they both got trapped in some crazy ideology this is his baby this is his baby he's gonna kill his baby with a rock to show his love for an angry God that he's never yeah exactly exactly yeah no no no but how do you enforce it and how do you do I can't enforce anything with people you got to let people know what it really is it's not the Word of God there's no Word of God out there we what if there is a word of God it doesn't belong to one fucking group that's that's for goddamn sure the idea that God came down and talked to one fuckin group and his knowledge is the only true knowledge and this group only has anybody who tells you that is bullshit okay so let's just start there there's a shark there there's no God's gonna talk to everybody he's gonna talk to Chinese people he's gonna talk to black people everybody's gonna have a universal message and if it's not a universal message everybody needs to sit the fuck down and talk this through because we might be getting some mixed signals here we're not at war with each other we're just humans yeah we're just a bunch of humans yeah and this idea that you have to be at war because somebody wrote some shit down on animal skins or you have to be the chosen one or you have to be the people that have the truth you know why is the other you know religion saying this it's simple because we are the truth yeah I've fucking seen that man I've seen that in Islam videos I've seen that in Christian videos I've seen them say in Christian videos these are online things because we do the world the Lord the Bible is the only true work of the Lord and everybody would go crazy clap how do you know how the fuck do you know you don't know and it doesn't mean there's no God it doesn't mean there's no God it means that you don't know you're pretending you know because it makes you feel better and you're fucking with everybody else when you do that most people I know who are their most radical atheists our have been raised in those fundamentalist households and that I mean I consider that to be a form of child abuse which is it's a psychic child abuse where you get you get your will you get one plus one equals three for your entire life did I told you about the time where I was hanging out the Hari Krishna's right that I'm talking about that and one of the hard Krishna's when I was saying to the Hari Krishna you know the bhagavad-gita as it is is the Bhagavad Gita with these purports by Prabhupada the founder of the Hari Krishna's and there were some things in there Prabhupada said I just didn't agree with it didn't make sense to me didn't make sense so I said to me no I don't agree with this here and he goes we don't say that we don't agree with Prabhu pod we say that we don't understand what proper pod means it's not it's not that you have the ability to be logical enough to look at whatever the particular mythology that's getting diary at all over your fucking brain and be like now this is wrong it's that you're stupid or you're possessed by Satan you know demons have taken hold of you it's and so when you're a one of the most a erratically one of the most intelligent beings on earth which human beings are and you're having the shit thrown at you then the fundamental one fundamental component of being human being which is a part of you are like no that's wrong that gets subverted that gets subverted if that's not child abuse I don't know what is which is why a lot of people or so a lot of many radical radical angry atheist they should be angry you know and therefore that God that they are trumpeting that doesn't exist they should be trumpeting it they should be doing tap dances on its moldering grave and cheering and joy you know another problem with religion is that it's very regressive in nature not that it's not progressive and some of its ideas because like a lot of Christianity it sounds like really good advice if you want to live a happy life there's a lot of it but the stuff that's regressive in its nature it what it does is it basically goes against all the known laws of culture and awareness that we have ever been subjected to so our entire lives of reading books our entire lives of interacting with people on the internet interacting with people in real life experiencing films and experiencing art and experiencing all the different things that people have created and noticing that it's getting better and better and smarter and smarter all the time that science is getting more and more aware more and more capable technology it's fucking exploding at this unbelievable increasing race everything is newer better faster smarter more advanced more intuitive more interconnected except religion yeah religions like hit the brakes we're gonna go back to the time wheel right and shit down on any skins yeah and they're like hanging on to this wild stream of information and digging their heels in the dirt and saying that women shouldn't be allowed to drive right they're essentially what they're doing is keeping us stuck on this fucking planet and not flying into space interstellar ships no it's true it's true yeah because it's such a divisive thing and it's based on such idiocy most of it it's but not idiocy it's based on very colorful beautiful symbols which represent archetypical aspects of the human experience and that you can use to like help yourself wake up but the literal interpretation of the motherfucker that's keeping us stuck on the planet and that's weird when you consider the idea that graham hancock talks about which is the notion of the Demiurge or the fact that indeed there is an interdimensional nemesis that these people are worshipping the Jehovah God who appeared in the Garden of Eden and said to Adam and Eve don't eat the fruit that makes you know the difference between good and evil don't become human that God that Satan that God was trying to keep us stupid and dumb it's like a really advanced alien consciousness that's like let's keep the monkeys is dumb and divided as we possibly can because then we can extract that delicious fear for them that we like to eat and so that if you look at Graham Hancock's version of it it's kind of scary to think that the direct result of all these various world religions that have at their core this megalomaniacal doom god they're that they they're the very things keeping us from being free from all the gravity well that we're stuck in so it is almost as though there were some kind of dark force that's like keep them trapped on this planet so we can keep eating them it's our food source live off fear yeah they live off this suck fear of the air with a straw like a coconut when you drill a hole in a coconut just tap it in yeah Oh fear keep them scared Oh have you tried Earth yet it is so filled with fear oh you should go over to earth it's good they're terrified those monkeys are terrified they don't realize how powerful they are they never will that Jehovah has done such a good job over there I have a less supernatural idea my idea of why it's like this is that it's a communication issue and that the old communication the old information is still getting fucking bounced around over in the spot where they figured out communication first and that here we are in 2014 the further we get away the more you know like look the west coast is the furthest spot from the East Coast which is where everybody landed and it's just pretty commonly known that the West Coast is more progressive people more relaxed that's like the California lifestyle like people talk about it all the time it's it's it's not just a matter of you know like oh the beach is here everything's coolest no it's everybody got as far away from the bullshit as possible right the bullshit was like my family were Italian and Italian and Irish immigrants and they're all those people that that landed there they all landed there within decades or you know generation yes it was all these crazy immigrants that escaped Europe which is even more fucked up and you know you go further further further you're gonna get to Iraq you're gonna get to sumaré you're gonna get to the fucking epic of gilgamesh I mean that's what you're getting to it's it's all mapped out for us it's all real obvious where everything got poppin and everything got started the people that stayed were assholes there were assholes with ridiculous ideas and everybody tried to revise their ideas the further we got away like look Noah's Ark is essentially the epic of gilgamesh and there's an Hercules you can compare Hercules with Jesus I mean there's a lot of these fucking stories that are super similar right yes there's a lot of them when you compare the the actual core origin of like the like what was what was actually said with what actually are you saying happened the Virgin gave birth to a god yes like okay all right I just want to be clear how many of these are there there's a lot of these on and you think about people just sitting around campfires after they fucking shot a ram with some homemade catapult and they're eating this meat over the fire telling these stories for a thousand years before anybody writes anything down you're dealing with the echoes of savages that's really what you're dealing with literally sitting in front of a fire eating meat that they cooked on like they killed with a some fucking Flint knife their ideas still haunt our modern minds yeah that is so cool so crazy echoes of savages I love it yes what is it it's a ghost story it's like this everyone's brain is haunted by this ancient ghost story that's still floating around in there we believe it mm-hmm so much and we're so terrified of abandoning it that even now some part of me is I talk about rising beyond religion some part of me that grew up mildly religious you might still a little party's like uh you're gonna curse yourself if you talk about your home be careful it'll get to you man it'll get to you because for we're just getting our heads up out of the goddamn water of delusion here and you know not all religions it's important to note that not all religions have got their feet in the mud they've got to stick up for Buddhism it does not have it's it's not kicking digging its heels in a good point it mutates it's not about believing in not all of it's got so many different forms but it's about it believing in certain fundamental truths in the universe now it also doesn't seem very greedy they're never asking you for money you never see a Buddhist late night television list with fucking robes on a Rolex yeah people every time you write a check to me food I'll become very happy very happy come with it check all Sony's Italian sounds like father Guido Sarducci yeah you're right you know what I mean I mean they don't have late-night TV shows they don't have slicked back hair and wives with plastic faces they don't drive Rolls Royces they're just they're just trying to figure out life they're just trying to get through guaranteed there's still sects of Buddhism that have the same kind of built-in guilt principles or sorry whenever people get in control of anything yeah yeah but but the the the Buddhism is an example of a religion that it can radically transform your life - a God just by the the focused processed or not processed the focused disciplined assimilation of certain basic principles through meditation you'll start losing the conception or the idea of where you stop and the universe starts right that's what Buddhism does it dissolves that membrane between what you think you are and what everything else is through these meditative practices and contemplations and you really can pop out of your little eye and get into the big eye through Buddhism and that's pretty badass but and I think other forms of Christianity that invite you to lose yourself and love or lose yourself in selflessness or the idea of just like going from a receiver to a transmitter permanently that's pretty badass - and that can radically transform your life and not God that they're talking about the God of love is the God that we're in right now but both of those two things are various ways of losing your little eye and merging into the big one and those are to be that's very beautiful and I don't know enough about Islam to understand all the varying types of it but I guarantee there's some version of Islam based on the poetry of Rumi and the Mystics that also points to the same dissolution of the idea or the concept of the little eye and merging into the big eye and that that thing that shift in the human in human society if that happened that's how we could get off the planet but for that why do we want to get off the planet God look at the fucking universe it's awesome yeah fucking missing this here man we're gonna we're gonna go somewhere else and get hit by a meteor there oh nothing weightlessness brother we're just gonna experience weightlessness think about the other like Manson brother what you listening man weightlessness you get to experience that you get to is you get to dig I know I sound Adam homelessness is terrible for your body you know you get osteoporosis and shit you know what else is right you know what else is terrible for your body weight weight being stuck on a fucking planet we can but your body's designed for this it's true but a lot of people say that the reason they say that of the majority of our DNA or the information in there now I'm starting to lift from Timothy Leary it's so badass but that the DNA inside of us is not the information there hasn't even been like barely used yet because encoded within it is exactly the same stuff encoded within whatever makes a caterpillar turn into a butterfly and that right now our brains are based on not being able to fly our brains are based on being able to walk north south east and west but most people they don't when they're giving their erections they don't talk about altitude you know that's not in that's not built in the way that we move around so the idea of how much more our brains would evolve if we removed the planet Earth from the equation and now realize that we exist in an infinite space where there is one day where there is just one day happening right now we think that there's this day that keeps happening over and over again just because the goddamn planet goes from a light side to a dark side over and over again and it gives us an incredible illusion a kind of metronome of time that we think oh yeah there's days and because there's days there's years and all these years fold together to create a lifetime when the truth of matter is there is not a day there is rather not a bunch of different days there's just one day or no day there's no time there's no space there's infinite beingness that's what we're in right now because our current situation on this fucking gravity well it's given the illusion of days and minutes and seconds and then what whole life's become a race to fill those days and minutes and seconds and and Beyond places on time and get mad because people aren't there on time and the whole fucking thing is just a wreck it's just a wreck so one reason that would be nice to fly off of this gravity we're well aside from the fact that be fun to float in space there's I mean come on man there's so many things that you could do like it's Disneyland zero dude it'd be amazing you could go there's this ride there's that ride can you imagine what fuckin UFC would look like in zero gravity everybody would turn his soup what do you mean bones would break everybody's body would dissolve you're assuming that they haven't sleep clearly in this equation this ridiculous fantasy I'm having of floating in space they've developed ways to like apparently to generate gravity since I'm fantasizing here I get to say they've developed wait fuck it was true they do it like a double gravity that way you come back to earth your strongest fuck there you go if you wanted him that shit that would be like the new thing that UFC guys would get pop doing dude he was hanging out in double gravity all that motherfucker that cheeky bitch yeah he's got double strong bones yeah his fucking head got an inch wider ah Joe we got to go into space because it's like I think it's just built into human beings to want to migrate it's we game we virus weren't we well yeah we are but what but you know they're finding out now that you can re varus's to fight cancer they're finding out now that viruses can actually be transformed into things that are good instead of things that are destructive and that is my hippie ideology and my naive belief that there is a way that human beings can be recoded through technology and psychedelics and through some uninvented thing that hasn't happened yet that creates a kind of state of technologically enhanced empathy that allows us to transcend these invisible brain boundaries created by the echoes of the savages as you say yeah and once that happens one of the byproducts of that and by the way you don't have to leave the planet and whenever I start yapping about spam appreciate I'll be here you have to leave the planet but a lot of us would like to experience what that's like and that's one of the byproducts but maybe another part of the by-product of this kind of merging or fusion is you don't give a fuck about going into the universe because you realize you are the universe yeah that's where I'm at bro I think space travel is it sounds awesome it sounds like a really fun thing and I bet perspective wise getting above the earth would be magnificent for you it would be a probably life-changing because a lot of those guys like Edgar Mitchell was two astronauts the Apollo guys they talked about the experience being like transcendent like there's something about being above the earth and I think if we could get everybody to just fucking fly up off the earth that's what we really could shift a lot of consciousness we got everybody to go into like near Earth orbit and just see like look at this thing that we're on and look at all this silly bullshit were involved in now yes look at all that yeah because that doesn't have a roof yeah that goes on forever so we're down here tripping out about this guy believes in that book and that kind of believes in this book it looks so stupid it's like you ever been in an argument with like a brother or sister and then your parents come over and what you're arguing about just instantly seems so fucking dumb yes well either like what are you fighting about she's using my paintbrush it's not here a paintbrush like oh my god yeah we're fool like I want to pretend to be like older you know I want to pretend to be more mature but I'm still six you know what I mean yes when you look up and you're looking down at our conflicts all of them every single one of them and you compare it to infinity it looks so fucking stupid that we're wasting our time worrying about getting rid of the word bossy we're wasting our time with stupid shit we're just constantly distracted by stupid shit that's right yeah that's it man that's it that's the kind of epiphany that the planet needs in mass and then once that epiphany happens who knows the end result but is in you know the skeptic in the cynic would be right up until not very long ago to be like well that's never gonna fucking apps see I don't like those words I don't like that's never gonna happen I like that would be difficult but amazing if it can have that that's what I guess guess what everything that we do today never happened before so that whole it's never gonna happen it's horseshit if you go back to 5,000 fuckin years ago and you bring them into a podcast studio take someone throw in a fucking time machine throw them here in 2014 sit him in that chair and explain to him what the fuck is going on right now they wouldn't even be able to grab it there would be nothing about what you're saying even if you could speak their language if you could explain to them conceptually what a computer is there's no fucking way they would ever be able to imagine that this is real so you could just download movies on Netflix and watch them yeah I am flying through the air on Wi-Fi like what the fuck are you saying it's not even connected anything you have a magic box in front of you that's I'm watching people fuck on it this isn't the most insane thing ever no one ever saw this coming okay so whatever it'll never happen anything can happen almost anything yeah and eventually anything yeah it's almost anything we're gonna get some fucking molecular control over this universe on some really deep level at one point if technology keeps evolving it's not gonna be just that we could blow things up we might be able to build things we might be able to create fucking universes we might literally have a universe button that someone advanced one day where we can walk by the Science Museum and create your own universe do you want to do that okay press that button boom boom boom boom throughout the fucking cosmos because a new universe bubble just got shoved into that huge fuckin you know those are those basketballs when you like the buzzer goes off and you're at a carnival and you gotta throw basketball and the basketballs are just bouncing around that little pit of basketballs and you're chucking them that's universes and every everything you press that button you just made a universe Debbie I'm gonna call the Debbie LAN dia and we're just gonna have fucking universe buttons all oh you know a new diverse app on your phone fuck it I feel like create a couple universities today people be in competition to see who created more universes while they were at work yeah man that's beautiful yeah that that this universe brought to you by Yahoo oh my god how awesome much better you know make your own fucking universe much better listen to the five-second sponsor yeah see I love that see man what you just said is so beautiful because even as ridiculous as it may sound it still acknowledges and accepts the principle of novelty and the idea that you don't know what's gonna happen and that idea of not knowing what's going to happen that is this Buddhist teacher I'm really into his teacher this guy ajahn Chah was this like forest monk party without dude imagine that I want to make a movie I John cha the forest monk he's a guy he's a he's a you know they're these Buddhist forest monks they live in the forest they sit at the edge of open graves and watch bodies decompose and they can process and understand the fact that we are impermanent which is something jack Kornfield did which is totally amazing but yeah they sit at the and just watch for days well you just sit and watch corpses rot so that you clearly digest the fact that you're gonna die because you're made of the same matter you're not going to make it out of this so that you understand your attachment to the body is an attachment to a thing that is completely impermanent and part of the process anyway this one of the things he said is when you go into an experience go into it not knowing what's going to happen go into it understanding that today you don't know what's going to happen tune into that frequency tune into that place of like you really don't know man and all the ways that you think you know and all the experiences that you've had and everything that you use to determine how things are going to be it's gone devoured by time it's not there anymore there's just this one moment right now and you've been using your construct of how things the workout is a protective mechanism because you can't accept the fact that you are infinity experiencing itself as this impermanent mote of meat and so that moving into those places is so exhilarating it's so exhilarating and if we do that as a planet instead of thinking what everyone fucking thinks or most people think which is war is inevitable conflict is inevitable it'll always be fighting if you go into that with the idea of like maybe not just maybe not maybe we can really figure out a way to do the pull up pull us out of the goddamn primordial gory muck of believing invisible symbols that make it okay to kill children maybe there's a way to pull that out and end up floating in space or laying in a fucking super utopia where you're psychically merged with the entire universe through technology why not well I think it could be both I mean that that can happen but along the way I think what has happened is this mad need for conquering that people seem to have especially men I mean we go back in history and what do we know about history history is essentially military history military and technology history and occasionally events I mean that's what history is the printing press was invented the bomb was invented in the boat well once the Japanese would not accept the use of guns they quickly lost at warfare I mean that the military history of our world is the real history when we talk about you know knots it is what we talk about the civil war in this country we talk about when we you know fought the British we there's all this the real history of our world is a history of conflict that's fuckin crazy but in in conflict this is what's fucked up there's innovation the atom bomb came about because we had a threat if there was no threat there would be no atom bomb I mean it literally was invented because people were terrified of someone inventing it first right so that I'm not saying that it's a good thing to have nuclear weapons but what nuclear weapons represent is a human mind set forth with resources pursue a goal and what is possible what is possible is this intense ultimate nuclear destruction possibility and human beings created that because of conflict not saying that that's a good thing but I'm saying that involved in this conflict and struggle that people have always had the desire to conquer and fucking live in a big house with a fat Mercedes and be fucking consumed and private Chad and I wanted on an island and raw that feeds this machine that makes technology that feeds this machine that is ultimately advancing us past the barbaric state that feeds this interconnectedness that we all have now on the internet right that all that is because people before us we're struggling and figuring things out and trying to communicate it I gotta send a teletype today ddddd I had to send a message to my friend on the west coast he could be in trouble don't people over there can't be trusted and all this shit was invented in order for people to continue pushing this goal of conquering new lands and new places new ideas and new fucking markets and you know and in new natural resources that are being tapped into and it's all a part of this thing that is advancing us ultimately so at the same time at the same time we're all this crazy struggle and trauma and all these bullshit's going on DARPA technology is being used on the Internet you know I mean didn't the invent it didn't they kind of Advent the Internet I mean DARPA who is the who is the inventor of the internet I always forget that tidbit it's so sad I should know that something bizarre like okay let's pull it up but my point being they're making crazy robots super intelligent robots you went up to and you can kick them and they balance themselves out and bounce back up they're making these robot cheetahs that can run like 60 miles an hour have you seen those fucking - yes I have the exoskeletons yeah that's like some seriously high level shit and it's all being made from military money right all that shit's being made to make better weapons and all mean isn't it military money essentially DARPA yeah what does it stand for DARPA is the Defense Department yeah and it's the Department of Defense I don't know what it was and something yeah but what it is is like when it I mean you know obviously don't want defense airborne reconnaissance projects office you obviously don't want them using it on you but it's pretty fucking awesome stuff I mean hell yeah they're making robots dude that run they're making these like horse things do you kick them and they fucking they move like yeah and they balance themselves out about the new flying aircraft carrier everyone's talking about it carries drones on its back fuck floating drone that's fucking gooood that's goddamned Starcraft shit and if you think about it that's the that's like the peak of Technology when it comes to robotics and and and function like as far as like we finally I don't know about robotics as far as like um assembly line stuff I don't I don't mean maybe that's like super complicated at this point but robotics as far as like things that are on their own they're just walking around or flying around yeah like things that aren't attached you and you either use remote control or they know what the fuck they're doing yeah autonomous defense robots those things try going to war with that that's the equivalent of the airplane by the way when you were talking about the invention of the airplane DARPA wants a build an Avengers like flying aircraft carrier to make drones even more effective when drones start becoming like big button mobs of birds like you know when you see like birds fly around and they're all in unison sand they're like like when those start being drones attacking that's when - that can happen man I mean that's gonna be one of the big privacy issues in the next decade it's gonna be drones people are just gonna be able to fly drones over your house check up on you well your girlfriend's gonna be like sue them motherfuckers up to him fucking sent a drone his way to fly the drone over so would you do Nate Duncan oh nothing just wash the car and did you notice a tiny mosquito sitting above your computer as you were jerking off to that disgusting camping it's outside the window because everybody thinks it's a big thing that's that it's not a big thing man that the drones that everyone's like the other drones will be flying over no they're not going to be flying over they're gonna be these microscopic little orbs sort of drift through like a mist gathering information gathering biometric data looking at eye dilation whatever they want your fucking pulse take it like maybe measure your exhalations to see what kind of food you've been eating maybe they can even tell how much you've been drinking but the idea that we're gonna have the luxury much longer of looking up and seeing those these cute quaint little flying big drones no way man we're talking tiny little thing must already exist I mean it's the most obvious so they I know that the if you go to like in DC they have like the spy museum and they show you know but you know little bug bugs that that's why I guess what that's what I called him your house is bugged you know so yeah really is I want I don't know but it seems like a possibility I'm gonna say it's real for now god damn the internet anyone with that shit up in the old days you say yeah with my understanding of the CI but D I'm the UH you know how are you gonna how are you gonna scan every ant in your house how are you gonna scan every moth or every gnat drifting by what houses are gonna have to have force fields that shut those things down when they fly in or some kind of way to dismantle or detect drones yeah there was a I'm trying to remember what the actual story was but there was a technology they were working on that was essentially gonna be like a grain of rice and it's gonna have Wi-Fi in it it's gonna have a camera it's gonna have a GPS signal and it's going to be able to transmit video and it would be the size of a grain of rice and you could like literally scatter them throughout a city and you would have an accurate view of the entire city all the time there you go like they would force people to start using certain amount of grains of rice like type things in all of the house like well we have a thirty grain house so hey if anything the government wants to know Matt I mean there's 30 grains in my house is like one grain in your bathroom one grain in your living room so they know where you are at all times and it's got a wide angle lens I mean that's a little tiny mosquito one but this one I'm talking about isn't even a bug what I'm talking about is actually a grain of rice I mean it's get they're gonna scatter them yeah like pollen it's like these these DARPA flying this is like Alex Jones worst nightmares the DARPA aircraft carrier flies over and doesn't release little mini drones it just releases a dust of tiny surveillance technology these weird pollinators that just sort of float on top of everything transmit eggs back whatever you want we'll show you inside of houses it'll show you what's inside of people because some people are going to inhale it and based on like maybe the thing communicates with their phone so it gets a GPS it gets their identity and now it's inside of the being and it can start saying what they're eating what their health is like you know Google is already working on this like an ingestible cancer detecting surveillance technology it's like people think the surveillance is gonna stop stop with just the outside of us but all these new like health measuring devices the Fitbit the Apple watch the gage biometric and though right it's crazy how much that stuff can you might imagine like dropping that shit on an army and being able to get feedback not just of where the army was but what they've been eating what their blood pressure is how what their adrenaline adrenaline levels are like you know like you could get a full feedback of like well this uh these soldiers are mildly terrified right now let's see if we can up their adrenaline gland production using our nanobots that they inhaled while they were getting ready for the fight so they all have heart attacks there was a story from a long time ago I believe it was like the 19th 1970s or 1980s I forget when it was but they shouldn't even say with it what the year was because I don't remember I don't remember what city it was but they wanted to find out what would happen if someone had released some sort of a biological agent on a city like if there's some sort of a poison gas or something that got released on the city like how would it disperse and how far you know would it go so they they literally blew some like material that they could measure on the city like blew it on all these people made these fucking people breathe it in they sprayed it I mean that's like one of the origins of the idea of chemtrails is based on the reality that they have done goofy shit like this we tortured some folks yeah man they do it and of course it's like the ultimate war weapon would be a way to like get infinite data on the thing that you're fighting I mean it's the right primordial essence of war is knowing what your enemies doing that's the most one of the most important if not the most important facet of war so the idea that you can like surveil them without them being aware at all I mean that commander who recently was like you know they've you've noticed that the press is like gone from be now you should be scared of Isis to kind of now it's get turned into like looks like Isis is backing down but this commander to make the announcement about the potential death of one of their leaders said we hear you we hear what you're saying to kind of like you know imply that we're so you're being so surveilled that we hear everything you're doing and we know everywhere you're going and I think that's probably true and that's got to be a little bit on the you know terrifying side when you realize that you're being surveilled by a superpower with technology that probably no one on the planet is aware that exists yet yeah for sure I mean if you think about what DARPA shown us that they can do who knows what kind of agencies the government has been fucking cooking up these crazy bugs with yeah absolutely but isn't that ultimately going to work against them as well cuz isn't all technology especially technology that you know it's small like not talking about things like nuclear weapons and things that are difficult to acquire but all technology eventually becomes easier to acquire it starts out being super difficult and then X amount of years later everybody's got it so ultimately everyone's going to be able to spy on everybody at every point in time forever yeah that's the problem is is the problem or does that keep going in that same direction and do we accept some sort of a biological symbiosis with technology that enhances it and makes it even better at one point in time and then do we eventually figure out how to wake make artificial parts that work better than all the parts of our body how many people walking around out there with artificial hips Graham Hancock has an artificial hip didn't know it yeah Joe Perry has an artificial knee they mean we're making robots they have parts in their bodies that are machine that someone invented and you're you know it's being powered still by your tissue and your blood but essentially they've put better parts in than what you had in there yeah man I mean it it all comes down to at some point people have to wake up to the fact that they're not just an AI but they're also a we at some point you got to wake up to that fact that you're not just the one little you you're directly connected to the entire universe and you're a tiny little pixel of awakened nacinda cyou naver's but you are the universe eventually that's got to happen and privacy fear and the terror of being observed and surveilled is a hundred percent based on the notion of the identity and like one of the last great taboos is the acknowledgement or the realization that in fact you're not a an identity you're not a single eye you're a big eye you're a big eye and part of this merging technology and that's what this shit is doing man it's not just merging with us it's merging us with each other right part of what that's doing is it's dissolving the boundary between you and me and everyone on the planet right now because these things getting transmitted it God knows how many people at this point I see the awards on your table it's getting transmitted to a shit ton of people right now and that's a form of merging auditory merging and obviously the next step is going to be a emerging of consciousness through something that scans brain waves and induces similar emotional states and other people that's gonna happen man right and that's another form of merging and then the next step from that is recognizing or figuring out a way to feel what it's like to no longer have a body yet still have consciousness yeah and then that's the null another form of merging that's what we really are and somehow and the thing you're hopeful appraisal of the situation of military technology is that somehow through this stuff it's going to usher us or push us over the boundary from being an eye to being a we well maybe that's what never gets taken in consideration by things like the Drake the there is no space travel because nobody ever bothers once you get to a certain point time you go oh I get it we can create our own reality now you can get to a point where virtual reality and regular reality not not only they indistinguishable but they're interchangeable yeah you can just experience everything at once you can your regular life like whatever you deem your regular life could still exist along with a complete virtual reality of your choosing and you could choose to go back and forth to both places I mean the idea that you have one or the other like no we could still keep fucking and going into virtual realities that are where you're living in avatar yeah flying around in a fucking dragon it's just as real as this life yeah just take it's gonna take some time it is this life I mean that's the thing it is this life based on the notion of that we are one consciousness experiencing these we always end up talking about that right but goddamn it that is it like we're snorkeling right now yeah we're snorkeling through at Eggman I think Terence Mckenna compared this to its technological reef or something it's incredible as they don't know where it came from but it's like technology's extruding from time and space and we're beings that live that are like fish swimming through this technological reef well you had this awesome idea of the attractor you know McKenna had this idea that we were being pulled towards some ultimate attractor ya know and this strange attractor at the end of time yeah and that our innovation and novelty and all these different historical events everything was leading towards this attractor which is such a bizarre way to look at things but so unique like you you hear that and you go oh like there's a thing that wants us to build it yeah it's pulling us through time you know but it could also just be we want to survive and nor survive you compete in order to compete you have to innovate and you have to worry about your enemies you have to keep going so you can get your common two more monkeys and make more monkeys that are like you not like them those fucks yeah those fucks and then you just make it better jets and better missiles it better this and better that and then eventually you figure out oh I could just do this there's no more war death violence sadness just bliss just bliss man and recent computer maintenance I pray in my life that I never seriously say I've got to get my common to more monkeys do you have any more monkeys because I go that's how you accelerate the process because if we still lived in Eden it was just you know our friends it was like 20 of us would we ever even invent boats okay if we lived in this perfect place and there was fruit everywhere we have an infinite number of animals to choose to eat an infinite number of fish yeah we're gonna wouldn't there's only 20 of us what are we gonna invent what are we gonna do we're not inventing shit man we're gonna have a good time yeah I'm gonna sit by the campfire and laugh we're gonna smoke weed because no one's gonna lock us up in jail for having a plant that makes you happy we're gonna we're gonna have no conflict man we're gonna have zero it was just our friends and we all lived in this unbelievably cool place where there was food everywhere what do we ever argue about what would we ever invent nothing and nothing we would get together if we had an infinite number of food it was just us I'll just start friends we had an infinite number of food and we were healthy and we were in a place together we would just be laughing that's what we would do we would never get anything done we wouldn't worry about RER he's fucking acting kind of weird man did you hear I'm already trying to take over the kingdom no you'd be like did you CRE rape that penguin I'm starting to worry about Diaz he might be forming a new political party you know really good points I think I'm going to join DS I'd like to merge with Diaz and just have one super party why fuck around and give them choices we'll be both both beep co-presidents I've called headlined not the vice president the feature act yeah I'm just here to uh I'm opening up for the president for the first two years of his presidency I'm here to warm the crowd up man that's cool well yeah I don't know man I do think that there's something to be said for for turbulence being a kind of like the you know it's it's the creates the friction that generates the heat necessary to fuel whatever this strange technological life-form is that we're weaving out of nothingness so in that way I think it's a great thing and I think that probably as long as you're on a gravity well and a planet which we all are regardless of the resources around you you're still gonna get in fights they're still going to be turbulence because there's too many of us it's because we think that we are eyes instead of recognizing that we're one organism that's what it is because re keeps eating my fucking fruit okay we as lazy dude I went and picked the fruit he's fuckin in fear I don't want his fish he brings over this fish dude he goes fishing perhaps to go fishing nobody wants a fucking pick fruit you're right you're right fruits more valuable mm-hmm because it did wasn't made with fun so you know people go fishing for fun man you can say fishing and fruit picking is equal fuck you man you had a good time you asshole you brought back ten fish that must have been a thrill and a half yeah that's not the same okay it's not the same when your other chopping wood you're gonna give me a fish for all this wood that I chopped fuck you you had a good time making that fish yeah that's great bastard point fishing is so goddamn fun not too close not I don't know if you have to leave it seems like the thing I stand but I would know I thought I thought no no I'm doing Adam Carolla Show today I think it's at like 4:30 it's live oh that's cool yeah it should be fun yeah man fishings a fucking blast I just went fishing out in the Mobile Bay in Alabama and would you guys fish for we were fishing for trout I guess is what's out there right now but you know the we didn't catch anything man and it was we are with this professional fisherman and my dad's friends with and he's like this time last year at this place was filled with boats but because of the climate is different the basically I don't miss your spawning is that what's going on yeah there's spawn the shrimp melted and shrimp eggs end up on the marsh grass and get released and then the fish come out of the deeper ocean to eat the shrimp oh there's shrimp eggs and then that's when you have the fishing booms but it hasn't been happening and well some people are a little I mean he you know you want to whenever you're fishing you want to come up with a reason for not catching a fish you know but I some people are a little nervous because even though after that terrible BP oil spill there was actually a boom of more fish because they stopped fishing and fish production went up our fish had a chance to fuck and mate without getting ripped out of the ocean by people for a season or something so there's more fish but then now it's like well why are they there there were just a shit ton of fish here at this exact same time last year it tends to be like that and so you know who knows just a weather thing sorry could you think of any other animal that we would tolerate catching and killing the way we tolerate people catching and killing fish if you think of any other animal we would tolerate just got a bunch of machines like a bunch of trucks and we're gonna do is we're gonna attach a net to it we're just gonna go run through the woods and this net is gonna slice down trees at the bottom okay and everything it captures in the net we're just gonna eat every now we cut instead of dolphins getting caught we've got a couple joggers some fucking hike guys so I got caught in my net jogger yeah I'm here to catch elk you stupid fuck I wasn't looking for you and you treat people that are so stupid they get caught in the net the same way they treat dolphins I mean by the time they get to and they hope they're not dead he got trampled to death yeah the poor bastard he got caught up in the net right behind it elk okay kicking him in the head yeah they'd have a name for the joggers they calm like asphalt veal or something yeah forest meat yeah like yeah what do they call it into the eating fruit bats and after they call it bush meat oh that's what they call like anything any call that monkeys they call Bush bush meat the least appealing name for anything but yeah that yeah that's it is there is a part of you when you're fishing that has to acknowledge the kind of sadism that's happening there because you're using a device from the Hellraiser movies it to lure a thing in ridiculous it's ridiculous but you know and I know that ultimately we should have compassion for all being and wish them all alive free of violence but fish do eat other fish of course well that's my argument about bears whenever anybody wants to say bears are cute like have you ever seen one in the real life eh in the real world and B do you know they eat babies yeah they eat their own babies all of them yeah they just eat they eat each other one of them dies they just start eating it they don't wait a while is there a reason they come back no they start eating but don't they eat the babies because it's like there's not enough food for all the babies and it makes more sense to eat your young than to waste resources where everyone starved I thought that's why they cannibalize no the male's eat just because they like to eat babies and they like to stop the babies from breeding of course they don't know what they're they don't what not they don't know what the real motivation is there's a lot of guesses because they can't ask the Bears obviously but they are pretty pretty sure that there's a bunch of factors one sometimes the males will kill the Bears the Cubs because they're hungry sometimes the male and they're easy to kill like you just go and grab them and eat them so they might do it because of that they might do it sometimes because they want to bring the female back to estrus so she'll want to fuck and she'll want to have more babies so they can come because otherwise she doesn't want to let the bear fucker she got her babies around that's the darkest yeah darkest wait dolphins do that dolphins do the same thing it's one of the reasons why female dolphins are so promiscuous apparently they study dolphins they found out that female dolphins will have sexes with as many females as they can so that way when they have babies nobody knows whose babies who so they leave her alone but if she has babies and their babies and you know that you never fucked her they just kill the babies God Jesus damn man and that's dolphins their sweetest things ever faces they're always smiling not always the smiling when they're killing babies see fuckin you know they they did it doesn't mean doesn't happen every day it doesn't happen all over the dolphin world but it's been observed hey Roger why you smiling like that it's not like bears though bears it's a hundred percent like the males come out it's the Cyrano's explain this to me and he knows a lot Barriss and when I was in that bear hunting camp they had seen a bear kill a cub and then it was eating it and then the mother came back and finished the cub off and finished and ate the rest of it like it is such a fucking hardscrabble world that you can't even imagine the reality of being a bear I got it on that note I gotta go take a leak don't take a week I know it is sad it's fucked up but being a fish fish don't even get the fuck fish have the same problems other fish eat them but they don't even get the fuck in fact like there's certain fish where you buy lures that are the baby fish there's like like like you could buy like baby like a little Rapala that's like a baby trout and fucking trout's will eat it cunts find out who that I've musician was that yesterday earlier Pat Regan that's who he is yep patty Regan on Twitter yeah that dude is fucking awesome I don't want to say any more I don't want to give anybody give the premise or give the hilarity of a song but we were fucking call happing hard that was so good yeah it's really me and Tony had him on kill Tony it's really interesting because a lot of musicians who are comics aren't really good musicians they just know how to play it a little bit of guitar enough to make it work but he's actually a really good musician on top of it yeah no doubt like he could do like love songs and it'll be awesome you know well not to me when y'all get off me you you like a love song every now and that's right that's really rude did they do that what we're talking about earlier on those fucking those humane society videos that's deaf fucks with your head man totally by the way the new Grand Theft Auto came out and I saw you tweeting about you fuckers and there's peyote in it now where if you take if you if you take if you take the only thing you turn into a chicken well don't play it we could play it on this right here oh okay okay so you take it yeah you can play it like that yeah you could do that Oh we gonna put it up that way let's take over that yeah well anyways it will you can wipe why okay this but yeah you you just turn eat is a peyote and he just turned into a chicken on it VOD does it turn you into chicken though why don't they just call it something different oh wow this is badass wait this is a video game if I won't get over again yeah you're not playing this are you don't play this no this is a video game don't fall for it if you don't I don't know that do you know that you're Bryant pull that I thought you weren't playing that I thought only we were watching it yeah it's not full screen and it's just I we're getting pulled so many times if you like somebody doesn't want you playing their video on another video because then you won't go to see their video that's the idea behind that you're taking hits from them so like pretty much any time you play a YouTube video or any sort of nature video or any sort of video that anybody has a copyright on you can get pulled likes yeah this is one I don't know what fair uses man fair use is very fucking you know like when you talk about fair use like you could play some things if you're doing commentary over them that's fair you sir I don't know I don't understand it better to avoid it yeah man anyway whatever that looks awesome I don't have time for that shit though dude I can't play Grand Theft Auto Inquisition last night it's over dude it feels like I'm on fire right now just knowing that's back in the house it's so good it's so cool I was doing the UFC this weekend and they had the ad for some new video game I think it's called Far Cry yeah Far Cry 4 or some like yeah but they were playing like in game footage of it whatever like this is insane this is insane I can't believe this is real it's amazing that kids get anything done it's a fucking amazing yeah kids today get anything done sure because I had a hard time with quake one you know think about the graphics in quake 1 and think about what the fuck we're looking at today is this Far Cry game and these UFC games man sometimes I watched the like the preview weather when they step forward to start to fight and for a full second I don't realize it's a game yeah yeah I know oh it's again you know like I see them move and like it take I have to recognize like well does they look too perfect it's too this is too uniform in color there's some weird shit cause a video game but it takes like a full second before I realize that I'm watching a goddamn game so this is it so we're watching it and they can't see it right right okay exactly dude and what if people want to Google this what is it it's on Kotaku calm and it's so he turns into a chicken yeah you just ate some peyote kids get anything done you can come a chicken or you know you pay attention some stupid boring ass fucking homework that you will hopefully never use in your life this then is this this has been real one day the new for Xbox one and ps4 came out last night midnight and they added a bunch of cats drop new drugs you could also turn into birds and go like fly around the city and poop on people when you do drugs but a lot of drugs stuff and a cat stuff that's pretty cool that's pretty badass you know I did I show you the alien game I have on my DK - you are the oculus rift day oh I didn't want to try it have you heard of that I've heard it gives people fucking heart attacks the alien yeah that's right I've heard I've heard people say literally I stop saying literally I literally have to stop saying literally I just apps ain't fucking don't say it stop it for whatever reason it gets close to heart attack level with some people yeah there's people that are doing it that are they're worrying like well this might actually cause a heart attack yeah everybody who's put it on am I on screams not just a rudimentary technology if you could feel it ah feel that tailed fucking piercing your neck or that or if you have some sort of suit you're wearing some suit and it like to put pressure on you in the areas where the things supposed to bite you like when it comes out and grabs you like you feel hands on your shoulders I you know how what a freak out that would be if it when it gets you it pops up and just grabs your shoulders and you're wearing this suit and in this suit there's like finger press buttons on the shoulders and it pushes down on you and you feel it how's this thing's in front of you this fucking crazy tongue comes out right before it brains you you feel the hands on your shoulders I bet this suit comes with like a special place where you could hang your diaper inside naturally evacuate they probably warn you to give you something enema before you play with it yeah you will shit yourself you're gonna shoot your cell 80% chance you'll shit yourself it's probably just like a blood thick wetsuit like a armor-plated wetsuit and you zip it all the way up to the top and everything that happens you in the game you feel it in your body man I'm looking forward to the the new that people have been speculating about having these VR goggles on airplanes so that when you put them on you can see the outside of the plane like it's the inside of the plane you know yeah and also they're talking about using kind of projector technology in planes that projects the outside of the hole I've seen that I saw the images of that they don't have a working plane right now right but it makes sense it did actually I mean I'm gonna say this is a stupid thing for me to say because like the most technologically advanced thing that I've done recently is figured out that I could put marijuana drops into my smoothies I realized that like I am always like you know railing against people but I'm not doing I'm playing Dragon Age and like drinking marijuana smoothies but that being said it seems easy to project that outside of a plate onto the inside of a plane based on what you could even buy it like Brookstone they have those projectors yeah have you so fun yeah that's what it looks like we're looking at a picture of it right now and it's the inside the plane the roof and the two sides are all like a giant screen and so it looks like totally seamless like you could see the sky and it they have cameras apparently on the top of these things that project everything that's actually out there so if a plane was beside you you would be able to see the plane in HD you know if you know that would be the best to fuck with people yeah you hijack that thing and you like if you got hackers on board they hack that fucking thing and they show UFOs everywhere and everybody starts freaking out like oh my god there's 20 flights are you not seeing this fucking plane now oh my god you don't see him and everybody's freaking out 200 people are you screaming when the plane dinosaur's neck dinosaur snag something that big yeah man t-rex or you know it doesn't have to be the it doesn't have to be the egg though what you're flying through either it could be like a a space they can project space out I feel like you're flying through space in the plane right you could have like an avatar plane while you're flying through like the avatar dimension you've seen the fucking dragons around you as you're flying each like James Cameron can have his own airlines and you can have the full avatar flight experience you imagine how fucking cool that would be so it's like a ride all the way to like New York is five and a half hours of avatar monsters flying around the plane so bad so bad look down you can see the forest everywhere you look down to program you see like those Navi running around jumping swinging from ropes and shit shooting arrows it had a game component man you could sure you could like be shooting them with like machine guns or lasers yeah you're in the world immersed in the world everybody in every seat has their own avatar and they're flying through this pit and you just look up and you know where you are it's just an infinite screen above you like a roof find a roof no the whole thing's a screen yeah you know why do you only have screens here and here and a little bit here no the whole thing is the screen well because that you know that what are they called the people who make you put your phone someone's gonna ruin it like guaranteed like one of the safety people be like there's no way we're projecting shit on that thing these are fart tubes that make people want to kill themselves you know advancing you know what would happen someone would tap into it it would be five hours of gay porn from LA to New York like know everybody looks like oh yeah sailor don't just dicks and mouths and fucking hairy dudes covered in cum and just dudes with those those ear holes in those ear holes guys get those big plugs in their ear all stretched out feet up in the air hairy legs getting butt-fucked by another dude and that's all you see for five or even worse and calm and Dixon calm or even worse The Big Bang Theory they just show the big did you see LG actually made a commercial where they they they pranked a bunch of people with this like realistic window in the background and then they had like just like a meteorite coming from the ground oh that's awesome can we play that yeah it was a commercial so fucking cool yeah that's bad wow that's wild wow oh my god whoa and they had all lights my shit my pants I think was like a year and a half ago but LG ended up pulling it because it got so much bad attention from it well didn't people all have the same releases bitch look it's an LG TV okay fuck you man they're lucky nobody hit anybody Christ I want one of those did you go mad for real I bet he did yeah today give him a check yeah and they got a sign a release right yep Wow yeah it's so cool man how we're talking about exactly yeah we're talking about how the universe our subjective experience of the universe is about to shift so radically in so many different ways because what's that new Google thing they're being so secretive about the thing where you can see an elephant in your hand that they're not talking about you know what Google hologram look it up it's called I keep forgetting it's called magic something or but it's it's basically like some it's an augmented reality that creates apparently they're being so secretive about it people can only speculate based on the patterns that they've taken out and I there's a few images that might have been released but it's some form of augmented reality where I don't know if it's coming off of your phone I don't know if it's coming off of a projector or what it's coming yeah magic leap look at that raised half a built that see that he'll have in your hand yeah it's gonna be able to see Holograms like lifelike lookin Holograms yeah real-time yes and I've heard I've heard I know someone who supposedly saw it and they just said it's the most incredible thing they'd ever seen their life and the people who've seen it are all like no you don't understand oh my this is a game changer so you're gonna watch people fuck in your house that's what's getting there you're gonna be on your on your bed you're gonna be watching like little mini people fuck like you're the king like you're like Gulliver's Travels you like landed on some beach and it's filled with hot people and they're fuckin but they're only like three inches tall crazy it's crazy you're gonna be able to jerk off and have your own head projected onto the top of your cock so when you come you like the dream do you think they'll get to a point where when you come on the characters the characters recognize you come on yes I would i program i program that into the game what like how because you know the new game if you play it you don't play games you're too busy so yeah there's a game shadows of Mordor which is this super fun game that has a thing called the Nemesis system which is that if oh look at this Wow oh my god it leaves shadows yeah it's a little elephant blitz it flies around your hand I wait for that what is this though that we're seeing is this a real demonstration of it or is this a artistic representation it's the website oh that's just their website but that's what it does but no think that that look it's time to bring magic back into the world oh my god technology sometimes the best thing mind-bogglingly awesome sometimes the best thing in life come from the most unexpected places most of us know what a world with dragons and unicorns and elves and fairies is just a better world that is why we're summoning the Antichrist to what they actually said though what right before that my but just say it good most of us know that a world with dragons and unicorns elves and fairies is just a better world that's so crazy this is why we are using black management's into this dimension what would happen if we use technology to bring magic back into the world like they're showing a kid of a couple kids sitting around a table in class and it looks like the sea horses are flying around in space above them and they're not wearing glasses or anything so this must be some kind of like it's a projection technology yeah some but I mean where is it coming out of this is what's weird mean I want to know if these are real images we're seeing but they're fucking with us this is just magic dude ballerinas dancing on a little girl's bed go back up to that look at that yeah that's a little girl's face like could you imagine watching a little tiny man dance with swords in front of you doing like some crazy ancient Alibaba Persian dance so cool he's like four inches tall it would be cool if they could give them a touch of some kind at least like like if it's in your hand you could kind of feel it using maybe moisture or do it haptic technology by using like air blasts you can simulate stuff but yeah that's yeah but you have to have a fan to do that I think it's gonna get to a point where they can actually like put something in your mind that makes you respond to the program so you feel sensory input that doesn't really exist yeah that way you can know what it looks like to get attacked by wolves put on this you put on the suit and you have a virtual reality scenario we are attacked by wolves and you can literally feel them tearing you apart plane take off the suit and you're fine how about a feeling to take a nap inside a vagina what if you take a nap inside a vagina but then she enjoys it she clamps down you can't breathe and you have no way of telling her that she's crushing you ah I was really enjoying it so she kegels you in there oh yeah yeah she's like are you sure that when you get in there you you're not gonna you're gonna be safe Oh baby your vagina's so soft and amazing and welcoming when I get in there it's gonna be like I'm just okay you'll let me know okay just like put your legs in first we don't have a problem we have no problem trust me I'm in I'm in I'm good I'm gonna go all the way in so I love you honey I'm gonna try to make you come under climb inside of our pussy it feels too good and she just called ya the last thing you see is like what appears to be a skeletal hand cuz she's done this many times before and it looks like a hippo like a hippo mouth closing down on you that's what it's like slammed just a wall of the roof of her mouth like a giant meat press coming down on your body the mouth of the vagina just closes down you're like choking on saline on all the fluids in there it is sort of like in this mucusy all those baby pushing muscles just smush your bones yeah you feel the pressure of her pussy just ripping your shoulders off their sockets why do I have to kill you maybe it like sucks you through a tunnel and shoots you into a surprise party because I think women to be getting the short end of the stick for too long and about time they start killing us with their pussies I'm just trying to look at it from their point of view widow style you know it is weird what you just described was birth and reverse yeah maybe you maybe you maybe the stuff they say about how we all experience trauma from being squeezed out of a pussy when we're babies and don't have any muscles at all can't do anything is like still there's like residual trauma inside of us a lot of people say that's like one of the root problems or the roots of a lot of bad trips is that we still haven't gotten over that suffocating moment of falling out of a floating ball of water where we had all the food we wanted and then squeeze through a tunnel that's so strong it mashes our head out of shape that that's a trauma and it's still encoded inside of people it's very possible you're a baby but you don't you don't have a language but you're a human being you don't have a big brain you have a little tiny ass brain that brain is still taking in signals you still know what your mama is you still feel good getting the nipple in your mouth like you're getting a little tiny baby house there's a lot of information that's going in yes and we just assume they forget all the fucked up shit like the being born into the world and the cold hands of a doctor as he picks you up and his fucking gonna light on his head and just this big giant like a gray alien he's wearing the oxygen mask this is what the alien abductions are some people say you know though wasn't it a big fad rebirthing ceremonies or something where like you again you would like they would do something where you get to be born you'd get another chance to overcome the PTSD that comes from being squeezed out of a pussy into this dimension um I don't know man I don't know it's interesting I don't know if it gets stuck in your head but I don't know either good but it seems like a very likely scenario I mean the the brain is functional and it's the most traumatic experience ever and you don't have any context you don't have any language you don't have any knowledge of why you're there no one's explained what's gonna happen all of a sudden you're born that's got to be unbelievably traumatic you've been hearing this then on top of that adds circumcision how about they slice your fucking dick with a razor yeah welcome home what you cut his dick what welcome to earth we're just gonna keep it clean what about soap anybody ever everybody we're talking about soap the cut is fucking dead kids screaming's dicks on fire screaming just came out of pussy dicks actually how long do they wait for they circumcised they probably don't do it right away yeah they definitely stick you with needles right away they vaccinate you like instantly we're worried about disease fucking shove needles right into that baby's body start pumping chemicals did you ever do a home birth fuck no what am i living in a cave what am i on a fucking farm somewhere in a Clint Eastwood movie about the 1800s let's the fuck out of here Wow Sally I don't think she's gonna make it you try you hardest get a water bucket that's all is it every movie every western birth movie it's like they act if you get the water bucket there in time the baby will survive in the water bucket fix me a bucket of water yeah kiddo but a bucket of water want some cloths from clean cloth since water like a baby's turned around I'm gonna go in there he goes in with his farmer hands and ruins your wife's pussy just shoves his gigantic gorilla like farmer hands into that pussy and spins it around he's the only guy knows how to do it because he's done it with calves we got a breach crab all right he rolls his sleeve up to his elbow and just fucking lubes the whole thing just launches it in there and spins around the kid fingernails fucking country naughty bird just fucking gopher shit monkey bullshit just took a giant farmer doctor crap in here reaching into your wife's pussy pulley got a half strangled emaciated malnourished baby and then he's gonna smack it to make it cry yeah and the poor thing is just like what happened why what happened why why did I do that is like the ultimate argument one day for a new type of birth what if they figure out the birth ago look we've found something out about the human psyche and although we were all created a certain way and we can't avoid it we found that there's considerable trauma and a less likely chance of enlightenment when you come out through a pussy and that really the best way to do it is we we do it nice and slow and we are gonna send you information to your baby in a form of like a nano bot that delivers video and it's gonna get your baby used to how it's going to be born and it's gonna slowly be there's gonna be an opening in the top of the roof and then some loving hands are gonna come in and I'm gonna take you to your mother who will then be stitched up yes until they figure out one day they're gonna figure out how to dissolve skin and then reapply it all right yeah the stitches kind of teleports out and that floats beam of light beautiful music on a nice soft pillow vanilla scented candles how nice like like like calming Indian music Enya yeah no no sang no singing fucking kids not ready for that okay just like guitar yeah something sweet something like not aggressive at all and then they cut off the tip of its do nice and calm you're never gonna get if you don't get it now get it if you don't get it imagine if they did that though if they brought the kid into the world and it's like feeling of soothing enlightenment and which is a minor dose of MDMA just the tiniest dose of MDMA while in the womb so that as the kids being born it has no inhibitions as the kids mean I mean they have a little tiny body so it could be like the fucking like a pinhead of India man yeah but they find out that not only is MDMA when given to babies in the womb make for a better birth for everybody but they all become super geniuses all those babies become the kindest most unlikely have no emotional problems they have zero issues it's a jumpstart to enlightenment yeah give your baby a little extra seat I love it it probably already tripping oh really yeah I think you're I think babies are probably tripping I'd say what they're tripping on though they're definitely not tripping on MDMA they have no form that this is study they they don't know they're separate from their mother at first they don't understand that there's a separation they don't that the whole idea of separation is something that comes later down the line the idea that this is me and that to you is something that comes later down the line and that I mean God if you've ever taken a nice dose of LSD the moment that goes away that separation goes away if you've ever had that in a psychedelic that's surprising moment where you're like holy shit I'm everything you just merge pure they called expansiveness the clear mind that is the most ultimate that is as great as it can get that's pure freedom it's a pretty intense experience that's for sure and it's experience that probably 80% of people never have right at least probably more more than 80 yeah it's one of the real problems with the world one of the real problems of the world is even like super intelligent people I read a lot of different people's stuff online people that I don't agree with at all super left people super right people I read a lot of people's stuff and one of the things that I'm always shocked and how angry and shitty a lot of really smart people can be about fairly controversial or debatable issues right but they can be really angry and shitty and insulting and I know they're smart so I'm reading this and like this just screams a lack of psychedelic perspective they're like not everybody has a psychedelic perspective 24/7 but usually even if you have like a moment when you're in your car like we were talking about that driving last time we were driving together you were driving and you like this fucking asshole the fuck out of my way and then you started laughing you're like listen to me weird I'm always talking about peace and then like man I can't tell this olena Buicks to go fuck herself but we were joking and laughing around while we were doing it yeah look man I mean that's just natural I mean it still comes out it's it I was able to catch it with you if that's what mindfulness is the training so that you can catch it at least where after it happens you go there I didn't fucking pattern it again but I know what you I know what you mean man it's a some people haven't quite realized yet that they don't have to be like that right and I know yeah I've seen these fucking Twitter fights between people that are supposedly super intelligent and somehow they devolve into like tenth graders incredible right it's incredibly embarrassing well it's a social retardation is what it is it's part of it and by social retardation I mean the most advanced social interaction that I ever get out of my life is when I get high with my friends whether I get high with them whether it's mushrooms or I mean there's regular these all sorts of wonderful deep interactions you could have sober or not sober but when you trip with somebody there's some intense bond of humanity that happens when you trip with them yeah but when it's over and you're laughing and it's like oh boy like the social bond that's constructed through those moments is pretty fucking remarkable man and if you never experienced that I kind of feel bad I kind of feel bad because we all go through great moments in life it's not like the defining thing where you have to have it or you won't be complete but it is some next-level shit yeah it really truly is some next-level shit and it's some shit that a good 80% of people are just not gonna experience I like to think that a hundred percent of the people experience it because I think it's what happens when you die and I like to believe that the death experience is one of complete merging and that that like wow wow wow the Steve Jobs like wow you know who I'd love to get high yeah Richard Dawkins that's everyone's dream man that guy is so fucking smart but so hostile with so little time left he's pissed he's always pressed he was getting mad at these women who were mad at the scientist for wearing the the shirt with the sexy ladies on it and you know who's like saying like that's not real feminism the real feminists aren't I wouldn't be mad at some ridiculous shirt isn't that funny though Joe that thing like here we have one of the great moments in human history uh-huh and as part of a byproduct of landing a probe on a goddamn comet and already they're reporting that they found organic matter on this comet indicating that the entire universe is being pollinated by these drifting mountains that have within them precursors to life as part of a by-product one of the people who one of the magician's as far as I'm concerned that the magician engaged in a ritual a sorcerer that summoned this being out of dust like made the metal and to put the wires in just the right way so that I could get in perfect orbit around the comet going 400 miles an hour with harpoons that didn't work but it had fucking harpoons that could shoot into the thing one of these sorcerer is the robe he was wearing happen to women on it and as a byproduct instead of feminists and people who aren't feminists and atheists and theists all being like you sir are a bad motherfucker you got a P o box cuz I want to send you some cigars or cakes or anything you want you deserve to get showered with all of those scientists should just be getting massages for weeks they should be getting whatever they want they should paparazzi should be following them out and snapping pictures of them for what they did but no we're still stuck at this stupid frequency where a lot of us were like can you fucking believe you would wear that tasteless shirt oh you don't even understand he could wear whatever he wants he's a scientist but fighting instead of everyone being like we did it we work together we got a thing to land on a comet let's see what else we can do you know what's my favorite part of it watching men criticize the shirt doing it so purely for female brownie points doing it so clearly I've watched a Twitter fight between a guy who claims it calls himself a feminist and some woman and the woman who loves pinup girls and she loves uh like that rock Billy type shit which is the girl who by the way the shirt was invented by a girl or created put together by a girl but there's similar patterns that one that you sent me the link which eventually want to becoming sold out it's slightly different than his but someone informed me that they make those shirts by hand so what could be going on is like it's a pattern that you can buy and then they put it together and they make the shirt and this girl who's his friend bought the pattern bought the shirt you know bought the cloth it has these sexy ladies on it and made her friend a shirt I have in law because he loves her or I assume he loves her he wore her shirt on TV yeah and when I was all happy and celebrate what a sweetheart man well this is on you know he's a sweetheart the guy instead of going fuck you it's my shirt you guys are crazy okay is there some real shit to be worried about you guys not pay attention to the fact that we landed a comment a girl keeping this shirt alright she's my friend I did it for her I would say it's its equivalent of like giving someone a shout-out okay relax women like these kind of shirts too but some people think that like you have to take the sex and fun and comedy out of science and that a guy can't have a personality and be a fucking weirdo with a bowling shirt on there's all these sexy women on I don't know who that guy is I think he's a hero and I think he's one of the coolest guys on earth today because not only did he take part in getting that fucking thing to land on a comet but he had the balls on the day that that thing could not have maybe failed to wear that shirt that's true it could have fucking not worked and they look at that guy there was that shadow do we know that what he did he wear it the day that the project that was saluted my understanding and I don't want to know if it's different I'm like I want to stick to my version of this guy this hero scientist yeah I'm fairly certain that that was the celebratory day and he knew that there's a chance that thing might not land and he's gonna be he's gonna become the punching bag of everyone he's like a little scientists are wearing these fucking retarded shirts man how are you gonna land it comment how you gonna land a probe on a comet when you're wearing these weird shirts you know that guy put really put himself out there it's true he's a badass what's his name that's a good question we need to find that guy's name that guy should have met something he should have his own float in the Macy's Day Parade scientists gonna Google scientist shirt and I bet that you get it right yeah sure that's definitely Matt Taylor yeah that's the first thing Matt Taylor dr. Matt Taylor shirt made me cry too with rage and his abusers feminists freaked out over the scientist girlie shirt comet scientists Matt Taylor shirt scientist was awful feminist freak out over scientist girl this is fucking great he's a comet scientist yeah well here's the thing man lock your hold up some photos of some guy shirts where like guys have like they're wearing cowboy hats they have no shirt on they're like the same exact kind of images and you know they're shirtless and if a woman wore that would you do anything other than laughs would you like what is this crazy shirt you got yeah who would be offended who would see if a woman was on television and she just landed a fucking comment landed a robot on a comment and it took 12 years to get there and she's sitting there and she has a t-shirt on and it has pictures of guys blowing each other on it who would be like this bitch this fucking bitch she thinks she could do that and put that in my face no you know it'd just be like it's happening the universe is waking up we're entering into a better period of human history yes one also you personally could never be offended by that you would only think it's funny I would think it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen well what person wouldn't think it's funny I get maybe if you were with your kids and your kids like daddy why is that guys sucking on that guy's penis I didn't want to have to explain this shit so early but he's a comment scientist they wear weird clothes comet scientists love gay guys that's just in the homos you would just be like I don't know I don't know kid but they just landed a probe on a giant floating mountain that has pre or pre precursors to human life on it how about that friend I heard you say homo that's what I heard I didn't hear all the other stuff you said homo homo is derogatory who cares what happens up in space if we can't have freedom down here freedom to not be abused by assholes with derogatory language you can still say homo by the way and I've never been criticized for saying homo no one's come after me for saying homo homos themselves like Justin Martindale gave me a homo pass oh he did yes he did that's cool I don't know if you did but he would knock well it's not cut I mean I'm just saying it now because I know it's gonna be in tensions the most important the idea another and here don't song here yeah intention no oh you're doing that kind no it's not what's important what's important is gender equality overall when that becomes a hundred percent across the board then we can worry about your attention right now it's about controlling language okay Wow it's like you're not being an asshole it's like the voice of all things it's like it's like if all the blog's on earth formed into some monster and attack the city that's what it would talk like if all the blog's on earth got together and became a organism like a life force all the tumblr if tumblr was a living creature it would just it would be covered in tattoos and it would have piercings all over its face and it would just be screaming into the abyss hey man have you seen that blog about Etsy if ice we talked about this on here that see boyfriend's like it's a blog of like boyfriend's having to wear their girlfriends Etsy clothes have you seen that what does Etsy Etsy is a so Etsy is a like a crap it's a like an amp what would you call it Craigslist for people who sell crafts and stuff yeah it's exactly it's like like I'm gonna make a bunch of socks and sell them to you it's like a garage sale please look it up man a garage sale can you pull it up and it's so funny but it's like I'm confused just watch this blog it'll all come clear like it's like people make crafts like I made gloves and I'm gonna sell them online or I made my own boots so so there's a blog dedicated to boyfriend's having to wear the sweaters that their girlfriends made and they all would semi miserable cuz they're in the did you find it yeah that's Etsy but let go oh so it's just guys wearing their girlfriends creations you got to see it sport why do girls create like ridiculous things and they make them wear like what do they make these guys were sad Etsy boyfriends dot tumblr doc yeah okay stop right there that shirt looks like what I have on very similar this is I'm wearing a velour tracksuit top and it's wonderful now I understand why this fat Italian guys that sit out in front of like social clubs wear these things they're so relaxing they're comfortable it's like your clothes are giving you a hug it's like inside it's all fuzzy and shit it's great to comfortables fuck softest thing I've ever worn and these guys are wearing these sweaters because they're posing for their girl yeah they have to UM what is this guy doing he's being this is it his girlfriend obviously made some kind of like nose warmer type thing and say he has dope oh well it's sweet God am i wide after some enough bitterness warmer okay that is that a hat that she made and she made a jean jacket well it's fairly interesting okay it's just a bunch of guys wearing shirts you're right it's fine I'm a dick I gotta stop doing now he's summing up darkness you know there's a there's a on the stone there's a it's called there's a Buddhist author named Sharon Salzberg and she coined the great phrase recreational bitterness and it's this recreational bitterness and how damaging and dangerous is her name again Sharon Salzberg Salzberg Cipolla sa lzb ERG be ERG Salzburg Sharon Salzberg recreational bitterness she tweeted about it recreational bitterness it's a or is it Joan Halifax one of them said that I can't resort to just two different Buddhist teachers Roshi Joan Halifax or Wilshire but anyway recreational bitterness how it's like that thing where you get around a group of people and your primary topic of conversation is what's wrong in the world recreational bitterness I got to stop doing that man I'm so sick of doing even little ways you know where you just kind of accidentally go that that fucking idiot just kind of even joking isn't it yeah it's dangerous I think Rebecca Solnit Salzburg solna Sharon Salzberg tonight I got here Rebecca Solnit now look at me she got married I don't change in Salzburg sell out the cultivation of recreational business speaking to her allies Rebecca Solnit well she might have been caught out otherwise she must have been quoting this person yeah this is 2012 huh she looked it up but she might have been quoting this other person I'm saying right I mean I didn't read into it whatever either whoever created it all praise be to you maybe point is it's a fucking awesome quote recreational bitterness is some real shit I mean go to any comedy club oh my god talk to the guys were like on the outskirts especially they're like trying to get in it's the water it's the water they swim in and it's so sad but it's like when you realize how it's infected your own life in the small way is like it's the smart this is why mindfulness is good because you just sort of watch yourself and then the next time you find yourself bringing out some old bones to chew on with your friends and you're just like saying or what how you're referring to yourself or like what is this idiot one right that thing was that dick set gotta say you know you look at the content of your language and and it's like you know if you go into the idea that the universe conforms to the way you describe it then that is a very dangerous modality get in to get into because maybe you're actually coloring the world with your with your linguistic farts the constant degradation of this universe that you're in is a kind of habitual fun well you for sure taint yeah and not just taint but you you interact with everything you come in contact with every person you come in contact with every situation you find yourself in you're in control of what kind of energy comes out of you in that scenario and just in doing that you talk about the ripple effect of the savages that created humanity and how it's affecting us today also every like good thing you do or every good interaction that you have or every great experience that you have with other people that spreads out in a good way and the more you do that the more those people might likely learn from that experience that that's a good thing to do and then do it in turn to other people right so one of the nicest fucking compliments anybody ever gives me when I go to comedy clubs or wherever is how generous the people that come to the shows are it's because we talk about it all the time you gotta have talked about it many times like leaving nice tips for people being friendly people sincerely letting people know that you're happy with what they've done or who they are or that when you do that and you show like friendship and and and just a real genuine unselfish gratitude when you do that or a generosity when you do that you can create a whole world where other people start doing that the people around you start doing that - maybe the waitress you gave her a $50 tip for a fucking in a donut and she's gonna you know for whatever reason gives somebody else a tip or give somebody some advice that you would or help a friend or you feel inspired to be nice and who knows who knows you know you help a friend move and you do it all cool and selflessly and you take your time out of your day that friend might be a fuckin mover helper for life that might be like dude Duncan fucking got up at 9:00 in the morning met me at my house help me get the rental truck never asked for any money you know and and he helped me all day he was dedicated to help me move my fucking shit out of my apartment I'm gonna do that for everybody now and what it's so nice when it's effortless yeah and then when you practice mindfulness in the midst of that you get to watch the parts of yourself that do resist because no matter how mean let maybe you're a supremely awakened being but there you're still gonna have this kind of psychic indigestion we're in the midst of helping or something you might notice certain selfish thoughts start emerging about wanting to get something back from it and you can't blame yourself you were raised in the system of exchange you know if you give me this I give you this if you hurt me this way I hurt you that way so there's a momentum in the direction of selfishness that comes from a lifetime of conditioning and that's why if you put yourself in a situation where you're giving to someone and add mindfulness to the equation you'll start learning a lot about yourself and see your resistance to purely being in that complete state of just letting it go giving it away believing that we exist in the universe of pure abundance where there is not a limited supply but an infinite supply and the ghost story the echo of the savages is one of its primary components talks about a universe where everything is limited and can go away and therefore you must constantly be on the defense when maybe the news story is one where it's like no we live in an infinite universe of pure abundance and the more you surrender to that the more selfless you become and the more you embody that by giving it to other people the more you summon into this dimension a brand new paradigm that has as its nucleus love or you get James Brown because James Brown you don't get if you have all those the things you know ghetto man you gotta have some suppression you gotta have some fucking iron will that's sure been developed to fight against the oppressive white man so you get on that stage and you just showing everybody how shiny your shoes are and your fuckin spinning and splits and you live in a marginalized civilization a marginalized culture and you're a bad motherfucker and you want the world to know it you get out there with your cocktail I'll slip back yeah man but we're both are beautiful because one you got the flower growing out of the sidewalk or out of the country where it should never be and the other one you've got a field of flowers that are just infinitely growing under the beautiful Sun both are incredible both are incredible I love them both and I think that as long as that light of humanity is shining on the potential to be a flower bursting out of a sidewalk or to be a community of flowers that's what it's all about man there's no feeling like that but this fucking culture of bitterness it's turning your back on that notion it's eliminating it's a lie I mean you might say James Brown was a completely bitter person but when I'm James Brown it's someone else saying yeah I know you're not I know you're not I'm saying what he's doing even if it might be a reaction or a retaliation when you see that guy come out especially that amazing concert where the Mick Jagger said the worst mistake of his life was following James Brown you ever heard about that story when you see that fucking concert that's I think that's love exploding out of that guy love amplified through cocaine perhaps but still love cocaine is love is that what you're saying I think cocaine can amplify love though I don't like the stuff makes me depressed but I've heard that I'm not joking that's not a sarcastic guy I like almost every drug but I can't do cocaine it just I don't know what it is man but I do it and it like just gives me the blues it's really weird um just did I never heard James Brown did cocaine did he it was James Brown into drugs I should know that just assuming and that's not fair to say yeah you know why I haven't looked it up because I don't want to be racist I don't want to be racist looking up something yeah but he did drugs fucking black man well you know anytime somebody does something great most people like what drugs were you on James was smoking a lot of pot but I could smell something else in there I confronted him about it Brown @pv a previous objection to PCP or angel dust and had freebase cocaine propane Kressley cocaine when you're playing croquette hey you have a little coke but he shrugged it off I think the second I was out of there James was smoking pot laced with other stronger drugs Wow this is from Mick Jagger's James Brown biopic yeah did he I mean what it's Mick Jagger doesn't make jack this is a woman actually said this this is a I'm getting the quote it's from that article that's so funny Mick Jagger being like I'm pretty sure I smell drugs and James Brown's marijuana well this is the Tommy ray - yo am i - yeah t Oh am ia re who was hired by Jagger to be a consultant for the new film is now working with the Rolling Stone star and his team on a two-hour documentary which will set the story over the battle over James Brown's estate Brown was raised in a brothel by his aunt after his mother abandoned him as an infant and his abusive father refused to care for him holy shit her prior to it was this rejection that is believed to have led him to becoming a control fully of control freak in later life wow that's intense man he always insisted on being called mr. Brown even by me she smiles it was about respect this man this was a man who came from nothing who dragged himself up by his bootstraps he had talent he was ahead of his time what do you plan up here why are you showing us well on Wikipedia it was it's saying for the majority of his career Brown carried around a strict drug and alcohol free policy with any member in his entourage including band members firing people who disobeyed orders hmm but they said in the nine however in the 1980s is alleged that Brown himself was using drugs after meeting and lady later marrying Andrew Rodriguez oh so early in his career he was drug-free and then later in his life you started fucking hitting it hard no pilot started listen if you really want to do PCP that's the best way to do it what do you undergo snort it like a pussy people snort PCP I'm sure they do man that I went through a phase of watching PCP videos the people on PCP because it looks like they're possessed by demons have you ever seen it like the emergency room videos of people on PCP it's as close as you get to demonic possession like they don't know who the fuck they are they're saying weird shit they have to like strap them down with leather straps but it's like The Exorcist man that a person on a bed those are the stories where you know the cops shoot them nine times and they don't drop it break their dang cuffs shatter their wrists and get them off they say like ancient Sumerian like ghost or darkest was on the way I already tell you about my old boxing coach now my old boxing coach was on PCP and he got his finger bitten off in a street fight his finger on his right hand was gone his index finger that got bidded off so he had his big toe removed and his big toe attached to where his index finger was but permanently curved so that he could still throw right hooks Wow so when you'd shake his hand he would shake his hand you'd get that you would get like a hand and one thing would be curved so he had the doctor fix it and sew it together curved because it was one of two things either would have to stay straight already have to be curved and he went with this so he could still throw right hooks I gotta tell you man I almost want to get my finger a place of my toe just to tell that story he fucks with your footwork fucks with your footwork you're missing your next to big toe your big toe is gone your big toes there but your next to big toe is gone and that was the one you know that long freaking one he had a long freaky one have this shit removed and that was his index finger so he had like a short index finger yeah his finger his index finger is basically like a pinky it's basically like really close to like a pinky what kind of life are you living where whenever you look at your thought your toe finger you're like yeah that was when I was on PCP in that street fight I got to go teach boxing now that's so that's there's so many bad asses out there I didn't end up in this incarnation I didn't become a badass but that seems fun you know that seems like a really cool life like did I tell you about this guy no Joe you never somehow you completely miss telling me that you were trained in boxing by a PCP user who had his finger chewed off he was a longshoreman he was crazy I mean still is a great guy but he was like like one of the toughest guys I've ever met in my life like legit bona fide tough guy his name's Joe Lake he's still a friend of mine from Boston he was he was an animal dude this is a funny story I was supposed to work at a Knicks comedy stop I'm supposed to do an open mic they're not work you know stop by for the open mic night and Joe Lake tells me he goes I know that guy Dominick who runs that fucking place I'll come down to watch so he comes and he sits in the artists big fucking giant Irish guy his murderous puncher just knock people dead you know just tough as shit right and his friend Mike who ran the comic Club one of those bouncers didn't show up so he asked Joe Lake he goes will you help me out we you just watch the crowd make sure you know nobody fucking steals any money or something just gotta stand back there and watch the show and I'll pay you X amount of money because I have fuck it I'll come see the show so he goes and sees the show well there's a guy works for the club that doesn't know that Joe is just doing a favor for Mike Mike Bettes who runs the place all right so he yells at Joe like why don't you fucking kick in his hand hit this heckler out you fucking idiot he goes that's your fucking job you go kick that guy out and Joe picks him up and slams him against walls literally lifts him in the air and it's holding up against the wall he goes I don't know who the fuck you think you're talking to but you talked to me like that and you're going to the hospital and then he puts him down and he just puts a finger in front of his face and he goes okay and he walks away and the guy is just guy was a hundred and fifty pounds at the most Wow Joe's a big guy and I show up at the open mic night and Joe shows up and this guy who works the club sees Joe and turns white like a sheet and Joe walks over to him puts his hand on his shoulders like his tower knows puts his hands on him and he says this is my friend over here Joe Rogan he's up and come a very funny kid you know you should give him some work and the guys like looking at me I never worked that Club ever take forever to get into that Club I did four years I did all the other clubs I couldn't do that Club they wouldn't let me I couldn't do weekends I'm so glad the story ends like that it's so much cooler than getting mafia into a comedy club well I won't say the name of this club but this club was famous for paying people in cocaine this club was run by run by people of unscrupulous connections allegedly I do not know whether or not any of it was true but I had witnessed things that would lead me to believe that it probably was true I think I know the clever sands it's like fucking Candyman but the guys are ready they were good guys it was a terrible situation if that hadn't happened I probably would have got along with him fine right and I eventually did they had to realize that I didn't have a grudge and I do I was in it he was embarrassed you know that this guy now was in the club again and he couldn't do anything about it the whole thing was a mess you know is a mess and that guy always like had it out for me because he just thought you had brought a thug to get your way on stage exactly I'm sure that's exactly what he thought I was fucking terrified but when you meet guys like that it's like Reid you go you got to go oh there's a guy like that out there yeah if you ever start thinking that you you know like oh I'm a fucking bad-ass all my men tell that he's different than me but now you need a meanie guy who got his finger bitten off in a fight because he was on PC hand his toe sewed in place of that fucking finger so in a way that you said I get punched in a way so that you can keep punching exactly it served if I got in a PCP street fight if it ever happened like somehow I'm I don't know my fucking neighbours mad about the laundry room or something and we getting that PCP fuel Street where my neighbor bites off my finger and I'm in the hospital and they're like we can put your toe back on I'm not gonna be like can you just make sure you put it on the way I can keep fucking fire well he was a boxer and he was a boxing coach I met him because I was working at this this gym I was teaching Taekwondo at this Nautilus plus place in Revere and there was this gym that was attached to it like a kickboxing gym and I took over I was teaching the Jae Hyun Kim Taekwondo Institute's classes and they're in Revere and he was a boxer that would come by and use the weights and all that stuff right and we just became friends and so we exchanged techniques he would teach me on a box I was teaching my the kick that's cool we became friends I was like oh my god this guy's fucking crazy he's the best though like a great guy that's cool to be a martial artists then I have memories like that you know like what one day they're gonna I don't have memories like that but that would be those are cool memories this would be cool memories man I love that I'd love to be like be able to like yeah you know that my Starcraft coach you know closest I've got to that kind of company kind of competition that's close I got well for me was so long ago I feel like I'm lying when I told stories like I know they're all true and that I can verify them and I'll call my friends were they're like my good friend Steve Graham who I'm still friends with we'll talk about the old days all the time but when I talk about it it seems like a lie like doesn't seem like it was really happening it doesn't it doesn't seem like a lie to me no no I mean to me oh I'm that was my life oh I'm sorry now you may no no no no I'm saying in my life when I tell the story I got no matter I saw him again a couple years ago he really does have a fucking her permanently curved he's a great guy but I mean when I tell that story like that I'm like no I didn't make that up I really know that guy I knew a dude who's arrested when I was living in Boston because someone had killed the sky and broken virtually every bone in his body and continually injected him with cocaine to wake him up when he would black out and they kept breaking his bones probably with like a hammer or something like that I probably like hitting him with a sledgehammer and just breaking his body and when he would pass out from the shock that inject him with cocaine and they did that over and over and over again until they eventually killed them and then they chopped him up into little pieces and this guy I know got arrested for that and I don't know if he did it and I don't know if he didn't do it but I know who he seems a scary guy he was a scary guy that went to jail for several years why did the guy do that they were doing it oh yeah I have no idea but it's a big story it was a big story in the news and then when my friend got arrested for it I was like okay now I shouldn't say friend training partner guy who showed up the same gym as me I mean we've never you know didn't have my house I just want it Joe that's one of the worst fucking things I ever heard spring well every time you finally fall into the abyss finally you're like it's over it's over I'm missing out you get a cocaine rush yeah they killed that guy slow I don't know what he did I mean he must have done something awful or something must have gone awful I don't who fucking knows but I knew a lot of people like that that's the weird thing about like fight gyms as you come in contact with some really scary people sometimes right you know people who want to learn how to defend themselves people want to learn how to kill people people who are training not out of some kind of recreation or the enjoyment of a sport but actually your training because they have to daily get into fights and torture people well there was a guy that used to come to our gym that legitimately was a hit man it was a legitimately hit man for the the Irish mob in Boston and he would literally ask how how would you kill somebody in this situation would you do and he was a very nice guy like he was very quiet and very nobody he was almost like a guy who knew some exciting shit was about to happen so he could stay really calm most of the time until the exciting should happen so like when you would train with this guy like I help this guy out a little bit we did some drills with them and showed him some stuff and he was very common in the sky was a killer he was very calm and very relaxed and I knew sort of who he was or what he was so it was really weird showing him all this stuff you know I was just trying to get him to respect me and I was just trying to teach him the best I could and just ignore all that bullshit so I don't know what you do I don't want to know what you do I'm just gonna show you this is the best way to do this shit and I was teaching them and they're a fucking wino getting arrested he wound up getting arrested for murder like he's in jail for like I don't know how he was a part of that whole whitey bulger thing when all that whitey bulger shit went down there's a great if you seen that Brad Pitt movie where he plays a hit man you know the one that's what James Gandolfini his last movie yeah was it killing him softly that's it pretty fuckin good movie to get movie man really good but it's sort of the like it was the the elections it was Bush versus what were the elections going on in the movie it was like it was like throughout the entire movie on TVs it's playing the elections because it's trying to make this amazing comparison between the new mob like the mob it evolved or a change into what kind of corporate structure to the United States having also shifted to this corporate structure where there's this kind of diffusion of responsibility and Brad Pitt is sort of the embodiment of that kind of like diffusion of responsibility because his point of pride was that the way he killed people was by surprise they didn't know that they were getting killed yeah and that's a like that makes it any better you know that's somehow like that's like a good quality to have but god it was a great movie man but it's also great cuz it wasn't just a hitman movie I love the Gandolfini character oh he was so awesome so out of control and it would you saw him just ramped up the out of control he just got more and more crazy the movie when I was like oh yeah it was like one of his best roles I thought it was just just like he's because you really believed he was that guy he looked like he was so fat he was having a hard time breathing you can tell it irritable he would be like in real life when he would fucking scream and spit would be flying out of his mouth holding onto a drink he nailed I didn't even know he's in the fucking movie that was just one of those movies where a friend said it's good and I was just like laying in bed watching Netflix it's like god damn this is a good movie James Gandolfini was a bad motherfucker yeah dude that Tony Soprano character was the greatest in my opinion the greatest individual character in any show ever yeah I think you're right man I think he was I mean if not the greatest I mean it's a certain maybe there's an equal level that they all reach at some some place but that was like right up there yeah he was a he was a badass like him and Rhoda like right there and who Rhoda Mary Tyler Moore's friend under fire no on Japanese Godzilla monster yeah I was just trying to think of a silly character Lou grant him and Lou Grant no [Music] rotor character always creeped me out Ricky Schroder no no Silver Spoons wouldn't know the guy that was on his fucking podcast bro be nice the guy toys were denim jackets and he used to be like the the the maintenance guy for was it Mary Tyler Moore or oh oh I know you're talking about god damn it not Schroder what the fuck was his name Schrodinger's cat no that was literally yeah there was the guy on that show where the girl got super addicted to drugs right know one day at a time one day at a time what was the dude's name from one day at a time well I'm dead it's hot isn't it weird that you can like almost any sitcom from like back in the day you can move it on up to the side yeah you could just sing the song you know the song to addy it locks up Potvin in the sky what's his name creepy guy but find out his name have you seen the too many cooks thing yet no no I keep hearing about I'm scared I'm scared I'll be too awesome pretty awesome it's gonna be too awesome and take up all my time what was his name Freddie Mercury there was always those guys where you would uh Schneider that was his name Schneider Wow there was always those guys that were like the guys who worked in the building where you lived or carmine Ragusa did he work the big ragu yeah and we're at the plant with Laverne and Shirley shots quillery oh my god I forgot about Lenny and Squiggy dude I met Epstein from Welcome Back Kotter once yeah shit yeah Epstein from Welcome Back Kotter was on Newsradio he played my brother him and Nick DiPaolo and Brian Cowen we all played brothers and he was the regulator came in with a baseball bat beat the shit out of all of us it's back when you could do that shit on TV can you beat people up on TV anymore is it allowed yeah yeah you can I think you fuck yeah look at the well I guess the walking dead doesn't kind of this dude does it not count as a kid what the fuck man this year is so horrific violence exactly the way it's supposed to be yeah god that's what the comics are like that's what it was like that's what that's exactly why the comics are so badass is there this season is finally hitting the pitch that the comics hit which is just extraordinary violence and insane hopelessness exactly what it would be it's so badass that's why the comics were good yeah and that's the only way a show really works is it got it has to continually ramp it up and outdo itself yeah I'm right religion religions say stayed and static it can't change because it either does that or it falls off and jumps a shark yeah those are two like it goes Dexter or it goes Walking Dead yeah oh God Dexter sure as fuck jump the shark start off so good so sad I just I just started watching an episode of Dexter on a plane and I was so saddened by what it what happened they gave up they gave up and phoned it in uh something happened where they ran out of juice for someone it could be some political things some people got involved it shouldn't got involved like some guy like maybe he was a producer for coach never that show that's the fucking sitcom this guy was underrated wings was not a bad show Satan church was fucking hilarious on wings that guy was great that guy's a great actor man he's a creepy actor like he pays off yes good I interviewed him once for later on NBC you know one of those shows later he's a fucking great guy like he was really cool like we had like a total normal conversation like he was like a regular dude it's always like super nice when you meet another guy was I gonna sitcom it was a fucking regular guy Chris Hardwick is really nice like I did Chris Hardwick's podcast last night yeah fucking great conversation with them like the longest I've ever talked to him I've only sound like hey what's up man how you doing what's going on never listen to his podcast but his first like real conversation I had to sit down with him it's a fucking really nice guy like a really nice guy really smart guy good worker fuck yeah yeah how many shows is he has a million show he's on more shows than anyone's ever been on a bet but my point being he's a normal dude like you meet him he's totally normal you don't I mean like you meet him there's no there's no weirdness thank God man that's yeah that's always such a depressing mind fuck when you run into somebody who's got success and they're assholes because it seems to disrupt the principles you've come to understand that allows success to grow into your life which is being sweet and generally being a giver it's such a weird thing when you when you and it's a rare creature well some people are so fucking talented then it's almost like you'll let them get away with some crazy shit like I never heard James doll know Feeny was an asshole and never heard who's anything other than a nice guy but he was obviously completely out of control who's obviously doing blow and he was drinking he was yeah yeah they found his body at blow on his body I mean whose look you don't get that big unless you're just fucking going off like a rocket you know he was wild he was in the Buddhist he wasn't doing yoga while he's and kale he was a wild motherfucker and I the only way you get a wild motherfucker like that that you can enjoy and those crazy fucking movies and that roll is if he's living like that right you know and it manifests itself in this art is art becomes this wild explosive spit spraying yo fucking piece of shit and just fat redness fucking no hair and you suck and that's that guy you have to that you have to be that guy to do that it's right like it's beautiful there growing a Gandolfini plant you've got a lawyer with Koken wings fucking good motion oh that place I gotta give him I was in a restaurant once in Little Italy before he died and not sure not long before he died either when he came he came walking in and I wished I was famous enough to go say hi you know I wish I was like if I was Brad Pitt I would go over and say hi to James Gandolfini but I don't want to be annoying man and he probably didn't know the fuck i every partisan watch the UFC or fear factor knee that stupid shit so i didn't want to say hi but like anybody that i would want to say hi to he was like right up there and then after he died I was like shit shit I said I couldn't just sit hi should I said hi yeah I didn't want to annoy him though you know just seemed like a douchebag moved go to someone's tables like maybe if I can catch him like if I'm leaving in his lame synchronicity and he's right there yeah what if for whatever reason you interrupt a really nice bite of whatever he's eating and you trigger the heart attack and everyone from now on talks about Joe Rogan killed James Gandolfini and everyone's like What did he say to him What did he say do you know that's why I didn't yell at Buddy Hackett do you know that no Buddy Hackett was screaming at me and I never raised my voice we were on the Last Comic Standing this dude was uh I was one of the judges Buddy Hackett was a judge Monique was a judge this dude was really funny I won't say his name it's really funny but he was stealing jokes it's just like yeah and I and I said all nice things first I said you perform this is awesome you're like I really you know really funny and a lot of energy but I heard those jokes before and one of them was actually from a movie the movie boiler room though the joke was they should put so you people are an island someone says that to a gay guy they should put you people on an island he goes they did it's called Manhattan pretty funny it's a good line this guy did that in this fucking thing on TV and you have to you have to call that out so I tried to do in a nice way tried to say nice things first and then say but I've seen those jokes before don't do that man and I have to say that I can't just let it fly and then you know monique was saying shit like you know oh you made it yours you made it yours you know that might have been something else you made it and then buddy I guess was yelling at me you fucking it so I never what I'm fucking you he's screaming at me because those Catskills guys no God rest his soul all those Catskills guys a lot of them they shared material so like they didn't think about joke writing the way we think about joke writing it was like you know you had an act you went on the road most likely those people are never gonna see you again you go from place to place to place and if you ever get famous and put that shit on TV on The Ed Sullivan Show that's yours you know he did it on the Ed Sullivan Show what are you gonna do you know and they all would like struggle for it didn't become the art form that is now - like their Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor era where it became this new thing so it's almost like what he's talking about as far as comedy and when I'm talking about his comedy is there a totally different thing he's talking about being a band for Bar Mitzvahs and doing and and all with all due respect showing up in these you know these halls where you can have a music band then a guy tells jokes and then Sinatra's gonna come out and play and you know it's not a comedy club and the art form was not established the way it's established now it's it's a different experience for them so I'm defining his experience in a way that challenges his entire career yeah it's like fuck you kid and he's right he's right you know in his world in the world the world that he evolved in and you know that Catskills style comedy they all used each other shit you know they all did that they all would come up with jokes they would remember those jokes they would write a few things down or make a few observations do a little crowd work but they all like there was a really common thing for like high-level guys to you know have joke jokes and that yeah I've heard that it's weird that he decided to go on Last Comic Standing - well you know he's a love guy you know he was everybody was praising him and you know he's a legend little economy but anyway screaming it and I just go I am NOT yelling the Buddy Hackett thank God he died two weeks later dude at the most it was like a month or something like that I mean it was really recent to the point where I was like yeah you gotta be careful man well I'm an idiot too you know when people yell at me especially when I was young my automatic instinct was to fuck you like to yell back you know that whatever echoes of my youth would reverberate my adulthood when I'm supposed to be rational a lot of times did skip the tracks a lot of times it fucking went off the road and into the woods like I would do things that I didn't want to be doing that's he punching he was nicked Apollo to make the Apollo came and scared both of us and then our other brother Epstein came in scared him he had a baseball bat and he was a priest so I go to Adam Carolla's we are doing January 2nd in Las Vegas Nevada Duncan Trussell Ari Shaffir Joey Diaz and moi and we're all of us that's
