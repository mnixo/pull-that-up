Tommy Papa Joey what's going on buddy you looking at that uh tarantula hawk yeah sighs that sucker yeah I found one of those in my tub ones that's straight from maynard's farm Maynard from tool uh-huh yeah he sent me that Wow he found that fucking phone Jesus yeah he was explaining it to me and then he sent me one because he's that's how we roll the coolest you brought Brett you know I'm on this all meat diet I know ring bread fuck but you have a family oh I'll deviate a little bit I'll deviate you might want to take a look at it later idv ated over this weekend yeah I went to Disneyland and I had ice cream and then Friday night or Saturday night Saturday night I had pasta I had all kinds I had Girl Scout cookies a bunch of Girl Scout cookies and dude I'm telling you Sunday my back was hurting really one day my back was hurting everything was like my knee was hurting all this like inflammation it's crazy puffy yeah one day back two days because today's Tuesday so I ate corner warm Monday and Tuesday everything's normal yet no really no more aches and pains so you were full on meat for a whole month a whole month but when 20 meals a day - usually - yeah maybe a small meal around noon after workout and then dinner all right and that no eggs no yeah I eat eggs eggs and fish eggs fish meat me just no no bubbles at all no no fruits no no right of course no I had an olive no two olives and two pieces of chili mango the entire month - glorious a host but the pieces of chili mango I legitimately felt guilty I love chili mango actually never had chili oh my god really now is one of the greatest creations what is it it's chili pepper mango dried mangoes but with chili powder it's uh it's a Mexican big big hit and Mexican community right yeah so because it's got the sweetness from the dried mangoes yeah but then it's got the spiciness from the chili powder oh that's right up my alley ah so good a two pieces I was only gonna eat one I was like fuck it let me have another one eat that second one I'm like oh no what have I done why'd you decide to do it in the first place the diet yeah well because January's world carnivore month and I know quite a few people that have done it and that have had some serious results and serious results with autoimmune issues - well I have vitiligo which is an autoimmune disease it causes you to have these patches where you don't have pigment oh really and this month I have the best results sort of ever had with vanilla about trillions it's it comes and goes it comes and goes depending upon how well I'm taking care of myself treatments and stuff like that but this this month it's got all these spots fill in like a pretty rapid rate really people with eczema I've had spectacular results with it now what if you were to suggest to someone who's wouldn't eat just meat what percentage meet the after going through this do you think you would I think the problem is not plants as much as the problem really is refined sugar carbohydrates and bullshit that's what I think I think that's the problem is cheese counting that you can eat cheese you can eat cheese you're gonna choose really animal product yeah I think for most people the real problem is junk you know candy sugar yeah pasta various glorious bread even that bread that bread is probably better because it is less gluten because you make sourdough bread yeah it's just flour salt and yeast it's healthier for you but no I think bread in general mm-hmm just the the idea of bread is it's a human created product right true you got all that concentrated carbohydrates in a very weird form it's like glue I mean look look what it is when you're making the dough total glue that eventually it comes glue in your stomach I've actually thought that before like that did they like put together cities with this so it like dries for a day it's gonna get off the counter right yeah well you remember when you're a kid you'd make paste yeah you know yeah yes basically flour and water and he'd make like a paste I just posted a I just posted videos on how to bake the bread asking for it so I put a new series on YouTube called getting baked with Tom and I realized what I was making it like this is a long process I've pour videos getting through one loaf of bread over multiple days are you still doing the TV show you were doing a TV show for a while yeah and we're not what was that was called baked on the Food Network how'd that go it went great people really liked it but we're not making any more I don't know why so then I was like well why do I need the Food Network you just keep making it and put it on YouTube it's so much better to put it on YouTube because yeah who can access it anytime they want right this archaic system of waiting for Tuesday night at 8 o'clock yeah that's what they suddenly occurred to me like wait I've got camera you look at you friends look at you yeah have you uh have you varied your process at all since you first started doing this if you added yeah yeah yeah yeah well you get better at it it's just you know it's a it's a skill it's a thing or start to it sounds corny but you become one with it like I know the weights of things just by holding it and I know the timing of things and I know the temperature what that's gonna do and it just is very immersive so yeah I started I started branching out and then also started making bagels and pretzels and stuff like that bagels no don't you have to boil bagels you do yeah so I just take a like a like a Dutch oven just with water in it and boil it up and baking soda and let that kind of bubble up we use a different kind of flour for the bagels no same flour really shameful sourdough flour yeah sourdough photos yes out that's the key like I have so many bad bagels in LA and you know people always talk about it's the water it's this and that and and you know I met I've met this Vito's pizza is a guy from Jersey here in LA that makes great pizza and I'm like so what is it the water with the toe he's like it's just not you know it's just knowing what you're doing he says and I keep running into these bad bagels and I realized the flavor that was coming out with Oh bagels I'm making is because of the sourdough starter mmm it has this different flavor it's a deeper flavor it's not just to use that as the yeast it's to actually make it taste better is it true that the water is different on the East Coast and that is it a more mineral rich water that's what everybody says wouldn't that just be pretty easy to add those elements to water from the west coast you would think and some people say that they like import the water maybe that's why people are less flavorful over here you know they're not filled with all that you know I mean flavorful like Joey Diaz like mad flavor yeah yeah like that he's got flavor yes and he's got like charisma yeah the thing you don't you don't get a lot of that out here no you don't it's yeah it's different it's just different it's a chill well even people that do have flavor out here it's like they take the flavor goes up to seven you're right yeah you got rusty pipes yeah rats swimmin in it dull generations and right up in there there's yeah it's gonna add to it for sure yeah there's something the water does taste different though what it does yeah like my manager Jeff he loves New York City tap water he's always extolling the virtues of New York City tap water my bro you're crazy I'm not sure yes any day now a hundred people could die from that chair everybody's so proud about it though I am too when we go back with my family like around Christmas we're just there and I'm like you just drink from the tap my kids took a sip of it she's like it tastes like carrots and she was right it was really right yeah kind of like iron charity yeah there's stuff you're not supposed to drink probably a lot of stuff but or maybe you are supposed to drink it right well yeah maybe maybe in Earl's lesson anemic maybe minerals taste bad but yeah good for you mmm-hmm right yeah like hard water when you get hard water isn't that minerals that's minerals right right and it's great to shower and salt your showers in soft water in the soap just never comes off that's trapping hours of what is that I don't know but in my parents town house you take a shower you're gonna have soap on you the rest of the day so did they have a filtration system is that what it is I don't know yeah I guess so must be it must be something that takes the yeah minerals out so when you get like that residue on your shower head that white residue that's hard water that's sperm oh I am so busted [Laughter] that's the only thing I've done maybe like three times my whole life is jerk off in the shower three times yeah it's like never been my thing I've only I think I've probably done it just to say why are some place I've never jerked off I've never jerked off never it's just too hot in there if she's too confusing and frustrated we got to let the water down a little then you just like then you're being a weirdo it's like those guys who lay in bed to masturbate they bring a box of tissues and jerking off supposed to be a maintenance thing that's like you just need it yeah let me just take care of this I'm not obsessed hey let me get a cup of coffee let me do that Jesus Christ people that don't masturbate at all they've got that's got to Q PI too much real estate in your head that there's no doubt about it right well I don't know you could argue that the people that do it all the time although there's a lot of real estate when it comes I think porn in particular is a real issue for people it does not have an obsession yes indeed I remember a buddy of mine was like really into it in the early internet and he started looking at the world through a porn lens it was everybody every girl was owned to be approached like somebody in a yeah oh that's not good anything you watch for that amount of time right it's gonna affect you I've often thought that about violence cuz I've seen so many people get beat up mmm like I'm so comfortable with people getting beat up right like fights like if I see a fight somewhere like a fight breaks out yeah my heart rate doesn't jack up it doesn't it doesn't go oh my god this is crazy I can't believe they're fighting right like look at that bad technique dropping his hands look at this dude oh my god left legs off the ground there's nobody's doing this is the world like it's just go at it I'm like this terrible technique and I'm running some everything coming a mile away that's crazy I see society becoming unhinged yeah I see it becomes normal I think yeah violence becomes normalized like you know I've been reading a lot about Native American cultures lately I've gone through like five books on wild west over the last few months and one of the more disturbing and shocking things is the torture his Native Americans would torture their victims like you know yeah particularly the Comanches the command those were the badasses right they were the badasses yeah they were the reason until they developed a repeating multiple shot revolver and carried a chamber that had more than one bullet they were running shit because everybody else had muskets and shoot multiple arrows you know they could they would there's a if you ever heard if there's a guy named Lars Anderson you know who is yeah he's a famous YouTube famous archery expert uh-huh and he going through old texts and old artistic depictions realized that the idea of a back quiver where you would reach back to grab an arrow and then put it on the string and then pull it back and shoot the that's not accurate that what they actually would do is put the arrows in between their fingers and they developed technique they would draw and pull and draw and pull and draw just release one at a time yes and they would go from finger to finger so they literally could shoot an arrow a second Wow and so this guy he actually shows how he can do it not just in theory you know they're all they're holding in some of the depictions you see that they're holding multiple arrows in their hands right instead of in a quiver and so he figured out how to do it it where he can shoot multiple arrows in a second and see if he can get to him she's so like see he's doing that that's him pulling arrows out and this is what the Comanche did yes and the Comanches were able to do that and when they were able to do that they were able to shoot the American settlers and the the US Army soldiers and when multiple times before they could get off another bullet because they had a pack a chamber see how he's she because he keeps all the arrows in his fingers and so he tucks them in his finger and they just grabs it with the other hand draws it back so they were actually winning the war for exactly for hundreds of years hundreds for hundreds of years and it was so crazy what they would do is the US government would give people allotments of land saying hey Oklahoma is a beautiful place why don't you guys move there and you can get a thousand acres of land like whoa golly I'm gonna take my family moved to Oklahoma and what they were basically using them was cannon fodder for the Comanches so they would send these people in they just get slaughtered yeah because they wanted to try to figure out how to settle this land rent they wanted these people to kind of fight the battles with the Comanches and then the soldiers eventually would move in and then they set up forts so they were just put out as bait yes they're put means it's horrific whether it's conscious or unconscious or whether it was you know semi aware or you know when they're maybe these people could fix it yeah but they definitely did get slaughtered what part of the country where the Comanche Oklahoma Texas a lot of sections of the West okay they ran things yeah and they were cousins yeah there was they were incredibly nomadic they rode horses they were fantastic with horses they they had the most horses right well the reason the most powerful tribe and they all they ate was meat they would eat buffalo but mostly and you know occasionally berries and stuff like that but mostly their diet consisted of Buffalo's follow the Buffalo and then kill all the other Native Americans they encountered oh really kill all the settlers they encountered other ruthless jeez yeah so the other native Archer the torture is insane cutting people's arms and legs off and throwing them on a fire while they're still alive shit like that he's so they enjoyed it yeah I mean this book that I read empire of the summer moon is all about the Comanches this guy SG Quinn was in here and he kind of explained how he found out about it when he moved to Texas and he moved to Texas and started delving into the history of the Comanches and the war that the Texas Rangers the Texas Rangers the original Texas Rangers were created to combat the Comanches they were these super badass soldiers that dressed like Indians and then and they realized they had to learn how to fight on horses because the Comanches actually shot arrows on horses whereas the original US soldiers would get off the horse to shoot a shot it was ineffective right Comanches would run up on them and fill them up with arrows it was crazy they would kidnap all these white settlers and take their babies and take that killed her babies take their children incorporate their children into the tribes rape the women torture and kill the men Wow but they were nomadic they didn't know it so they didn't settle create little town always moving around only tents and they followed the Buffalo yeah so just like seasons they would stay in an area for a little did we just follow the Buffalo wherever the Buffalo were that's where they would go geez yeah but the the thing about it is it's to me so strange that cultures can become comfortable with extreme violence like very comfortable yeah right well anything that you're just exposed to all the time you know we're pretty violent society right we see a lot of violent images all the time we see it but in terms of like day to day violence now compared to just a couple of hundred years ago no you radical drop off yeah you'd have to choose to digest it now yeah you'd have to choose but a lot of people do choose yeah but also you can put yourself in a little bubble and like it doesn't really exist or you can get into a murder bubble just like some people get into a porn bubble right you can just get into like watching people get slaughtered oh yeah right yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna watch other yeah bread comes out tonight right at midnight as though it is last midnight last night so it's out right now it's out Oh My Jesus it's done it's out are you with it I am happy with it how many years did you work on it two and a half that's a good number yeah close to three yeah that's a good number yeah that seems like to polish an act get it tight tour with a little bit and then almost get to the point where you're done with it yeah almost sick of it yeah where something started that's how I can tell and jokes start to peel off mm-hmm is you're not you done with them yeah and then out of the ones you ever do you ever have when you get close to taping all of a sudden something new pops in and makes the lineup oh yeah last minute of course you know of course yeah other stuff you've been working on him really trying to perfect it for a couple of years and then all of a sudden something shows up like the last week that's a killer yeah I think it's just you're in that space yeah and yeah I shot it in Newark Newark yeah really yeah why Newark I'm from Jersey I'm a Jersey guy that was born in Newark yeah and I just feel like I just have a real affection for all those great New Jersey cities that have been just destroyed by corruption Passaic Patterson Trenton Newark all these great places that were system yeah corruption yeah corruption there's a ton of money in New Jersey there's a ton of money people getting taxed like crazy and then these politicians multiple times going to jail for abusing the system and getting busted and bribery and just it's just awful just really and it just became real violent places and people start moving out and I really think it's gonna come back they're just too great it's like Asbury Park hit the Jersey Shore mm-hmm used to drive through there and was just bombed to help with these great big Victorian homes right on the beach it's like how's this place not just kicking ass and the only way that it over works the gay community comes in and says well this is nice and we're gonna fix it they saved Asbury Park Asbury Park absolutely so I think it's gonna come back so I just wanted to in a little way just shine a little light on Newark so Asbury Park is basically a gay neighborhood now I don't know if it's a gay neighborhood but it's a good healthy gay population and so they buy these Victorians that are on the beach and are they valuable now yeah yeah the real estate's really come up there only makes sense right there's only so much beachfront property exactly I mean look at Mountain Malibu's preposterous I've looked at houses in Malibu that are on the beach oh my god it's hilarious yeah like create like doesn't make sense money millions of dollars for a house that looks like it cost 150,000 exactly yeah that in North Carolina probably would yeah right and should yeah yeah no it's crazy but there's so it's limited there's not that much especially in that area you know the Jersey Shore the whole coast it's like Manhattan it's the same thing yeah but it's a that I do feel like there's I mean you look back and you read all these books from like Philip Roth and stuff he was from Newark and it was just this thriving place with industry and people living their lives and then it became as real darkness and it feels like I'm full that it the population will succeed and tearing them over hmm so what was the theater that you went to the Performing Arts Center the Victoria theater and it's like this Performing Arts Theatre there it's beautiful great space it's this with little downtown it's where the Devils are playing and then that's before they moved and it's like this one square block I mean you get on a train you're in Manhattan in ten minutes right so is this great theater I did two shows there I'd perform there before it's north got a lot of fans in Jersey yeah it's slowly you know parts of it you know it's tough you know two steps forward and two steps back we've done some UFC fights there oh yeah yeah oh right because you couldn't do New York grace for a long time right so we should do it in in in New York yeah yeah you know there's beautiful downtown area really great beautiful Whole Foods and Nike really yeah beautiful in Newark yep beautiful and then you know you get it to the outer you go a couple more blocks it's a different story when I first moved to New York I stayed with my grandfather in Newark oh yeah my grandfather bought a house in Newark and like the early I guess it was probably the 40s he bought a house there and stayed there till he died oh really North ninth Street and it was originally an Italian neighborhood and then it slowly became a bunch of different kinds of neighborhoods they did a thing called blockbusting where real estate agents would come and say hey black people are moving into this neighborhood you got a sell now or your real estate value is gonna drop what yeah and my grandfather was like fuck you I like black people why would I move he wouldn't move man but the neighborhood changed from an Alitalia neighborhood to a black neighborhood and then and then it eventually became a bunch of different immigrants right and then when I stayed there and this was probably 88-91 and 91-92 that's when I lived there it was bad man yeah next-door neighbor got his a house broken into by the cops that battering ram his front door he was selling crack oh my god yeah in racket my grandfather knew that kid from the time he was a little uh terrible you know he's watching this kid grow up to become a drug dealer again in like a nice outie that he kept parked in the driveway right behind a gate yeah I was spending all that crack crack money my sister runs this nonprofit I think I've talked to you about it called City green out of Clifton and they create all of these city gardens and take over farm lands I can Passaic and Patterson and mm-hmm and it just really bring these young kids in it has like these learning gardens and these school programs with these kids from Paterson and Passaic come in and they're just like these young little kids that don't understand like we're vegetables come from their parents their families are blown apart and they're just like there is thirsty as the vegetables they are they just want love and learning and what are useful and they just it's so inspiring the sea and if you if you can get kids at that age like four five six seven if you can get them there that's gonna change everything hmm you can come in and help these kids out and give them a lifeline that seems like where most of the change can happen yeah if you can catch them when they're young you have them a positive direction to go into that's one of the things that I talked about a bunch of times in the podcast like we spend so much money overseas to try to replace dictators and get rid of fucked up governments when we spend so little time going into inner cities and trying to give young kids chance I know give them opportunities create community centers do something where you give them an alternative to drugs and crime and gangs and and all the shit that plagues those errors that's where you really believe and I've talked to other people that are really into philanthropy and they all seem to think that that's the way to do it one of those are young get them when they're young but what the program is is difficult and you got to try and get the parents involved with it and all that but if you can do that there's I mean well that's how you're so inspiring when you see these kids then move up to high school and they're just you know you I grew up with kids that were you know okay and so lazy in comparison to these kids they just suck everything in and want to do well and they're inspiring these kids will just kick ass what do whatever they have to do to learn do whatever they have to do to get into college they're just really like some of the best people you could possibly make hmm and because they're thankful that they have that opportunity and they understand that they could have gone a bad way right a lot of people that they grew up with yeah and they see in their neighborhoods you know there's there's a there's trouble this this is not this isn't this isn't guaranteed that things are going to go right for me you know right it's amazing that there hasn't been more time and effort invested by the government to try to clean up these terrible neighborhoods it's just not immediately profitable and I guess every politician has for you in office mm-hmm yeah it's really I know it's like I did a I did a fundraiser in Newark this is where I got the idea to do the special there I did a fundraiser it wasn't a fundraiser it was um like a awards dinner kind of thing for this prominent lawyer and all these politicians were there and they all seemed like you know people with good intentions and whatever and then you walk out into into the city and on the way to the airport it's like man this is some of these areas it's like how this is those people were nice but it takes it'll take thousands of those people to really all work on that problem like I don't know how you do it but you know when I travel around touring and I'm sure you see it too in every city all of a sudden there's these tent cities just popping up homeless people that wasn't around when I started touring like in the middle of New Orleans in the middle of every city San Francisco the Upper Midwest you know there's just all of a sudden these camps of homeless people yeah that did not exist before no Los Angeles is staggering I mean there's basically a small city inside the city yeah there's right now they're bordering on 70,000 people 70,000 70,000 people live on the streets in Los Angeles just in LA just in LA and because la never really gets cold really rains ten times a year it's really not that hard if you have a tent you can live outside yeah and they do I mean they did full-on tents and they string them all together mhm and to create little villages yeah there's uh the underpasses like all throughout LA now are filled with tents yeah yeah no it's incredible it is how much of it I have no idea but how much of it is mental illness how much of it is just economic I'm sure it's all the above yeah it's a bunch of different factors but you know mostly if you your instinct well mental illness for sure was what started out the wave of homeless people during the Reagan administration because they changed the criteria for people being able to you know be confined to a mental health institute they they released a bunch of people they changed what what constituted you being mentally ill whereas before there were asylums right get help in counseling and maybe even get out but now they just kick those people out or then they could just kick those people out right and I remember it because how old you I'm 50 yeah I'm a little old in um 52 so when I was early 52 uh-huh when I was uh I guess I was like in high school or right after high school yeah Hagen was in office all that shit was going down and people were freaking out because all of a sudden there was homeless people wandering around the street right and there that didn't exist before and people were really angry they were like these are mentally ill people and now they're just wander and you know I lived in Boston it was fucking really cold yeah to see people wandering around at Boston it's definitely always a a large portion of people that truly truly need help yeah right it's not just that you know they're lazy you don't just go get a job like there's major issues and there needs to be some kind of a safety net to help these people and you could just see it I mean it's so weird to be it's it's popping up in LA in areas that it never was before yeah and even what-what is lazy right like how many people that are late that lazy that they're homeless how many people are mentally ill there's got to be a lot of a lot you know I mental illness is a weird thing right because it's got such a stigma attached to it but and I think there what is wellness right what's mental wellness maintaining a beautiful state of mind a peaceful relaxed calm thankful filled with gratitude you know loved happy that's healthy right mm-hmm everyone experiences some mental illness just like everyone experiences some physical illness but it's a matter of whether or not it becomes chronic and prolonged and what it does to you and the people around you and some people have it way worse to some people have way worse physical health right yeah some people have way worse mental health and some people it deteriorates and sometimes you could be like on the right track and some stuff happens to you and within six months you're in trouble you know what I mean it's a it's a it's a tricky situation to kind of maintain we're a lot more fragile than we like to pretend we are yeah it's one of the beautiful things about being a comic is that we have a real community uh-huh you know I mean we have a really beautiful supportive community of like-minded weirdos it's it's it really is true I know like is there a place that other people get to go to that we get to go to like the store where everybody's hugging everybody everybody sees everybody I know so friendly I was thinking about that I was I was at I was leaving and everybody every time you leave a club whether it's the store or the seller in New York everyone's always asking are you gonna be here tomorrow you're gonna be around where you going you're gonna be like everyone cares about they want to see you again and they want to know if you're coming back and I was like that's such a wonderful thing yeah this isn't an office this is no this isn't people that are being made to see you every day right but if if you're leaving the store and we say goodnight it's like are you gonna be here tomorrow yeah are you coming back to the Playhouse yeah we're looking for yeah we're real lucky in that regard because I don't think musicians have a spot like that where they get you know do they feel isolated if they're not with their band or their family yeah isolated yeah and it's and it's interesting because the LA it's the stories revival I think is given it a sense of place because coming from New York I felt when I was out here like oh Khomeini's just roll into the laughs action and then get in their car and they're gone there's no hangout yeah there's nothing there and The Improv had it for a while and they messed with the bar and they moved it to the other side and ruined that was such a great place they ruined I know and it's it hasn't got its mojo back how do you get a mojo back I don't know have you ever seen that photo of The Improv where it's Jay Leno he's got a pipe yeah yeah in the bar and everyone's in the bar the bar is packed with people I know and it's this weird sort of photograph of you know capturing time yeah and that was what it was like when I first started coming here there was basically two schools there was the Improv School and then there was the Comedy Store school right and then there was the Laugh Factory just like the stepchild right it was weird yeah it's a little weird cuz Jamie used to work at the comedies door he was a dishwasher there and then left to start his own comedy club yeah you would you know the industry people would go to the improv that was all like people that were angling to get on sitcoms people that were squeaky clean right and then the deranged weirdos we're all hanging around at the store yeah and it's comfortable there for them but a new wave the new revival the store is very different totally different very different but it still has that shadows of that there's something like there's still some deranged yeah it's in the walls it's baked tomorrow [Laughter] be able to build a place like that it would have already exist yeah because if you try to build a place in 2020 sadar we're gonna build a new Comedy Store we're gonna put it over here and a Silver Lake and we're gonna this is this and that and that and we're gonna make it like the Comedy Store yeah it would feel like a hotel bar Encino hotel long yeah yeah why is it echoey what's wrong here there's no soul it places have a soul and that place has a hoof so a lot of Dark Souls a lot of mixed up Souls yeah that's a weird point of contention with scientists and with people that are open to more weird ideas yeah that things have a field to them that things even have a memory to them oh yeah I believe that a hundred percent I do too but if you you know if you talked to a brilliant scientist they would dismiss that instantaneously they think they were all brilliant but they're not open to everything they're acting all smart with their little test scores and their lab coats but walk into an old hotel in Italy and tell me that you don't feel something something there that history I'm not saying it's all ghosts coming up and giving you belly rubs something till they have that dismissive need to refer to be a reductionist to reduce everything down to its core components and dismiss any soul it gives you control right it gives you an idea like that this crazy madness is some how manageable like I do it too in my life you know I organize my desk and I get my thing and I get my schedule and okay everything's okay this isn't chaos ya know who we're not all gonna be this this isn't completely out of my control I'm controlling this at least my pens over there yeah and my books over here right I would think that that's what it is and if you can't if you can't justify it with facts and numbers then it doesn't exist well I don't know because certain places always seem to have a personality and there's there's more there's more going on I did just because we haven't figured it out yet doesn't mean that that stuff doesn't exist no I agree even this room even this place like you know you moved here right this would be this is the old place was the thing but this feels different now than when you first showed up it's got stuff there's got there's some memories there's some things have happened there's like it feels comfortable here well we got this desk too there's the same desk from the beginning this desk is soaked in with people's palm sweat and weirdness good feelings and weird feelings yeah and it wouldn't have come from something that wasn't wood yeah no I agree and this is also reclaimed farmhouse wood yeah yeah this is all from some Russian farm this is all reclaimed oak all the shit is like a hundred years old Wow yeah where Russia mmm we decided to get this wood one of the things when I was building this I said can we get wood that's old yeah and so we we figured out that there was ways you get like really old oak and so Eric the guy who made all this got this really old Russian oak and cut it all down and trimmed it and you know right everything's all you know it's like got cracks in it and it's it's expanded and it has personality it's alive yeah it's alive if it's not alive I mean it's it's organic that's probably to describe ya know that it has a difference and then you know if you want to go further and talk about the ghosts that show up that we show you the picture of my ghost you have a picture of a ghost didn't I show you that did I ever show you that Jamie I don't think so you have a ghost I have a ghost where your house I apologize if I'm repeating myself I don't know if you are I don't remember this all right but I'm I got one of those nest cameras oh the nest cameras captured it goes those yeah and I was at the Comedy Works in Denver and it goes with you again he opens for me you know you want an opener that you can trust yeah and I got an alert on my email the first time like if you if it senses movement and it alerts you and I open it up and there's my dog Bella just in the thing like this is so cool I'm just like I mean I'm in Denver and I'm looking at my office and I thought wouldn't that be a cool beginning of a horror movie if you get an alert on your phone and back at home there's a guy just staring in the camera right that's a good premise for a movie so then I as I'm saying that to my opening act who wasn't a ghost I get another alert and then this comes up oh yeah you can see it up there okay why do you have a picture of Chris D'Elia on your wall Krista Leah we just found out look at that bro that's D'Elia Chris keep away from Tom something you might not know I love D'Elia but that's George Carlin that's a man with a wrench yeah or a man in a trench coat with an Uzi this is 10 o'clock at night the only people home or my wife and my daughter this is on the second floor there is no shadow coming in the thing it's a ghost that's a legitimate as a person that's not a person for sure my wife is the only one in the house hmm and you think that's a gun in his hand it could be a clipboard maybe he's just a really annoying surveyor from the dead he's like a few moments of your time video of it was it moving or something no but I have a video of another thing in the same office so I could show you this is weird yeah it looks way different in this picture when it's small than it does when it's large which is scarier when it's large it looks more like a person can make it even bigger Jamie can use make his image larger hmm I have a ghost in my house and then we hear things yeah see it does seem it seems like you know the light is behind him right like yeah you like you the outside right edge of it is sort of highlighted like there's a light behind him mm-hmm doesn't look a gun though it is weird and it could be a gun and then I got this video could be a sawzall for Brad he's got a fixer and a big electric serrated chef's knife and chop up some bread bro so have you ever had an experience that you could say you think is probably a ghost cause that everybody in the house has had a little something is your household it's not old how well like poltergeist writers over over an Indian burial ground you never know I'm Tom Tom ya never know what look at this video in the same office from the nest you got a video what's going on did the thing move no can you press play again okay the same camera what's that it's a bug bro it's a bug 100% that's a bug how do you know it's a bug because it's a bug it's moving into the camera it flies around its doing loop dee-licious that's a bug it's probably a moth oh my god you're a little fruitcake crazy person that is not that's no bug you're a crazy person look how it's sailing so what they call is a fruitcake fruitcake is not that's a gay person that's a gay person but you can call someone a fruitcake of their nuts too right isn't it yeah nuttier than a fruitcake yeah yeah yeah look how that okay let go that's no broad look at that that is a bug you're out of your mind that's a bug do you want to see I would bet drop it to me real quick all right I would be all-in but that's above all right that's not it goes it's Tinker Bell that's what it is your house is invaded by fairies but that ghosts my I believe in ghosts really and yeah I do and then my wife yeah we've all had little things go on in the house a little thing my wife thought someone was standing right behind her she's doing the laundry thought it was my daughter and turned in this note oh that's about thank you let's watch this let's watch it so everyone at home can laugh crazy tom pappas here we go well if you first watch the bug oh look oh yeah a flat paper just she's a paper ball bugs look like a fortune cookie dude it's a bug listen to me there was there's a thing that I got sucked in to stop any bug that's a video artifact it's because it's moving very fast and from the screen there's a precedent to this you have a low resolution camera that's in front of your desk yeah this is a security camera low resolution doesn't take a lot of frames per second the reason why it's so elongated is because it's passing by this camera and the thing is taking multiple exposures huh Wow while it moves through there's a thing called is that George Carlin behind your desk yeah that's the daliyah that's the chris d'elia it moved to the it's George Carlin's oh who actually that's George Carlin that's pretty cool you got that above your desk yeah um the there's a thing called Roswell Rods see how it looks all long like that uh-huh and Roswell Rods there was this guy that me and Eddie Bravo back in the smoke too much weed everyday' days we were convinced that there were these things that were moving too fast for the human eye to see and there there's gelatinous jellyfish-like creatures they're shaped like a - that's the idea see how they look see those things yeah yeah where'd you get the idea you'd seen a video see that one that black-and-white one word show right right above your cursor Jamie to the right right there click on that one yeah that sort of iconic image of the well rod had me convinced like oh my god there's these things in the sky and the only way you could capture them was with video cameras so it set these video cameras up and they would get these things on video and this guy made this documentary I think a couple of documentaries I think if you go to Roswell Rods dot-com the whole website dedicated to it yeah it is nothing but a video artifact once there's a show called one of those monster shows fucking one of those Wright History Channel shows or Discovery Channel shows yeah and they solved the mystery they set up two cameras in front of this fireplace or this fund this campfire yeah one of them was a campfire me know I think it was actually a lantern whatever it was they set up these two cameras one of them was standard resolution and the other wasn't was HD so one of them captured multiple frames per second like many many many frames were a very high resolution and in that one you clearly see bugs clearly very easily defined bug in the other one yeah that's low resolution and it doesn't capture as many frames per second all those images are stretched out and it looks like tubes so in the exact same place at the exact same time with two cameras right next to each other two very different images one of them is all stretched out from the low resolution camera like your security camera the other one is high resolution and you can see it's clearly a bug I guarantee you 1,000,000% that is a fucking bug alright I'll buy that one see if you find it I'm convinced but that other one here it goes lover bro I love all of it I love being in a spooky old house a nice old church theaters The Comedy Store belly room scares me sometimes yeah I've taken people up there I go just just stand here and tell me if you don't feel weird in the belly room there's something about the belly room I go above those stairs it's just like there's something about that room especially when there's no show going on it just feels like your body's telling me you get the fuck out of here right let's get out of here so what is that your bitch the back one off the main room the dressing area whenever you're back yourself that's a weird feeling that's a sketchy spot yeah that's a really weird feeling where Kinnison said he saw like didn't he see like a quarter move in the air he ate a pound of cocaine now guy snorted so much coke who the fuck does what he saw is he's not a good know well Carla Boh who's Kinnison sidekick had a great story about getting kicked out of the comic store and he told it on stage one night then he got kicked out not of the comic store excuse me kicked out of his home gotten to fight his wife you know get out fuck you you know I'm going to goddamn comic store yeah so he went to the comic store just because I think he was working security the store so he had keys yes he said I'm gonna sleep on this stage I'm gonna make it one day I want to be a big famous comedian almost this is my fucking stage I'm gonna sleep here so he slept there may be dark main room in the dark and he hears something in the background and he hears like a door click click you like picks his head up pitch black can't see shit hello it's Carl hey I got kicked out in my house I'm sleeping here if anybody's here wondering and then he hears chairs moving clink clink clink clink he's like what the fuck is going on hello and then something grabs him by the ankle it pulls him off the stage into the crowd into where the seats are crashing into the chairs and then boom the door shuts and boom another door shuts and it's gone and he's laying on the ground in in the middle of the main room a bunch of knocked over chairs something had grabbed his ankle and pulled him off the stage Oh or he did a lot of coke with Kissin he was right he was it's a great store that is a great sir didn't he told it on stage one night at the store holy shit yeah that's a good question I've never asked the audience if they feel weird in there no I don't think they do they're drunk they're drunken they're watching a show they're having a good time yeah they're there for fun the basement feels weird you had such a funny I saw you like a week ago working stuff out on the main stage that whole thing about back of the hand oh yeah I don't talk I won't get what I want I know working that butt that whole area was so funny oh thank you yeah it's uh it's the most rewarding feeling ever when you have a chunk and it's just like become something yeah over to uh you know because in the beginning Oracle it's it's like a plant I know right in the beginning is like a couple of leaves in the stick and hope you fucking we come to trade yeah exactly now it's like a tree yeah well now it's got branches and you can hang from it yeah and like branches it goes off and yeah places so it was fun to watch I can't imagine not doing that yeah you know cause it's the most fun thing to do I know well you get addicted to it too when you don't do it you start feeling like a weirdo oh yeah once you've done it a bunch you know that's it it's yeah you start getting like weird go on vacation for a week when you're living on air what do I do I go to dinners now Thailand do you guys have comedy oh yeah you know comedy at all yeah weird you brought it back to Jamie - oh yeah I gave Jamie I know James gonna come back tomorrow it's a beauty it is a beautiful bread belly he doesn't have a toaster you don't have what do you want Savage I just threw my old one away I was planning on get a new one I never did actually good thing is you can get them anywhere and it's not like they're probably heavy your house before you get home they have their own trucks now I know they've made me so snotty I'm like it it won't be here today you know it's interesting it's like we have this attitude about business right that lamb we want you know it's nice when someone works hard and creates a business and become successful yeah but it's not when they become too successful right it's not when they there they are the business yeah and then we think that's a monopoly we got to break that up yeah I gotta hear a lot of people saying that they should break up Amazon yeah they're too big - a good good so you want to end up so you want to wait five days for a book but the idea is you want other people to be able to open up bookstores yeah I don't know I know I'm not an economically I don't know it's like I'm not a rocket scientist clearly not an economics expert but I know but it's yeah I see the arguments but I also see a little bit of hater in those arguments Thanks for writing that quote from my book my way is you're my friend it was really great when is your book out they can pre-order it now but it was out in May and you can pre-order it where Amazon yeah but they know they are talking about Amazon book is coming out on Amazon that is it's like that's like a ghost it's like they know hey back to the comedy store thing yeah wasn't there a story that someone came in a waitress came in and all the chairs were stacked in a pile yeah but I never talked to that waitress did you know I don't even know if it was a waitress I've talked to people that have had weird experiences yeah but you never know man people are tired in the day there's a lot the power of suggestion but then there's also the reality that that used to be Bugsy Siegel's nightclub and the people were murdered there yeah Bugsy Siegel was a legit gangster and they killed people in that club in that club apparently they killed people in the basement yeah that's the word have you ever been in the base Oh podcaster yeah yeah yeah that doesn't feel creepy a little bit weird it feels a little weird yeah I was weird when I did Argus's show down there fucking material man Argus Argus is a hustler he's always right as no joke no joke at all I saw him kill the other night in the main room on a Saturday night I was like he is fucking good with jokes written like yes I know really current event jokes but tight good solid jokes he's no joke he I follow him a lot I end up going on after him a lot there and I'm just always amazed yeah I mean like not not like just from the headlines kind of this like like a like a late-night show this kind of worked isn't that funny no like funny good jokes and you know he's a guy that never threw in the towel yeah that's the thing about Argus I mean he writes all the time for periodicals he writes jokes for like newspapers like that and he runs I think something crazy like at least 10 a day what yeah well he's in Hollywood he's out there and that the streets are his gym he gets out there yeah we were hanging around a store one night an Argus pulled in with fucking sweatpants on all sweaty and shit huh I go what do you do I'm just getting back from a run he was out there running I was like whoa yeah he's he's the real deal I mean he's been at the store forever from the 70s from the 7 I mean he's to date mitzi he did you didn't know that no yeah who's Mitzi's boyfriend there he is that's Argus Hamilton in a time machine yeah I mean he's been swinging at the store forever look at him that's a night I was in eighth grade oh my god I was in ninth grade I was in high school that was my first year of high school one who's already on the fucking Tonight Show I probably saw him on The Tonight Show you know that's one of the things that inspired me do stand-up is watching Richard Jeni on The Tonight Show Jenny yeah okay watching watching comics do stand-up on The Tonight Show was like one of my favorite things yeah when I want to stand up but come on I'd be in my I had a TV in my bedroom with a 12-inch TV yeah and you know we had rabbit ears get whatever was on regular Network you know yeah people don't even know what that is anymore it's easy folks there's a signal that's in the sky and you can pick up the TV if you put tinfoil on the end of it you'll get even better seasons better reception you had a fuck with the antenna remember like you could stand there I would stand there sometimes and hold it a certain way and you know when it was really great when it snowed right when it snowed out you'd a great surface something something happens with cell phones too you know yeah when it snows outer cell phone reception yeah just there's something going on with I still use one from time to time because in LA depending on where you are there are a lot of free 4k HD stations that are going over just wherever you are through the air and then I'm watching sporting events because that's the clearest it would be because to be better than what you're getting streamed online when a helicopter would go over your house the signal break up the wave yeah how did it affect your toaster so the helicopter the Papa would fuck with the air and that would be messed up to save me it's all waves right yeah Wow weird I remember my we have this tiny little TV room in my grandparents house and the men would sit in there beyond this tiny little couch and I'd have to hold the antenna so they could watch the game so I used to have a wrench to change the channel because the thing broke off remember those little piece of plastic you click click to change the channels and the thing broke off slide in here with a wrench and have to pop pop that's how you change a channel yeah used to keep a wrench on top of the TV yeah remember finding the finding the UHF channels yes Oh like this is crazy penny Floyd was the guy in New Jersey yeah most people don't know who he is I worked with him you did I did stand-up with him yeah it's still out there I think now is he really yeah my cousins are him in some place in Wayne New Jersey or some dude I did a bob gonzo gig with uncle Floyd on the shore in Jersey me and there he is very nice guy bowtie plaid jackin me and Otto and George oh yeah that makes perfect sense yeah and he's a handsome man I fuckin bombed but he did went on after him ate shit after uncle Floyd yeah ter they didn't want to see me at all would he him would he do songs or what he just do stay I don't remember hmm I don't remember I believe he brought puppets and he had a show on UHF that just went forever forever in New Jersey yeah uncle Floyd show Monday through Friday 6:30 p.m. and he just cable television network of New Jersey it's like public access look at him Wow yeah it was like public accident yeah do you remember public access you used to be able to do your own show you could go down the public access station yeah I did it there was a guy named era Pucci me and I think Todd Parker with the ones we did like when we were both all three of us were open my curse we did a show on cable access TV in Boston we went it was your own show well we just did a show I think we did one episode and I was wearing a dress I forget was like a game show like like a dating show type of deal it's we created ourselves to I'm sure it was terrible yeah but you were doing it it was great yeah and then some one of my friends said did I see you on TV wearing a dress I was like probably great all these maniacs that's the only people that would do it oh boy right there was a porn one in New York there was a porn one it was Hina porny she was famous she was like legendary in New York oh I know he talking right well Howard Stern had a cable-access show didn't he no he had clothes he had wo wor that's right which is like channel 9 and that's right he had a weird gig weird like small show back when Howard Stern was he was still huge but he wasn't huge like he became yeah but he was he was popular yeah he was big at the time he was big but I'm trying to company it was before private parts yeah Fartman during that whole years before then even Jackie the joke man this is the girl the poor girl yeah that's right yeah and she would do it wasn't like you know you couldn't go complete porn but look she'd have yeah she was a so not making fun of it oh that's an SNL sketch font of Robin Bird but she would have liked a lot of drag queens on wholesome pornographic Robin bird sued Time Warner okay and she had a cool voice and she was just she was just a mainstay well do you remember when there was a radio a talk radio channel in LA like Tom Lycus was on and there was two girls that would talk about sex all the time oh yeah yeah I forget they have one of them I think was in Playboy right and they had Tim Conway jr. Conway and Steckler yeah I mean they had there was a channel an all talk radio channel and this was in the 90s I remember because I would listen to it when I was on the way to news radio I would listen to the radio when I was on the way to do the set right to the set yeah yeah it's something in a more our yeah right in the afternoon I was coming home oh that's what you guys were sunset sunset Gower yeah I think we're at CBS Radford originally maybe for a little bit right I did hardball at CBS Radford and then sunset in Gower right and we're looking at all those other shows like real shows like yeah yeah friends everybody has envy it's fun always you're on it's Network show thinking only I could be over there and this day it's one of my fondest memories but there was a time I remember we were all sitting around the set and we we kept getting moved we got moved no less than nine times over the course of five years nine times yeah we just kept getting we see the thing is with shows back then in particular yeah it all is about who owns the show mm-hmm okay if NBC owns the show and you know then you're golden they're gonna put you in the great spot and hook you up on their network yeah we're going to put you like right after friends or right after Seinfeld yes this week yeah how was the Thursday night was the sweet spot yeah they used to call the hammock spot right between friends and Seinfeld well yeah yeah some people would call it that and it was the we were all sitting around the set and one of the guys from the was you know but someone brought in the ratings yeah fuck and then everyone's complaining and it's not and everyone was so down and I was like hey last time I checked we're on fucking TV why I know I know we're not number 80th my friend Lou Morton he would cut he's one of the writers and come in every day with a shirt with sharpie the number that we were on and one day came in and said 88 I was like really like oh fuck news radio oh my god we didn't do well until we got canceled Newsradio did great in reruns that's it got a chance to see how funny it was so yeah yeah it's so weird it's weird how many times that happens - mm-hmm like Arrested Development have a lot of those shows it's all about where it is yeah I know I know it's all about where they put it yeah so wait so the that it was on that all talk radio was that the guy who would was his name who would he would do all the voices who'd do all the characters no he was on a radio show Phil Hendrick oh Henry Hill Henry Wade fill him he would and he still does it if you never heard Phil Henry he's a goddamn genius yeah Phil Hendry would answer the phone and then he would be the caller so he would call up with these ridiculous he would say ridiculous shit yeah were you like how can this guy be real if people get so angry and then other people would call in like that man is so ignorant and then he and you say no Maddie you are ignorant here in front of the Journal of American medicine and he would just go on these and most people were in on the gag yeah I'm right I wouldn't even say most people maybe like 60% of yeah great being parked in front of my house like listening to it like yeah yeah I think he is I think you're right what does he do these days does he have a radio show probably well Henry he's probably working with uncle Floyd Andrew show the philodendron show is it on the radio the youtubes Today Show about iTunes I feel about when I hear about okay that's good like when I hear people that are still doing radio radio Mike Wolfe do you have any other options is there other what can you get out I'm on Sirius XM right now that's different that's definitely means like translating interests you like radio like over the over the air right yeah I know but you know what there is something like I've been I was in a couple towns Columbus Ohio Denver even where they have a strong terrestrial radio thing mm-hmm station that's popular Austin Austin Bob it's such a cool thing and we've kind of lost something like mmm because they're talking about the show that's coming to our town ignites a sense of community that you don't have in other things right and it's live yeah it's happening over the air tools coming in this weekend we're gonna we'll be there it was also censored that's a real issue yeah for sure I mean look one thing that we all owe Howard Stern a huge debt of gratitude is that he was sued by the FCC yeah I mean like legit yeah yeah he was sued he lost a shitload of money the the media company was a company that had his show whenever the company was yeah they were fined hundreds of thousands of dollars right for him like well for almost nothing this was during the Bush administration they were going after him remember that yeah I remember it dude they went after him they went after him hard to the point where it was scary yeah where like you would you would hear about it you know like what yeah and and you would hear about the things that he got fine see if you can find the things that Howard Stern about five things you got fine for yeah let's pull that up I hope rejas listen man whatever anybody wants to say about Howard Stern that motherfucker opened the door for all of us all of us for me 100% yeah okay let me see the first thing is the fart man's done well he got fine for them that was intelligent ISM as he showed his ass okay it's not really surprised that he exposed his butt cheeks and a $10,000 gold spandex superhero costume blah blah blah where'd where's it's a fine - where's it's a good find for that I don't it said as most other greatest offense he was he was Aunt Jemima joke I saw yeah well there was a lot of stuff that he said you know that you would look at it today like in terms of like a podcast you'd say listen even there's always a I'm outrageous so here's the things that he got fine for let's make that look at the fucking numbers man August 12th 1993 $500,000 infinity broadcast network all right and good find $600,000 and $500,000 $600,000 December 18 1992 and then August 12 1993 $500,000 so within a year six months time even look 92 2004 look at that is it in one in one year's time in six months time they get fired $1,100,000 fucking insane man well and I wonder what the offenses were its language mostly language I'm sure it's language or subject matter potty humor you know fuck man crazy I mean we think about this today in terms of like what we get away with on podcasts oh god oh my total freedom total freedom and I think a lot of that was open that door was open because of how it's turned what does it say that it says playing the piano with his penis she recorded that Chris okay Louie Louie this wjk JFK FM in Washington DC became the third Infinity station to air the Howard Stern Show in 1988 two months later and Stoll Mel of New Jersey mistakenly tuned her radio to hear Stern talk about having naked women in for an upcoming show she recorded the us fucking snitch she reported the Christmas party broadcast in December 16th that featured a man playing the piano with his penis mm-hmm a choir singing about gay sex to the tune of white Christmas and women being hypnotized to achieve orgasm under the referral of her senator this fucking crazy lady called the senator and congressman stumble fire filed a complaint with transcripts and a tape of the program the FCC reviewed the evidence and asked infinity in October 1989 for an explanation as the material in quotes may have violated federal law by including indecent programming during daytime hours and that's funny like at nighttime it's okay to get naughty yeah Karmazin argued that the term patently offensive in its new rule was vague and the sexual references cited were no more offensive than daytime television shows Geraldo and Donahue which used similar terms without repercussions sure his response was later rejected at the FCC yeah so they started finding him back then in 88 I would imagine that for terrestrial radio a lot of that still holds you could get away with a lot more now yeah and because of him because of Howard Stern because of all the I mean look and he was under the gun manatee he stuck to his guns yeah he kept doing the same program I mean it's it's a vastly different program now but and people criticize him because of that but look he's a different person yeah he shouldn't have to do that old show he he should do whatever he wants right that's who he is now right exactly you know but I work for NPR do this live from here which was Prairie Home Companion and I do this thing on that show and there they have comedians on once in a while and they have musicians and they are really strict when when a comic is about to go out there he's told 20 times what he can and can't say hmm and it's like really really really strict and if you violate it if you say the wrong thing they get a fine for every station that it airs on throughout the network oh Jesus yes okay 100 stations is 105 yes exactly that is it's still it's still really serious and that's censorship six o'clock in the evening in the East Coast it's so ridiculous it's you know look I get it if you have a program and it's a rated PG program and you know this is the way you want it because it's for kids and their families and stuff like that but for the government to step in it's ridiculous yeah it really is ridiculous and the fact that this was you know that people had to endure this for so long right I mean like before Howard Stern people have to realize there was no one there was no one like that there was great Don Imus he is kind of controversial in some ways yeah he was and then Stern who is just a totally different yeah yeah he opened the door for podcast for sure yeah all these outrageous people doing podcasts he made the road map right yeah 100% well show the other was that here's you can come over to this side of the street and no one's gonna mess with you well and when they opened up the door like what you're on Sirius satellite radio sirius satellite radio is also responsible for podcast because they showed that you could do things uncensored right um they were the first place yeah first real outlet Sirius XM oh yeah both of them together but XM and you know then they merged right so if you're subscribing to it that means that you're willing to participate you're paying for it you're not it's not like public terrestrial radio where if you just get in your car and it pops up right so if you're listening to Opie and Anthony if you were rising in Howard Stern like you could hear wild shit right and then podcast sort of came out of that right and like this podcast is directly because of Opie and Anthony 100% oh yeah yeah because they set it up the way their show was and you've done it yeah it's a hang yeah you would go in there and everybody would hang out real loose very loose guys would come in hey Tom Pappas here what's up Tom what are you doing I'm playing cowboy lines and this is now making bread yeah and everybody would have a good time and Jesse no there was no structure to it yeah where's Stern had much more structure yeah a lot more bits and we're gonna go into this now and yeah that kind of thing and he was actually a classic radio yeah he was a you know he worked the board and shit you know yeah he was moving the nut the dials and stuff writers yeah I had people working for him it was it was he was more structured open Anthony was more of a hang right yeah and then Anthony started doing live from the compound he he had this house brain in Long Island and he was with a fucking machine gun posing in front of a green screen singing karaoke and I remember thinking god damn I wish I did that in my house I want like that set up had a studio set up at his house and I need one of those this may be just any time you want to just go live and start talking about things right and it would stream on and you know the internet was not that good back then yeah right yeah all this happened like starting yeah I think he was doing only 2006 or so while he was still on yeah yeah and they were giving him a hard time about it right they were telling him you can't do that and he was like but it only gets more people to listen to the radio show right it's not gonna take anything away from the radio show yeah yeah which I definitely agree with they got fired right when the last time was that church thing yeah yeah yeah yeah with the st. Patrick's Cathedral is just here yeah yeah it was yeah yeah yeah that's great he was the last guest oh yeah I love him he's the best he's the best he's a maniac he's so funny he's Larry Oh God yeah they got fired and then he realized how quickly everything can go away because he was like fuck goes out of money and I think they were fired for like two years yeah they couldn't be in the air in two years that's right and so then then they went too serious right they got hired by serious and then you know and they had that thing where they would do both at the same time right they started with serious what they were back on terrestrial and then they would do the walk I did it with them yeah you do the walk the walk we would do we would broadcast with wireless microphones walking through New York City yeah okay yeah it was like a block and a half away so you'd get out they would strap you up with these wireless mics yeah and then we were walking down the street talking it was on the air it was great I felt I really felt fortunate to be a part of that like I felt like I was a part of history I know it felt like there was it was like it was that's where the action was for comedians to they had such a home for comics 100% yeah and many buddy and you look forward to like there was never a time where I didn't want to do it you know they were like ah don't get up in the morning do this it was like fuck yeah yeah Patrice would be in there when my shows were sold out I still made it in there yeah fun yeah felt like it was a clubhouse like you felt like a part and you also could be yourself yeah you know it's like right you unabashedly be yourself you know norton's in there talking about trannies and you know and his experiences with ladies of the night and all this crazy shit and Therese was ragging on everybody Louie would be there there there's us in Little Jimmy it's great in the day there's like a Tom Segura that's right like it top that's fat Tom fat al Tom tats almost every boy whoo and that was when we were 2005 look I was said that they were talking about the silver leg break in this oh ok so that wasn't that's not the XM studio wasn't it seems like it is serious yeah wall the glass walls well yes serious was yeah but that I felt I feel real real fortunate yeah part of that it was cool yeah that's a good time Anthony when he would latch into something it was just funny as any of the comedians oh he was genius he still is still hilarious yeah I haven't heard his new thing very often because well it's all the subscription and he's decided to go to a complete subscription model so that no one can ever fuck with him anymore and pull him off of things and he has a loyal fan base its compound media he actually has a whole bunch of different shows that people can get from compound media so you get a subscription and then you get his show and a bunch of other shows and he would just get that glint in his eye when they get onto a subject and you just it was like a like a dog with a little toy just knew he had something there's a real there's a real benefit in what he does you know that the only people that are going to that are people that want to see his show and hear his show so he can say the most outrageous shit and he's never gonna get fired yeah because if people subscribe or they unsubscribe it's probably you know a wash you know right right you know I'm sure he gained subscribers maybe he'll gain subscribers because we're talking about it but but it was an interesting thing where they it was the combination of those guys you know what I mean like they yeah over the years had that rhythm mm-hmm and you know and Opie would lob it in and then just to see it all break up at the end was really sad fuck yeah it's uh they should come back yeah I mean the I don't think Anthony wants to yeah I think you would ever want to again no it got pretty good guy Chris yeah they got they don't like each other anymore yeah it's too bad I mean in Anthony on his show they would shit on Opie know they would got bad yeah girly yeah and then Opie got fired he was doing opens open Jim was he do ya hope he radio Elfi radio then he got fired for filming someone in the bathroom I was taking a shit and he filmed them yep radio pranks gotta ride people and their shitty but if you can like if I was taking a shit and you up above the door hey July but hey your motherfucker shut the door you never think you're gonna lose your job for that we would be laughing yeah exact time an innocent place yeah it comes from a place that we would all do something like sophomoric yeah depends on who it is yeah like if you had a guy working for you and you were the boss and he is shy and you filmed him shitting then it would be totally yeah then it's like hey you can't do that no there's an your inner circle you know it's gonna be allowed but it was like me and I opened up the door when Jimmy was taking a shit and I filmed him you know he was screaming and laughing at me and it would be fun right it wouldn't you know we're equal yeah hands girls just yes spilling out of the drop ceiling oh hey Joe yeah little lizard man in there but there was a thing that you could get on that show where it was just it was so wild and loose we had this remember stalker patty yes dr. patty we I had these pot breath strips uh-huh and if you took on these breast strips it would literally put you in another dimension they were so goddamn strong it's a girl won a plane and when it landed he goes I almost I almost asked to be taken off the planet I know you serious because yeah I was I was like I can't do this no come on man really took it - yeah yeah I wasn't ready for that before the plane took off it had already kicked in and I was on the runway no saying I gotta go I gotta get off this plane I can't do this fly to Florida so anyway stalker patty was there and we gave her a regular Listerine breast rip and told her that it was a pot breasts trip and she and so she started having these psychosomatic elucidation started believing she was hallucinating re stood in front of her with his balls out of his pants he pulled his balls out of his pants and zipped up everything else so it just be a sack the sack a said they were in I was like dude are you hallucinating you seen it she's like oh my god oh my god what what's going on what's happening and she started seeing things that weren't there no it was just yeah so ridiculous hilarious but again no fine stalker Patti and nothing fine that's it stalker Patti trips out yeah you had hair so it was probably 2012 but he's uh you know or she you know was a regular on the show and she was like a legitimate crazy person yeah and they would have her on and yeah you know they would have all kinds of wacky that's from the stern model to all that stuff yeah oh yeah he opened up the door for all that stuff yeah I mean they always had these wacky radio characters and kind of kept that ball rolling yeah it's such a weird thing because they're like you know they're obviously there's a segment of the audience is laughing at them but they're so grateful to be part of the show yeah you know and they they it gives their life a little bit of a meaning the way that long ago man well you know we're talking about 15 years ago the world was a completely different place now completely I know it was there was nothing there was nothing like podcasts but what's amazing like we started the conversation talking about the public access stuff with unemployed like yeah there's always been that thing for funny odd people to try and get out there and do their thing you know what I mean it's kind of it's endless it never stops like it's it's inspiring there's like this force to just be silly and you're out there and try and communicate with other silly people and that all this media is changing but that thing everyone's still uncle Floyd well ovenbird there's now I was having a conversation with my manager today and she was telling me there's now 900,000 podcasts what there are 900,000 ranked podcasts out there that are regular podcast they're being done there's only 300 million plus people in this country right right whatever it is surrounding 20 million yeah so there's nine hundred so there's almost like one in three people have a podcast almost January brings flurry of releases pushing podcast tally past 900,000 how many of those are might respond over inspiring I need to know cuz I tell everybody do a podcast like how many yeah I would I will Wayne D 200,000 yeah I think oh it's probably like a hundred thousand but even that yeah nuts that's amazing it's a lot of fucking people out there making podcasts it's like you know it's the same as Twitter it's like great everybody has a voice you could just have a voice you can just create a might get a mic and you have one yes right and here's the thing like if you're good it'll grow yeah I'm it's really that simple right if anybody wants advice on podcast then one thing I say is be consistent right just grind you have to grind grind put them out all the time is that what people know they can count on them right as soon as you disappear for a while you lose people yeah so as you take time off you lose people's and as mine we my buddy was like off for a couple weeks and it was me and you'd feel it yeah you lose your momentum yeah and then you lose the people that are addicted to it and then they find something else they go to this one or that one they're just you know see the number 900,000 so many people think yeah crazy that is crazy just out there talking about everything it's a different world and you can use that world in a beneficial way like people get things out of it like in this podcast I've had so many interviews with inspirational people and then but like David Goggins and campaigns and and all these folks that have really inspired people to change their life Jordan Peterson yeah I mean so many people and that have inspired people to take chances and change their lives don't you feel like we're in this cultural moment where people are actively trying to go further like we're always doing that right we're always progressing yes we're always doing that but it seems like there is a there's a bump right now yes there is an acceleration yeah happening where people are really not only thirsty for it but also participating in it for sure one can only think it's gonna it's gonna leap us further or like a lot quicker well it's definitely it's definitely opening up conversations that people wouldn't have normally had and it's it's one of the reasons why it's so valuable right now is because this is a weird time for humans communicating because so many people are communicating electronically yeah so many people are sending text messages and emails and not not talking to each other for long periods of time face-to-face yeah like you and I've been friends for years yeah our biggest conversations we have are on this podcast for sure I mean we have dinners together and stuff like that but yeah sitting in a podcast studio you're locked in right staring at each other across a desk is very unusual way to talk yeah and you're also freed up to ask each other things that you normally don't ask and we have Jamie to make sure that we're not talking shit that's a little weird that's a little weird that the hideous leering over there crucial he's shopping for toasters right he's the world champion Googler people from Google want him to come in and teach them how to I'm not joking that people have asked him to come in like how are you what are you doing like people watch your showing what the fuck is he doing how's he doing it like that Jamie's the goat yeah get it done he's the greatest one-handed Googler in the history of the universe like you probably are one of the best one-handed typers ever because you always have to type with one hand yeah you've probably developed a new schema and a mindset when I'm here that's what's crazy it's like you anticipate what we're thinking and then you pull up the thing before I go can you pull up oh there it is yeah he was weird I had like he had my ghost up there before I was done talking about it here's a problem with ghosts those ghost shows Wow yes those ghost shows are bullshit a hundred percent one of those guys got in trouble recently because he made a ghost book and you like plagiarized a bunch of shit okay like blatant like copy and paste yeah geez yeah it's some of my favorite theaters when you go right where you go performing these theaters and you talk to the people I always asked it was you have a ghost yeah there was a little boy I was in where was I Oshkosh Ashe Kosh and there was an old theater and the guy who runs the theater said you know we've had theirs legendary they keep talking about there's like three ghosts something and they're having a cocktail party upstairs in this like cocktail lounge off the balcony and his son this guy's son ran into the balcony and he's talking with people I gotta go get him and he goes in there and the kids leaning over the balcony talking to the stage and having a conversation with someone he's like yeah no no that oh this is my dad what he wants us to go down there he's who wants us to go that guy he wants us to go down there there's no one down there the thought about that with little kids is that little kids have not dulled all of their senses with the pressures of the world and all the other information that we carry around in our heads and all of our ideas of what's real and what's not real and that little kids are open yeah and then they could see things well um flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers was talking about that with his son that his son is like I think it was flea yeah his son is like tuned in to spirits in a way and then that he was looking at it was like maybe it's that these kids are not like maybe we all have that in us but its blunted right by pressures and life and the lack of sleep and responsibilities and relationships and yeah work and fear and everything and and also like we define how the world is right we get it in our head that this these are the parameters for the world yes how the world works and that's it and go to work and fucking button up your fucking sleeves right this is my belief yes my belief system is gonna carry me through yeah yeah this is what it is it's a fact there is you know that's why it's good to smoke it up once in a while oh yeah I think the door is open that's one of my favorite things about pot yeah is it it makes you aware of how we're things actually really truly are yeah when you don't hear things off when you don't do it for a long time and then do it yeah which is like my schedule you take it makes you look at everything you all your structure that you've mmm formed over the last whatever amount of time and you're like you see it from another just from another perspective it just makes you look at it and be like oh well that's kind of unnecessary that's kind of you know douchey that's part that's on easy opens those doors to just woo hey when I when you're saying you're reading all those books about the Native Americans you know did they talk about their usual stuff yeah there well certainly they had a lot of spiritual stuff but there's a lot of peyote rituals they're really into peyote and they actually particularly was important at the end of the Native Americans free range when they've done they all got you know conquered and moved into reservations the peyote rituals became increasingly important for them oh really why then cuz they're fuckin filled with despair right do the stories of the reservations are one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever read anywhere about anything like yeah massive amounts of people dying from starvation and disease and you know it's horrible man people losing like most of their kids most of their family members and you know the amount of people that are left it you know like Native American reservations I don't know how many people live on them but I don't think there's any growth or population boom it's not like there's a bunch oh you know I mean like the neighborhood exactly cities are growing inside these reservations and they're becoming more more yeah affluent it's not happening others destroyed fucking alcoholism too and it talked about that in Black Elk life of an American visionaries most recent one that I'm reading they're talking about just the alcoholism and that all that they were converting all these Native Americans to Catholicism right and how they hated being Native American they felt so terrible about it because it was just that their identity was just so disparaged by you know just being conquered and moved into reservations and extreme poverty and they would see these other people and they like these people look happy and healthy and you know and then they're forcing this religion on them the the most heartbreaking wouldn't you'd see those old photos where they were putting them in in traditional dress like making them all of a sudden wear suits and ties and shoes yeah it's so sad it's fucked up man it's it's one I mean I always knew it was fucked up but the genocide of the Native American people is one of the most overlooked parts of our history we kind of like brush it aside like we're aware of it but we don't discuss it all the time yeah like you know they killed like 90% of them with disease intentionally no just no just exposure to Europeans oh really yeah like some tribes 90% of them were wiped out because of smallpox and all sorts of other diseases geez they had no defense for it yeah just these people show up yeah stuff yeah it's awful how do you how do you I have a daughter that's going going to school she's gonna call him College yeah undone done and so she's learning all about the world like in all the darkness of the world yeah you know you mean all you have to do is read history and not just you know our history globally it's just that it's a nasty nasty tale yeah and I feel though that I it's I want to like prep her before she goes even deeper when she goes away to the schools and starts learning about it even even more intensely you could tell like I don't want her to lose hope you know what I mean like there's it's a very very dark upsetting thing to learn about but you have to kind of realize we're at least muddling through it we're try we are progressing we are conscious of that history right so don't lose hope you know what I mean like I'm afraid to send her out there without that armor in a way yeah don't lose hope is huge right finally find good people they're out there find nice people they're out there especially you know I think people were very scared today mm-hmm and I think this is a pivotal time with with human beings so much change right so much change culturally and there's so much change you know just in the world well you're shifting and it's also tearing down like all the institutions that carried us for a certain amount of time right those things are no longer really important in this in the world like churches have fallen off in sure sense of community just the town squares join or are isolated and so it's it's all of this shift yeah and that's whenever there's that shift and change in anything even in your own life when you have to move all of a sudden your world is a little rocky and shaking it's like it feels like the planet is about to move I mean it's like we're all stacking our boxes it doesn't feel like there's any official structures anymore that are valid like news where do you get your news yeah who's more full of shit CNN or Fox like it's like where's the news coming from right there's no one place where you can say like these guys aren't biased yeah this is not you know this is the one guy that is telling it straight yeah there's no place like that right so how do you know what's really going on in the world and yeah it's about and and also no one's watching those goddamn news shows are dropping off late night television dropping off everything is dropping off yeah it's watching no attention that shit anymore right so all these structures that used to be there are primary places to go for entertainment and being informed and one of the weirdest things is people rely on folks like me yeah okay don't do that right I'm not the place to go you want to hear yeah talking shit yeah you can come to me you want to be informed listen I'll guide you in the right direction I'll tell you where where I go or I'll tell you who to listen to but don't listen to me larae I've way too much of my plate and I'm not really paying that much attention yeah you had that light shone on you last week right yeah that was adorable you know it's always funny it's not funny but we always talk about you know at some point that they're going to do it at some point they're going to say evil stuff everyone gets their turn oh for sure to be tried to be knocked down Yeah right well that's what canceled culture is all about right and it's this thing you're looking to just only look at the worst aspects of someone exaggerate those magnify them and ignore everything else right the thing about it though is it's really difficult for people to swallow now because they know what that is you know most people who listen to the show yeah I mean they've there's been 1,500 plus episodes they know the fuck it actually is well that was what was cool about all of the comments and defense of you and the show was like it was like this person had never heard the show like you you couldn't you can't listen to this show without understanding the openness and the diverse the the acceptance of diverse points of view and so also comedy like you can't take comedy and take it out of quote out of context and put it in quotes take a section of a bit yeah and use it as evidence of homophobia or transphobia or anything else you know and it's it's disingenuous and they don't realize that by doing that they're just making people distrust them more that's all they're doing you're not gonna convince someone that hey you know this show that you love that you listen to this guy all the time you're actually evil he's actually plotting against gay people and trans people yes everybody else that's protected and sacred in this world yeah you know ya know it is amazing though but it's like the comedy and comedians have kind of filled the void of a lack of grown-ups around you know what I mean like you're like it used to be Walter Cronkite or with that evening news and that's where you got it and then you saw a Johnny Carson or whatever doing the funny stuff right to be mocked yeah everything needs to be mocked yeah it's one of the great things about colleges we mock each other we're always busting balls were always asked talking shit to each other Larry it's the best it's fun right exactly and we actually enjoy it yeah you know I think it'll all turn around it'll all come back around I think what we're experiencing right now is just a shifting of our focus yeah as a culture and these things that used to be important like sitting around the radio listening to the the evening news that shit is non-existent anymore nobody sits around the radio trying to find out what's happening in the world like hold the whole family like listening yeah bet when they were doing that they couldn't have imagined anything different yeah but you do I do I do crave and my wife craves a connection it's it's like what are you listening to or whether you watch like yeah what are you listening to when you're going out oh I'm listening to this American life well I'm listening to Jordan Peterson all right so I guess we're not gonna have something to talk about tonight but we should both listen to this one so you can come back and talk about it and have you know we were both thinking about the same things it's kind of a cool that can be a sense of community yeah you know do you guys have a show that you both watch we've been watching shits Creek lately what's shits Creek shits Creek is hilarious no shit's no never heard of it it got picked up by a Netflix it's over its words I think they've shot the last row they're shooting the last but Eugene Levy levy okay him and his son Dan created this show about a rich family who loses their fortune and ends up in this small town oh I think I have heard of this it's so talked about that during an era is on it and and these two other actresses that are just killer they're just such defined characters it's very small show it's all takes place in this little shitty town shits Creek and they're there they're like these affluent arrogant kids and parents and is so it just hits the jokes are just fast and cutting not it's such a good oh it really is good all right it's the first thing that I we've watched in a long time I haven't even been watching anything first so used to be on pop TV and you know Netflix bought it yeah exactly right yeah shits Creek and that that's father and son created it together and they're just so damn funny Wow look at those eyebrows look at the matching eyebrows Catherine O'Hara is just on point she's so damn funny all right man good I'm excited and they're kind of short you know they're easy to digest I was into mrs. Mazal but the last season I started off kind of clunky I haven't gotten to it yeah I know I feel like I should watch I watched the first two seasons I really enjoyed it but it says it's hard you know it's it's one of those things where it's it's so close to home because it's spelling it up yeah yeah and then has the Lenny Bruce he's very good he's good yeah he's very good it's very believable yeah yeah I was just talking to Kevin Pollak he's he's got a show yeah no he's the dad yeah he's great he's really great I listened to a Lenny Bruce thing recently what's a call it's on YouTube it's a it's a it's Italy it was an album that someone put out about Lenny Bruce the killing of Lenny Bruce and it all it talks all about it's some new stuff that I'd never heard like his young daughter talking at the time and talking about the court case similar to the you know Howard Stern thing like the case just that devoured him that in the heroin mm-hmm which is also a you know suspect of were they trying to get rid of this guy kind of a thing right but it was a very interesting little documentary audio documentary about the fall of of Lenny Bruce and you talk about just you know you're it's such it's almost cliche how legendary that story is but just to be reminded of how completely alone he was just using just having people show up in a comedy club not even a club just a nightclub cuz there were no comedy clubs that he was that brave to keep going to keep speaking while the whole government was coming to squash him like a bug they were arresting him that the the bravery of that is astounding astounding and like Howard Stern he opened up the door to all of us I mean that got lately dark I opened up the door to all stand up and this is created the art form essentially because it was yeah wasn't the same when he left it was different it was different before him it was jokes right jokes jokes right exactly and he became cultural commentary right from talking about religion talking about the government sex yeah love all of it loss here is an interesting thing that I was I was like so what happened when he died like so he dies and I believe 67 or 69 and I was like so what was next thing like if they were really clamping down on him it was only four years later the Carlin's case for the seven dirty words came up hmm it was that close Wow that in my head I always thought that was a much different era yeah the Carlin was much later than but it was only four years later that they were still attacking so he kind of you know picked up the the fight in a way hmm is that remarkable it is remarkable yeah Carlin was arrested several times as well right he was pulled off stage yeah yeah yeah just for speaking and again what is that 40 years ago not that long ago no I know amazing like if they could see what was going on any night in any club anywhere yeah they would be oh my god if you could bring Lenny Bruce to the comedy store on a Friday night you'd be like holy shit what my game you can't get at all anymore yeah I mean watch Brian Holtzman yeah you can say so much yeah you say anything we're the cops yeah but he but it is pretty cool you can get it on YouTube with some of the killer okay cool yeah I've listened to a bunch of his old stuff it's weird it's weird how comedy is it has a lifespan it really does it doesn't work it doesn't culturally things are so different that the taboos have been broken to the point where it's what he's saying is it's normal it's like a museum piece you listen to that album Carnegie Hall Lenny Bruce Carnegie Hall yeah I've heard that yeah and it's cool like to hear the way he talks and the stuff in the his style and all that but as comedy that make you laugh it just doesn't work it doesn't work now just a different all the bets that are still valid he had one bit that he did about gay people well he's like it's illegal to be gay right so what do they do they take you and they arrest you and they put you in jail with a bunch of men when I have sex with you it's valid obviously not it illegal to be gay anymore but ya know there's crazy as that yes gay sex was in many places not legal then right I'm just fuckin insane mind-blowing mind-blowing same in our lifetime in our lifetimes no weird yeah so strange so the guy who plays him in Miss Maysles very good good very good yeah very believable yeah Dustin Hoffman's the best Lenny Bruce though yeah he's fucking amazing yeah and I think that's the best version of an actor portraying a stand-up comedian right what about Tom Hanks and punchline what about Sally Fields crushed I mean I guess Tom could have the last-named he seemed a little bit like a comic he did he seemed like an 80s comic yeah he pulled it off big away wasn't her type guy yeah it wasn't him that was the problem with that movie it was they stuff around it yeah the locker room yeah the locker room we go up and do their thing oh the locker room ajan had to get changed to do comedy like what why we need a locker room imagine the store just put in a locker room hey guys we have a locker room for you now oh great why are we taking off our clothes what I got my show clothes you just have cameras yeah this is my outfit yeah the the scenes of like the the actual club's themselves were interesting because I saw a punch line and when I was an open mic er I think punch line came out in 89 that sounds I think 87 it had to be around 88 said it 87 or 88 okay so that was right when I started because I started August of 88 so it was right right after I started right and I remember thinking why I was like it was so romantic to just to be involved in this thing and I'd only been doing it for a couple months at that point time so I just just signing up on Sunday nights for open mic night and getting my feet wet remember watch that movie they just I loved everything about standing up there sited about comedy yeah you know this was a movie about comedy now and were you disappointed or were you into it at the thing was very funny right and laugh right there was there was no moments in that movie where I was like haha yeah but I always remembered the part that excited me was when they were in the diner in the middle of the day like she cam comes to time to gets yolks and stuff and I was just like how cool is that you they they're not in an office they're just a diner that seems so excited just show up and go to the movies with your friends I still love that yeah it's families and responsibilities I'd love to call them one of my buddies up hey what you doing man I'll go to the movies fuck yeah let's go to the movies yeah whatever you want to do hanging out with your buddies at like 2:00 in the afternoon at the movie theater the best laughing I had the very first day that I quit my day job I was in New York and I finally was a full time comedian and I walked up to Central Park with my buddy and it was packed on a Tuesday just packed with people and I remember being so disappointed like what should only be comedians right now are you oh my god can figure it out too to get a day off well when you're in LA and it's like 2:00 in the afternoon you're on the road and it's fucking jammed up with people like where are you people going yeah everybody should all be in the office you fuck that that is like one of the more attractive aspects of comedy to people is that freedom but that's also that freedom that was one of the reasons why so many comics are so irresponsible and lazy yeah is because they have that freedom yeah that they don't actually sit down and work yeah like how many of us have actually like you've written a book Norton's written a couple books how many comics have actually written books yeah it's fucking that is the real test of whether or not you have discipline right oh yeah yeah yeah write a book ya know to sit in there every day and do it but how long did your book take I this is my second book that's right and they take they take yeah I don't know I guess like all in probably two years do you enjoy the process I love it joy the completion of it what do you enjoy more the process of it really yeah I love there's something about the routine when I can get locked into the routine of this is how it's almost like it creates a the routine creates a space for your creativity in a way so if I get up at 7:00 and roll in there with my coffee and sit at the desk and open it up and go to work and know that this is happening now good or bad you know that routine that they it's giving it's like going to church it's like this is the time when this happens right this is the time when the writing is going to happen and it could be a week of horrible days but then all of a sudden a couple great days happen you know I just love that discipline of it and then just going to work on it and and then playing with the words and then revising it revising it revising it and I I love it I like that part of it really surprised me that this is a very comfortable cool place to be and I could spend years here mmm that's great that's a great thing to be really into doing because it's so productive yeah do you write I'm AG and up do you write stand-up like that as well do you sit down right stand up in front of your computer yet not from a whole cloth and like not from out of the blue hmm if I can double up my cliches it's home but like mostly I'll rewrite oh I will rewrite stuff like if if I try something out on stage tonight and then have an idea listen to it or just remember it and then I'll kind of noodle around with it and see if I can go further with it actually writing mmm yeah so where do you come up with your premises so they just just random observations throughout the day thought random thoughts while you're driving yeah yeah something somebody says some ridiculous thing that you saw somebody do yeah it's you know on your mind stuff that's kind of on your mind and then like if I'll get like we were talking about the tree like all of a sudden you're getting that joke I was watching the other night mm-hmm start getting that thing down and then your mind almost starts to think about it all in its downtime you know what I mean and then all of a sudden you start to pop it up but I I have lost so much thinking I was going to be able to remember it that I just started writing more hmm I just started putting it down I just started right and and it's been a real savior because there'd be hold things like they were valuable that I just let go because I just didn't remember her got into the routine of performing it but if I could have it down I was able to keep track of it and go further with it yeah I think that's gigantic I use a couple different programs but one of them is called Scrivener right you told me about that but I really like about that as I set up my premises on the left side so all my premises and then when I click on them it shows me the whole bit yeah and I just started doing that over the last like three four years yeah like really writing out all the bits and then having them categorized and yeah apparently there's a way to set up Microsoft Word like Scrivener which would be way easier because Microsoft Word is my preferred way to write because they're saved also on an app on my phone right so when I write bits on Microsoft Word write it and then I'll just go to my phone right pull up my Microsoft Word so you're just taken out you could see everything you be exact you as huge as huge pages does that - mm-hmm I'm also on my iPhone in the notes application yeah so I'll copy and paste shit into notes yeah now it's I I really feel like and I think that's what writing the books did was it made me realize the the real value in getting it down it could always get better like you know I would get I would get it really good to a point mm-hmm but then realizing like you this stuff even though it's killing could even be better yeah always it always right mmm any and and the moves the changes that happen at that stage are so small mm-hmm that to me is like the writing that yeah that's the smallness of it yeah those little pauses yellow beets yeah a little extra one extra word yeah right boom just a changeup yeah well I have that feeling too when I watch someone some will say something just one word something about one thing that yes yeah oh man you know who's really making me laugh yesterday I'm her heart was Katt Williams oh he's hilarious I had so crazy he doesn't get spoken of enough cuz I'm crazy I think but I think that he just you know people just hit you right and he was just going off about the election and Trump running and all of this kind of stuff and I don't care what side you're on this was you would just destroy you yeah he was just the way he talks it when you talk about the word that's why I'm up in my head he pulls words out that I would never think of use he just yeah says them in a in his style God is he a naturally funny I don't know if it's natural but he's definitely funny and you know you know man I was more active when he was really touring a lot like during the pimp chronicled a he's one of the best in the world oh my god best in world he was a monster did you destroy that Michael Jackson stuff oh my god that stuff was so good and dangerous at the time I know hadn't come to grips with this idea that Michael Jackson was a pedophile when I care she's not in the black community and he was out there just fucking swinging for the fences it's so good oh my god oh he really makes me laugh he's a straight-up killer but yeah I think for most folks the pressure of the that high level celebrity is overwhelming it just it just fucks with you yeah just fucks with you yeah it could wear you down and break you down like it did with Chris Tucker it didn't deal with Martin Lawrence it did you know it does a lot of these great comics yeah a lot of guys weird thing it's fucking very weird there's the pressure of that many people coming to see you that many people relying on you that many people like waiting for you to fail that many people hating on you yeah you know and and then he clearly there were some substances involved with him sure you know like II had some shows where he would just go on stage and start yelling at someone in the front row and then leave yeah I was in Oakland just went on stage is someone heckled them he's like fuck you bitch in this like going going crazy this one this tonight and then got offstage and this fucking you knows 5,000 people there to see him you can't just leave do you feel that pressure the bigger that I guess yeah I do but I also feel extra love like it's happening yeah it's nice man that's good I but I'm also where that other people have fallen into these holes you know and I've benefitted from the fact that these people have kind of carved this path and showed me where the holes are uh-huh you know and also I it's like I'm definitely crazy right I definitely have some mental health issues but I'm also I'm very thoughtful in meaning that I think a lot about things and I spend a lot of time alone just trying to look at things like an outside observer right trying to look at things like how would I if I was me but not me look at me and what would I say to me like how how would I how would I tell myself to gain the proper perspective how would I allow you ate my situation correctly how would I how would I perceive what would I do would I say man I wish I had done this why do I do that now right on that kind of shit that's good that's so much of it figuring stuff out is being conscious of it right it's being aware that I've got a problem going on or I had the right if you're means you're thinking about it yeah the thoughtfulness with everything with your diet with your family if as long as you're constantly thinking about it right you'll you're giving yourself a chance to yeah in credit the Ralph yeah right correct your mistakes and path and there's no way you're not gonna make mistakes especially if you're putting out as much content as I do yeah there's no way and it's doing as many shows as I do there's it's I suppose I've accepted that and I've also accepted that these moments of adversity I always come out on the other end a better person a better comic better better everything yeah better human and the cool thing is too that the you'd have to you'd have to almost you'd have to change exactly who you are for for it all to turn because it's not that a network is gonna tell you that you did something wrong and take the wrong stance or misinterpret you it's really your audience that it's that relationship with them and they know what you're about you know what I mean like that's the beautiful thing about not having a job job right like you could say something that you even didn't mean yeah and as long as you're fans who know and love you give you a pass then it's okay then it's going to be okay and I've definitely done that I'm definitely said some shit I shouldn't have said yeah but someone you said that you wouldn't eat my bread I that was really weird he brought a knife I set it up I didn't that was Jamie's this is one of our sponsors is a this is a cami Coto knife this is a beautiful Japanese knife look at that bitch oh my god a sword is it heavy no I mean it's really well-made these are dope the old kitchen knives it's not serrated do you have a good kitchen f3 I figured I could cut bread though yeah cut the shit up do you have a good knife set at home I've got good random knives oh well imma hook you up ya cuz ya got they sent me a couple of these look at that that is a good night bread come on fuck this corner for taya yeah baby come on son I want to start I want to try eating me for Jamie and I are talking about more than say we're like yeah could we do it I don't yeah I think I could is it is it hard oh thank you so hard part not chewing Lee do you get bored come on when this come out of the oven four hours ago so damn delicious let me get a piece of that he'll how big you want that is good stop Amy's ruling over here looking at this I always forget to bring butter ah they did one time but this is fucking fantastic without butter come on mmm something to be said for pleasure right yeah a lot just like a balance but saying having too much indulgence and pleasure and no discipline and having too much discipline and no pleasure right exactly but like you said you felt so sick after going to Disney mm-hmm yeah but I eat ice cream I bet your kids are happy when you go off the leash oh yeah they love it right well they just love Disney yeah the new Star Wars right is off the chart is it it's so crazy what's it like well it's 20 minutes long what mm-hmm that's awesome dude that's amazing cuz most of the time they rip you off with like a three minute ride dude this is 20 minutes long from the moment you get there and the scale of it is an insane there's there's one time when you get off of this thing and you know you get transported into this area where all these stormtroopers are and the air it's a halt it's enormous and there's like a hundred stormtrooper standing there and behind them is space this is huge you know 4k screens that show space and you really feel like you are on a starship in space that's filled with stormtroopers it's fucking bananas wow that's amazing well you get in you move in you go for a flight like this is see all those wheels marks on the ground yeah there's no tracks everything is run by computers the whole thing is run by computers right bro it's amazing I mean it's it's just the most intricate and advanced ride Disneyland has ever done by far 20 minutes every step of the way you're like I can't even believe that they did this it screaming it's it's 100% next level Wow that's like look at that look at the fucking detail of this place you go into this and it just it seems like you are in a real spaceship this probably doesn't even do it justice oh no it doesn't why you that my jaw was dropped Tartaros Wow and is it more than just the ride is it like a whole section well it's a bunch of different interactive experiences there's people there's actors right that are there you know like the like they're storm trooper folks and you know the bad people yeah they've talked to all the people that are walking around they ask you like are you here to fucker you were able I'll miss the little kids and we're going the whole time that's awesome yeah you remember the resistance yeah yeah I haven't I haven't seen the new movie yeah that's okay the movies have become Disney fied yeah you know and that I don't say that in a good way there because Disney makes some awesome shit but there yeah it's just commercial late ceiling Wow just fake right no heart it's a soul again yeah well it seems like it's gone through a corporate diversity filter on there making sure that everyone we have them let's have women run this and we're generals and this and that and yeah they're hitting all the right right it's by for delay but the the movie feels like it's formulaic - I haven't seen a very latest one but the ones before that is like they don't feel they don't feel special Yeah right I mean I know that's not the best example but Tarantino movies still feel like Tarantino movies that motherfucker still know how knows how to make a real movie but you get out of his movie like whoa well it feels like it's made by him right it doesn't feel like it's made by a company it's it would be impossible to make Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with with a corporate structure right without him yeah right it would be impossible yeah did you hear his expect acceptance speech for the Best Screenplay it was like usually you would think other people at this point but I wrote this by myself so well that's why it's so good oh I've got a good movie for you yeah yeah this was I was talking with my buddy Steven Soderbergh who digests not only did you drop a name I did but to give credibility to this to this selection his movie of the year was give me liberty this small independent film made in Milwaukee with a lot of like regular people it follows this one guy young guy whose job it is to drive people with disabilities around in a van through Milwaukee you know like through like a public service and it follows him through one whole day it's so good it's such a good film you really got to see it it's the performances are crazy good you don't know who's an actor and who's not it's just so well done it really makes you feel like it's the total opposite of what you're talking about like that big committee kind of a corporate thing to see something like this like you could just feel the filmmakers hearts and souls pouring into the movie those movies that are really big you also have to think of how much money's invested in them right huge and if they go bad it's a giant financial is it like and go bad means like not make a billion dollars yeah well or lose money like dr. Dolittle right right yeah I think that month at movies probably gonna lose money oh really well just real dangerous coming from a guy like Robert Downey jr. who's amazing yeah who's so incredible in the Avengers and that movie made fuckin kajillions of dollars yeah all those movies are amazing and then he goes and does his kids movie and it really doesn't do well it was a dangerous those movies are like oh Jesus were on thin ice yeah back to the shore no dangerous for who for the character yeah for the for the production company for everybody yeah what if they come to you know the production company a year later and say hey we have a new idea for a movie in the productor or the studio and the studio is like hey fuck you we lost a hundred million dollars on you you fuck thank you see all the issues with cats oh yes that was probably the biggest financial disaster here right there pulled it back to like redo it and they're gonna release it yes how many people are making fun of it they do it again they like yeah they left visual effects team only apparently like nine months and I like left watches on people that didn't cover their hands up all sorts of bad stuff I saw it with my kids we what my daughters like we have to sleep good though like we want to watch no because in the beginning like we thought my daughter's like we have to see the worst movie of the decade how we not go see that and we're the only ones in the air it was really brutal and at first that is it's bad but it's so bad is it good no it's so bad that's not good bad yeah it's just bad like so bad it's not good now like in the beginning you have a laugh and it's like all right I can see why this is gonna suck and then by the end of two hours you're like no I've just been hit in the head with a shovel Sapa yeah it's really bad and you're seeing all these people that have been in other things who are just not talking about you know like Jane Judi Dench and it's ray it's bad there's some other movie that came out recently that someone was saying was as bad as the room oh really that movie the room see if you can find that movie and it was really yeah there was a whole article about it saying that this this movie is so bad that it's good that you need to I didn't even finish typing and it kept in it auto-completed what is it well it says now he's showing off his skills no it's said that finished up says the room is the worst movie ever yeah the movie as bad as the room what shocked the one that shocked me that everyone was said was so bad was Will Ferrell and john c reilly in that when the new one right the was it as a canadian movie so bad it rivals the room yeah what is that that's called ryan's babe it's I don't know never heard of it is that a recent article yes from four days ago yeah that's right yeah the people were telling me you have to see that's from 2000 that was that movie that's not a new movie but someone just discovered you put Will Ferrell and john c reilly doing anything and i'm in right and people really rebelled against it that girl's hot though this looks pretty just in their underwear running around for some reason perfect oh this is terrible good yeah it's pretty good looks really bad some rough edits in there so how are they gonna redo cats they're gonna really at it and they already did I think they Reata did it and then but if they re edit it everyone's gonna know that sucked so bad they re-edit I've never heard of that ever it's released no like you fucks like ok we'll fix it we'll be back how much money is cats lost almost half like that sonically they just didn't put it out there they'd like put out a trailer and Internet freaked out they're like oh okay well we'll redo it yeah I spend a bunch of money redoing it Sonic the Hedgehog yeah really I got now it actually looks a little bit better yeah they gave him like better teeth or something dude it's hard man making the movies got to be the most brutal thing ever he's so hot guys in here that have poured their heart and soul into a movie for years like a motherless Brooklyn I am now moving I know I didn't hear it was it good I don't know and I love him and I love the subject matter he loved that movie and he was really put such heart and soul into the soundtrack no and I haven't seen it yeah Jesus Christ cats headed for a hundred million dollar box-office loss Oh what the fucking shit oh my god oh my god I just keep thinking about them all like being at craft services and backstage like this is pretty great huh maybe see that celery sticks rebels committed to losing weight she's lost a ton of weight and people are mad at her are they really yeah they're mad at her because she's like her being big they like her being big because she's big and I'm big and everyone's big and it's okay to be big and I heard it's healthy to be big and so like people are criticizing her for losing weight you're criticizing Adele as well oh really I they said Adele they're angry that Adele lost weight because they loved the fact that she was this huge musical superstar and then she was obese so she wants to take care of her health trying to be healthy a little longer and then you're turning on us well she became a role model for certain people I guess and they'd be a role model for you to get healthy we can all get healthy yes come away from Tom's bread you'd only meat just don't eat it all the time use this all the time well I didn't gain any weight this weekend yeah I didn't gain any weight I ate all that shit and then I fasted Sunday night until Monday I went to yoga Monday morning didn't eat till right before my first podcast and I didn't gain any weight at all that's great yeah but you it's a moderation moderation it's it's eating like shit over but what was interesting was the pains by pain knee pain what is that it's inflammation it's inflammation your body does not want to have to process all that stuff and they think that may be the route for many people of a lot of causes of pain and discomfort is just inflammation heavy diet right sugar right sugar is the big one so if you get all of that out of your system your body can what go to work on stuff it has to go to work on yeah you get all that shit out of your system and your body doesn't experience inflammation from your food right and if you're eating food that like you know grass-fed beef you know or in my case elk you know or yeah I'm sure vegetables are not bad for you I just did it to try to find what I just did it to try to find out what it's like to only eat meat right when you have no carbohydrate it's one of the things that's most amazing is that there's no crashing you would eat and you don't feel any different after you ate other than the fact that you don't feel hungry right like you don't crash right there's no ups and downs and peaks and valleys my energy levels were amazing really how quickly energy how quickly two weeks in two weeks two weeks in I noticed I felt amazing really and that was shedding weight I was shedding a lot of weight I think it was like seven pounds down two weeks and she's now I'm 12 pounds down 12 ish somewhere that I was 193 this morning I was weighing about 205 before I started this diet real yeah way a no I feel a lot better like a lot better really yeah yeah so what would you what would you recommend would you recommend people just do that or do you think you people you have an autoimmune disorder there are I do believe there are certain people that have an adverse reaction to some plants right some foods that's when an elimination diet is all about it's like trying to find out what are the things that bother ya but it but for me it's like what I did is I just took a lot of multivitamins I took a bunch of different vitamins and nutrients supplements on top of this carnivore diet so I'm only eating meat but then I'm taking all the essential vitamins and amino acids and I'm also taking fish oil so I'm I'm covering all my nutritional bases bases right but I'm not doing it with food I'm not doing it with plants I'm only eating grass fed meat and then I'm or or elk and then on top of that I'm taking in fat from like bacon like bacon I needed fat because elk in particular is very lean leaves I'm leading elk fight grass-fed beef I'm fine but with things like elk you really do need some extra sources if you don't have fat would you would you start to feel bad yeah your body doesn't like it now your body does not want a low fat diet with low carbohydrates it's there's a thing called rabbit starvation have you ever heard of that yeah people got that in Antarctica I think was in America the cold cold climates where they were shooting rabbits and eating rabbits and they were literally starving to death even though they were eating all these rabbits cuz rabbits have no fat on them so they're only eating this lean protein Ranko with no fat at all and you start feeling like shit yeah different explorers have found that too that you know when they you know we're living in places and trying to eat only the the foods that they could harvest off the land they're eating animals like they had to take in fat if you don't really fat you feel really bad yeah yeah so a little bit so you could balance it so would you say maybe 80% this is what I would say try it just tries try it's 24 diet try it straight out right and I think you'll be amazed at how good you feel now here's the thing is that a honeymoon thing like what is it like if you extend that to 90 days or you know 365 days yeah you're gonna feel like shit eventually right is it gonna start breaking your body down right I don't know I only have experience in 30 days but in my experience in 30 days it was enormous Lee beneficial you did say something in your post about a explosive diarrhea it needs to have a new name wrong enough for what I was experiencing real yeah I was like someone was tapping into looking oil like an oil well at ease I have pictures so why was that happening um well I talked to dr. Shaun Baker he wrote a book on the carnivore diet he's a physician that's a carnivore diet advocate he's been eating this way for two years two years yep and he seems to think that it has to do with the colon adjusting to the factory body doesn't have any dietary fiber so you're not taking in any rice or bread or anything that's gonna absorb the water so your rise what you brought is like what I did that last around two weeks two weeks two weeks of rocket fuel coming out abuti whole hog cheese but if you get through it get through and Tom Segar is going through right now he is yeah yeah yeah he sent me a text the other day saying this diary is astounding astonishing coffee is it you guys both drink coffee I'm just asking just a general question guys both intake a lot bro explore authorize liquids and whatever kinds of liquids I'm coming out of your butt it's not normal I was really getting excited about trying this but here's the thing at the end of that it all goes away right at the end of two weeks my body adjusted and now it's not a problem at all really yeah I'm not a problem at all now so what's breakfast steak or eggs sometimes like this morning it was steak yesterday morning I ate six eggs right now just just whip those down lunch I don't even want oh nice usually two meals a day right and then the second meal is usually steak no state either elk or a beef steak I think I've asked you this before but when whenever I think about these diet things I always picture my family looking at me well they're eating pasta eating like do you feel like an outlier at dinner with your family or no they knew what I was doing yeah they they'd made fun of me in stir right yeah that's what I always my kids mock me too [Laughter] um you know they didn't mind yeah no nope nobody bothered my wife didn't care everyone knew I was doing it right it was okay right yeah your wife's not like come on have ice cream with us no no boy there'll be a problem if she was yeah if it looked so good yeah yeah no it was it was an eye-opener but here's the thing yeah sorry here's the thing about that kind of stuff you kind of have to commit right like if you just say I'm gonna try to eat healthier it's too loosely defined I know I know I was doing the intermittent fasting and lost good amount of weight and then it just kind of like plateaued and I feel like I'd like to be you know like 10 pounds lighter and it's I'm working out I'm doing all that stuff but I feel like it needs something to shock my system to go to it nothing will shock your system like this carnivore diet yeah including your butthole but you will lose a lot of weight I lost I mean I lost a legitimate 12 pounds of fat just fat my face got thinner yeah when I was watching my face I would feel actually feels a little fatter now because I went through Disneyland bread but joking around maybe I'm a little swollen no you look you look leaner why I was a real I I was you know I was getting fat I was developing a gut like we did this way and thing and so many people mocked me I was getting a gut though my stomach was like hanging out yeah so when we came in here to do that I had my that was December 23rd and my family was in town and we had eaten like pigs that day right I was loaded considerably bloated with food as well it was nighttime with a nighttime podcast I was like 10 o'clock or something like that right pretty pretty late podcast yeah when we all took her clothes off and got on the scale so I knew it was probably gonna do the carnivore diet anywhere but that was like yeah let's just do it let's just do it well set it in my head right yeah so knowing that for the month of January that was all that I was going to eat yeah that's that really helps if you're gonna trust - something to have like a real solid schedule right like sober October's yeah another perfect example for me Lent yeah when we do sober October we have one month no booze no pot no nothing yeah there's something good about it yeah you have that month because it takes it out all that kind of mushy brain stuff of oh but maybe I'll just just know what you're celebrating yeah we need a certain amount of rigidity occasionally yeah that's how you get shit done yeah and I mean even if you are like writing if you said I am going to write every day for the month of February yeah you know every day yeah there's something to that the routine yeah so something really beneficial I'm gonna write for one half an hour every day if you do that you get things done it's really true if you just decide I'm gonna go on a carnivore diet for the next 30 days starting right now yeah just count down on your calendar 30 days from now you will fucking lose weight and you'll feel amazing yeah I just don't know if it's a way to eat all the time no that's the thing it's like it seems like an extreme thing that I would not be yeah willing to maintain well you're the bread man well that's the thing you're the sultan of sound that's why I want balance I'm always searching for the right balance I think a great move is six days on one day off that's what I think six days on a rigid diet on one day where you you look forward to eating bread and pasta and drinking whatever you want and you know have an ice cream and one day that was the question he just reminded me of the question no booze during that my drag boost you did yes I don't drink a lot drink a glass of wine with dinner maybe two glasses yeah yeah that's all it was a shot sometimes before I go on stage or a shot of whiskey right yeah so it's not a lot right you know if it's more than two drinks a night it's unusual you're cool with whiskey and then going onstage oh I like it you do you don't feel like it's good you used to it I would feel whenever I drink before I go onstage I just feel like a little off mmm I fell on you do yeah I like it leave my film do a shot right before a film oh yeah really yeah really that's interesting good shot a Buffalo Trace whiskey yeah and the old pipe and you're good to go that's wild liquid whiskey's wild liquid it is well it's wild liquid right and you want to get wild that's wild liquid yeah and our fuel we have different styles too you know yeah yeah it also helps me deviate when I'm riding on stage if I'm fucking around on stage it helps me deviate I go go off a little tangent a little more courageous yeah maybe or a little a little more reckless yeah better work yeah yeah and what about weed though in that same same thing for that too yeah that doesn't make you more timid on stage no no makes me more it makes me nicer right but I don't think it makes me more timid right yeah weed makes me nicer yeah that's one of the things I like about weed like I need more things that make me nice and make you nice Hey yeah it helps me when you look at yourself you think that it's that you could be mean sometimes not necessarily mean but I am naturally aggressive right yeah right yeah and that makes you a little bit more let's realize like we don't have someone certain about time left yeah when I get how I want to call my friends tell them I love them right that's what I want to do you know I want to ya wanna hug people just want to be around them yeah yeah would be nicer I know it is good but I oh yeah I don't know I have how do you flirt I haven't performed hi and how about tonight we did win you up I'm not up tonight you know I'll be up on Thursday Thursday yeah we're doing tonight cha yeah relaxing my wife it's kind of uncomfortable because my wife has people over because my special airs tonight Oh to wash your special you have to sit with them uh but no they're gonna do it and I'm gonna I don't know so now hi sit in the yard and for the cigar I don't know don't be there aren't she doing that in your house so excited oh that's nice it is it's nice they're all excited they all are I can't watch it you know yeah I'll be in the other room listening that if they're really laughing or not judging their laughs that's terrible is that a bad feeling man yeah want that in your life yeah but I do feel especially now like that that's all done and I'm moving into new territory that the weed kind of isn't can play a good role yes for sure how much material do you have set aside for this for you new stand-up I've only got about 20 that's good though when did you film October Oh so you gave yourself some time that's nice yeah November December January front for solid months that's good yeah so I've got like this new direction a new like area of stuff but it's you know it shrinks the more you do it yeah and this special is gonna come out a little later so I thought I had more time but then deciding though when you're scared yo and you're onstage scared you gotta write new premises and yeah I was thinking about the other day that you always feel like a young comic because you're always putting yourself back in a vulnerable position yeah that's a matter how experienced anyone is yeah you go out there and I'm gonna do all this news you're a child again you have no weapons which is great it makes you youthful it makes you like okay we're still like a hint it's like now I've been doing this for 20 years yeah there's a it's a great aspect of stand-up comedy when you do a lot of specials because it keeps you humble yeah it really does yeah and it keeps you appreciative of the art form you never get complacent well that's the coolest thing about this era of comedy and I think that's how Netflix changed the game ice having so many people put out so much content it's making every end that's seen by a lot of people it's making everybody get on their game and write more it's the era of getting a headliner set and just rolling for 20 years is gone right so it's actually taking the whole art form pushed it further it's great yeah it really is such a good moment mm-hmm it's such a good mo and so many different voices coming in yeah it's not from so many different places just not only in the culture but from around the world have you seen Ronny Chang yes fuck hilarious great so different yeah exactly on stage with a suit real angry and shit fuckin great I want to talk to him he's cool guy I'm gonna get him in here yeah yeah I know I gotta get him in here all right I'll join his act yeah I enjoyed it he's a good guy too and it was like I didn't he didn't remind me of anybody right every punch lines premises all of it seemed like yank no no that's recognizable and relatable but unique right exactly yeah no he's I mean that's what's so cool it's just like the whole globe is opened up it's like all these voices from all those different stuff it's cool it really is this it is and this art form you know I've been thinking about this a lot and I really think I'm gonna do something about this I want to document how everybody does it mm-hmm because I think this is the only art form that is a global worldwide art form that's enjoyed by everybody yeah it's not really documented Yeah right like musicians it's documented how they write songs it's documented how you learn to play music you can go to school for it you know you can you could take classes online when you're a comic man you got to kind of figure it out on your own yeah and I think we would all benefit from some sort of documentation and particularly for the people coming up the girls and guys coming up that are learning how to do stand-up now would benefit tremendously from like a guy like you breaking down how you do it how you started what's different now right so I'm thinking about doing a series oh yeah yeah and I'm probably gonna put it on YouTube like like a podcast and do it like a podcast but call it like the comedy creation series I'd love to be yeah yeah I wouldn't want to get everybody as many people as I can like tell me how you started how old when did you start yeah what year was your first Club and just break down how you do it yeah that's a great thing because it's so varied yes you know from doing the show with fortune mm-hmm we shot the fortune Fenster yeah to the great fortune she's hilarious yeah her special is up right now is it I want sweet and salty and Netflix Netflix as well yeah yeah yeah so great and we're interviewing all these comedians we had a hazers Trejo came in I love him love him and he's such a unique story so different yeah you know his parents coming from Mexico he's got a care for them he goes down to Mexico where there's like this new scene coming up of spanish-speaking comedians and I mean that story you put that one and then you talk to you know Ryan Hamilton two totally different planets yep all in the same form yep it would be great to one fuck yeah it would be amazing it would be really good the world needs to know how these fucking people do these things yes like this if if you don't know anybody that can sit down and talk to you about how they do it you know it takes too long to figure it out no completely completely like if you're in Pittsburgh I don't know what kind of scene Pittsburgh has right in sure it's got some kind of a scene but how many people really yeah you know I mean and they couldn't you really how many really good ones are still there yeah that you can really learn from how do you how do you find out yeah no no I know that's a good thing I mean when Seinfeld put out the documentary like people still listen to watch comedian like young comics oh yeah because there's the very few road maps out there it's very few glimpses into how someone is doing it and how they're working you know there's been other stuff where people will show themselves on stage and they're just backstage you know drinking or just going about their day like a road doc kind of a thing mm-hmm but not very few about process yeah very few yeah process and you know how much you've adjusted yeah what do you do differently now what do you think about your old stuff what would you do differently and start over again yeah yeah it's good stuff yet some we do it's a weird art form in that it really it doesn't have a class you can take nope well they have classes they don't really you know what those classes are good for getting you on stage they're good for that yeah yeah I mean very few classes are taught by legit comics right right maybe there's some of them out there that I'm not aware of yeah every class that I've ever seen has been taught by scrubs right you know they probably give you bad advice Rick chrome does one in in New York remember Rick chrome from the seller no I don't he's great he's like he's been a long time and that's very valuable he's like a real you know a real thoughtful practitioner of it all you know what I mean and I've seen him just glimpses of him like when he be teaching downstairs at the cellar and it was like okay this is legit but then you see some names of other people who are out there doing it and you're like oh man I would imagine it's good for you to to teach because like you can kind of like think about the art form or that would be really interesting I don't know if I could teach it could you could you I don't know think some young you'd have to be really careful yes you don't want to mold someone into your style that would be the fret that'd be the temptation yeah I'm an observational comedian not anymore yeah but yeah other things when you learn how to teach it's better like I got way better at Taekwondo when I was learning how to teach those teaching through most of my competition days yeah and it's one of the reasons why I think I got so good because I was breaking down the technique constantly I wasn't just doing it I was breaking it down for beginners and showing it so I made sure that my you know my technique is very good it's like mmm my martial arts you know career one of the things that I'm known for is I do everything I do it correctly right it's very crisp but my technique is like I always prided myself I was that word yeah I did sounds weird yeah I would put myself on having excellent technique it wasn't just that it was powerful it looks sharp it was correct yeah jiu-jitsu the same way to guys get way better at jujitsu I've never taught you Jitsu but guys get way better when they start teaching it right another cool part about this era is that can meet people are staying comedians yeah longer yeah right where people would do comedy they get blown out to a TV show or something because economically just to stay a comedian wasn't really feasible but now you can actually make a living and it's actually a more valued thing in the culture like this is the first wave of guys staying in it yeah for their whole career and not wanting to get out yeah there's they're not looking at it as an escape a to get out of it someone was just asking about that like what was the last person that you know that had a special around the year 2000 that's out of the game now right a completely quick comedy right who completely quits comedy yeah not anymore it's just too easy you know just think about those you know afternoon diner trips and going to the movies all that goes away if I got the job job yeah yeah and the only way you would do it is if you're not making enough money so then you would have to get a job job right right yeah yeah but no I mean you know even Eddie Murphy he's seeing what's what it's become yeah he's got to be regretting it at some point of like why did I leave why did I stop doing it maybe but I mean he made him a lot of fuckin great movies and he also grew real funny grew as a human being you know a hundred look no regrets he's still you could still see just when he was just hosting yeah it just pops out of him it's just such a he's a volcano of near Hamid II if he had kept cracking at it all this time though mm-hmm you know what I mean even like a little bit would have been it would have been good for me would have been good for me to watch it would be but would have been but it will be great to see what he does now because he's kind of committed to it it's committed to us I think he signed a deal with Netflix for two specials for two I believe so I believe that's what I read see if that's correct one-handed type or genius I think they gave my shit ton of money good only a man dolomite I haven't seen it heard it's also good is it so good got a huge response from people how he's not nominated as a is you know I know they're nominated right now but still he really should have been Ricky Gervais should host every award show from Mountain just a little those twats know we're on to you rocket climate change is real fuck off get out of here with your golden man statue and sit down taking a bath yet everywhere fuck off he was so good he was what I mean one of the best performances I saw this year for sure don't lie yeah I need to see it haven't you do he's brilliant he's brilliant and it's comedy it's so good James has just won one special one special yeah okay they're gonna give him a shit ton of loot and I hope he hope he works it out could be a movie or else because they did dolomite so yeah it's gonna be work you know unless he hires a bunch of writers to craft the bits and then that won't be right anyway you know you really need the work you need you need to be on those stages yeah Ellen did it how was it it was good was it good yeah anything about it didn't look like she was had taken off for decades certainly didn't well she does to her show all the time so she does do that monologue she does but you know stand up stand up you know and if I think the monologues like stand up light though mm-hmm yeah like Jay Leno Yeah right Brent's always doing those monologues but then he would just stand up on Sunday nights and they do corporate gigs yeah yeah right exactly he wasn't banging it out in the clubs every day like us no he's still going now though I talked to Bill Mara had him in here yeah and he was repulsed by the idea of going to the clubs oh why would I do that literally you don't want to go to the club's do it away and done I escaped I'm out yeah I'm like but it's the greatest way like it's you you hang out with comics he gets to stand up yeah you know it just seems like low-rent I don't know man me sometimes people have their own audience and that's all they want right they don't want to they don't want to go like a show at the store yeah tonight I'll go up at the store and there'll be 14 other people on the line I'm right and there's people there to see every one of those people Yeah right now so they're not they're just there to see you they're gonna see , that's what's great yeah it might not be into you at all yeah it's like going to the gym no one wants to really go to the gym it's right at the gym you start to love at the gym it seems like you know I talked to burr about this and he's in agreement he believes that you have to do it he's like that's the only way you know anyway you got to go to the you got to go to the clubs I'm like I think so too yeah he goes nobody else that doesn't go to the clubs really kills right yeah you get through it yeah you can do a monologue you can recite a monologue yeah but you're missing all of that high impact mm-hmm stuff in-between and you also run the risk of being funny because people love you the people that love you that come to see you they your crowd right and you run that risk yeah maybe you can pull it through Brian Regan may be a different he might be an exception to that rule cuz I don't think he still murders he does but he's out there performing all the time on top non-stop any treats you know he's in a in a good position where he's beloved where he can treat a set in front of 3,000 people he'll kill but also be able to work his stuff out yeah within that set he'll work out new stuff yeah yeah yeah he's a unique guy right because he's super popular with his crowd yeah but he doesn't he doesn't have a problem but being famous he can go anywhere yo yeah no absolutely yeah there's there's people outside of the comedy loving world that don't know who he is no it is astounding to all of us Yeah right yeah but that's how fragmented the culture is like we were talking about if you're just watching One News or watching one thing it's like where everyone's in their own little bubble you know there's you know jo koy is selling out you know the forum yeah and my parents will have no idea who he is multiple shows I think two shows of the forum yeah you know what I mean like we're we're it's such a big massive entertainment eating Colossus that people can be huge and be invisible at the same time like Sebastian yeah Sebastian sells out four shows at Madison Square Garden sometimes I have to explain who he is to people weird but meanwhile he can go places yeah it's really a beautiful balance yeah you can go to the mall nobody gives a fuck me huh you know yeah Taylor Swift can't do that I was watching a documentary actually said say my kids we're watching I watched it last night my daughter do this a beginning of it when she walks on stage in the stadium and you see all the fucking people with their lighters and everything like wow I guess it's not lighters the light from their cellphones on their phones or something but ya know you're talking about it's Boise so what was so cool about it was watching her as a 13 year olds learning to write song yeah she's just she works she does she work that's got to be an incredibly bizarre place to be her existence your life yeah her life because she's young I know how old is she now 29 that's in that documentary so she's been hugely famous for how many years now 16 I think is when she came on the scene yeah 13 years and those are very formative years I know she seems like she handles it pretty well I mean that's what yeah I'm the documentary it was I was really impressed like yeah how good of a songwriter she was like watching her come up with stuff she's obviously so practiced and knows what she wants to do and just the way she was coming up with stuff as she was on the fly maybe that's the key yes maybe the keys you have to like really be obsessed with your work and doing what you want to do a hundred percent Prince a hundred percent oh there's they are making this stuff they're not wooden things they're not you know they're they're actually have a craft that they can right go to work on look she's right all that noise it's totally yeah a really good writer yeah and all that noise you know she was obviously just even from the glimpse that they showed us in the documentary dealing with weight and the fame and the Gagner stuff and yeah wait yeah she had you know she would see pictures of herself and stop eating and what yeah is that in the documentary yeah yeah I didn't only watch it for like two minutes ya know walks in my kids were watching I'm like oh get out of here before I got infected now it's pretty I liked it I think I'm sure was impressed by her I really was that's a bummer though that she was thinking she's always been so skinny well everyone's got stuff they got to deal with but the thing then like you said like it's a weird place to be but that she can go and write songs and go and perform them that seems like that's she's got something tangible right meaningful right that will get her through that right it's not a hop star where corporation puts together you look and your songs and your thing yes Anu that she's doing it all herself yeah you're not just the guitarist someone else is writing the songs and doing all this stuff and you're just doing drugs it's important to have something that you do yeah maybe something small and stupid but it really gives you a real life meaning and if you without it it's doesn't have to be this big performance stuff or stuff that gets you a lot of money right a little hobby a little craft a little something you can go to sleep thinking about yeah it's it's a I don't know why but it's an important part about being a human being well gives you that's the think you nailed it it gives you a meaning like you're you're working towards something you're working at something yeah you know yeah shuts the noise out mhm as you're thinking about this thing that you're actually getting better at yeah and then you get this satisfaction seeing the progress yeah yeah yeah and I mean she's you know as big as they get but then she can crank out these songs and he could see like this calm come over and she's doing that part yeah yeah it was pretty cool to watch Taylor Swift fan yeah there you go I was definitely but watching my daughter who's pretty skeptical kid you know it's 17 and to watch her like admiration for her as a as a woman getting it done was that that part you know she definitely gained more points for that that's cool I wonder what happens with someone like that like where do they go as they get older what do they go as they I mean you're you're growing up and living your entire life in this superstar position very strange superstar peon well I probably you know the the white hotness of it probably fades to some degree but if you're an artist like that you would keep creating you know like Bonnie Raitt was just at the Grammys right you know and she had their moments of being huge and then you just become like a working musician in a way yeah you know mm-hmm yeah now that's a good way to do it right yeah sort of be appreciated by your fans keep going out keep doing it and they'd take him along with you yeah see if they stick around and you're 90 years old playing a nursing home but there's still 20 people in the audience yeah it's pretty cool it's a pretty good thing yeah like look at Willie Nelson yeah still out there banging it out yeah an amazing story weed he did stop smoking weed no lung problems now I was down edibles well he's still getting high though but he was fucking up as long as I guess which is hilarious because he's like 19 he must have been smoking a lot I wonder if he smoked cigarettes as well did he smoke cigarettes as well yeah about that but I'd heard a story of him smoking like garter garbage cans full of weed in Hawaii that country music star that has that song I'll never smoke weed with Willie again oh really yeah Travis got shrimp what's his name famous guy never what tobiko because he got so messed up yeah it's like he's got a song never smoked wee willie again puts you in the grave cranking it out and that was his thing was to be nicer yeah he was he Willie Nelson has always talked about his mean streak and a whiskey streak and yeah and the weed was the thing that really made him a kinder yeah person that's what it does yeah it's the best aspect of marijuana is it makes you more kind and more it makes you think about community and friendship and just yeah forgiving people to write exactly laxing just letting go of all the bullshit yeah that's what the world needs a lot more forgiveness especially to present we could use we could all use use just a little more understanding yeah where you gonna learn if you don't make mistakes screw up and then you correct it you become a better person whether this song should be rewritten by somebody about Joey Diaz pretty good I always heard that his herb is top shelf Lord I could not wait to find out for myself well don't knock it till you tried it and I've tried it my friend I'll never smoke weed with Willie again now we learned a hard lesson in a small Texas town he fired up a Fat Boy and passed it around the last words I spoke before they tucked me in may I discount bungee jump but I'll never smoke weed with Willie again I made this count bungee jump I'll never smoke with Willie again my party's all over before it begins you can pour me some old whiskey river my friend but I'll never smoke we will get you the edibles joeys edible oh my god really yeah it takes take a 500 milligram edible and we'll take the wrapper off and put a 20 milligram edible label on it hey what have you heard about micro dosing a lot yeah yeah other mushroom acid a lot of people do it I know yeah coming a thing seems to help them sort of like stay focused and centered and calm and keep the chatter down negative self chatter all that kind of stuff is there anything bad to it um I don't know I don't know I mean if Mike goes through a couple of times yeah but I've never I've never done it on a regular basis like a lot of these people do but I know a lot of people are doing it with psilocybin and a lot of them do it they take it like once every couple days they don't even do it every day they take it every few days and they find it remarkably beneficial Ron white is into micro dosing oh yes I've been yeah loves it and it's not like you're really tripping no no you it's barely perceptible really yeah barely perceptible but it just gives you a nice feeling you know it's like there's something about it that's nice yeah yeah yeah and then people feel like that that it just eliminates some of the anxiety and the shit that goes on your head that can you could be battling with it calms those voices down for different people yeah yeah I mean obviously for everyone everyone is a different word reaction to that yeah some poeple we got to wrap this bitch up where are we gonna go that's it's three o'clock so with it we just have three hours come on let's go for five I really can't if you need to do it
