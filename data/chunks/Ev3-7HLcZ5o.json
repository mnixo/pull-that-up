five four three two Dave Rubin ladies and gentlemen hello everybody what's up brother dude I haven't seen you well the last time we saw each other it was just now but before that was right before the election the day before the world changed squirrel eat around its squirrely does that literally it seems like a lifetime ago not even a lifetime ago it's like a different life for me I think it's a different life for you think about how much has changed for both of us in that time but it seems like another planet like an alternate universe the day before the election it is in a lot of ways right I mean people are the world's going well people the world's trying to find its footing yes you know it's a lot of craziness well I hate to tell you Jill Oh oh but you are a little piece of the finding of the footing mm because people are finding the footing you know I'm on tour with Peterson right now I just got in this morning from Atlanta and it's like there is without being hyperbolic there is some kind of awakening happening right now people are kinda getting their shit together they're kind of sorting out things there through long-form conversations like we're all having and all these people that we're now connected with there's something happening where people are going there's another way to make sense mm-hmm and let me figure out what that is doesn't mean we have all the answers and I'm sure as hell no I don't and I don't think you think you do either but we're at least giving them a little room to figure it out and it's pretty cool well the thing about Peterson that's been fascinating is how many people misrepresent what he says to try to frame him him in a way that makes him evil and mixed their positions seem more ethical or more moral or better or more intellectual there's so many articles being written about him almost on a daily basis he didn't misrepresent what he's saying it's epic bullshit I mean weird that's all it is these guys want clicks that's all they want I mean I've we've done about 20 shows in the last six weeks or so bounced around from Nashville and Houston and Atlanta and Chicago and everywhere else the crowds have been incredible it's it's probably split you know first off they're always go well it's angry white men that's the main thing it's all angry white men now first off let's say it was all angry white men there that in and of itself doesn't mean it's bad let's say there was like a really disaffected group of angry white men that really felt like either masculinity had been compromised or they couldn't get jobs or they didn't feel good about their lives like if there was someone talking to them that was helping them that would actually be good but let's just put that aside right because they don't mean it in a positive way so they say it's all angry women now I can tell you it's about 60/40 male to female roughly at Jordan show at Jordan shows yeah and it's do you think that's like dates that reluctantly go along with men like there are some I mean there will be guys that well is actually usually girls will come up to me after and they'll go you know he's a big fan of you guys or he loves Jordan or he loves you or blah blah blah and I'm just here but then they all have a great time I mean I'm telling you this thing has been an insane love fest I know you saw the video that Jordan posted last night it was his birthday last night we were at where the hell was I did a tabernacle in Atlanta you know almost 3,000 people singing happy birthday to him we brought out this frickin stuffed lobster and a piece of meat cuz he's on this crazy meat diet now and it's like it's an endless love fest every street we walk down people high-five and I say and I we did a little meet-and-greet impromptu thing at the Lincoln Memorial and about a hundred people showed up just out of nowhere and it's like these people are just trying to figure shit out they're not white supremacists they're not alright they don't hate women it is literally nothing that they say because they want clicks and the way they get clicks I mean you know the way they're clicks is they say the absolute reverse from the truth it's not that they lie a little bit like a little lie I think nobody would even picked up on it we don't think that's what they do I think they're just misrepresenting I don't think they're saying the apps the opposite of the truth they're just they just look they're finding these little categories like homophobia transphobia homophobe he's on tour with the gay guy trans folk there are trans people that show up there and I and I discussed it with him every freaking night I asked you know we do it so I basically do like 15 minutes to stand up up top he does an hour and a half and then we do a QA together and we bring out all of these things and every night to clear it up and sometimes I'll have people bust out their phones and I'll be like why don't you guys record this tonight let's get it out on Twitter where he takes down the all right because he hates the identity politics of the right as much as the identity politics of the left I mean I think the reason we all focus on the thing of the left is because it has encompassed culture and media and politics and what you're allowed to say and and universities and all that so it makes more sense to focus on that the little sliver of it that's on the right yeah it's shitty it's horrible you should not look at your skin color as some great thing that makes you better or but it's not a right thing is racism always a right thing like no racists right no I think the left is far more racist than the right at the moment yeah why do you think that because identity politics is based in racism you happen to be white I know nothing about you by the color of your skin I know about Joe Rogan because I watch the show I listen to the show we've done this several times and we can further ours that we're gonna sit here now we can dive as deep into any issue and that's the only way that I can sensibly judge you but the idea that you will look at people that you would look at a black person a black person will be sitting there or a Muslim person would be sitting there or transfers and sitting there and you'd go I have even the inkling of what you think because of that immutable characteristic that is actual racism that is prejudging right judging first before you know somebody so I have a much bigger issue with that because that has infected everything in American society right now the identity politics of the right that this should be a white ethno state or something like that but it's not that's not really the identity politics of the right well I don't think the left is necessarily that way either I mean I think the identity politics there's a real issue right with people that only identify with other women women that only identify with women and don't care about men there's a real issue with people that are only American they don't care about the rest of the world just like there's all these weird groups but I think we run into problems when we start saying oh it's the left it's doing this it's the right that's doing this I think is just tribal it's just this weird thing that human beings tend to gravitate towards crop tribe's for sure and look we can we can I talk about things usually from a little more of a political lens than I think you do so yes of course ultimately it is tribalism however you want to parse that tribalism right so yes the let and I say this all time but the left/right thing doesn't make that much sense anymore you're either basically you're basically for freedom you're for the individual to live freely however they see fit or you believe that the government should engineer things and that there should be central planning so that people I think that's always shitty thinking I think people that say that the government should engineer things they're just looking for a solution and then they think the government should handle it well yeah but I think we should pay more taxes everywhere is that gonna go it's gonna go to the government and what's your nono me you're thinking I mean there's like they're having shitty thinking it's like this idea that the government's gonna fix it the government's filled with people like we don't have our own individual solutions so we don't have our solutions as human just as human beings objective human beings looking at problems why would we ever think that elected officials these these people that are for the most part full of shit yeah they're just trying to say whatever they can say that's gonna appease both the special interest groups and the lobbyists and the people that are helping them get into place the people they're gonna vote for them and you know and then just sort of like skirt around all the other issues that are controversial to the point where they can get into office let's try it once we name three politicians that you really like I don't know any of them Johnson who was like who I like him to and I voted for him but he was the worst possible libertarian candidate you know who's the best libertarian candidate I mean Rand Paul should be if he really had the balls to be what he is got to learn how to stuff a takedown yeah right he's got a lot guys coming at she gonna figure out all you could do you could do two hours with him and he'd be a lot better in a lot of ways but he should be the guy but he doesn't have the balls to do it because he wants to maintain being a Republican senator in Kentucky and he's not gonna do it if he has to leave the party but if but I've seen a major shift I think in Republicans or at least conservatives or generally people on the right whatever you want to call that thing there is a massive libertarian streak that is alive in them right now which is why most of the people that I like these days that I get along with that I think are fair and decent and honest are pretty much libertarian definely return so libertarian so libertarian in classical liberal is what I get more than anything else because I say I'm a classical liberal which basically means you believe in the individual the sovereignty of the individual is the simple most important thing it is your life it is your duty to do what you see fit the government is supposed to do pretty much nothing other than protect your life so it's supposed to have an army and police and stuff like that and then really just lays a fair economics and that and then the difference between classical liberal and libertarian is how far do you want to go with the government so I think there is some utility for the state but the more I do this the more I have these conversations and I talk to Anne Capps and real libertarians and all that I find it hard to defend the state at almost any level at this point but I do think that because I don't want to live in Mad Max fury road just yet although we may be heading there I still will defend the state at some level but I would say everything should be local we have an incredible experiment here with 50 states if your state taxes too high move goes somewhere else if your state doesn't have good education you can go somewhere else if you don't like the weather somewhere but the second we make everything federal and this is what it's not just the left this is what people who were using lazy thinking that you referred to they think we should just have one law that we should all live exactly the same no matter where we are geographically no matter what our religion or what however we set our set of uses that is a nightmare that is a nightmare for a totalitarian state because if the federal government if one government controls everything guess what if you don't like it you got to leave the country you know go to Mexico go to Canada you probably won't like it I really referring to it because in terms of what you want set of laws well because you want states rights you should care about is States right so for example we live in California we are taxed out the fucking wazoo I bought a house last year it's my first time at 41 years old that I own property in America I made it I own property I don't have to tell you about my property taxes they're insane they're very on their absurdly absurdly high that's the price you pay for living in a spot everybody wants to live ya know but that's it that's the beauty right so like there's a trade-off there now I could move to Texas and the property taxes would be way low and maybe because they don't tax as much the schools aren't as good or a series of other things but that's the beauty of the foot vote you can go this is an experiment this thing in America against that of anyone that wants to keep giving more power to the federal government which is pretty much everybody these days pretty much everybody in mainstream certainly all of the Democrats all of you know the the the mainstream set of Democrats and the Bernie and the progressive crew they would love for the federal government to control everything and that is an absolute nightmare but when I say I control everything like how so they want to control all economics Department of Education it can figure out all the environmental regulations all of those things I would kickback everything to the states let the state's decide and if you don't like it get goin I mean that's that's a beautiful thing if you if you really care about marijuana and you live in Alabama right now and it's not legal guess what go to Colorado go to California I mean that that's that's how you'll influence things because you can move your family your value whatever you bring to your community in your life I mean think about it right now if California just kept taxing higher and higher and kept screwing up a lot of this a ton that's going wrong in the state eventually Joe Rogan might be like you know I just built this freaking kick-ass new studio here I'm now paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and all this stuff you might want to try it somewhere else where they're gonna tax you less but that's the beauty of the thing you don't have to leave the country so the federal government should pretty much do nothing it should make sure we're not warring with each other that the states aren't warring that's about and then protect the borders beyond that it doesn't have to do a lot leave it to the states let look if you had a problem here you know your sewage leak right outside you want the federal government to deal with that or do you want the local municipality to deal with that you want everything to be as local as possible because that's how you'll influence things and that's how you as an individual will be empowered and that's all I'm just saying no I mean hearing what you're saying but I'm just not hearing this this clamoring for the government to take care of everything I mean you hear you heard a little bit of from Berni yeah you know but I just think again a lot of that is like it's not doing it now so the idea is that the solution would be if the government takes over and we take more rich people's taxes you know and he'll spout off about income inequality and take that money and redistribute it and then somehow or another that's gonna fix everything but it's not you're just gonna make government bigger you're gonna have more jobs you're gonna have more jobs in government and they're red tape more bureaucrats more bullshit so you're agreeing with yeah yeah for the most part I mean that's the thing it's like they look you want to give free college education everyone first off it's not free I mean that this is just stupid lazy thinking to say it is free it's not free you got to pay the janitor and you got to pray the professor's and everybody else they mean free for students and the idea being that our taxes instead of going towards the military they would go towards education sure so they should at least be honest and say that because a certain amount of people just here free and you just think it's free but it's not free you obviously have to pay for right but also we're moving into an economy where robots are taking over autumn automation is taking over gota you know what I think McDonald said within five years it's all gonna be iPads go to half the McDonald's and you know fast-food places in airports now it's all iPads so if you're the more you're gonna the government which doesn't do anything right or well or efficiently the more they say okay private business you're gonna have to spend more on employees well then all these businesses are just gonna figure out ways which they should do I mean that's ingenuity right they will figure out ways to save costs save expenses and then less people will be hired and then at the same time we're gonna be subsidizing all these people to go to college we're often in college they're learning nothing in gender studies and and all of these other crazy classes and we're just gonna have this set of people who have no real skills and we're gonna set up businesses that will never want to hire them because the government is gonna tell them how much to pay I mean you have employees here you know you pay them what you think is fair and if they don't want to do it they don't have to but imagine if the government came in and was like yo you're gonna have to pay your guys this amount it's ridiculous well think how many people would love to work for you for free I'm sure you get emails every day as I do I don't want to stop I don't want people to work for me for free but like I don't like interns I don't like the idea of it yeah but you're a small business owner that's the fact and you should be able to do whatever with your business and your property that you want you know that I'm the I think we get real there's a lot of cliche terms and one of them is like that people who go to college or studying gender studies or lesbian dance theory but how much of that has really happened it's very small it does exist in some weird states like I'm sure you're aware that lady who was the professor from Fresno State who got in trouble recently there's so many of them which one was some big lady he was talking a bunch of shit it's just there and she said she could never get fired and they didn't fire yeah yeah there's a lot of them there's a lot of really wacky professors out there that do have tenure yeah that woman was tweeting out some bananas stuff in his tenure and she's not gonna go anyway there's universities all over the country they're constantly teaching kids I mean that for the most part these are they're it's a small percentage it's a small percentage but they have way over influence on the amount of people they have scared the majority into silence I mean I don't know how often you're doing colleges these days but I don't know yeah I'm doing them all the time and what I find so I did this thing at University of New Hampshire we post saw so look they first off what they did was they were supposed to be about 300 people there so they at first because of the protesters the school said we can't secure a room so think about are they protesting you about well I was spoke technically I was supposed to be there that day with Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk from turning-point okay and we were going to talk about cultural appropriation and you know some of the hot-button stuff so I don't even know that they all were there to protest me specifically but anyway that day was the day that Candice and Charlie ended up on TMZ with Kanye so they bailed on me and just left they left me for the Wolves they they were on TMZ with Kanye with just a couple weeks ago they Kanye showed up in the TMZ offices with them well so they just showed up with him and they blew off their yeah yeah they're a good appearance yeah well it was me it was me in University of New Hampshire or Kanye and TMZ yeah but they had a schedule like they were supposed to be there and they just decided not to so the people like paid to have you come Yeah right yeah and they we're supposed to be paid to go - come to think of it I didn't get more money for this that is ridiculous the whole thing is ridiculous that they would just blow that off it's like that's a gig yeah I don't blow off a gig because Kanye wants to go on the gossip show yeah but now you're fuckin stupid well now you're talking to me like as a comic good yeah yeah we wouldn't do that it's just a different you don't blow off a gig yeah it's just a different people come to see you don't just decide oh this gig is better for me right now yeah this gig with Kanye on TV hi Harvey that's the thing that they spend time with Harvey Levin instead of me that's well he seems like a nice enough guy this business a little shady yeah but but the whole thing behind it is you don't you don't cancel a gig because you got another gig that you think is better for you last minute like that's terrible what's that phrase man the show must go on yeah it's supposed to go on yeah for sure so I saw you getting it was that the lady the the coin they brought they brought noisemakers they were slamming on shit they were screaming this is where it's so ridiculous like you would let them talk and they didn't have anything to say I mean the best part of this so first off 300 people are supposed to be there they say we can't secure a room on campus so think about what a defeat that is so this is where you might say okay that's a minority of students but think how they affect the majority that meant that a University of New Hampshire is a pretty solid school in the Live Free or State Live for your dice tape right mm-hmm they could not secure because I'm showing up a room on their campus so that's already a massive loss right when you say could not secure you mean safety why they said they could not secure it safety wise there were too many threats whatever the hell that means Twitter chatter other none so Candice and the other guy are gone it's just you yeah the the gay libertarian guy and they're like too dangerous too dangerous too crazy yeah what is he gonna say we're gonna we're gonna have to silence him yeah well I flipped the script on their heads I mean that's what it comes down to like they don't know what the fuck to make of me because I don't play their game but I'm just doing what I think is right I don't think I'm a freaking rocket scientist I don't think I'm some massive intellectual I think I'm someone that can communicate these ideas pretty well and and hopefully we'll talk about it but I'm back in stand-up now like I'm doing I'm just doing what I think is right on this planet while I'm here that's it and so when you do these speeches what do you do when you go to these colleges so so I get up there so they move it from this from the university 300-seat room they move it to a hockey rink of 7,500 seats so think how absurd this think out sir this is 300 people yeah and they're in a how many people in the audience 300 people oh so so apparently they didn't apparently like another hundred supporters of mine showed up but they didn't even let them in even though they were roughly seven thousand one hundred empty seats while Wednesday later man I don't know because at that point security starts everything just gets whacked I mean this happens at every college thing like nobody knows who's in charge anymore you know it's just like this big clusterfuck so anyway so they put up you know like a step and repeat with the turning point symbol behind me and I'm doing my thing but there's a freaking Zamboni back there I'm like what the hell am i doing like this is ridiculous in turning point is that conservative think tank things they're the largest conservative college nonprofit so why do they have that behind you well cause he was sponsored by them Charlie Charlie runs turning-point okay yeah but he didn't even have the fucking show up it was either that that thing goes there or I sit I stand there literally in front of you no see seriously why yeah I mean that's for for them to figure out why they did that but anyway 7,000 empty seats I do my thing I talked for about a half hour and I knew they were a certain you know 250 of those kids were there to listen and agree or disagree I mean think about it these this is the conservative group they're bringing a gay married guy who's Pro pod who's Pro euthanasia who's against the death penalty for reforming the prison system I'm pro-choice like I could go on and on about the liberal cred that you and I don't get anymore right and they're there they're applauding what are they what are they mad at you for well so it's not those guys Reds ever 50 it's the other they're mad they they don't know they just want you to bow forever they don't come to listen right they want to silence you that's it they just they want to silence you about like what is it that they oppose that you're saying Joe I literally every time I they would scream or they'd start robotic Li you know they set timers and then they robotic Li chant we're not the problem or just some other no they say yeah we're not a problem we are and I go look I'd look at them right in the eye and be like I'm standing right in front of you do you have a question for me is there something that I said that upset you any of that and they can't respond they I mean they just can't respond because they're not there to exchange ideas they believe they are oppressed and they I mean look I always go up there what do I say at every college thing I go think about it do you think you have it worse than your grandparents I want everyone in this room to think about your grandparents right now and 99.9% of people in America right now have it better than their grandparents had it I'm sure you have it better than your grandparents added I better than my grandparents had it all of these kids there at University of New Hampshire studying whatever the hell they want to study they have it better than their grandparents but the power of thinking that you're oppressed the power of thinking that the world is warped against you is it's a drug it is truly a drug and one other thing on that so it turns out did you see the exchange I got in with the trans woman yes so it turns so this trans woman is telling me to go fuck myself and whatever she's saying and screaming along with that bullshit said about well cuz I mentioned the Jordan Peterson pronoun thing and I said look I want trans people to be treated equally under the law I want trans people to be respected I hope you find I literally said to her looking right at her I hope I hope you find someone that loves you in your life I mean all I want you to be as equal and happy as anybody else on this planet that is what I want for you she's still telling me to go fuck myself it turns out I didn't know this two weeks later I found this out about a week ago she's a professor of gender studies at University of New Hampshire where she's literally trying you have a professor that is part of the protesters and she's live tweeting the thing about all right Dave Rubin I mean so that's where when when people think it's this little thing it's yeah it's this little thing that's that's metastasizing and spreading like a cancer and I truly believe that identity politics that this thing I think is the biggest threat to to the west and to freedom that exists did you communicate with her at all I communicated her from with my mic but was there did she exchange say what she has a problem so she kept yelling at me and I did she yell out we have a video of this I don't know where it's probably maybe an hour in or so I saw it and I just was like all poor yeah what's he dealing with I got a lot of pity for that which was that it was like well I was shaking the jar corns oh you know it was really funny is that I realized that there's one so there's one moment in I never lost my cool because it's like it's punch of kids Yellin yeah and as long as they're not gonna you know take a samurai sword out and stab me or anything then it's fine but there was one moment where they just kept going and going so I sarcastically said it I was like guys shut the fuck up and it got a big laugh and then I subpoenaed it a couple times but then I realized that when the school newspaper wrote about it they said and then Dave Rubin told them to shut the fuck up shut the fuck up is very different than shut the fuck so that was my one my one lesson in there well nothing seems like is the answer she didn't want anything for me she should be back thrown out for doing that because if you are doing that you're you're disrupting a performance you're I mean I'm sure you would have a Q&A with those people ready to be happy to do that do it after a half hour I opened it up for Q&A let's see the rest the last hour but you didn't even get a chance to get to that with her right she was already yelling I know and then I I think I even said to her I know I did it with several people I'm pretty sure she was too do you have a question for me and I think her last thing was your I hate you or something something to that effect I mean this is a professor she should be disqualified for teaching she says analogical thinker this is not what you want raising your children yeah but essentially that's what they are they're still children you got this fucking dummy who can't focus enough to have a coherent argument they're yelling out in the middle of your performance yeah and by the way for the record the authorities are the police or the campus safety whatever it was did at one point try to have some people sit down and be quiet and I was like guys don't worry about it cuz it's like yeah I guess we could escalate it to that point oh by the way I didn't even want this video to be released when they videotaped this I did not want it to be released cuz I don't want to add fuel to the fire I'm trying to fix some of these part of the problem right is that this becomes something that they know that they can get a video of if they go to your next performance and interrupt you yeah but you know what I don't think they won one person over to their side I don't think one screaming lunatic who who did not come to respect me even though I was there to respect them I don't think they want anybody I think I actually want a lot of people to my side and I I mean I know it because I've received tons of emails about it I've know what you're saying but I don't think it's about winning to your side I think it's about other lunatics that realize there's an opportunity to get attention if they go to your show and yell things out yeah well that's why I we ended up putting the video up because a couple of them would put up these little clips a very selectively edited that made it seem like I was doing things that I wasn't like I was silencing them or just some other nonsense so then finally I was like alright if this is the way the Internet is and it just is then we'll just put up the whole thing on edited even though I had before 10 minutes before I said guys don't even record this I said don't even record this because because Charlie and Candice hadn't showed up and I was like it's ridiculous I got 7000 empty seats behind me but then once people start playing that game you can either just be the bitch which I refuse to be or you can fight back yeah it's a weird place to be because you know what they're doing and they're essentially just trying to rile you up and if they're not willing to have a real dialogue with you they're just yelling fuck Dave Rubin that really should disqualify you for being a teacher I mean that's that's the worst way to communicate you're demonstrating that you're thinking sucks yeah and that you want to teach about Gender Studies but yet you know you you you were interrupting a comment you're trying to claim transphobia or whatever the fuck he's she is trying to claim she it's a she right she's a trans woman right she but she was another one yeah okay yes by the way I treated her with complete respect like that's the thing they they truly they want you they want to put their foot on your neck and have you stay there forever yeah and that's why every time now that somebody mainstream writes something about you half the time they're calling you a conservative because they don't know what the fuck to do with this guy who's talking about drugs and all the crazy shit you're talking about all the time but also you're woke enough to actually identify there is a problem here with what's happening in the mainstream so they can't categorize us in any sensible way so in a weird way especially because me and you also because of the nature of what we do we sit from people that are a little scary you know do you mean like you've had Jones on I've had Molyneux on you know I had certain Abidjan at the beginning and I'm sure you've had plenty of other controversial people and it's like so they there's an odd way that they want to look at the two of us more than other people because we by the nature of our jobs by the nature of how we exist that's a threat if you want to control the way everybody thinks hmm yeah you're not supposed to give people a platform that's what I keep here yeah so what's your policy on that because that seems to be the after this IDW intellectual dark web article came out that was the big thing that people kept hitting me on it's like you don't want any gatekeeping you'll talk to anybody now first of I won't talk to anybody but I'm a general believer that you let ideas out there but what is wrong with talking to people it's always been what people have done there always been interviews with controversial people guess what happens when you stop talking to people yeah not good yeah that's when shit goes down yeah but there's a lot of people that don't want us talking to people I mean I look a lot of people were pissed you you smoke pot with Jones right you smoke pot with Alex Jones I watched it it's bananas I watched all the memes and it's like look that guy has done some seriously twisted crazy shit there is no doubt about it the Sandy Hook stuff and yeah I didn't know about the Sandy Hook stuff by the way before we did the podcast I knew that he believed a bunch of stupid conspiracies that I genuinely just dismissed but I didn't know that he was saying that those kids never died or that it was now that changed the equation for you yeah I would have been mad at him and I would have talked about it right away I mean like the fuck are you talking about those kids are dead like there's a guy that was a it was a terrible story about a guy who is a conspiracy theorist before Sandy Hook then his kid died at Sandy Hook and a bunch of people were threatening him and calling him a crisis actor and saying his kid never died and then he realized how insane it it really is yeah people are looking for conspiracies everywhere man I keep hearing him now about Anthony Bourdain that Bourdain was gonna expose some child pedophile ring and that's why they suicided him it's fucking stupid man without going down fully on that road there is one odd thing about the Bourdain thing which is just a few weeks ago didn't he tweet some odd thing about having the that he's met the Hillary Clinton like machine or something and he was just talking about no no I'll tell you exactly yeah well is it he was talking about the same people that Harvey Weinstein used with that were Israeli was it black cube or some shit see you find the tweet because he was basically saying that Donald Trump's people use the same people that Harvey Weinstein used sir Israeli intelligence group - you know there was something that Harvey had done to his victims where he was trying to silence them by scaring them with these uh these you know right Israeli mercenary type folks alright so point being don't go down that conspiracy but that's not what he was doing I mean he was just saying he's just standing there like he's got he had some crazy thing with his girlfriend was like fully invested in her battle with Harvey Weinstein yeah you know so that's what he tweeted about but it was it's like they would kill him for that like that's so fucking stupid yeah well what about Ronan Farrow what about all the people that wrote the story what about all the people that are accusing him of rape Mike that's the guy is going broke - did that people don't understand that Harvey Weinstein's business is going bankrupt he's fucked yeah he's going to jail oh yeah it's the walls are caving in he doesn't even have his business he's never hiring a mercenary to go kill a chef I mean this is fucking stupid this is good thinking yeah and you know look it's not it's not that it's impossible for someone to have want to hire someone to kill someone I don't think that's what happened I think he killed himself and I think it's a terrible terrible tragedy and I think it's really disrespectful to have all these dumb speculative ideas because there's sport in conspiracies it's a sport yeah it's game there's a hobby that people have and looking to fucking I'm looking for the truth bro I'm looking to fucking close the gaps and this is what it is man it's the Illuminati the second you think you got it there was you got this right here um okay here it is yeah hold on scroll up I am in no way here Lee couldn't I've been on the receiving end of her operatives wrath and it ain't fun right that's from about a month ago x' operatives here we go now you're gonna feel some glance for me her operatives wrath okay but he was the thing is hillary clinton was but before the track before the the scandal happened there's a lot of photos of hillary clinton hanging out with wines Oprah hanging out everybody meryl streep cuddling up with them like the whole thing is there's people that are complicit for sure yeah in one way or another so I'm so after everything you just said and knowing that Jones plays that game a little bit would you have him on again if I had him on again that would be the first thing I would talk about you know I'm I've been friends with Alex since 1998 I've known him for a long time yeah I don't think he's a bad guy but I think he's very wrong about a lot of things he's very misguided about a lot of things and I think he loves conspiracies there is a bunch of people in this country that love to make they love to connect the dots and find conspiracies in fucking everything everything that there is and sometimes the right and Alex has been right definitely he's been right about a bunch of things he was right about the World Trade Organization particular about when they were using agent provocateurs to disrupt protests and make them violent protests by smashing windows and he documented all of it how these people were none of them were arrested they were all they went to one safe house and then negotiated with the police then they were released they'll had military military issue Footwear like he's got all these these documents from people that worked inside either police or law enforcement that say that there is a standard practice and this is existed for a long time and when you have peaceful protests and you can't do anything about it the best way to do something about it is to take that peaceful protest and turn it non peaceful no way to do that you have these guys wear masks they go in they pretend they're one of the protesters they start smashing windows flipping over cars and then you move the cops and then they shot the protest down so you essentially shut the peaceful protesters down by introducing non peaceful people and you these are military operatives these are people that are working for the government or working for whoever the fuck decides to pull the trigger on this and this is real this has happened well there's a lot of people saying that's happening with the Tommy Robinson protests in the UK right now see I don't know enough about that story other than the fact that a bunch of people are mad at me on Twitter that is I'm gonna back away and then I saw something about he was he was filming outside of a trial of muslim paedophiles he's grooming gangs yeah grooming gangs yeah well me the whole story so I don't want to do this as if I'm the freakin lawyer of the whole thing but in effect he was filming outside of the the trial for these this group of men that are raping they're raping like 12 and 13 year old girls basically they're on trial he had already been on probation or something for something else and you're not allowed to film outside a courthouse so technically I suppose he is in jail now for the right reasons but there's a lot of people that think he's not gonna survive being in jail and I look I had the guy on my show have you ever have you ever talked to him no I didn't know anything about him until this this thing happens yeah I mean he has no I know it's a lot it's no I do have kids don't you have to occasionally just pick one and you're like this one dude there's a lot of them I just don't know I don't know what's going on like people how come you're not calmer than this like I don't even know about it you fuck I know I love it I love that when you sit out sending on Twitter for six hours and people start screaming at you like god that proves you or you say anything about it yeah oh you talk all day long this is not then this comes up and you know your word like I don't even hear about some just no yeah well alright let's not dive too deep in that so quick on Jones though so I'm not actually in case you think I am I'm not giving you shit for doing I'm not sure is I'm just curious because I think part of the article that that Barry Weiss wrote in The Times about us she was talking about that and there's a line in there where she said you know if you talk to these people meaning Jones and Serna vich and Lowell knew that you're either cynical or stupid and in effect that was that was a shot at me and you it wasn't a shot at anybody else because they don't have to talk to other people you know I mean like I love Eric and Brett Weinstein you know what she said this yes we can probably find the line but it was that you'd have to I think it was you'd have to be cynical or stupid I would argue that I mean argue against that because I don't think you have to be either cynic or stupid you just have to be a person talking to someone just because you're talking to someone doesn't mean you agree with them yeah use the idea of giving someone a platform like I'm gonna have Ted Nugent on the podcast right you obviously endorse everything he's ever since that's what you're saying right if you have one that's that's the only way that's it how come you can't just talk to the guy and find out like like Candice Owens I don't agree with everything Candice Owen says yeah was a lot of it yeah and this is nothing wrong with having a conversation like that in fact it's illuminating what he got here that's funny pulling up the line this is from The Times piece okay it says it's yes to me that if you're willing to sit across from and Alex challenger mike sorowitsch and take him seriously there's a high probability that you're either cynical or stupid that now if there's a reason for shorting the IDW it's the inability of certain members to see this as a fatal error so now that's Rogan and Reuben now here's nothing that saying yeah I get it I'm just definitely seeing things you can criticize about me but I have the list right but here's the thing if you're saying I'm taking him seriously I got Alex high and drunk and he started talking about interdimensional child molesters like if anything it showed people who he really is like I've known the guy forever I've partied with that dude I've had him coming to my comedy shows and we've gotten fucked up and ran around the town and went to bars together back before everybody knew who he was to unkeyed go places he's a fun guy I don't believe everything he believes I think he's silly in a lot of ways but I like a lot of people that I don't agree with I don't have to agree with them I didn't know about his Sandy Hook denial if I did it would have been the first thing I pressed him on yeah when I talked to him I wanted to do it with my crazy friend Eddie Bravo cuz he believes every fucking conspiracy theory yeah and I wanted to get him with Alex together and it was the clusterfuck that I hoped it would be it was but the good thing about it is it showed people who Alex really is it showed a side of him that you just don't get from his infowar show you get to see him hi and laughing and drunk and pound and whiskey and fucking around and people like oh I could see why you liked that guy and I can see why he's fun we had a good time together doesn't mean I endorse his opinions on things and the idea that this is only red or white that it is one or zero it's binary that's ridiculous yeah why it's ridiculous I just didn't those two choices of adjectives I just thought were slightly like you could shit defending her position I think I think she's doing a smart thing because she's a writer for the New York Times I do have a lot of ridiculous people on and you have had ridiculous people on absolutely so what she's saying makes sense if you take them seriously but she left that yeah if you take I'm seriously I do not take Alex Jones's opinion on interdimensional Charmcaster seriously I don't his opinion I don't smoke pot once a year to test to see what George Soros has done with the marijuana right George Soros is giving the marijuana fucking dosage recommendations like that's pretty sure Roseanne told me that - yeah well she thinks that's another thing I don't know what to do with her now she thinks she apologized up she said George Soros was a Nazi or something yeah he was captured by the Nazis I mean he was like why anyway this guy Rosie's yeah this gatekeeping thing I just think it's interesting because if we're gonna do what we do well at whatever level we do it it's like we're gonna have to talk to people that people don't like and listen look Larry King this is the one thing I always say it's like Larry King in the in his heyday think of the prime Larry King right so 1991 CNN prime time yeah he could have you know the OJ Simpson lawyers on Monday he could have the Castro Seinfeld on Tuesday he could have a magician on Wednesday he could have Lucille Ball if she was still alive on Thursday and then you know George the Secretary of State or something so no one thought he endorsed all of those ideas or friends with all those people but I think somehow now because because this feels like your home mine is actually in my home hmm the way we are we're different we're friendlier we're not sitting here with no cards and with ifvs and it doesn't feel well produced and planned and all that even though I think we both do a hell of a fucking professional show that I think we're both really proud of I think because of that they think now you're seeing the real them or so or something like that like it's it's not just looking for shit to complain about listen one of the reasons why I decided to do a podcast in the first place because I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted I wanted to be able to talk to my friends have a good time fuck around along the line it became something different and along the line I became not just talking to my friends it became talking to people that are famous or interesting people or professors or writers or whoever it is mm-hmm and I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want yeah and that's why I'm doing this I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want if I want to talk to and if you don't like who I'm talking to it's super simple you just don't listen to that episode and go Rogen you're all right now all you have is alright people you think you're balanced up because you have a B Martin on once a year I just think I talked to people you know I talked to a lot of people there's I like talking to people I like talking to people I agree with and I occasionally talk to people I disagree with when I get something out of that - yeah how aware are you of the thing that you just said there that like you did exactly what you set out to do I don't know that you fully set out to do it this way but you did it like this thing that you have created is so it it is so what you wanted to do whether you unfold it or not but like you created it it's awesome like I'm I'm doing it at a I think a lower level than you are but I'm very aware of that that like I somehow I hated what the system was offering and I was like I gotta do something that feels right for me and I came at it from a different place did it cuz I didn't come out from a place like I need a gig I came at it from a place like yeah it would be fun yeah fuck around right the other things yeah I mean novels are already a professional stand-up I was already a commentator for the UFC so this wasn't like when I came I mean I did it for years for zero money yeah for years because I just did it for fun literally for fun do it once a week have fun sit down have some comics over wood smoke some pot talk some shit have a couple of laughs and then next thing you know I've got Graham Hancock on and you know next thing you know I've got Bourdain on and I've got you know this professor and this author and then and then it got weirder and weirder but it just to me it's just what's interesting talk to people and I've never looked at it like like like there's anything I have to do I've never looked at it like that I've just it was like well this would be cool oh that guy sounds cool let me get him yeah this guy might be interesting I like to talk to that dude I want to find out about sleep I want to find out about exercise I want to find out about diet I want to find out about like what how the fuck this finance is really where I want to talk to Peter chef tell me how this works honey what what do you do how do you how you making your money like what the fuck is going on in Puerto Rico this this I love talking to people man I've it's a fascinating thing to pick the brain uninterrupted with no distractions to sit down and talk to someone for hours at a time you learned a lot about yourself you learn conversation much better at talking to people and being sensitive and open-minded and being considerate and and listening and that's a big thing like listening and communicating with people not just waiting for my time to talk but communicating with people it's like I feel like conversation is a lost art with a lot of folks and I've gotten way way better at it over the whatever many years nine years nine years of doing this show yeah I'm with you I mean I hear you all I mean I said at the beginning but I just I'm doing what I think is right yeah it's fun that's like it when I see like the barrage of hate that I'll get online for this or that or just you know it's the same thing it's just these people that just endlessly want to hate on everything and all that to my voice oh is like if you're spending all day long hating on me like if you think that what I'm doing is the real problem here you know you mean like let's say I'm wrong on everything right say everything I said for the first 10 minutes about politics is wrong and we should have strong federal government and identity bollocks like even if that is that's how it really is am I really the biggest problem here that people are all day long devoting Twitter accounts people that make accounts all day wrong fuck Dave room and Dave urban socks it's like what do you do is that going on all the time it's like wait do people get laid you shouldn't know that that's happening that's the part of the problems you're sort of indulging it by paying attention to it there's just too many I'm paying way less attention yeah that's good yeah you can't pay attention at all I dude I was in a sensory deprivation tank just two three days ago thanks to you I've been doing it more I was doing one of these infrared saunas I'm doing I know I'm doing all my August off-the-grid I did it last August just literally nothing I locked my phone in a safe really locked my phone in a safe for 30 days do all the TV no nothing off-the-grid August we had some Ruben something rubenesque something or some like that but I'm gonna do it for now on I'm doing that every August really yeah I am completely shutting down I'm working on this book that I started last August and then of course the year gets so crazy that I have to pick it up again in August I've been writing it now I'm on the road what's the book like I mean I don't want to go too far in it but it in effect it's when I did that Prager you about why I left the left that's sort of the the genesis of it of sort of giving people a little bit of a roadmap what is a preggers you video instead of it so you're familiar Yeah right what dennis prager yeah so super conservative fella yeah so he does he has this you know online university where they do these five minute cartoon videos on different ideas and they'll do on economics and foreign policy and race and religion etc etc etc and so I did one it was about a year and a half ago February of last year called well I had actually never said the phrase why I left the left but I just talked about my frustrations with the left and why I believed in freedom and in liberty they titled it why I left the left and and truly the first the first half-hour when it dropped I was pissed because I was like man did they just like blow my gig like I really felt at that time I feel a little differently now that I was trying to fix the left from within or at least have conversations as someone that was one of these people like that's why I was focusing on the left the all these liberals were my people this is the thing that I grew up in that I always believed in so the fact that they did that first half-hour I was like fuck like did I just get booted out and then quickly I realized that video went went so viral it's their number one viewed video on YouTube that I was like you know what I have to just kind of embrace this and and again it goes back to the label saying it doesn't really matter whether you left the left or whether you're a libertarian or not a liberal the rest of it but anyway that's the the genesis of the book of like just how do you escape this sort of monolithic totalitarian thinking and how do you just be whoever you are and how does that how does being an individual basically lead you to being happy because I think that's actually the only way that you can be happy I think that that's it you have to you know it's most cliche thing ever it's what Peterson's telling these people every night the thousands and thousands and thousands of people are showing up every night and he talks about the individual he talks about stand up straight you know clean your room like these things will sound silly at some level and I'm the more that I'm with the guy it's like he is giving these people saying that has just been so lost like so absolutely lost people think you can just be put blame the system everything else is somebody else's fault you should be given shit all of this stuff and it's like everything about every movie any movie whatever your ten favorite movies are is it about a guy who just was like oh the world sucks and what the fuck am I gonna do and somebody it's somebody else's fault no every great movie whatever you guys got a problem and guess what he does how's the problem yeah and that's what you're supposed to do this is an adventure this dis life but when you mean the individual like being an individual dealing would be happy what do you mean by that that well first off that we should only be judged as individuals right that's it so remove all the immutable characteristics I'm gay Big Damn look but you got any specific questions for me on that like Big Damn whoop oh is that big damn right but like you know like that just saying that means nothing other than you can figure out right you know who I sleep with right right okay that that's it all we can do is judge people as individuals and you have to just figure out what is right for you so for all the people that I disagree with that are sort of like big government lefties and bobble and I get why that you need maybe need a little more of that if you live in a big city where you might need more noise regulations than if you lived in the freakin if you live in the middle of Idaho on a farm or whatever it's like if that's the life that you want to live then fight for that but what we're doing now is this collectivist craziness is causing people to be unable to think clearly so like Huffington Post yesterday wrote a thing about how you have to choose between being for gay people or said I think it was for queer people or for chick-fil-a not happened to be is because of Jack yeah cuz Jack Kent retracted his tweet about chick-fil-a and it's like I have a tweet about chick-fil-a yeah he tweeted that he showed like a digital receipt that he bought chick-fil-a and then Soledad O'Brien was like you tweeted that on Gay Pride Month endless but why would he tweet of a chick-fil-a receipt was a guy like chick-fil-a who cares like yeah you better not like chick-fil-a because that meal a dance I eat usually I took a picture yesterday there was a chick-fil-a next door to to the theater we were out I took a picture of chick-fil-a there and I tweeted out the thing and it's like I like chicken sandwiches every time I've gone into a chick the people are going to find me one fast-food restaurant is that we got here so that's what he did tweet oh it's a cash out that's one of our sponsors your 10% boost at chick-fil-a was applied you were charged 2843 chick-fil-a uh-huh he dared and save 10% on gay pride he wrote boost and then he tagged chick-fil-a hmm and Soledad O'Brien showed who showed him who's boss but I'm saying that that sort of this endless guilting and and you know you do this so you're evil it's ruining the fabric of society it really is eat chicken if you like chicken don't eat it if you don't like it but that's what individualism is about if you want to make the choice if you think that whatever chick-fil-a is doing to gay people whatever they're secretly doing a gay people if you think that's so II believe him though by the way during the pulse nightclub shooting at the gay club in Florida when 51 people were killed they gave free food to everybody but if you think they hate gay people that much then don't shop there but you don't have to harangue everybody else into doing everything that you want them to do that's actually the reverse of freedom yeah live and let live that that's what I could see people if they're saying that chick-fil-a is a homophobic institution that that you shouldn't endorse chick-fil-a particularly if you're a gay man but what does that mean I go into church okay not that I know of okay so it's not that seem weird I don't I don't know just but he clearly is an influencer and I think that the cash app if I had to guess because they sponsored this podcast they're very active in sponsoring podcasts they probably have some sort of an endorsement deal with him that is why he did that so it was a financial thing for the cash app okay yes all right so we don't know about that specifically but if they were paying him to do it I mean that's for him to that's I mean again that's for him as an individual to decide I am going Pride Month is this month this month this is the gayest month there is damn and I'm here with you hello June all right yeah Jude very gay but I'm saying like but how many people are upset how many pieces but but it goes exactly to where we start with this whole there is this loud group of people and most of them have some sort of odd influence in media there all of these blue check BuzzFeed 4000 Twitter follower people and then retweet all of the articles of the people like them at salon and box and BuzzFeed in the Minda and they make it seem like we're all hysterical crazy people and I simply don't believe that I believe that most people I would say the vast majority of people probably I mean I think it's something crazy like 80% of people I think are good decent people who just want people to live they want you can fuck who you want to fuck you can smoke what you want to smoke you can't do it on my property you can't take what's mine you can't force me to bake a cake or do any of those things but you can little allow people to live as they see fit I think that's what most people are and that's why there's such a pushback that's the answer to the Petersons thing Petersen said I'm not gonna use pronouns that the government forces me to use that's all that's what put him on it's also mean there's so many of them they got so silly with that that it made sense that someone was pushing back 278 different gender pronouns yes and you're obviously dealing with people that are being silly yeah this is not like there's like not just people being self oh you remember when Miz came along there was Miss and there was mrs. and when was that what year was that I was a kid I remember being super confused I'm like they made a new thing you know what smile he's the CEO of that company too who is Jack yeah of cash at OE the oh yes that's total science yeah okay well there you go hmm um I just think that well that's a tricky one that's that's different well look he's a guy promoting something on one of the things that he owns and says but he's doing it on Gay Pride Month oh who cares I mean really like it just so what so what is it that they so I guess at one point they were against gay marriage and maybe they still are now who knows what every couple that's not a late CEO isn't the CEO dead I think the CEO that was like super yeah I think it is the the original guy and I think they honor his wishes though and keep it close on Sunday still you know what every time I was dupit its fuck because I want a chicken sandwich on Sunday yeah so somebody should be opening somebody should be opening the Sunday chicken sandwich could not in pro-gay Anjou not in June solidarity to my gay brothers and sisters it's also stupid eat a sandwich if you want a sandwich don't everytime I've got into chick-fil-a when you've got its chick late are they nice or not yes when I've been there literally twice and are they nice I remember there's nobody at me they're friendly they don't think everything's ok yeah yeah I just don't think that uh I don't think there's that much outrage I think there's a business in outrage though and there's certainly a business and a lot of people that write these articles and the the Jordan Peterson thing has been very illuminating to me because I've watched them misrepresent his positions on so many different things and call him so many horrible names transphobic racist all right all these different things and and do so with you know with no justification or rationalization like you look at the actual article and they don't they don't post to what he actually said it's like that woman in the the monk debates what was it called oh yeah it's called the monk debate yeah yeah whoever that woman was Goldberg I think whatever it was it was her and Eric Dyson yeah when she said you know that he doesn't want her to where he doesn't think she should be able to wear makeup at work he's like I never said that well you can google it well we can't do that we can google it we can find out you made me Google something that you were wrong about yeah that's that's upsetting to me yeah I don't want you to do that you know that bothers me more than anything that is dishonest it's a hundred percent dishonest she knew he did not say that they were he was having an intellectual exercise we had an interviewer and it's I think one of the things that's gotten him into trouble is his openness to discuss things with question mark just bad I don't question marks I don't know I don't know if we can work together we've only been doing it for 40 years I don't know why do women wear makeup in the workplace why do women wear short skirts and high heels why do they I don't think he's saying you can't do that you shouldn't be able to do that he's saying why he's saying that there's obvious realities when you turn on CNN why is it that Jake Tapper Anderson Cooper Wolf Blitzer and the rest of the men are all in suits they dressed exactly same Anderson's are a little more tailored but everybody dressing what are the women all where every single woman dresses they all wear dresses with cutoff sleeves that write their own spray-tan they all have gorgeous hair lipstick blah blah blah why isn't wolf blitzer walking in there with the cut off would look like Netflix special I have a whole bit about it yeah about women on Fox News versus men on Fox who's watching it with the sound off smoking pot it's some sort of a wildlife show yeah it's something very strange is a weird cultural dance that we're doing right so if so the idea that Jordans talking about this that men and women dressed differently women put on lipstick to look tracted why do you work out joe rogan because i don't kill people so number one so you don't kill people but number two you want to look good you want to feel good you want to be in a body that is your and want to look good for your wife and your ba-ba-ba-ba and you want to live long right like the to deny these realities all the time and to think that that's because of your toxic masculinity and all of this nonsense I agree that it is a loud minority but what I what I think maybe we're we're having a little difference is that I think this thing has spread in a way it is so easy to believe this nonsense this abject drivel that it is in it is infecting young people at an alarming rate but by the way there's a lot of hopeful signs on this because now they're doing all these studies that the generation right after Millennials so the kids that are like you know like 15 now that they're actually more conservative now because they see all this as absolute hysteria so I think there is we are getting like a little bit of a rubber band effect on this thing and I think things are shifting into normalcy and that's why people are listening to your show and listening to Sam's podcast and everything else I think there's an issue with people commenting on things that other people were saying and just sort of jumping in and not having the other person there to discuss these subjects with particularly like why do women wear makeup at work why do women dress the way they dress I think if you set if you were sitting down with Jordan talking about it he's willing to engage in these subjects with a very very broad canvas I mean he's willing to look at all the various aspects of them because as a legitimate intellectual that's what he's doing it's an intellectual exercise in discussion of cultural norms like why do women wear these shoes where you can see their toes yeah in the in the workplace whereas if a guy showed up with flip-flops on you like Mike the fuck were at work here get out of here with this bullshit outfit yeah go put on some goddamn dress shoes and we're in the office you know it is strange that women wear very little clothes in comparison to the way men do on these shows and I don't think there's anything wrong with the discussion the problem is framing it as if he's saying you shouldn't be able to he's if someone got on TV and said you shouldn't be able to wear makeup at work you shouldn't be able to dress like that that would be a problem so think about what these guys are doing in effect so right so you're saying that Jordans taking basically a decent but potentially confusing position but it's but it's basically a right decision of let's have a conversation so when they write all these hip pieces and why do they do it because they can't get anyone you know they just did release this study about journalists and they're basically all paid like 45 grand a year and they're alcoholics you know just broadly speaking and they just want all these cliques they want their jobs and they realize that these websites that are faking as journalists faking as places of journalism that they're just trying to hold on to their jobs as long as they can but if you're one of these people what's a great way to keep your job oh there's a guy out here who's sold over a million copies of his book who's on tour selling out Beacon Theatre and blah blah blah all over the world I'm gonna write a hip piece on him cuz guess what that's gonna drive a hell of a lot more traffic than writing something something honest so that's part of the game and you know he I've discussed this many times including on stage with him why does he keep retweeting the articles his belief is while I'm still here I'm still here I have exposed them and I'm still here and if anything I'm bigger because of it and now nfm was a guy who's his friend yeah I know he's pissed about that one that was a weird one yeah because the guy's argument was shit it was like I was raised like why I think Jordan Peterson is dangerous yeah like dangerous you didn't explain dude why well this the problem that I'll give you many chances like that if you write something like that it doesn't make any sense now I'm gonna discredit your opinions I'm not gonna think about I'm not gonna go oh let me listen to this intelligent person's perspective I'm gonna go oh this is that silly fuck that had that dumb idea about Jordan Peterson that I feel like it was just it was a some sort of rationalization for him getting attention to virtue signal over what Peterson is saying yeah but didn't he didn't have any real points didn't make any sense I don't think I actually read that that full one but I know that you're twice yeah so I know they try to go back over it and see if I'm if it made any sense to me that nothing you got nothing that you just didn't represent his opinions are accurately that's the problem when people don't represent the opinions accurately you set up a straw man and then attack the straw man and then have this clickbait tea title like oh you just need a hug yeah yeah getting attention they need a hug I mean that's what they need but I'm telling you man this tour it has been a freaking love fest every night when I go up there and I'm warming up the crowd and I'm doing silly lobster jokes and you know some of his other buzz words and I'll talk about make a couple jokes about Kathy Newman or like some other silly things so what you're trying to say is yeah so like I do like a role on those like five different ones it's like a whole bunch of stuff but like when I I'll go up there and I usually make some reference to the intellectual darkweb and if I say your name or I say Shapiro or Sam or whatever people go crazy and what's what I'm realizing about it is all of these people think about all the people however many hundreds of thousands of people are watching this or listening to this right now and then how many millions will you know in the next two weeks or whatever most of them are doing it alone right they're watching on their phone or they're listening on their iPad whatever it is or you're may be watching with your boyfriend or girlfriend but most people it's a pretty solitary experience in the in the world of what we do now imagine and it's like when you do stand-up now 3,000 people piled into this place and you can look around and go whoa there's some other people like me and they're not bad people and actually what I found is that these people look good they dress right like I'm not to make it all about material stuff but like they look like people who are trying to get their shit together and I think I said it to you right before we sat down but me at this moment I truly feel like like the best that I've ever been I really do and it's partly because of that because you cannot be around that constantly I'm not saying everything he says is right and I'm still not with them on some of the religious stuff and I have Sam I'm doing my show when I leave here to go with Sam Harrison they're they you know they're really at loggerheads on some of the tricks a moderator I swear to God and Sam has said this too I swear to God if I was there with the two of them I could have worked it out when that whole truth yeah that they bounded back and forth for an hour on the meaning of truth I wish I was there and we talked about doing some live event together we never got around because Sam's doing a lot of live events yeah well so they're doing it with they're having Bret Weinstein moderate it but I would have been thrilled to feed with look I love Bret there's nothing about Brett Langer would be nice yeah yeah like so either it could have been one of us or or whatever it's completely fine and I think they just wanted like a more sciency focused person and he's biologists powerhouses so that's like if there's any like they're doing jiu-jitsu on each other yeah this is any like openings they're trying to choke each other that's kind of but that's how we find out of ideas are valid you know you let guys like them discuss them they just it was very unfortunate that at least they're first-person yeah the second one I think was much better but the first one was just a cluster fest I called Sam up afterwards I was like this is crazy non conversation you guys had he's like yeah I just got you know stuck yeah but think how cool that is that two of them are the two of them are some of our leading public and intellectual yes in the country in the world probably they're debating over the nature of truth mm-hm and millions of people care yeah that's a little different than what's going on on CNN on any given day oh for sure well there's a real problem with mainstream news and first of all there's a problem in that it's a ratings driven thing it's like everything they're doing they're trying to get ratings anytime there's a big story in the news it's just like what is it what are people going to pay attention to that's what we're going to put on there's no consideration like is this interesting to us is this what we want to discuss it's it's a news program but it's not a news program because it's also an entertainment program yeah and then they have commercials every 15 minutes you know did you see the Jim Acosta thing what he did they're yelling at the Trump during the Korea thing is crazy that's crazy that a journalist would insert himself into that sort of a situation and interrupt and yell things out and people don't have a problem with that they are we are truly watching the implosion of the media and that's why I meant before it's like if they would just lie a little bit just lie a little bit on the margins as they probably always have done I don't think we'd be in this position because people wouldn't be able to so clearly see how messed up the whole thing is but because they've become so hysterical writing articles that are completely the reverse of the truth because they're actually acting like petulant children all the time and because they half the time it's like they pretend they're nonpartisan but if you just look at any of these journalists Twitter feeds it's like pretty obvious what you all are all of you in the mainstream media they've created an opening so that now if people want some sense of truth you turn into Joe Rogan and you're turning to all of these other shows so I think it's very difficult to get employment if you're not on one side of the fence or the other side of the fence and you're a journalist it's not it's it's not a simple world like the world of podcasting what you truly can be independent yeah I mean I think I think in a lot of ways it's like Hollywood you know I've always described Hollywood as one of the main problems with it is you get a bunch of people to come here seeking attention right that's the reason why they're here in the first place they want Fame they want exorbitant amounts of attention and then on top of that you are entered into this system where you have to be chosen for each part it's not like you can like you have a sprint and the guy who's the fastest is the one who wins yeah that's not like that it's someone's us well Dave why don't you read these lines like hmm I might like you Dave how do you feel about Hillary Clinton cuz I'm Pro Clinton yeah I mean that we want Clinton to win don't we want Clinton to win Dave and you're like oh my god yeah you'll drop your standards yeah I'm a huge supporter of Clinton I think she's amazing and I've seen this because you you're it's this weird environment where you want these people to like you so you're terrified of saying anything even remotely controversial that doesn't stick to the script of this left-wing discourse so there's all these people that are just just just faking it they're bullshitting if they might not even have real opinions but they've adopted this predetermined pattern of opinions that they think that it's gonna help them get through the door with these producers and these studio executives and that's Hollywood yeah and when someone breaks free you know occasionally someone becomes right-wing you know whoever the fuck they are with its Chuck Woolery or Dennis Miller or they look at that fucking crazy man broke from the pack you know look at what's-his-name the fucking actor got the older guy Oh john-boy no not john-boy the other one very good there's Gary Sinise expose got in trouble with Dave Cross's wife he said like Dave Cross's wife said that he tried to hit on her when she was 16 James Woods James Woods yeah yeah yeah he's really dealt himself hey he's got a giant dick yeah yeah he's dealt himself in he's all in y'all in and he's like sort of like resigned himself to never work again yeah I mean means but he's probably like 75 years old or whatever he is he's probably I don't give a fuck anymore yeah I mean I'm pretty sure he's got fuck you money like possibly yeah yes he's definitely saying fuck you so if he doesn't have the money she might wanna doesn't that prove though why doing this what was the right thing to do because I'm very aware right now it's like I got a lot of good chicken on I'm getting offers and all sorts of different things and I'm like I'm my own boss I'm not gonna fire me I'm not gonna accidentally tweet something one day and then go that down the fire Dave Rubin like right you know like my my fans fund most of what we do and it's like I need to grow like we definitely need to grow because they're just my guys are just doing too much but I'm also very aware that the more we start growing that all the problems that you just laid out will start becoming more and more real so I like being a slim and trim as possible at least for now mm-hmm because I don't want to be down the road where we've had we got too many people there's too many just different competing interests and business interests and political interests and everything else so it's like that's why I mean you're what you're doing here it's freaking it's amazing man it's amazing yeah it's nice to be able to do it for sure it's nice to be able to just have opinions on things yeah and and and also just know that you're a nice person yeah and that you're not trying to like I'm not trying to do any evil like I'm an I like I look at like Who I am like I'm a nice guy like okay all right well what are my opinions why can't I talk to this guy what could I have why I can't have discussions on these subjects you know like there's a lot of people that feel like if you're not in a certain group you shouldn't have discussions on certain things now if you're a straight man you shouldn't talk about gay rights if you're a man you shouldn't talk about women's issues you shouldn't talk about me - unless you're a hundred percent supportive you shouldn't discuss the subtle nuance of human interaction yeah well didn't Martin Luther King he wanted us to be judged by those things right and he said if you're only this color you can talk about that I'm pretty sure yeah but also you know there was an article right after that IDW thing came around the times that was calling you a conservative and I think I think I emailed it to you because I was like man what seducing what thing said the renegade conservative right that's what it was Pro gay rights Pro women's rights pro-choice pro-marijuana Pro universal health care Pro universal basic income like what else do I have to do like what what are the things in my Oh pro-second amendment he must be right one yeah well Joey you're off your range you just have what do you think you don't have a series of thoughts that don't all lock in but you have to be in a pattern that you have to be in the pattern and I just don't understand why someone's willing to be dishonest like that like a cursory examination of people's thoughts and positions on things would lead someone to realize I'm definitely not a right wing person but they but the thing is that they have owned the narrative for so long you can still get away with yes yes and and what's happening is now it's shifting that's what I mean by I think we're starting to win and I don't mean it win like we're gonna destroy these people I mean I think the narrative has started to shift a little bit where the enthusiasm behind the conversations that we're all having whoever it is in this thing hmm the enthusiasm is so great and there is no counter enthuse yeah where are all the versions of us on the other side of this I'm right no I don't even mean on the right like the people that really are selling identity politics at a really great way at a comedy level who have a huge podcast and like where is the where is that intellectual set of people where's the Sam Harris of the other side of this or the that have real followings they don't exist and that's partly why the hysteria has been ramped up they can't believe that out of nowhere just because of our own all of our just wherewithal and desire to do what we think is right or what makes us happy or whatever the hell you want to call it they can't believe we all frickin created something well they won't create job that we're all in a group I'm weirded out the soup we're in a boyband or I guess christina hoff sommers isn't that bad yeah who else is in that band is Heather in it yeah is she in there I mean it look we don't hurry to Brett well you got the card yet on a unit card dude the clubhouse is under your studio me and Shapiro were joking around about it but like with like the Superfriends yeah like what is this this is the weirdest Avengers ever it's a weird group of humans I mean me and Ben we disagree on a lot of shit but we're super friendly to each other yeah like what I do is show or he doesn't I really enjoy like him you do freakin Shapiro show before my show what sorry what the guys had a show for three weeks this is what are you feeling people are mad at me with the way I dressed see that like they're like everybody else is wearing a nice shirt at a time like listen man I told the guys I was on my way to the Comedy Store you want to take a photo of me I'll be there you're not in the bush in the brush yeah I should be in a bush hi everybody I'm sucking up my ass I'm wearing fucking chucks we're in Converse in a some sort of a flannel shirt it's a I bought that jacket Alaska I've just that's how was where just what I was wearing at the Comedy Store dinner sure I said all right men that's what I'm wearing no greenery around the Comedy Store never got the sense yeah what will North either way I just don't I don't give a fuck that's what I look at that's who I am yeah and I'm not interested in portraying an image just it is what it is you know it's like this this intellectual dark web like it's fucking Eric he's crazy he gets mad when I call him crazy he loves it he's trying to get me to on the whatsapp oh I'm on the group the little fucking chat room just two or three messages a day for different group text conversations with comedians where we're talking shit about things and there's nothing around I don't have time for this I'm busy man all right well then you can't come to the club trying to make a yoga class yeah I don't know fucking time yeah who the hell knows like are we a group do we have a meeting and shellacked cards and later we have in common I think we have a respect for our audience and intellectual curiosity actual curiosity for sure yeah yeah and I think that's where that's where a guy like me and Shapiro although we have very different opinions on many different things you know I think we both are intellectually curious yeah so think about I've had been on many times I consider him a friend we've we've broke bread together although it's kosher which makes it fucking what do you have to eat the house such a smart guy follow that voodoo well whatever I want but yeah he usually brings something or you know has one cheated a kosher restaurant I did eat at a kosher restaurant with him once but then it was all these Orthodox Jews there and then they treat him like cheese's and I was like dude I'm not a photographer you know dude I have to take all these pictures of him and they're like who's that guy I was like I'm not doing that again but it's funny but you know I've had Shapiro on look he's not inherently for gay marriage right I've had my Studios in my house wearing whatever thoughts on gay marriage well now he takes the libertarian position it which is the government shouldn't be involved but I don't know that but but I see a lot of conservatives doing that where they should have all like this is where Rand Paul is I mentioned before he should have been years ago screaming that he's for gay marriage because if you're truly a libertarian the government doesn't tell me what to smoke sleep with then the libertarians could have taken a really awesome powerful principled position and said this isn't about religion it's not it's about freedom it's one of the things that I shove in the face of people that were Hillary Clinton supporters might you know that she didn't support gay marriage till 2013 you know goddamn crazy it is I support it when I was 13 yeah this fucking grown up old lady with grandchildren yeah he's telling people that she's not for gay marriage until it became convenient politically and she just wanted to separate herself as being at least the semi conservative option compared to Barack Obama yep look Barack Obama was not for a gay marriage at the beginning he got pinned into it because Biden made that stupid comment on Meet the Press where he was basically like everyone's forward and then Obama had to come out for it but think about it if if all of this stuff that we're talking about keeps winning if it all keeps winning mm-hmm what will happen in 50 years they will literally look back at video of Barack Obama campaigning the first around saying that he's for traditional marriage and they will call Barack Obama a homophobe and they will eventually want they will want the Barack Obama library that's being built now in Chicago they will want that being taken down because that would be that that will be the statues of our day so that that's why I don't know where you're not at on the monument stuff but I would not take any of them down you can put up a counter plaque or something right next to it to say robert e lee did this or that but the idea that removing the shit i think is absolutely terrible erase history no I agree with you I think they should there's a problem with having them in town squares and celebrating them but there's also a problem in that they were all most of them the ones that you they're they're talking about in the south they were resurrected during the civil rights movement to sort of counteract the civil rights movement so like these these are really this is not like a celebration of these people back in the day when they were viable this is during the civil rights movement they erected these fairly cheap and they put them up quickly and they did it in response to black people wanting more rights and yeah I would still face yeah I get it I would still be not for taking them down you put up something next to it you put you what I would be about if you want to compromise I'm for taking it down and replacing them with something else and putting them somewhere else like if you want to have a civil war museum so that would be the compromise where you could get me I'm not saying you should melt them but it's there's something to there's something to the argument that their racist statues and especially if you understand the motivation behind creating them in the first place yeah the problem though is that you know I mean I know you know this it never ends where it's supposed to you know people wanted to go after George Washington and Trump said they did Trump said that and people were ridiculous t'me dee Utley afterwards someone wanted to take down a statue of George Washington I was in Old Town Alexandria where George Washington's church was and it's actually the same church that robert e lee went to so they had a plaque for both in them and because they took down the robert e lee one they also took down the george washington one at the church that george washington went to i mean if you follow that logic and this is what you have to do when you're when you're doing these sort of historical Tracking's they will come for everything so think about it thomas jefferson's my favorite founder thomas jefferson you can go to his house in Monticello and they do if you go on the tour it's incredible they are incredibly honest about his relationship to slavery that he owned slaves his whole life he was having an affair with at least one slave and most likely had children with that slave at the same time he was writing the laws that freed the slaves so without this man these things don't move forward so we all lived with these odd inconsistencies George Washington George Washington who gave up power after the after the Revolution like he did the most incredible thing you know he gave a power as the commander of the army after the Revolution the most incredible thing that a that a leader of a country could do he owned slaves his entire life when he died and did this they do this at his house and it's outside DC I'm blanking on it for a second I get in a second but you can go on the tour there and he had his slaves his entire life when he died his half of the slaves got freed but Martha Washington's half didn't Martha kept disliked the capital bitch yeah so it's like all of these things it's like so Charlotte had half the slaves we kind of she had inherited them I think from her parents or something like that like it's all it's deeply twisted and warped and of course it was it now of course we can objectively look at it and go slavery was wrong and you shouldn't of course but they all were doing things in their time that you'd the world doesn't magically become what you want it to be just because you exist and think something and and the more that we start thinking that the more will eventually come after Obama for running against gay marriage the first time and and all of these things there is something that we think you love me right you love ELQ and all this other stuff guess what one day if this craziness keeps going they will look back when you're a grandfather and they'll be like they ate meat because we're at that point we'll be eating you know artificially produced whatever and they'll they'll literally watch videos of you chomping on you know some ribs and go see what a savage he was so that's why you have to just be aware of what your time is time in this world yeah they're doing it right now exactly yeah um did you ever see the video of Obama talking about illegal immigration it's incredible it's it's really amazing it's when he was a senator and downing for president the first time and he is more like he's stricter than in then Trump yes I mean it's a fascinating thing because no one brings that up and no one called him racist then but I guess we're dealing with a long time ago you know it's well I mean there's a couple of things it was it was it 2011 he was doing that he was a senator so it was probably around 2010 2011 something like that I mean look there's a lot of things there right he mean he's black number one so in Psych they're not gonna call him racist it doesn't it creates a thing where they can't compute what does that actually mean he was saying the things that people wanted to hear he also wanted to be elected yeah he want to be elected so they elevated him to a point that he was God play this let's listen to this yeah 2005 2005 yeah this is early on oh so he's on the need to better secure the border and a punish employers who choose to hire illegal immigrants you know we are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country so that's why we need to start by giving agencies charged with border security new technology new facilities and more people to stop the process and deport illegal immigrants having said that securing the borders alone does not solve immigration management we're going to have to better manage legal immigration in order to end illegal immigration senators McCain and Kennedy point us in the right direction on that point right now we've got millions of illegal immigrants who live and work here without knowing their identity or background that's part of the reason that we need a guest worker program to replace the flood of illegals with a regulated stream of legals who enter the United States after checks and with access to labor rights part of the reason that illegal immigration is so damaging that it ends up creating a pool of workers with depressed wages and no rights and that's not something that we find acceptable it's crazy dude American employers also need to take responsible I mean I just scribble down like I was doing homework in seventh grade think about what he said there we have to secure the border secure the border trunk yeah secure the border Wow punish you if you hire if you hire illegal workers if you if you enter illegally you're showing disregard for our laws you we cannot allow illegals to pour in we can't let them go ahead of lawful people who are you like to enter the country we need better border security more more process and deportations we have to better manage legal immigration and then he talked about the millions that are here now which in effect is a pathway to citizenship which by the way Trump is basically for at some level so it's like so what are we really talking about every time we scream that everybody is racist did he just make a wild but sorry ass when he's talking about Latino people so is Barack Obama racist against Latino people well this was when he was a senator looks like he was elected in 2008 and so he was probably gearing up to run when he was in 2005 the things that he was saying he was letting people know who he is and that he's out there and starting the ball rolling you know this is a different time too 2005 was just a different world and it seems like it shouldn't be because there was only 13 years ago but goddamn is a different so what does that say then what does that actually say about the way things have changed or the cult of personality around Trump or just sort of the general derangement of the media that they can't view these things it's not just the media I think it's also people's access to communication the fact that anyone can voice their opinion whether it's on Facebook or YouTube or what-have-you you know it's it's a different world Twitter you just you just tweet instantaneously this is fucking bullshit you know people should be able to do whatever they want or whatever you know whatever you want to say and then a bunch of people can agree or disagree or retweet it or you know or screen grab it because they think that it's damaging to you and they put I can't believe you support this piece of shit and think that a you can wake up on any given morning find someone you've never heard of who said something you slightly disagree with and you can help get them fired that's a lot there's a lot of people want to do that too much it's really interesting that people want to get people fired for opinions it does that doesn't make a lot of sense to me but really if we were to do a deep dive on that it's like well what did we just hear that is different than what Trump is trying to do right now does Trump you sloppy language yes does Trump lie yes but they all lie o Muhammad if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor lie Syria redline lie those are pretty big lies that he did not his Trump lie about everything constantly yes but what he has a way of doing is getting these odd big-picture things correct and then it causes this what so like almost anything so like they'll say you okay you know just in the last couple days with North Korea that Trump said I've been traveling a lot so like getting the exact quote will be tough but it'll be something like you know Trump said to the North Korean dictator that they are that they're good friends now or something like that like he's already giving him respect well it's like if Obama Obama when Obama ran he said he would sit down with Ahmadinejad and he would sit down with the leaders of North Korea and the rest of those things now Trump is doing it so it's like do you want him to sit down with them and tell him to go fuck himself at the same time like I'm not even saying this thing's good or bad I have no freaking clue nobody has a clue but everyone has every opinion on everything well people want him to fail too which is fascinating to me because when you see the Bill Maher side know so Bill Maher on Bill Maher on Friday said that he's hoping for a recession because that's how we'll get rid of Trump now we talked a little bit about Bill before this thing but like oh my god it's been a huge influence of mine I like him I used to want to be on the show I've kind of moved past that at this point but think about it you know Bill's probably worth a hundred million bucks or something I have no idea but like he can afford living through a recession but when people talk about the liberal elite that they hate it's that type of person it's this person on the coast who's like yeah yeah have a recession so we can get rid of Trump I hope he does amazingly well yeah hope a great hope Trump does amazingly well and turns a country round I hope he evolves his ideas as a human being I hope he does mushrooms it grows to love people why would you hope for failure especially failure for the whole country and sending people into a recession which is undoubtedly gonna cause suicides and turmoil and crisis and people going to go into panic thinking and panic voting which is not what you want I mean literally that's what started Hitler I mean that that that's what started Nazi Germany right they were in the middle of a horrible recession this guy came along that proposed a solution you're not going to get a better version of the future by people living in fear and poverty and sadness like I as I didn't vote for Trump but he's the president I want him to do great I don't agree with him on a lot of shit he lies about a lot of shit ya still want him to do great you know why because he is the guy that's running the country he's running the country I want the country to do well no matter who's running it like that my thought was like this this is almost what it's like it's like I don't like this doctor so when he fixes my knee I hope that's it it's really almost what it's like like he's the goddamn president okay if you want him to be in peace because he's done some fucking horrible crime which I still I've gone over all this Russian stuff I still am not convinced that he did anything horrible I don't see it seems like the Democrats did more horrible things or at least been caught in something yeah they definitely did something and just what they did to Bernie Sanders alone yeah should be a devastating blow to the credibility of the DNC it really should yeah and the fact that it's not it's just it's just blind allegiance and that he could say I hope for a recession maybe he said that without thinking you know maybe it was just a flippant remark or you know I'm pretty sure it was a it was a package line never hope for a recession no matter what I will hope the guy does fantastic even if he's hated across the board I hope he does an amazing job and I hope the economy soars and I hope people have more jobs more I hope there's a method to his madness I really do why would anybody hope differently I don't understand well I agree with that and and basically and again I voted for Gary Johnson look if I had my choice I'm pretty sure you know me well enough like I would much rather have like a really bright intellectual person who probably rather have Rendon yeah I'd much rather have Rand Paul I'd rather a libertarian who basically is kicking everything back to the states but you know what Trump is cutting a ton of regulation and doing a lot of states right stuff the economy is doing really well do you have any sense that we're gonna get into some intractable war in the Middle East to nation-build I don't think under his watch there may be some level of some peace now in the North Korean ponent Peninsula so it's like anything now I don't think anybody else would have done what he did with North Korea so talked a bunch of shit to that guy called him fat short and you know like it was very funny like what he does is kind of funny and then he gets to have a meeting with the guy and the guy agrees to a meeting with it I think they're baffled by him they don't know what to do with him because North Korean South Korean when the presidents of the two countries met at the DMZ and shook hands like that was an historic moment yeah maybe they can get past all this fucking bullshit that's been going on forever and if part of that was helped in some way by Trump being crazy like maybe it's good to have someone that fucks things up a little bit and mixes it up it doesn't mean he's a perfect person doesn't mean he's not a liar right-wing conservative neocon Joe Rogan but think about it so that's like what does he do so he brings in John Bolton who's thought of as a neocon like a war monger neocon and then he has mattis as the Secretary of Defense war monger neocon maybe what he was doing is that he was scaring people from the outgoing I'm gonna bring in all these people who are really scary who don't talk about peace that often who don't who talk about exercising our power and all of that stuff so that Kim jong-un is gonna go hmm maybe this time they're actually being they might actually depose me these guys fucking crazy right and by the way this is where I would say my side in this the libertarian side is pretty weak on this because a guy like Rand Paul what he would say is you know we should be cutting all military and never doing anything about Baba in which case in you can make a strong argument that you're constantly embolden in your enemies all the time because if they know you never want to do anything then it's not a great argument to get bad actors to stop doing things but I think that's a great place to have a good conversation and Rand Paul has supported a lot of this stuff Trump is done at the same time yeah I mean just I just don't understand the logic behind wanting a recession I mean I can understand the logic around wanting someone else to take over in two years or three years when the new life take place but but don't you think things are basically going pretty well right now like if you remove the Twitter hysteria like remove just like hysteria stuff like this he said she said like in terms of what's happening in the country right now black and Latino unemployment all-time low economy's chugging along like the basic things that matter for a society are working that's pretty good right it's now 80 good I don't know enough about this but what I've understood I've what's been explained to me is that a lot of this is the momentum of what Obama did when he was in office and that the economy he's writing the work of Obama there's riding the wave of the previous administration's policies so I guys yeah I've had economists on my show argue kind of both sides of this thing most don't agree with that but I've had probably more libertarian leaning economists well because they're all about cutting regulation all the time and Trump has been very good at that I think it's something like at one point it was like for every 63 or for every one regulation he passed he cuts something like 63 regulations so if you're a libertarian economic anima store someone on the right economically you want the government out of all of that stuff so they're very happy at the at the economic level right now right but all right but let's even say that's completely true what you just said there that this is all just because of Obama stuff well it's working like we've got a guy that maybe has just picked up the ball and he's the lucky guy and maybe he's gonna get it to the next thing but what I'm actually more enthused by is that I think after all this craziness that we're in right now I actually think people are so starved for sanity and like a reset to decency I actually think things are going to get much better I think again this is where I think the conversations that we're all having are affecting things in a big way and I think that even politically it's gonna start bubbling up I when I was in DC the other day I was at a small dinner with a pretty influential senator who probably don't want me to say his name is I'm not gonna say but I'll tell it to you later but I remember somebody it was somebody big and he got it he really got it like he knew about us like this whole thing and that's what I'm saying like I'm not sitting here like oh my god it's so amazing what we're doing but there something there is something happening and I think it will reach the political level to that people will not want the hysteria anymore and that eventually Trump will because of his own craziness become unnecessary you won't always need the Icebreaker we needed the Icebreaker to get all this shit out now it's all out everyone's reevaluating everything and then out of that is gonna grow i mean look maybe it grows something horrible right like maybe the Hitler comes mm-hmm I don't I hope it doesn't happen but what I think is that something decent is gonna come that's just that's just I think eventually something decent is going to come and I think there is there's a lot of decent that's coming right now but I think there's some people that are always going to resist that oh of course people that are just ideologically driven and they can't be shaken from they can't be shook from that position they're just they're hard left or they're hard right or whatever they are they they have this rigid idea in their head of what reality is and anything that's contrary to that they're gonna oppose and I think Jordan has been one of my favorite lightning rods for observation for watching this but all the disingenuous articles about him deceptive talking about his positions and extremely inaccurate ways and labeling him as some sort of a prejudiced terrible person what those have done is solidified this idea that there is a campaign of people that just are completely ideologically driven and they don't mind being deceptive yeah and that strengthens the positive it helps people like us to just talk about stuff and don't mind talking about being incorrect or ignorant or not worried you know we're not worried about our stance you just we're going about most conversations from a place of objectivity if as much as we possibly can most people are subjective at least to a certain extent as much objectivity as we can as much honesty as we can and just talking about things and this is this is something that's not happening in these little click Beatty articles or in people that interrupt your shows and shake fuckin jars and nickels or whatever they're doing looks like there's that all that stuff strengthens this position that we're in that we're in this weird of intellectual dishonesty and turmoil and I think a lot of it is because there's a lot of people that would just extremely upset the Trump got into office and anything that seems to represent that position on that side must be opposed violently yeah so I think underneath everything you're saying right there you're very hopeful right yeah I actually sense that you're really hopeful and I am too and it's like how could we ever do this if we weren't right like I would say that I'm oh if I had to like sort of Whittle it down what I am it at the core I basically I'm a world weary optimist like I'm an optimist by nature but I believe that the world the world is rough-and-tumble and all the things that Jordan would say about existence I believe but I'm still an optimist despite that and what you just said right there basically is showing that the Trump thing was necessary because imagine if Hillary was president right now in the same machine and bullshit nonsense and media and all of that stuff kept churning along think how much worse it would be for these conversations right now we would so be on the wrongs the you know the wrong side of things so to speak and the forces that don't want us to do anything good and have conversations would have been so emboldened Trump just came and took a freaking bat to the whole thing now as I discussed with Eric Weinstein it's like Trump was the bull in the china shop I think most of us would have preferred a panther way like we kind of wanted something to walk through knock a few things off Trump just blew up the whole thing you don't the phrase is bull in a china shop not a panther in a china shop that's right so that's what you get but after this for every reason you just said there is going to be a return to sanity it I goes one of two ways but I just I'm a firm believer that it will go that way that there is enough of us out there now trying to reset things and because I don't think people are evil I don't think people want to be talked down to I don't think people are dumb oh and even the people who are dumb I don't think they want to be dumb and because of all of that I think this was the necessary thing to happen right now I'm with you that I think I hope that he continues to do basically good things and that if that means that he gets in for another four years and continues to do good things then so be it but yes what I prefer that it's sort of more of a small government calm person who could tell you how many branches of government there are and like all of that shit and all of the stuff from that flag that's right behind you yeah I've got a frickin Declaration of Independence in our control room and a constitution and a big American flag like what I rather someone who knew what the Federalist Papers are and all of those things be in the Oval Office yes you don't get everything you want in life so you just kind of work with what comes and I think we could we have a little broom to work right now I think also as more people open themselves up to the ideas that Jordan is espousing or you are I am or more people are genuinely objective about these ideas start discussing them the more frantic the people on the radical left in the the what they call the regressive left the more ridiculous they're gonna get and the more obvious is gonna get that they're out of control yeah it's just what happens people start ranting and screaming louder because the their initial message doesn't work it's not like they're gonna go back and revamp the message and make it more logical that there's no logical message there but think about that so when that's exactly what they're doing with Trump - you keep screaming Trump's Hitler right you keep screaming Trump's Hitler Hitler Hitler now Hitler killed millions and millions of people and many more millions were killed because of hillier that he didn't directly kill now if you keep doing that with Trump and then someone plays that Barack Obama clip and you go whoa you're calling Trump Hitler hears Obama saying something that actually sounds possibly even more extreme if you believe this is an extreme position to take so now is Obama Hitler and what they're doing is they're creating a situation where they're going to cause a rebound so that people will be like oh these guys aren't all nuts but if they just if they destroy all of our ability to have this conversation then when the real Hitler comes in we won't even be able to recognize it because they will have cried wolf to the point that someone's gonna come in and they're gonna have a big smile it won't be a trump when when Hitler the Hitler type and I hate using Hitler as the as the metaphor cause it's so overplayed but like when the Hitler type comes it ain't coming as the angry guy like Trump is it's gonna come with the smile on its face right that's that socialist t-shirt like you know socialism smiley face that's how it will come because it will be masked in identity politics it will be masked in all of this nonsense that will rip us apart that will literally have us killing each other on the streets what do you think would cause that like what scenario do you foresee there could be possibly if extreme the ideas of what I consider the the fringe left which are pretty much mainstream Democrat ideas already if the Democrats keep going more towards the Bernie Elizabeth Warren keith Ellison real hard left progressive stuff it is rooted in identity politics which you know we've done already but like it is rooted in something that separates us it is rooted that you should that even today did you see this that Harvard I just tweeted out when I was on the way here Harvard released this statement of defending the fact that they are okay with basically having quotas that work against Asian students because they want to have more other minorities basically meaning black or Hispanic minorities so think about it why would you discriminate if you were hiring right now let's say you're hiring today right you're hiring for your studio you can hire you're gonna hire the most qualified person are you gonna try to figure out every little identity thing to figure out who you should hire diversity bro I'm all about diverse yeah exactly it's it's racist against Asians haven't been very vocal about it because they they tend to just put their fucking nose to the grindstone and keep kicking ass so they have to use that against them now that would say that that's the new thing you will not be a if you're Asian and and why do they why did Asian Americans or Indian Americans you're a great example they have succeeded at every level that we measure success that I think the highest socio-economic average salary over 100 grand you know education etc etc if you now say well wait a minute these people played by the rules they came here as in most you know like like all of our ancestors virtually came here pretty much with nothing people on small businesses busted their ass worked in coal mines it's not wherever you had to do it if you do all of those things and then you focus on education and on family and all of those things and now the system is gonna say well it worked for a while but we're gonna have to put you at the bottom of the thing now and guess what you're not gonna get into Harvard because you're Asian that is racism so I've been calling this out for at least two years yeah that the next move by this identity politics this evil oppression Olympics machine is that they will come after Asian people and it's starting to now so I see all these minorities by the way so Candice who I watch the show and I know you guys definitely have disagreements on stuff as do I do when it comes not only to politics but tactics sometimes and stuff but I really do like her you know look she's causing a massive rift in the black community and you can see it in the numbers black male support for Trump or for Trump doubled was that 11 percent now it's 22 know it well it's Kanye Kanye was the wrecking machine but I actually think I think in the grand scheme of things Candace is much bigger I really believe that in terms of high because I think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she decides to go that route because I think she could I think she could run for Senate or yeah yeah I'm not high today I'm only smoking maybe once a week on Sundays and now my tour so I'm not really at all but a spark up a joint and have you reconsidered we said you can smoke a joint or maybe I'll reconsider watch the podcast I did with her yeah okay yeah I watch I don't maybe I'll eat at least an hour and a half of it or so huh yeah why why what well I don't know where why you saying it that way cuz I don't think she should run for Senate no no I'm not saying she's a young girl with some interesting ideas and she's got a lot of passion no no I didn't say you won I didn't say you think she should I'd even say I think she's good I think she could have a bigger effect even than Kanye when it comes to just everything going on politically in a few she wants it she wants it man I'm sure she does but when you she's affecting people in a big way I think maybe in a bigger way than then perhaps either one of us understand but my book forgetting Candace specifically okay my point my boy runs nice person yeah my point was though that I think all minority groups are really aiding what's going on here if you're in the black community clearly there is at the moment a reevaluation of do we have to be democratic if you're that is an issue yeah it's it's a racist issue yes because people assume that if you're black you must be a Democrat if you're not you're some sort of an Uncle Tom yeah it's kind of fucked up yeah talk to my friends larry elder i had Thomas all on the show or my buddy David Webb or many there are many black conservatives and sure you are allowed to think however you want despite your skin color right so I think the black community Ben Carson I mean I think the black community starting to split I think the gay community starting to split because the left has sort of had this odd embracement of Islam which is bad for gays so I think the gays are starting to split I think that Latinos are even starting to split a little bit differently because I think for all the people that came here legally they're actually not as thrilled with illegal immigration as the media may imply that they are so I think there's just massive shifts happening all over the place and the way we look at voting where every election you know what's his name John King goes on CNN and shows you the map and he goes well the white working-class people here voted this way and the black inner-city people but I think all of that is about to explode and they won't know what to do because they haven't been listening but I think some other is have been listen do you think there's real room in this country for a third party I mean I think for sure someone could take a position that's outside those two boxes yeah and and make some real valid points and have a little bit of ideas from each side but the real concern in this country seems to be throwing your vote away right that's the thing that people are always worried about well if you go that way you're throwing your vote away and you're essentially giving it to the person that is on the other side so I to kind of buy into that right because yeah realistically within but this is why I was so disappointed in Gary Johnson every half the country hated Hillary half the country hated Trump at the highest levels that you could hate a candidate right so if there was ever a time for just a decent guy right like Gary Johns is just a decent guy if he was here like he'd probably want to spark up a nice guy he's just a nice guy he was such an ineffective confused memory problem couldn't lay out his basic principles simply you know he wanted as a libertarian he wanted the Baker to bake the cake that that's a crazy position to hold as a libertarian makes no it's completely against what would be your line of thinking as a libertarian you would never want the government to force someone to do a specific task he's talking about the gay couple that wanted a wedding cake made yeah yeah what's what's your position on that by the way well there's two issues one issue is that this they apparently went to places they thought would deny them so they can make a story out of it yeah it wasn't as simple as a loving couple went to some place they wanted to get a cake made and the people said no and they look what the fuck now they wanted a story in this so they sought out places that they thought were gonna deny them and then they made a giant national event out of it I don't think people should discriminate to the point where they're not gonna make someone a cake I mean I think there's do you think government that do you think the government a government shouldn't step in no yeah I think you should let people know publicly that these these are people that they discriminate against gay people and so if you want your dollars to represent your opinions and your feelings on things maybe shouldn't buy a cake from these folks that don't want to make a cake for gay people but the idea the government's gonna step in it seems crazy to me but then as soon as I say that I go okay well what if they wouldn't make a cake for black people should the government step in then so okay so there's a couple right right so there's a couple things there so first off it was about the specifics of the cake I know this a lot of people are gonna get into the nitty-gritty of every legal part of this thing but it was about a specific it wasn't that he wasn't gonna sell them a cake that was on the shelf but I didn't want to make he didn't want to make them a cake for this wedding now that's asking him to do something that's artistic or that's not honestly that was the variables like the you want two men so I apparently an so apparently the conversation actually never got to that point cuz he denied them before that because he knew what it was gonna be so it never got to like oh where you brought together or whatever but he knew it was gonna be a gay wedding so they just said no I'm not making a cake for a gay wedding right now look but they could have bought a cake that was there so it was an interracial wedding would you have a more of an issue with that so so here's the deal so it's look we have the Civil Rights Act of 1964 you have to serve people based on race and all of the minority statuses that there are I'm not for relitigated at but but there are there is a libertarian argument that basically would say we don't need those laws anymore because the the Civil Rights Act was in response to Jim Crow laws where states in the south had screaming Tory laws so we had the federal government come in and clean that up for everybody so you have to serve everyone equally you can't deny a black couple to come into your restaurant or you get you hassled watching you why can you deny a gay person then nope because but it was a specific thing it was a specific so let look put it put it this way if you had a if there was a Jewish artist who took Commission's for paintings would you force that person to bake to paint neo-nazi signs of course not you would never have the government come in and say that they are forced to paint something that's against their conscience so I would say that your original position is the right one which is it kind of sucks right it kind of sounds like I wish in my heart of hearts I'm gay again like I wish that every Baker would treat everyone equally and every person would treat everyone equally they are not allowed he wasn't allowed to deny them something that was in the store already because you can't deny based on those protected categories so he wouldn't have by the Civil Rights Act he wouldn't have been allowed to deny interracial couple of cake that existed there already but would he have could he have denied them one that he would have had to draw a black woman and a white woman if he was a real racist yeah I think the answer is that he could have denied them that and that would have been very shitty and he would be a racist and a really awful person but if the answer is that the government should then come in and tell this man what to do I would not be for that hmm sushant um I just that's just the cleanest way to deal with this related to freedom mm-hmm it's kind of shitty like freedom is messy it's definitely shitty yeah it's shitty and but the government can't protect you from shitty mm-hmm yeah no I mean obviously that's why the KKK still exists yeah and what's the alternative I mean what's the alternative we would all love the KKK to go away we would all of there to beat not all of us but most sane people don't want racism to exist but should we not let people meet should we be bugging people should we force people to do something they don't want to do I mean I just don't I just fundamentally do not believe in that I don't want people to be racist I don't want people to be homophobic or transphobic but the idea that the government can use its authority to make people do all these things I just think is absolute crazy so whether they decided to intentionally inflame this or not by finding people that mm-hm that weren't gonna do it if you really if you're listening to this right now and you're getting married you know you're getting gay married or untraditionally married as they call it if you're doing that and you live in Alabama and there's only one Baker there and he doesn't want to bake a gay cake it sucks it does suck but what you might want to do is what I said about an hour ago which is maybe leave that town like maybe take your skills whatever whatever worth you bring to a community and move to a bigger town where then robably as some other do it or order a cake online I mean the technological part that you just mentioned that you can now tweet about stuff and go don't go don't go like we have power as people and the idea that we outsource all the decision-making to the government is extremely dangerous I mean every every horror in human history is a government doing things basically you know as long as governments have pretty much existed it's not bands of nice individual people that disagree on some stuff murdering piano I mean I understand your position I'm with you to a certain extent I wish there was a clean answer there's no cleaning no but freedom's not clean that's not yeah yeah I mean even the freedom to be a piece of shit yeah and to be racist and to be sexist or homophobic or whatever it is and you know we we have to define what that is in the first place right like who by whose definition is something homophobic or but whose definite I mean is it homophobic or is it religious freedom like if if you know if someone is deeply religious and the other religion discriminates against gay people are they discriminatory or you'd have to give me an example of what they were actually doing mmm right like you're allowed to hate gay people you you are I hope that you do not hmm and I actually think this is somewhere where the Conservatives have moved I really do think they have moved there's virtually no mainstream conservative that's screaming about gay marriage anymore even Mike Huckabee who sort of irrelevant or like that that the Christian conservative side and then they pretty much of Ted Cruz what does he say about gay marriage anymore but that's again why Rand Paul should have led or the the real the true conservatives that believe in limited government should have led the charge on this so this is where the progressives did do something right years ago because they were fighting for real equality because real equality means you should be able to marry whoever you want they weren't going for extra rights for anyone now they're going for extra rights because we all have equality it doesn't mean we all have equal everything but we have to have equality under the law that's all the government can provide you and then once you have that some of us are gonna be born into more money right like your kids are gonna have more money than you did right fact should they be punished for that a lot of people would say yes we would do think that yeah I mean people don't believe you should be able to give your kids money when you die yeah I mean the estate tax I'm mostly I hope that I'll be able to make enough money in my life that that will be a problem but it will be a problem for you for sure short of you go and bust on everything you're doing which I'm assuming is not gonna happen do you think at the end of your life that you've paid taxes your whole life you've paid payroll taxes because you have employees you've done all of these things you've done everything right as a citizen do you think at the end of the day the government should be able to come in and take something like 55 percent of your money at that point no that's creepy it's creepy that they're able to do that to take money from taxed money yeah so the money has already been taxed for your whole life yeah you earned that money and then they're gonna tax it on top of that but that's a mainstream Democratic yeah talking point it's one of those things where they're dealing with the redistribution of wealth that that conversation the redistribution of wealth is super slippery because like who's gonna redistribute it and to who and like when do you decide that someone has too much money or what you know what's the standard with the metric and what what what occupation are we gonna we are we only going to go after the bankers and we're gonna go after artists as well like what if someone's a successful artist are we gonna take all their money are we gonna remove incentive for success there's a certain line that you're gonna cross where you shouldn't be more successful because they're gonna tax you harder to keep people in some soms some sort of an artificially constructed glass ceiling to avoid being taxed like it's a real weird I hate to tell you but everything you just said there is completely against what Democrats basically are for they are for the estate tax I mean these little why what's the argument for the argument is you right and now the greater good which is which is a phrase that sounds really good but is but is beer your face pretty much summed it up it never leads to good well we could okay let's just give more money to this thing that wastes money on everything and that has no accountability this giant money churning monster yeah that's the real issue right that this thing doesn't have accountability and that it does waste a shitload of money think about this if the government was slim and trim and effective and you know we were all taxed right and it was transparent and effective and functional there would be no reason to be a libertarian I'd be sitting here going I'm for government you know I mean like if it really operated in a slim way but what the government doesn't do anything good name one problem you could possibly have in your life Joe Rogan that you'd be like let me get the government to solve this did they do the post office well no what like what do they do well they do the post office pretty good actually but guess what if a post office closed tomorrow you'll be alright you'd still get mail Amazon pick no it wouldn't Amazon would see that US through ups it would cost a lot more he wouldn't though competition would start kicking in and between UPS and FedEx and Amazon and drones and blah blah blah DHL they'd all start would probably drop prices because right now we've just got this artificial thing that sits there that then allows them to price according to that but if you drop that why is the government in that business anymore I have three chickens I've really done the Joe Rogan lifestyle here over the last couple years so I have three chickens right now we had I'm gonna give you a good UPS story we ordered them they were born in August on a Monday in Cleveland they hatched that day they threw him in a box with a little hole USPS and they showed up at my door in LA on a Tuesday the USPS has been doing that for about it's the only way you can do it by the way you can't order chickens through any other method oh they suggest USPS yeah so actually I was keeping the USPS credit there because my chickens all arrived live yeah they send them to chicks yeah that's silly you're buying these live chicks that's the way you get them done for the US Postal Service I'm getting two ups I'm pretty sure though that if the USPS stopped it didn't exist anywhere you'd still get chickens delivered an Amazon it could probably do it even more effectively that's my point it's like I'm not saying these things have to be eliminated tomorrow I'm not even really calling for them to be eliminated but just generally what problem would you everything you're building here right right do you want the government to tell you how to do all these things and all the regulations that you got to have your electric thing this far from this and like all regulations like that for construction are important though you do have to make sure that people don't do stupid shed but emission of a power lines near a water line yeah there's a lot of but I would put most of that on the builders though they want to build things that are good now I get how all that's not true listen people know people are gonna corners all the time like you have to have regulations when it comes to construction methods or people are gonna get fucked they cut regulate they cut corners when there are regulations anyway they do they would cut a lot more if there weren't regular I'm not talking the 3rd world countries and look at construction methods they're fucking dangerous yeah that's why schools collapse on kids in foreign countries sometimes like well I'm not completely I'm not telling you that I'm against all regulation period that's where but that's where I said intellectually I like that argument because you could make us I think you can make a very sound argument that competition would force people to do better work like if you're a plumber you have a vested interest in doing the best plumbing job you can so that people will rate you on Yelp so that you will get more work you don't have a vested interest in cutting corners now you might write you're gonna push it as much as you can to save as much time and energy and money as you can but once you go over that edge yeah you don't want to be known as the guy that the you tighten something too much that you flooded the house or when you're building and you're thinking logically though when when people fuck things up and short things and do things terrible they're not thinking logically but I don't think it's the government I don't think it's the government that they're like the government gave me this regulation so that's why I'm gonna do it right well if you didn't have any regulations there'd be no incentive whatsoever to do it right there would be an incentive earner in Spector's no one was gonna check their stuff and make sure that their stuff was up to code listen man I was in the trucks in my whole life my dad's an architect yeah I've been in construction since I was a little kid you fucking need regulations these guys a lot of people that are in construction they're they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make money and it's not good for the people that have the house because they might have that house for five ten years before that problem manifests itself the the people who are establishing these codes are licensed builders or people that have been involved in construction for a long fuckin time and they know what's safe what's not safe that's why those codes exist it exists to protect the consumers you can't just protect the consumers through the marketplace because so I'm not calling for time for these problems to become a real issue and these problems could potentially damage everybody in the neighborhood it's not just gonna affect the person on this one lot like if a fire starts it burns all the houses in the neighborhood or if a flood happens and it floods everyone downhill it's it's a real problem absolutely real careful with construction I get it and you know my dad wasn't in construction so I'm not privy to like all of that the little stuff but I genuinely believe that as a general level people have a vested interest in especially now because of phones and apps and Yelp and all the doing good work because that's how you will get more working thank you you're never gonna remove the people who will do shoddy shitty malicious shit but you can keep them a bay with regulation so this is where I'd say you can take some regulation educated regulate regulation people who actually understand what's going on and you know make sure that someone doesn't do something stupid with a powerline or someone do something stupid with it the way they constructed main beams where they're just subject to collapse that's important yeah as most people buying a house don't know what the fuck they're looking for most people getting a house built they have no idea about construction methods and they need someone to inspect things and make sure that's up to code that's why code exists it's very important yeah I saw I'm not I'm not totally with you on that like I do think mo I think most of it probably 90% of it would be who has the most vested interest to build a good house it's the Builder because he wants more work he doesn't want the house to collapse because then he'll be out of work I'm telling you I know I got you I got you though I get it there's cops yeah there's a lot maybe a specific thing you know it's it's a dangerous thing too because it's where you sleep it's where your kids sleep it's it's you know you just I think there's a lot of idealistic notions about deregulation and I think there's some consumer protection has to be put in place because people don't have the time to spend all this time of researching construction methods and making sure everything's done correctly and be there and make sure that the joists are a certain with and they have a certain amount of support like all that stuff has to be done by people understand code assuming that the government regulators understand code correctly and aren't just on the take or a just shot you know you know just basically just taking money and sign it off on things I mean I when I got my house inspect things man have you ever had a construction project done yeah well I got my house last year and we had to go through all the inspections and had several guys go back and right we didn't build it now right there's a big difference between an insurance inspector yeah at a code inspector code inspectors are very different when you're having a house built yeah and I've had construction projects where I had to explain to people and go through it with with builders they're there making sure that the house isn't fucking fall on you that the the powerlines you know are done correctly that all the electricity is done correctly the pipes are laid incorrectly your septic system or your sewage system is done correctly yeah do you think that could be privatized then see again I'm not I'm just I just think it's and regulations yeah I would it you could have the pump be no incentive well no you could have companies that would that their job would be to make sure to inspect yeah and you might have they wouldn't have the threat of law to enforce these things like if someone is is if someone is building something and they're not up to code they lose their license and they can't build right if you privatized it what's the incentive for them to follow the guidelines yeah so this is this is where I'm not telling you that I'm calling for all this I just think intellectually it's just an interesting space to to argue something because I think that there's more the more that you can give to people to freely do what they think is right I think generally they will like again I get it there's gonna be some real shitty construction people out there yeah you know you should have on to talk about this and I think people have looped you in before is your on Brook from for mine Rand Institute he's because he's no obviously no all right so obvious okay so I'll be happy to do it he's a really interesting guy whose mother my thinking a little bit on this those iron Brand people are fucked and harsh they like ideas those are what they're not the most fun people on the planet but I generally I generally like them because they just want their kind of live and let live that's really it like that's like the crux of it pretty much is that really the crux of it I mean yeah people think that there's like sort of a cruel - aspect to it well I ran philosophy well they believe in in rational self-interest which if you say self it makes people think you're evil but but we all basically operate in rational self-interest all the time right but espousing it with us the the things like proclaiming it is the thing that people go oh you're you're you're essentially setting up the idea that Gordon Gekko idea greed is good yeah I kind of buy into that idea do you buy into greed is good yeah basically not greed to destroy the world but if you do you Joe do what is good for you and by extension Reid well that's what that ambition well all right exactly that's my point right i doing where it gets conflated isn't it right so with so without whittling it to the definition of greed versus ambition it's like you do what's good for you but but it doesn't mean you're just running this like rampaging program to destroy the world in the name of Joe Rogan you're doing what's good for you because you actually like your audience and you want them to learn you you want to have money so that your family can live in a house that you can afford that you can send your kids to good schools and all of those things that's all rational self-interest if at the same time you were running a nuclear power plant and you were mr. burns and you were dumping in the river well no that's actually no longer rational self-interest because now you're polluting the very environment that you live in so rational solute a scare of that who regulates that so that comes in so those guys I don't want to speak for who gets you in trouble if you in your opinion if you if you're this deregulation guy yeah who goes after you when you dump shit into the river so I'm not saying there should be no regulation I just who saying that I like this generally I like this line of thinking there has to be some regulation I agree you can't but what I would say that's where the regulation comes let's put it this way the environment yeah that I would say there has to be some but I've had some interesting people on conservatives who were dealing doing environmental stuff from a conservative perspective that there's ways to make money actually in green stuff in green products course and in yeah well I don't know that he's creating anything other than movies but he's making money a lot of money in green corporations right so that but that's him doing it privately right yeah yeah but what is like what's the solution if some pollutes if you're not going to have regulation what is the solution if someone does something that's illegal well if you're not gonna have a regulation it wouldn't be illegal but your question is well is it's illegal to dump things into the river right I mean it's just that's not a matter of regulation I mean polluting willful poisoning of rivers I'm sure he's actually terrorism right yeah it would be a bunch of like so what those guys would argue is what I said before which is that ultimately especially now because of technology like in the old days so like every time someone cuts a regulation I've heard Bill Maher say this a lot they're gonna start polluting the river immediately that implies that these businessmen whatever they're you know whether whatever they're whatever industry that they're in that they're immediately gonna be like ha the regulations gon start polluting the water we live in a time now where everyone's walking around with an iPhone where maybe 50 years ago you could have got away with a lot of bad shit right coal miners that were breathing all kinds of horrible shit that nobody was ever gonna find out about where now everybody is walking around with snapchat and Instagram and blah blah blah so a lot of the stuff would be exposed more so that all of the things that we've been talking about for the last couple hours about about people getting involved a lot of the things I think would start self-regulating but again and then I won't say it again I'm not for just deregulating everything I just think there's probably better ways to do it than just having the government come in and say this is what you got to do and now figure it out cuz the government isn't that good at most things yeah I know what you're saying there but I do think that obviously there has to be laws in place specifically laws in place to protect people from someone doing something that's gonna damage all the other people in the community yeah well by the way that so you can do that from the government supposed to protect your life and your property I mean that's a very simple libertarian thing you know you mean like so that there's a good argument there for why you could have some level of regulation yeah but I don't think it's just like specifically in terms of like someone polluting rivers I don't think it's good enough to snapchat about it I think people should be locked up and go to jail if they find out that someone's dumping toxic waste into the river because it's too expensive to process it and get it removed and put in someplace where it's it's you know safe that's a crime yeah well I'm all for finding those people and having the company's fire them and all those things as far as putting them in jail I don't know that I'm clock them up yeah I don't know that I'm get them off the streets take the money give it to Bernie's kids yeah not fair to putting more people in jail generally but yeah no I'm not either you know I think that's one of the more interesting things that happened in this administration is when Kim Kardashian got that lady credit honor rated or whatever he did got a release yeah got her sentence commuted that's kind of crazy like she showed up and she presented this case about some woman who was a been in jail for she's essentially jail for life for nonviolent drug offense right yeah and I think how many other people are like her for non-violent drug offenses for doing something with your own body yeah well that's where we're in a full and total agreement I just think that this idea that the pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs but people can't sell drugs that they can they're responsible for the untenable imaginable number of people that have died from opiate mm-hmm withdrawal or opiate overdoses fentanyl I mean fentanyl just last year we lost Tom Petty we lost Prince a couple other people too I can't remember there's some other famous people that died from fentanyl Patton Oswald's wife she was another fentanyl okay this it's like it's a horrible horrible horrible drug and no one's clamoring for these people to go to jail for drugs all day long you could watch cable news all day long what are they selling all day long prescription drugs with a zillion side effects that are seemingly far worse including thoughts of suicide and depression of Babolat and the original thing they're trying to treat right so look with specifically opiates yeah opiates of the day the real deadly ones and then you think about how many people that are in jail right now for marijuana how many people that are in jail for cocaine how many in jail people are in jail for psychedelics MDMA means it's there's no comparison in terms of the amount of damage done per capita I completely agree look when when the thing happened with Roseanne and then she blamed ambien or she at least said she was not you know the ambien the parent company whatever it was they tweeted out something like there are a lot of side effects but it doesn't make you racist but think how glib and ridiculous that was yes no one is saying that ambien makes you racist but ambien does have a litany of I don't know 50 side effects you know it you know sleepwalking saying crazy things eating it you know literally just being unable to control what you're doing while you're on ambien being in this zombie-like state so is it possible that even though she has also said that she didn't realize that Valerie Jarrett was black which I actually kind of do believe that I don't know she said it to me yeah I don't know I know I know I mean I I know her a little bit so she didn't think she was black I believe her okay leave her a hundred percent but look she said dumb shit in the past the Susan Rice thing was much more egregious the one where she said that Susan Wright rice was a man oh yeah eight balls yeah no yeah so I'm not defending what Roseanne said all I'm saying is that ambien the maker sends out this glib tweet like we don't make people racist but guess what you have people doing all kinds of crazy shit that they can having conversations yeah people have driven their cars in the wrong side of the highway people have done all kinds of crazy shit on their right so is it possible that made her impaired enough because I have a stupid thought and then 100% yeah it's a hundred personally side effects the whether or not they're responsible for those side effects is where it gets into the realm of personal responsibility like if you take ambien and you do something are you responsible for it no yes what are we going to say if you drink and you go commit a violent crime are you responsible for we all agree yes so it gets real strange yeah it gets real strange I mean that's one of the weird things when it comes to gender and responsibility because there's been so many issues of men and women particular it's almost always men and women you never hear about these from gay couples but men and women or I haven't heard about it at least men and women getting drunk and having sex and then the man gets accused of sexual assault and this has gotten so weird that a guy preemptively guy and a girl got yeah had sex and the guy called the police and wanted her charged with sexual assault because he was drunk and he did it as a pre-emptive measure because he was worried that she was going to come after him and so the university took action against the girl and I'm like Jesus Christ are we playing little stupid games and pretending the girls raped guys when they're drunk or that it's really devastating for the guy like what the fuck are we doing who we are gonna criminalize everything we're gonna criminalize everybody think of all of the stupid things you've done in your life whether on drugs or not or whether we when you were in college or not and voila now add social media to that add the amount of pictures that people send to each other and everything else we if we don't stop this out-of-control monster we are all just going to destroy each other but there's a gray area because we know that some people do take advantage of people that are drunk someone was if someone was like porn drunk drinks down someone's face and they were sober and they were doing it with the intention of raping them once they were intoxicated and they couldn't consent anymore that's one thing but if two people are getting together and drinking and then having sex then the woman has regret in the morning when she Sobers up so she decides that it was rape because she and he were both drunk that's preposterous but we don't have this ability to rationally process each and individual each individual case but by the way here's something that Trump did that was really good he got rid of those ridiculous title 9 laws that Obama instated where they were basically having these clown courts in colleges that you could go to them and instead of having due process which is perhaps the most important piece of of a functioning Western free society where you are innocent until proven guilty they were suspending male students just by accusations and then it was leaking I had Laura Kipnis on who's a professor that there were she was fighting against title 9 so then they brought up title 9 charges against her I mean there's and there's many many other stories on this that's something that Obama brought in that Trump actually got rid of that evil what's-her-name you evil Betsy DeVos got rid of so it's like we've we've just gotten to the point where we've politicized everything we've politicized our own capacity to be free and make decisions for ourselves if you get drunk and are fooling around with somebody some of that's on you might regret it in the next movie every every single one of us listening to this has had sex with someone or done drugs with someone or something woke up the next morning been like mark I shouldn't have done that not Jamie Jamie's clean except here's my thing I was thinking about driving if you drive in you're drunk no one says you're exonerated because you're drunk right no man you are drunk yeah fucked up and you did something drunk you're responsible for your actions but if you have sex drunk the whole sudden for some strange reason you're not responsible for your actions that's preposterous it's not it doesn't they don't match up it's not doesn't make any sense yeah but again this is where the the identity politics of all this ruins everything because what you're not saying that anyone that gets drunk you're saying if a girl really although that one example that you gave is true one example that's like ridiculous right it's a complete throwaway a ridiculous show you how fucking stupid the university is that they let that fly they should they should smack him send it back to class sometime in the face yeah son right back Scott congratulations but he's got laid yeah good for you you were drunk and a girl took advantage of your penis did you orgasm you did shut the fuck up then get out of here what are you doing it's it's ridiculous across the board it's far more ridiculous though when a guy is accusing let's just be honest about this it's far more ridiculous when a guy is accusing a girl of rape in those circumstances and I don't want to hear all your progressive nonsense screaming and yelling and no it's not we're all equal fuck you it's not the same yeah if a guy does that to a girl if a guy purposely gets a girl drunk and does it because he knows that she wouldn't consent any other way and then gets her to the point which is like long and she's barely conscious and fucks her in my opinion that's rape yeah a my opinion that but that person but if a couple gets together and they have a few drinks they're laughing they're flirting and they make out and then they go back to her place or his place and they have sex it's not rape we know it's not rape all right so let's split the difference on that one so now it's a it's a sorority party in college the girls decide they're gonna drop roofies and a couple of the guys things late at night girls are just you know let's just I don't know what the girls like right okay right so all right so a bunch of hot chicks now they're they drug these guys I mean I'm sure this has happened this is definitely uh never heard of it if you're sure it's happened it's gotta live happy think they roofied a guy I'm sure a guy has been I'm pretty sure I got roofied by a girl in college really yeah now I'm married to a dude so maybe she fucked her brain up she she's seriously it was some high-level Ruthie shit I was like we went all night and then I was like you know what I've had just about enough of this ya know this gal stuff you really got roofie by a girl I was roofied once in college like just like a keg party but do you know who did it I don't know who did it I don't have much of a recollection of it other than I remember I had like half a beer I could not really think and I remember I couldn't stand did you realize something was wrong I try to get out of there I knew something was wrong but your mind doesn't operate correctly and I remember I was Kyra member my friends were there but we were all like stoners at the time so I don't even know that I was like thinking clearly like something you don't realize fully you know you know something's not right but you're like at least what happened to me was I just couldn't like put all the pieces together did you get tested do you find out what it was no I mean I sometimes remember I remember at one point just sitting on a couch in the corner I remember a very bright lamp light above me I have no recollection of how I got home or like any of that but it wasn't roofinal why wouldn't you think it's how do you say it Roo - all you say that let's just say really goofy what makes you think it was that not like I don't know maybe well cuz I didn't trip I mean I wasn't in or stuff what does that other stuff that people give or jeers - yeah like I don't think I was in like a k-hole or done that's what I mean I don't think I was in that kind of state I was just in this like my body kind of couldn't move you know little aura kind of stuff bright light right and like I kind of couldn't think straight that that's the way I described but I mean I've done mushrooms I've done most things that are out far I wasn't hallucinating in any way right so but but just playing that one out for a second if a girl did that to a guy managed to get him hard bummed him right I think you'd think it's the same thing walk it off forward suck it out suck it off pussy you got you got laid yeah it's not good it's definitely not good for anybody to take advantage of someone's body and particularly give them a drug and that where they can't dev no control and then rape them yeah it's the same thing if a girl does it to a guy it is the same thing if she roofies the guy and has sex and especially what if the guy has a girlfriend he doesn't want to have set with her or you know fill-in-the-blank he's not attracted to her or he's gay and you do that to him and he's repulsed by it yeah that's right yeah yeah but you know but now we're in the realm of Bill Cosby right the Bill Cosby situation is fucking break right 100% no doubt it's a big difference between that and a couple that gets together and has a couple of drinks have you heard it from a gay perspective like two gay guys getting drunk and and having sex and one of the guys accusing the other one of sexual assault because he was drunk but I definitely heard of the first part two gay guys getting drunk adapt yes that's happen a lot the rape one I haven't heard it that I've heard so many stories about a woman in this one story about a man claiming that he was sexually assaulted because they were drunk I've never heard it about two gigger I actually do know one story of a guy that was given something that that was given something yeah but not two guys not wrong not willingly got drunk yeah no sorry definitely of people been given short and it's a hundred percent yeah this fat that's probably just a guy thing fucking dark thing man that's a dark thing that people who are willing to do that that Cosby thing shook me to my fucking core yeah the idea that this guy who was America's Sweetheart America's dad was possibly the greatest certain ethnic Russians that greatest but one of the worst serial rapists of all time if not the worst did we the first time I came on we talked about Cosby he's the reason I got into comedy at four years old I think it was 1981 or 1982 maybe I was five I was all Cosby himself on HBO I remember sitting in the in my family room buckled over and laughing to the point you know when you're just your whole body you cannot know pain in my stomach and I remember thinking I want to be funny and now my comedy hero it is basically the biggest rapist of all time what the fuck man that's like I used to have Cosby records hanging up in my house even two three years ago and eventually as the story started leaking out one his great records and I at first I was like I'm just gonna leave it up like it doesn't change my feelings about him as a comic and then I remember people would be coming into my house oh you got I'll be over there you should do you just take it and then put bars over it I should just leave it up there put bars over it yeah that's just so fucked like how could he how could he be that guy how could he be the guy who's so funny and everybody loves them and also be the guy that that drugs people and rapes them it's like what a dark dark dark secret I mean I think Jordan would have a lot to say on this I think that we these inconsistencies that we live with that often drive us and that you know why did we find out that that you know these people preaching about morals or all the time or the same people that are doing all this weird shit or that we've all done things that were not proud of or whatever it is and it's like that's part of being a human it's just part yeah yeah so you're talking about like that yeah the evil I mean someone who's doing this into his fucking sixties he was doing this but I guess it becomes an addiction like anything else like you are yeah your mind I'm sure I'm sure people do Studies on this yeah what happens to the actual brain chemistry when you're doing these things that I would guess it has something to do with the dopamine levels that are released at the same time when when you know somebody's snorted coke and doing whatever they're doing yeah whatever it is I don't know what it is but it's just so stunning to me yeah yeah I mean there's a and again this is this goes back to laws was or there's a need to protect people but there's also a need to go hey college boy who got drunk and had sex with a girl who was also drunk he didn't get raped fuck off it's it's really disrespectful to people that actually have been raped yeah you know and I get it's kind of funny that he's turning the tables and he's doing it to her I think there was the story part of the story was something about she had done it to one of his friends she had said that to one of his friends so he's preemptively doing it because he thought that she was gonna come after him next well part of it is that it's gross that it's all public right like everything has become so public and I think that that's part of the problem all the time like who banged who in college the idea that that now is like this thing that gets written about and and people get interviewed on all these things like again all of that is kind of dangerous and that's why I try all the time and I think what you usually do is you usually talk about ideas not people because it's the underlying philosophical ideas that matter not the specifics of this kid I mean you didn't pull up the picture of the kid and mentioned the girl's name and hers or Twitter and all chorus but that it's the underlying philosophical issues of why are we doing this why are we exposing everybody why are we attacking and destroying everybody and all that that that's much more interesting to me than just the specifics of the people or you know all the people that I'm so sick of all these blue check writers and BuzzFeed people like I never called them out specifically like that guy I hate that guy right cuz like he that guys nobody well they're just during the business of writing you know I think a lot of it is I mean we can decide that these people are our enemy but like we're in some ways foes on the battle v you know I just in a very perverse way in a very perverse way and I don't I just think it's just like their job is to write about things and when we're involved in a story they find an angle and they go after it just like I do with jokes when i if i crack a joke about somebody asked i do a bit about somebody hated them like I had this whole bit about a Bruce Jenner and the Kardashians what led Bruce to become a woman because I hated them it's cuz it was I thought it was funny yeah I thought is there's an angle there it's a story it's a big thing that's on people's minds and so it became a target for me the same way it is when a lot of these folks write articles and you know a lot of the men are in their 20s and you know they're idealistic or they're young and evolving their thoughts and maybe they wouldn't write that article five years from now or ten years from now or whatever and yeah I think we have to take that into consideration as well these people are embarking on a career in journalism and you know for a lot of them shitting on Jordan Peterson gets them social brownie points yeah yeah you know what you want to shift topics North Shore can we do a little mid shift there sure we can do a little midship so I was talking to Jordan about something that I think is kind of interesting that I haven't talked about publicly before and I thought if I'm gonna come on Joe Rogan let me see if I can bust out something kind of personal so you know Jordan was having all these autoimmune problems and that's kind of what led him to to doing this crazy diet where he in effect he's on the carnivore diet yeah like it's like meat that's it like I feel doing that great he looks so much better even even than probably last time he was here maybe what five months ago yeah his skin looks good he looked he's got some color back in his face you know he's definitely lost some weight slimmed down a little bit but it but in a good way mm-hmm his energy is back he just his hair looks better like he just looks better like I don't know all the science behind the carnivore diet of whether you can do it forever and not eat vegetables and truly survive I don't know where you're getting the rest of the nutrition that you need and the rest of the vitamins and all that but but when I've gone out to dinner with him over these things guy gets a frickin the biggest steak you can imagine at every place chops it up eats meat that's it so anyway so we were talking the other day in the green room before the show that it's interesting that he had this health problem as his success was growing and it's like you don't really think about that in life because you we all like to think like as we're growing and getting better and doing what we're supposed to do that our health is kind of in line with that so I've actually never talked about this before but about two-and-a-half years ago right when my show was really taking off I think probably about the first time we did our first sit-down so not the one last year but to about two and a half years ago and as I was four also first getting hate on line at the same time I started losing tons of chunks of hair times like I'd be in the shower yeah and tons of hair would be everywhere after you know I'd showered hair and my towels and everything and lost like huge patches back in my head up top like all over the place so I had a I had I guess I technical have it alopecia areata where it's an autoimmune thing they don't know why your white blood cells start attacking your hair follicles so I went about two years ago now again this is just as I'm like starting to really succeed like I'm really just like breaking through for the first time and I went on this like crazy experimental drug so usually when you have this they just shoot cortisone into your corticosteroids into your head and they hope that that basically reverses it or stops or whatever reduces the inflammation that's causing it like something like that and but my case was so severe that I went I found this doctor who's doing this really experimental thing where in effect they're putting something like poison ivy on your head so that your white blood cells will attack that instead of attacking your hair follicles and the hope is if you do just a slight amount that's necessary that you won't have like crazy reactions and you'll be and your hair bench would grow back anyway I did it for about a year and first off when I was on camera I mean there were points where like I was like oh my god like I don't I can't be on a counter anymore I was doing like not spray hair but like powdered shit and like grew out my hair to like hide so that well later I can show you like I still actually do have some spots here but I went under this experimental stuff and literally for two years virtually my entire body was broken out like red itchy gross disgusting my head was like like rip mirror's yeah for like a year bad and then and then a year not as bad but like like oozing my head with like as if you had poison ivy I was literally wrong basically putting poison ivy on my head and like I was extremely sensitive to heat and light and like it was it was a truly misery I had like a real oh I gained weight because of it cuz it like screws up your like my neck actually looked thicker like I look at videos where I did not look good for a year like I look kind of bloated because my body was basically having like an allergic reaction at all times I was putting something on my head to cause my body to have an allergic reaction like for whatever reason I was just very sensitive to it but anyway I bring this all up eight cuz I've never talked about it and I thought it would might just be something to like throw out there but be what I've discussed with Jordan is just this interesting idea of sort of as you're succeeding and as you're doing what you're supposed to be doing that life just throws you weird things and I'm pretty much over it now I'll show you later like I definitely have some stuff still that now just taking the injections and we'll see what happens but don't you think it's stress-related yeah so I'm really sure I'm doing the float tanks now I'm doing the saunas I get massages every couple weeks now I'm definitely trying that's why I did the month off Jordan was not famous his whole life and then in his 50s became famous yeah that is not it's not a normal state that people are accustomed to he was a clinical psychologist yeah yeah yeah and a professor and you know there's I mean how many stories do we have to read about people who go famous and lose their fucking marbles now it's not an easy road it's not it's not easy to handle people ask him about that so when we do the Q&A at the end there's an app that people send me questions and then I just kind of moderate it so I'm getting some funny ones and then I pick some serious ones but a lot of the questions are ask him directly about that about what it what pressure do you feel now that you're famous what is it what if you screw up what if you a lot you know they also ask him a lot which i think is a great question and and I don't want to paraphrase his answer because I won't do it justice but they asked him you know you talk about religion and archetypes and all that are you a prophet they will ask him now not because they're saying he's a prophet but like if you believe in all of this stuff if you believe that project factor and right and he he goes out of his way to say he doesn't believe that and he's not trying to make anyone drink kool-aid he's trying to help have them live the best life for themselves not like that he's laying out for them but but watching him go through all this it's just been it's been truly fascinating like it really it's like and then I think I said it before but it like the whole thing is like this lovefest it's not what they want it to be it's not who's that the people that are writing all these pieces who often I invite a lot of the writers sometimes that write things I'll be like you want to come to the show tonight and any of them are welcome to come as my guest they can see it right up front I'll do the exact same thing Jordan I'll do the exact you know what's good about those people what's good about is the same thing that I try to do with all my material I look at and I learned this from Doug Stanhope Doug Stanhope actually said it to me and I realized I kind of do it but from him saying it I did it more mm-hmm he said you should write your bits as if you're a defense attorney like you're defending your bit like write your bit like as if you and so I I think that one of the things about having haters out there or critics out there is that they're examining your material finding holes in it mm-hmm and I think if you go over all of your material and all of your ideas from the perspective of someone is watching them right now trying to find fault in everything that you do you will find it just be undeniable just be undeniable find find those holes patch them up and you know there's going to be disagreements it's not like you're always going to be able to state your point and it's going to be undeniable to someone who completely disagrees you know ideologically with your stance on whatever the fuck it is but no as long as you it's undeniable to you you've you've rationally made your case you've objectively stated the facts you've this is your position this is why and you can back it up there's too much sloppy work going on where people think they can and you see this a lot there's a lot on the progressive left or the regressive left what do you want to call it where they just expect that other people are just going to agree with their stance on things so they they have this sort of real this very rigid ideology that they're they're trying to yeah they often think that they're morally right yes so then you don't have to do the legwork of the argue right it's a lot harder to take a position that says you should be who you are and you have to fit that into society rather than saying this is what the moral imperative is this is why we need those laws and if you deviate from that you're the bad guy so unfortunately they've just embraced that I think too much so it's like it's like one of those things like when I go to these colleges and I'm usually invited by libertarians and it's like the returns point low taxes and limited government and live how you want to live right like that's the basics of it but they'll often say you know I talk about low taxes in a college class and people say I'm racist and it's like well how does race get into that but what they will say is that what they'll say is well wait a minute if you want low taxes that means you don't want money going to people who need it more and often it is people of color who need it more so you inherently are racist you have to think on how to make the counter-argument to that that I think there's a very valid counter-argument that I buy into but you have to think it's very easy to just take somebody who thinks the reverse of you and go you're racist right you're racist I think this way such a lazy way to approach an idea yeah yeah it's so lazy the only thing I have a problem with what Jordan has been saying lately is this idea of enforced monogamy being the solution to in cells these involuntary celibates yeah that's not gonna help so what do you think I become men well what do you think his definition of enforced monogamy is Justin well culturally the forced monogamy where people you know the the culture encourages and supports the idea of monogamy the he's talking about Mac he's just talking about marriage and that but that's not gonna clear the way to people that no one wants to fuck it's just not going to the idea is that there's a bunch of men out there that are taking up all the viable females because no one's getting married and they're just there's no room for these in cells no they are not attractive to women whether they're not physically attractive you tell me Harvey Weinstein was physically attractive fuckin disgusting Pig forget about what he did to those women other rapes or the sexual assaults he had a gorgeous wife yeah his wife was gorgeous that was a voluntary relationship okay so how did that happen it happened through success it happened through success and confidence and whatever the fuck else he's got you know intellect I don't know what his mind's like these these in cells they have to become men okay and there's Jordans all about that I mean his whole message right I just don't think that enforcement agha me has any factor whatsoever in this so he I think he would say this but I'm not his lawyer but I think he used the phrase all he meant was marriage that generally societies that more people are married and people remain man right so it's not gonna help I think perhaps if he was being interviewed again by her he would use a different phrase but even if they even if he says marriage marriage is not gonna help in cells these guys that are involuntary celibates they have to become attractive so they have to become men well the rest of his message is about that but they have to do difficult things yeah that's what they have to do they have to do they have to digital evidence get your shit together and martial arts I think is one of the best ways to do that I've seen so many men that were like insecure and dorky and do they become fucking nerd assassins through martial arts and I think it's a great way to build confidence and I think there's an extreme lack of adversity like physical adversity in a lot of people's lives and overcoming physical adversity is what leads to a lot of confidence in men and I just think that there's a lot of men that are just have no idea whether they can or can't do anything difficult and they have massive insecurity because of it yeah I think he would agree with every word I think you would to everywhere that you just said there huh yeah I just think that marriage is not fixing it you know culturally enforced monogamy is not going to fix it they have to become men and they had to have a reason to want to have sex with you yeah yeah so I think he would agree that I think he would say that once you accomplish that that that's when you will find more women and that the next step the next natural progression in life is that you will find someone that you want to be partnered with and that that then has the best value for a society but I don't want to completely state his case mmm it's an interesting case yeah but but he completely I mean look why is it that for the little bit that these articles get write about him it's that he's helping men he is yes he is also helping women but yes he is helping men well men need their shit together they need frame work for sure I mean people need this this thing about discipline and you know you're you are you're where you know you're aware of Jocko right yeah that discipline equals freedom it's like one of the best catchphrases it's so act it's empowering it's so empowering get your shit together and then you the time that you have for recreation you'll appreciate it so much more you don't appreciate rest when you're fucking off all day yeah you appreciate rest when you've worked hard that's when it means something to you when you've accomplished goals that's when this celebration is is something that you get a good feeling from it do you have a part in your life that you feel like is lacking in that department in what department and just like getting your shit together like not slacking on no I'm pretty good yeah that's what I do yeah I mean I do a lot of shit there the only way I could ever do as many different things as I do is if I just get after it yeah I get after it pretty fucking good yeah I'm not I'm not insecure in that I mean whether it's through martial arts or any kind of exercise or work I just I take pride in getting things done I take pride in working yeah you know especially working towards things that are important to me whether it's working on my set working on my standup whether it's working on a podcast whether it's working on my martial arts or my fitness or yoga or whatever I get after it man just got to yeah and for me it's not a matter of whether or not it's an option it's like brushing my teeth I don't decide one day I don't wanna brush my teeth today I just fucking brush my teeth and when there's days where I'm doing fasted cardio when that alarm goes off it's not a matter of whether or not I shut the alarm off that's not an option yeah you get up you put your fucking shoes on you get the dog and you go running cuz that's what you do and if you just decide that's what you do then you get things done and then a month later you're like oh yeah we did this all month and then six months later it's like oh I did this half a year and then if you're doing jujitsu you like oh shit look I got a blue belt oh shit now I'm a purple belt and that's how you become a black belt yeah you just you know and I got this is the good type of Piran civ cuz it gets progressively easier - I told you it doesn't though doesn't get easy you know I think so fucking hard every time that alarm goes off like fuck but you're for you now then right when you started I don't know did you know the reward of it you know that that rewards some enforcement there's some enforcement in the success that I've had in completing these tasks but every fucking time I go to yoga class oh my god Jesus 90 minutes and a 104 degree temperature with these all these women that are going to humiliate me they can definitely do things that you can't do they just fight well this is their tough man there's a lot of these older ladies that are fucking tough yeah you know they just got it out I was just one lady that goes there she's like 60 years old she doesn't even bring water and this lady's in there for 90 fuckin minutes sweat it out she's there every time I go she's not bringing water you sure she's sixties she could be like 20 and gray-haired and toughest shit she drinks water before she drinks it after but when she's in that class she's just tough it's just you know there now it's never easy to do you know it gets a little bit easier when you get better at it but then you just try harder and it makes it more difficult if you're always giving 100% effort it's always going to be hard you know you take some pride in the fact that now I can go two miles through the hills and you know and reach the point of exhaustion where before was 1 or whatever whenever your little little progress markers are you get some satisfaction that but it's always difficult to get going the the hardest step is the first step is not the 30th step or the hundredth step it's the fucking first one it's getting on the trail getting going it's the hard things the hardest weight to lift is the first one because once you get going like okay I'm a half hour into my workout I'm writing things down I'm supposed to be doing now I got you know 20 chin-ups and then burpees and then all you have to do it just have to do it and so many people have a hard time doing it if you would have a very moving if you would have ever thought when you started stand-up that you'd be sort of like because you're kind of like a lifestyle guru and in a way you know to me like every time I've done the sensory deprivation stuff I had the float stuff every time I've gone into the place when I just talked to the girl when she's like setting it up or something I'll be like Oh Joe Rogan's got me into this and they're always like Oh Joe Rogan he got everybody into this like you literally like created float places oh I went to one in Nashville like the woman was like Oh Joe Rogan I love Joe Rogan but like that and the MMA stuff and all that like how what a bizarre adventure you know you mean like we you probably would have never thought not that well the only reason why it happened because I had no intention of doing it it's like I'm 0 and I've never written a book on lifestyle or fucking what to do I just say what I do and I do it by example like obviously I do all these things I mean that Jim's not there for looks yeah I fucking do all these things so this is I think this is this is just a natural thing that's happened but the float thing is the most bizarre one because I can't believe I'm the one to tell everybody doesn't man but how the fuck doesn't everybody already know they do now more people know now but how the fuck didn't they know when I first got my tank in 2002 and I had been talking about it for a couple years before because I had done one where you know you go to a place and you rent it for an hour yeah um that's how we regular people do it I again you've gotta get it I need one man yeah I fucking need I tell you how often you burn it as much as I can and me it's right there it's nice yeah you're doing this more than like once a week or oh more than now oh really for sure and I come in here you know different I'll come in here sometimes even after the comi store you know how many are weird times I'll come in here during the day but the whole idea is that this is something that somehow or another was created in the 60s by John Lilly and nobody talked about it it was like kind of a suit weirdo popular thing with hippies for a while and then it fucking went away but were barely around and then I started talking about it and now they're everywhere all over the planet and that is a strangest thing to me it's one of the strangest things about my entire career is that the float tank business is sort of started up because of me yeah and that they're everywhere in the world now there's hundreds of them everywhere in every country and they didn't exist before you know and that somehow or another you could directly connect them a lot of them to me that's very strange so what does that say about ideas I mean what does that say about saying what you think and planing what your life is to people that's what they want I mean I think when I when I'm with Jordan the thing I realized more than anything else is he's giving them a little room to be who they are he's taken some of the bullets you know the hit pieces and all that stuff that we've talked about he takes a little bit of that to take these positions that are not wrong but are just politically incorrect or somewhat unpopular or controversial and by taking those positions he gives other people just a little bit of a forcefield to think a little bit soon so for you and this it's like you started doing something that gave you a little peace of mind a little something that made you feel good and feel healthy and clean and mentally sound and all that and then you started talking about it and then holy shit somebody in Nebraska was like I'm gonna try that and the next thing you know she opened a clinic for it and is doing it you know what I mean and then that that Spurs and so that's the beauty of saying what you think well it also works the same reason why this podcast works like that spot I've never promoted this podcast I just did it and through word of mouth it got bigger and bigger yeah the thing about float tanks is I'm telling you how amazing it is you try it and it doesn't suck you enjoy that I don't know what yeah it's not like all these people went and tried it out like he fucking lied to me god damn it no they went there oh my god it's so relaxing it's amazing yeah I got in there with a fresh perspective my body feels loose and relaxed this is crazy it's like there's a real positive benefit I'm telling the truth how quick can you snap into to the zone that you want to get into and you're in there cuz that's when I was just did it a couple days ago I've done it a couple times now and I've usually been it takes me about 20 minutes to kind of clear the clutter but you know sometimes it's more sometimes it's less this last time just because I think we've been traveling so much up in planes every day and everything it was until the light you know that's what happens like the last five minutes I finally got to that place where I was kind of disconnected you know but do you have a trick for that when you get in there I've done it so many times that my body knows what it's doing yeah I lay in the tank my body's like ah here we go I'll just sink in but I've done it how many times I've had a tank since 2002 so you're more than Mayer's a tank yeah tank time you know and then I've been in there on mushrooms and we didn't you know we did opposed especially that's the weird one there's marijuana edibles are the one some of the most underrated psychedelics in terms of like introspective thinking self-examination it's like it's one of those things that just forces you to really go over every single aspect of your subconscious you're trying to hide from you got a you got a good strain of indica that's not gonna completely destroy me like my weed situation at this point and I used to be a big pothead my weed thing is like end-of-the-night puffs from my me and like watch the same Simpsons episode that I loved in 1989 like that's good enough for me like I don't need like I know a lot of my comic friends like they want to smoke a sativa and write write writer and I'm like yeah I've opened up enough doors in my brain if anything I'd tighten a couple hinges you know what I mean I don't need to go the other way again like for me it's much more about relaxation yeah well there's a lot of great sativas oh you're indicas brother all you have to do just go to any store and then just take a little hit and then try it out just the whole thing is just don't go too deep like people try three four or five hits and then never smoke pot before and then they're in a k-hole in the corner crying and screaming and you know it's like your body doesn't know what the fuck to do with all that THC yeah it should have a look like this watch this hey that's it you're good blow it out relax give it an hour find out what the fuck the effect is don't just keep hitting it you know I've seen people that don't smoke pot oh I'll try okay and then an hour later I'm like are you gonna die and they're like you think you're gonna die like you look you're freaked out man yeah yeah so I back in the day like college and a little bit after college I had did mushrooms out of maybe 20 times in my life something something there and then I haven't done it in about 15 years and then about six months ago some mushrooms appeared doesn't matter how they were in my house and I was like alright here's what we're gonna do my that's friends over and David was there and we were like alright we're all gonna take one cat we're not gonna like have a fucking pussy come on so I was like you know we're just gonna take one cat okay see what I got to do so we'll take a cab and we had smoke a little weed drank it was after dinner and we're just all hanging out as a couple of us and we were like we're gonna go play some video games so we're playing like NBA Jam kind of thing you know and we're playing and playing playing playing and I'm going guys guys my controller is not working my controller is not working I can't control this nothing's working David looks at me he's like you're not holding a controller I was playing on my leg yeah I had no controller I was actually I thought I would so I'm telling you one cap see you mocked me but one cap can do the trick that's the story I think you need to go to a doctor find out what's wrong with your brain one captures a cue like this mmm Wow world's more interesting than I thought it was video games were again PlayStation 4 people yeah I jumped connected I jumped right into PlayStation 4 you know video games are good when you're with a little bit of I would recommend once you get into the two or three caps you put the fucking video games down just lay down and think about your life yeah but I for videogames like I'm again I just don't have enough time so like I like old-school 8-bit run one way I want to run what I don't want I wasn't worried yeah I want to run that way I don't even want to run backwards and I definitely don't want to run this way I just want to run that way so my perio Metroid that kind of thing I played that newly silly shit yeah like I want to blow some stuff up for a few minutes you know I don't have to murder a family and rape people and yeah I mean I've you know I've raped a couple prostitutes and you know all that it's fun when you're doing it someone's gonna take those fuckin sound bites you see it subconsciously you give it to them you know so I just gave it a little yeah who are they who are who are they they don't need uh everybody needs a hug I think we I'm less combative with every year less defiant and combative with every year with this stuff I'm more shrugging than ever Mike just try to be a nice person yeah trying to try to be nice try to be nice to each other do you do your best at whatever you're doing keep moving and when things pop up and people write things just go okay what am I gonna do yeah you think that could be a connection though to eventually killing the drive to want to keep doing things like to want to keep being funny to want to keep getting out there no my drive is for the people that enjoy my work yeah my drop when I'm when I'm doing stand-up my drive is because I know there's a bunch of people that are getting babysitters and they they're there they bought tickets in advance and then like next Friday Joe's coming to town and I'm I'm working hard for that yeah I don't want them to have a bad experience I want to do the best fucking show I can do I'm dead serious about that that's very important to me I understand there's a massive responsibility and I'm doing the Chicago theater like I did last weekend two shows 3,700 people a show that's a lot of people I don't want anybody to be disappointed I want to do my best job the best I can do and that's where my drive is my drive is to I'm dissecting material I'm rewriting it I'm practicing I'm going I went up three times last night I'll probably go up I'm going up at least two times tonight I'm doing the improv and I'm doing the Comedy Store I do that all the time man I do that all the time and my drive is to there's a great reward in making people laugh and there's a great reward in in we made an exchange you know they came to see me I made them laugh everybody's happy look we had a deal you know that's the deal and I've worked it's not an easy deal it's like you got to work hard to fill your end of the bargain but if you do work hard and you do work at it and you do examine it you do put in the hours onstage and you do go over the rewrites and listen to the recordings and do your best it's rewarding yeah the reward is that I I can say that those people have a good time like when I put a video up on Instagram a bunch of people cheering after the show my feeling when I this is like we shared this time you guys had a good time I had a good time I'm super happy there's nothing like thank you yeah yeah because I told you I'm just getting back in so I just booked my couple hours so on the nights off that I'm with Peterson so we sold out the DC Improv sold out Tempe and perhaps sold out Irvine improv here urban improv yeah yeah or any pro and yeah I feel that now cuz it's weird because you don't know me from comedy so it's like I did it I lived all those new york city years as a comic never hit into I was a good comic but I never hit into TV in that way and that's why I started doing all these other things that led me to this but it's like they can put my name up and now it sells out it wasn't before Yeah right so now it's like I feel this extra pressure of like wow these people like they're really coming for me it is what extra pressure but there's a reward to it too it's been awesome I mean it's like I'm getting back to this thing that people don't know me from and it's like I'm good I sent you the hour I haven't send it to anybody I'm not putting up publicly but I wanted you to see it because even if you could only watch a minute because I wanted you to know that I'm a real comic you know you mean likes because otherwise it's like we can all sit here yeah I'm kind of right but it's it's incredibly powerful like when you're in that room with those people and you make it real for that and I know my style like I'm never gonna be the best joke writer on the planet it's not where my passions lie but I like being in that room with these people doing what we did here and and getting everybody playing and being in the moment and I get people kind of yelling at each other and screaming and announcing their political differences and like all this crazy shit and I don't know anyone that's doing it the way that I'm doing it and it's not like I'm doing a set the way Seinfeld would lay out you know every word you know for the hour what I love it it doesn't matter the beautiful thing about comedies anyway you wanted you do it your way yeah your way Dave we just did three hours shit man now I got Sam Harris I got a run home I came here from the airport honey already it's already 3 xx that's crazy I got Harris at 4:00 I think I gotta get the hell out of well thank you man it's always a pleasure wait hold on now I'm getting you official you went to Shapiro before me it happened I was always free that day we'll do your show all right I tell many other things to say gentlemen Dave Rubin thanks brother thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
