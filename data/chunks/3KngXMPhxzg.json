three two one boom and we're live how are you come on I'm good I'm pouring coffee in the first seconds the perfect without chat that's the good way to do it with a cafeteria yeah named in a French way a French press that's what they're called is it cold well it's called I think it's called cafeteria but it's probably called pot of coffee but that makes sense but you know there's a French word for it that we just ignore a lot of the food you know because you have herbs you know herbs hmm and I used to do this bit of a - which I really enjoyed saying you know the difference in British and American you say this and you say herbs and we say herbs because it's a fucking H in it right but and I thought why does the H dropped off for America I think it's because put a lot of French guys would have come over immigration and they would have done a lot of cooking you know these French guys know about cooking they do the herbs and they they cut the H off totally so I think that was an influence from that probably Julia Child Julie Joshy French yeah I think wasn't she she is now I mean she's into French cooking alright okay but yet maybe laughs I sit next to Washington say we will use herbs with this stuff here and that we could do the revolution you war and then and then you guys are waiting and then they will hate each other forever well you guys also do a lot of weird stuff where you put like a you and color and you have a Y and tires what are you putting ties open I are yes yeah I think we had we had first dibs on the Lakers yeah I don't understand what we did you know what you got on the you guys got on the Mayflower and they said okay we're gonna talk like this for now they say whew a lot and we're gonna get put get rid of why you know tires if we're gonna adventurers get rid of the way yeah I just think the you and color and honor is a you and honor as well and yes we've got it and you've got it out I think yours is more logical on a load for honor yeah not for herbes no herbs is that's more French influence I agree yeah I always wondered because I grew up in Boston and I was wondered like those were the first people to leave England and Europe like what the fuck happened to their language because they developed the most disgusting brand of it well you've got your A's your bus today's which I can't hear strong bustin coming out of here yeah I got rid of it I heard myself on television once when I was like 19 years old it was like holy shit what is that well you guys had or you used to have their mother father brothers fuckin car and it's the ah yeah and we say mother father sister we don't have an r at the end of our mother brother sister and you know yeah we say mother I said a mother hmm and the rest of America has much stronger and Island has that that's a very Irish influenced thing and for us the I when we're playing when I'm playing American when I was in you know doing roles like that the our was the hardest thing to get hard hard car remember friends saying hey I was creating this thing that came out like hard hard tar and I thought that is the one to practice because that is just hard hard tar we've called it hard hard towards just just doesn't sound the same you spent a lot of time on the only time I've ever spent in England is working like a little bit of downtime doing stand-up and hang out over there but most of its just been working even working for the UFC or I'd never been really get a chance to really spend time in England I'd like to I'd like to do that just together I understand you folks well I heard different breed well I think at the base having played 45 countries now I think everyone is actually the same when you get down below a level but you know if you're gonna reach for you there's got to be a number of things which would make it seem different and brand names will be different than you sports does you know everyone sports does everyone's party's interview that kind of thing but underneath it all it's gonna be there's gonna be more mainstream people to come here I'll turn these people that's me and the whole spectrum now like in the old days it used to be everything was mainstream then a bit of alternative now we I think your country my country have a whole spectrum of what's interest people it's much more open in that way hmm yeah no I certainly agree we yeah it's the the collection of people is very similar it's just they're operating in a different environment a different theatre right yeah yeah and you know we're tightly smashed together would it be 65 million in your 300 million and you're such a large your country is so large compared to us yeah because there was a thing of ten only ten percent of Americans have passports but if you look at the aerial something like that but then if you look at where the temps and can go in America it's just so huge row it's slightly more understandable why a lot of Americans say I don't need a passport because I'm just gonna go to that place that's understanding of you but I think you know I think it would do everybody good to go somewhere like like Asia like every time I go to Asia I always think okay people are like this too yes is this is an interesting thing to experience Thailand in particular which I really loved right Thailand is it's amazing because it's like wow they might they hit like this perfect frequency where everybody's really friendly and really nice and it's it's a you know they call it the land of the smiles it's this very unusual environment there where everybody seems like warm and greeting I don't think I'm ran into one rude Thai while I was there I that sounds very interesting and I i I've I've yeah when I took Asia but unfortunately it was kind of in out and you know yeah but that's interesting but the ties more than any other country because I'm sure they must have a black market and a thing and some gangster of some time maybe they're very nice gangsters they were the nicest gangsters we know I'm sure they're not ask you first before they show you I'm sure when it gets to the drug smuggling and yeah sex trafficking and all the other day but would you mind awfully polite drug smugglers I mean they they have obviously a very open environment when you go to see Bangkok it's like moly Thai fights and chaos and a lot of expats wandering around drinking it's just you know there it's a different sort of world over there but when I was there I was in Chiang Mai and it's just super friendly people beautiful landscape very nice have you been in Vietnam no never heard it's amazing though but yeah I mean I find that from an American perspective it would be very interesting people going there even if they you know were there before and during the time of war or after just to see how people are because they fought for so long the French stuff before that but even before yeah America got involved in it they call it a thousand-year war that they fought anyway it's interesting it's I hope new generations coming along don't bring the baggage of before you know previous generations and we can all move try and move forward into a world that's more positive yeah it doesn't necessarily look like that well what has always been really interesting to me about Vietnam that I learned from Bourdain was that they they don't hold any grudges towards Americans which I find incredible I I got that sense of it I have not played there haven't been there but I got that sense that they were looking forward they just accept it that's the past and they don't have any grudges and just like it's an amazing attitude it is an amazing attitude I suppose it's better if you they did an empirical it's empirical in the way they kind of they didn't like do a massive concur in the end America left and so they got what they were I assume the majority of them were trying to get you know yeah they can run it however they want to run it but yeah it's it's tragic the things the wars are getting to do I was going to be in the military when I was a kid that was one of my I want to be in Special Forces and I okay now being a transgender guy with that but yeah that was where I was I know Trump wouldn't have let me in there force is right now if I were applied right this second but yeah so I follow everything I I kind of run my life on the military that sounds a bit with I run my career on a military thinks it's quite difficult to you know any career putting it together kind of weird what's your next move what's this how so yulik strategize isn't it yo yeah strategy out the wazoo I plan 50 years ahead really oh yeah well if you think about you came out I came out as transgender 34 years ago that's not the first good thing that an agent wants to hear you transgender that's it's like this is such a thing this is even now they would say okay well it's got a little better than it was for about five ten millennia it's a little better now but it's still not the hottest ticker that everyone's what transgender guys it's in here for this that yeah it's not the top of the list right and I've also got boy mode and girl mode and I do drama dramatic films in boy mode and then I'm touring in girl mode and doing stand-up and I campaign for politics in go mode I just how do we do that I just switched change you know take off heels flat shoes yeah because if you were just talking like if you didn't have makeup bond and you didn't have the heels and the nails you just seemed male yeah yeah well it's I think it's genetically inbuilt you know there's some I think there's quite a lot of people maybe who were the the way they're like they live their lives live their own personality they're not particularly male or female mm-hmm I feel but I've always felt since I was four or five I want to express this side of myself and it's built in I think its genetic and if you analyze masculine feminine if you really get down to it you found it impossible to come up with anything that was particularly masculine particularly family except for the ability to build muscle mass is easier for men in a venomous that's it but you know great footballers soccer players men and women athletics runners men women strong character men sweet character sure men and women mathematicians whatever whatever it is there's nothing that you can really say ah daddy's only good shot and with a gun no anyone could do that it's we're all humans and so and we get fixated by the masculine feminine where's it's a tiger if Tigers attacking you and trying to kill you you don't go now is this a girl tiger or a boy we don't care about it they don't care either the Tigers so you've always felt like you gravitated towards feminine things towards no gravitated towards both I had I gravitated towards playing soccer I was in the first team for two years when I was a kid was planning to do Officer Training Corps and then go Marines or Paris and then guns a Special Forces our SAS which would be the equivalent of your Delta Force and that was a distinct planned you a lot about that and I thought which war they're gonna send me to actually which one I said we do and they could be the idiots that I'm at school with will send me to the wrong war in World War two is very clear and then after that every other war is kind of hazy but there's all this feminine side girls side I'm not sure how to do it the articular even after 34 years it's difficult to articulate but I wanted to express that and if I look more like a woman than I you know it it would be much easier but yeah so I decided to do that in 85 when it wasn't cool and I got had a lot of fights in the street a lot of people screaming abuse at me taken a couple of people to court or just reported and police it then we went to court and yeah and you fight you fight your fights instead of going to do a military fighting thing I've I've done I've said this might be wrong for me to say this but I say I've done Special Forces civilian division you know fighting people people and now performing for languages I've run over 80 marathons I'm going into politics next year and and yeah and I came and the transgender thing is it's in a better place than it was back in 85 well certainly now I think because of probably Caitlyn Jenner and the the movement that you're seeing for to accept people that want to do whatever and anything yet want to do yeah it is just we're more accepting of each other we do see to be more what's the word because were the team all open more allowing there's a word for it which is just walked out of my head Billie mean that word but yeah and at the same time people going around doing more killings and stuff at the thing and I'm well there's more people yeah there's just sheer volume of human has the and the population growth is insane its diverse something like 200,000 years to get to 1 billion yeah and then it's taken this 50 years to get to 7 a half billion which is scary yeah when I was a kid I think the United States population was less than 200 million now it's 300 million global was whatever it was now it's 7 plus but borders an 8 yeah yeah I came out I think it was 6.5 I think that's just running away and one of the weird things is if we are having less Wars if we're getting better health to people then more kids are around and some people in I suppose lower income backgrounds and around the world they will say well we need to have six kids because that's what mmm you know from her for what much money yeah that's what we do but as economics care better people have less kids and that hopefully that should calm down there should be a bottoming I think they feel yeah yeah leveling off of the public yeah I've read that theory that they believe that industrialized nations and westernized society when people start having two careers you know and then two career households people are less likely to have a bunch of kids yeah so as people do better they have less kids yeah yeah so I'm a gut i I'm a glass is two-thirds full person that's really instead of a glass is half-full half-empty person so you're optimist I'm a big I couldn't be here yeah in the hills with the nose I'm planning to do this we've got a film coming that literally in the country and that I'm going to politics as well when you first started wearing women's clothes and dresses and makeup onstage people think it was a gimmick what did they think they did I really I decided not to call them women's clothes just like to say they're for my clothes I would just wear dresses right you know like women can wear trousers or pants and we used to call it men's pants and that's that pants right so but yeah they first started talking about it and not wearing anything again look kind of boy like and male like and then you were talking about it like I had the first check this is my first ever joke I had this about two years before I thought I said look you don't stand up so if you're from a minority it's kind of a good thing so if you in stand up terms so if you're from a low-income background you've seen rich people it's so easy for them is your woman is a man man from ethnic backgrounds a white people so if you're white male middle class than a vice useless so thank God I'm a transvestite my first love and everyone thought he's making jokes about something that he's not either and and they wouldn't believe me and journalists were going I don't know why he's doing this he's doing pretty well now but this is this a joke so I thought I better way addresses gonna put some makeup on and then they said okay he's doing this he is serious but he looks a mess kind of baby elephant thing I was doing okay get your weight and a truck you could have better haircut Matt and you just got to fail a lot and there's a humiliation period I mean this is the weird thing about coming out that it's kind of humanly I think people say you look people say horrible think what they say what the fuck is that somebody said to my face right there as I was walking out of a restaurant so I thought that's a not very nice and you have to be able to deflect it and go well you're obviously a scumbag so fuck you man so mostly men yes and occasionally women okay use new women but yeah I mean you know it's low it's people have low lower character they're on lesser character if you're strong character in yourself you okay living that live what the hell right you know people okay doesn't look quite look together but you know life's tough enough but if if you want to put someone down you raise your own status buddy yeah and they will do that and so I have stood in the street and people have unloaded you know swear words invective to me and I've just found a viola viola they go what your father fuck you and then literally you know two or three of them or one of me just screaming at each other and I just won't back down now but this happened recently was nine months ago someone outside my house and in in London just having a go at me so he knew who you were as well yeah they did they knew exactly where they were liver said we're gonna do your house is a West because of the way you dress well it was he added that into it there wasn't there was an altercation over I was just packing my characters I was just driving home to see my dad and Santa you got to give me a ride in your car I said someone heckles me like that in the street I just come back with the you will never have a ride in my car if I have to give you whatever give you so that happened and then this guy went off and you know this and that and the other in Rowlett it's just screaming it means so I'm shouting back at him giving him word for word and then who is it idiot and they said oh that's this guy oh he's a known he's a nutter you know he's just he does this I went all right maybe I should mention it he said he's given to my eye I mentioned it to the police there oh man weeks like that same thing oh it's the same ticket that's right next time I go now he knows where you live well he always did he was right in front of the house that's always fun isn't it yeah well and he said we're gonna do your house where no way you know so this was this that was his opening gambit we're gonna do your house when you're away hmm letting the letting you know they're a coward yeah well it was it was not very positive he didn't run a payout company that's kind of terrorism right there trying to strike terror in you when you're a well yeah that well that is yes that is the hatred thing is did you think about just going out there and fucking him up I don't think I'm quite that I would have liked if I'd gone through the military thing of a gun that I'd learnt how to do that you know and I've never have craft my guard myself up to the thing I do need to grab my girl herself up but I haven't got that so um well I saw we were talking before and you were trying tell me that you were lazy I'm like to fuck you I saw that thing that you did that documentary where you ran a series of marathons in a row with no training at all and I remember thinking before that I had this opinion of you and the opinion of you was you're a funny guy you're a funny comedian you you have good stand-up you obviously work hard at it but then I saw that and I was like oh okay there's something going on there like yeah that was a different kind of human being the kind of human being that could push themselves into doing that day after day after day and I looked at your feet where your skin was literally falling off and you're taping everything up and that's a that's a person that's got you have an iron will like that's a very unusual will for a comedian who doesn't really exercise like when you were doing I mean you were I mean you may be exercised a little bit but you weren't in shape now and you decided to run how many marathons and well was it the UK one was it the first one yeah that was 43 and 51 days 43 marathons in a row in 51 days with no training at a dev week I did have training about six weeks training yeah which is not a lot but they did they said that you know sometimes if you run a marathon you should train for nine months before that you know and I thought well if I'm gonna do forty three that's gonna be I won't be training forever I can't be bothered with so I but you know and this happened in your Civil War in maybe in any war I don't quite encyclopedic about your civil war and revolution water bit it's world war two but try on the spot training you know training as you go along that's what I did the first ten Matins trains you for the next 33 what was it like when you go over the first day though the first marathon was okay fuck my first days okay because well it's all in your head there's a more mental than it is physical and so the first math that I've heard of people running merit is run/walk staggered not very fast we'll get it done boom the second marathon is we kids you go I've done one I'm on the second and you can't really rejoice you can't punch the sky you can't put a medal around your neck you already you've got up at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning and you're it's midday and you're going through your second one and then you're through the third one and then you through the fourth one and then it was raining and my feet was shredding and I hold the moisture it was yes it made it too soft you know and they were rubbing on the on the running shoes and I didn't know how they how do I fix it when I'm actually wearing on it all the time so we started bathing in surgical spirit which you call something else it's a it's a ethanol methanol anyways it's some sort of alcoholic spirit and it it takes the moisture out of your feet and so they became stones it's kind of which um anyway if anyone doesn't have some surgical spare if you google it now you'll see what it's called in America but it's it's some sort of alcoholic thing that just removes moisture and so it made my feet my toes like little stones and kind of tough and actually that got us through and then I started and also apparently because I did 27 marathons in 27 days in South Africa in 2016 and that was the temperatures were crazy on that but it seems that the body will switch on a healing property that we've got latent in ourselves that we don't use and you will heal quicker you'll heal faster the more you get so I got so you get stronger and both the British one and the South African one I got stronger as I went on really the first ten days are the other key thing and after that it's kind of easier you're used to it your body just adapts and he understands yep this crazy asshole yussle and the brain goes what kind of mouth and shall we run today as opposed to what kind of marathon yeah well I think that's what the brain is doing cuz the first day that's going you got to do what this marathon it would be okay the second day the race going now we're gonna we're doing another one third day fourth day fifth day this is insane and then day ten the brains going okay you're on this kind of kick or something I understand let's let's try better Mathis don't push it too hard you know you the brain starts talking to the body and somehow it levels out roundabout main then it gets surreal math at 18 math and 23 I remember marathon 31 that was a lovely just so weird yeah but it was funny and you own the road you know Woody Guthrie this land is our land is my land the you become like it's your land it's like that it's everybody's land because you're running on the roads of this country I grew up in and you feel that the roads the fields the birds I didn't listen to any music I wanted the slightly a safety thing for traffic but also you could hear everything that's going on birds chatter reverse running there was I ran past somebody's house this is all about day two and there was a river running there and it went through the back of this guy's garden and he said oh hello I said got Ike Ike Ike went and visit him and I washed my feet in in the river and then I put the socks back on and I carried on running I thought I can you can do with his I took BlackBerry's out of the bushes like I did when I was a kid it just became a fetid feral this holistic or feral marathon's that's what I was doing it's not run it's not people shouting from the sides no one cares really which is fine and I'm just wrapped up in this other place and it was it's beautiful I mean it's really Zen well it seems like it would change you like accomplishing something like that like on the last day the last run when you cross the line what was that feeling like well this is a pitch you brought up that picture they put up some flags and stuff that was beautiful I tried to do it a five hour marathon now if you know the speeds it's two hours is what they told a break man so this is really slow but then having done 42 marathon suits maybe it's fair and I missed it by about 30 second but it was it was beautiful to finish it I was really quite strong all the way through I didn't stop at any time that was that was good in South Africa though I I did 27 in 27 days salute to Nelson Mandela's 27 years in prison and day 5 they put me in hospital because they thought my kidneys were giving up you experiencing rhabdo what am I like you know yeah yeah yeah yeah your first brother ever talked to who's known about rhabdomyolysis yeah I got rhabdo in 2012 how'd you get that I was on a anti cholesterol drug just a sort of health drug your cholesterol to a high tech this thing once a day and side effect is rhabdomyolysis see which I couldn't spell being dyslexic and I was paying Brown peeing and and I did it there's no real pain a lot of left the joy I was really tired and this is without exercise you were getting it I was on marathon three American four so I had trained that train before though I'd done some training before that one a bit weird with my training but yeah so there wasn't a huge amount of training before that one but third mouth and and I was started peeing a bit of brown this was not through the whole series of marathons or it was no well I tried to do South Africa twice 2012 was my first one after day four on an anti cholesterol drug trying to control my cholesterol and and I started broke Brian pee and then they said you gotta get a hospital now the guys you were gonna put fluid through you you have to go see a specialist especially said you can't continue this 27 thing because you have to get all this stuff out of your system otherwise the kid needs because it shreds them on you know this wrestles into the bloodstream clogs up kidneys kidney failure very dangerous a lot of fighters get it really you know yeah I'm a fighter died from it recently in Boston in the Massachusetts area yeah it's it's apparently something that happens when fighters over train as well like sometimes they're not doing it scientifically so they're not analyzing their heart rate their heart rate variability and they don't know that they haven't really truly recovered and they continue to push themselves because they they want to prepare harder yes they have this sort of mental mindset just train harder and you'll be better off but that's not necessarily the case of your body can't physically keep up with the recovery and sometimes they'll go into a fight over trained and then they wind up getting robbed Oh from the fight it's happened several times and it's caused a few deaths yeah well they said this you said you carry on right at running now in 2012 you won't make it so 2016 did you get off that medication yeah I would think that all that running you wouldn't need that medication I would have thought but you know they check your and you say it was just a fuckers you know you'd be on this for rest of your life that stuff's kids are shit out of me those statins yeah it's it's it goes to a scary place but 2016 day five Bloods were looking a bit weird day off so day 27 I did double marathon and that was kind of interesting day so you run one marathon last day of you run you've only done 25 race and said it's the day 27 so and when you go through that finishing that the final flag where the walkie they should be waving flags you've got another marathon to go and it's just yeah I might brain I thought this is kind of good but because it's 90k you're gonna do today ignore it carry on and it was a rough rough all day that's five hours then another five hours five hours plus another five hours plus in the end it was six I took 11 hours and 50 minutes to run 90k so I need double marathon in 11 hours 10 that's damn good yeah it was good enough and there's they got a they got a comrades marathon in South Africa which is 90k and they got a 12-hour cutoff so I said I will do 90 K in 12 hours mmm the double marathons at a before then I did another 6k after I'd finished that last moment must been orgasmic when you've finished there must have been incredible finishing the 84 was beautiful year finish at the steps of Nelson Mandela's statue right he was made president and that was beautiful and and rough I'd had to speed up in the last hour because of complications so I actually got faster have you ever done a thing where you're knackered and Mac and said now go why'd you have to speed up there was a wind it was a thing called Sport Relief I was doing it for so I was raising money and and I wanted to finish inside the camera window there to win till 3:15 south-african time police escorts were needed at certain bits otherwise you'll get carjacked things and and it's and you won't survive this big so I said can't we just ignore the the carjacking thing no you can't ignore it so I said okay stop the clock put me in the thing drive me to Pretoria stop me off and then I'll run there and we'll just continue it on there so we had to do that so he got behind because I wasn't running because I had to be driven across this dangerous period of part point of road to be dropped to Pretoria then I just had to run the kilometres off so they have like a carjacked area yeah they have certain areas where there's it's kind of out there there's no-one really out there and you just go along there and they'll be though anything can happen so my field producer fixer he was just saying we don't do this just you can't go there so I said we'll just get me closer to the finishing line and then I'll just run around doesn't really matter where I'm running now we know it's Pretoria no we need to finish I need to just run that distance so I ran the distance off but the time had got behind so I had to speed up from 7.5 kilometres an hour to 10 kilometers an hour so an extra third of this meat which was kind of evil no I moaned a lot that day I just I was just a moaning whining god I can't do this but I was never considering not doing it and I got there the the the live feed to London finished at quarter past and we've got there about 13 minutes past we got about two minutes and they just caught it before they went off it was like you know like in a film you know it's perfectly designed I just knew if I got that probably I get more money a raise more money an extra hundred gram because we've seen this idiot finish he's actually doing it you know so that was beautiful and then I talked to the this very interesting thing because you know if you're talking to prayer it was a press I talked to the press after that was a Sunday and so they kept talking normally they said we can't talk anymore we've got two minutes and then we're gonna talk to important people go away that's what normally happens if you're talking to live presentational press but I was on thing and they just kept talking to me because obviously a slow news day nothing was happening and they say we've got this idiot who's just run you know 27 marathons and they kept asking me other quest and what favorite colour do you have and what how big are your legs and what Thank You legs yeah I don't know what they were asking me but in the end these two interviews idea that with national I just said I'm gonna go away now I'm gonna stop this I had to stop my own interview which I've never done in my life and I realized they've just got no one else to talk to yes did you notice a big change in public perception of you once you've completed those marathons yeah the yeah the certain community and if you're transgender guy and you come out certain people go but I crossed into a line of well if you're gonna do that and you hate I know you do some comedy you do drama stuff we think you're a bit you know bonkers and out there but fair play I got this sort of I got a pass play to you if you're gonna do that and I was trying to do selection you know SAS they have selection your Delta Forces Navy SEALs they all have this thing that can you just go on and on and on and it's the stamina thing and that was my civilian selection for my own whatever solidification forces just to understand yourself yeah I'd I know I can go a lot for having coming out as transgender when you're straight I'm straight transgender so I fancy women so I'm gonna want to be lesbian so if you come out you you could stay in the closet and a lot down the millennia if we go back to the ancient Egyptians and further there's probably a lot of guys said I don't tell anyone about this I just I fancy women just go that I just won't mention this kind of feelings in my head and I thought I should mention it because if people shout and scream at me in the streets I will I will fight that at least verbally fight there or you know if they start going for I have had one fight in the street and I landed one punch yeah yeah I taught myself two years on the streets because of this yeah yeah the guy was was just giving me Oh Tracy only your dress and I was I've been a street performer for four years a common girl so I was living on the street you know no I was working on the streets and you know just knew a lot of people go around I just had met you don't have to be like this we can all space enough for everyone live and let live kept giving me stuff he was a bit drunk every Leicester so he was just gonna stay on that wicket keep saying and I said just chill out chill out and then the third time I just said I just fuck over now when I am I am loaded load of swear words on him and then he swung for me which was the handy thing because that came up in court and then I swung back and I landed one punch which I was pleased by and I was doing the wipe on wipe off stuff I was doing this mule blocking yeah from the jujitsu book that I taught myself Jiu Jitsu from a book if you could believe that which is you know you'll get these books with the different moves in and you can't teach yourself that but I did judo when I was six actually as well so I liked the idea of doing these things but I felt judo was always at the bigger kid you all get in pajamas and the bigger kid just throws you around of it I can never quite get the hanger throw the bigger kids I could do it now but I've never anyway yeah this is a fantastic video online of a very old judo expert and I think he's in his 70s or his 80s and he's working out with these young men and you see his mastery of judo as these young powerful men try to manipulate him and throw him around and he effortlessly watch this this old man and he see him he's very very old and he's throwing these guys around and me as a martial arts expert these knees men are not doing this willingly this is legitimate like even that guy tries to throw him and this is a black belt who's trying to throw him but he's so good and his his use of balance and leverage is so amazing he just knows where to be like see how yeah yeah that just throws himself into a perfect position I mean it's really stunning to watch and this looks like it was from the 50s or something like that because it's really old but yeah does it say just has 75 year old judo master I mean this is an old man and the the young man is much larger than him yeah significantly like 25% larger than me at least maybe even looking at me he looks least twice as big as him and he cannot throw this old man it's really amazing judo is a beautiful art he's getting more and more full on his these guys I gotta get this he's trying I mean he knows that this guy's a master but it's just look at that like it's incredible I mean the way that guy's body can toss these people through the air and yet they they are helpless they can't have anything there's no way that look at that boom 375 years old I mean it hurts my hips just looking at that you know you couldn't have many different martial arts that yeah yeah which ones jujitsu and striking martial arts my background was in striking which is in Taekwondo and then eventually kick boxing and Muay Thai and then I got really into jujitsu when I got older and what I'm choose grappling it's all choking people it's like you it's not throws like judo there are throws in jiu-jitsu but there it really comes from judo it comes from the ground fighting aspect of Judo which is not as emphasized but the Brazilians really really emphasized it and sort of they they figured out what the best way for a smaller person defeat a larger person is through leverage and jiu-jitsu is really the only martial art that I can think of that works like you think of a martial art in a movie like in a Bruce Lee movie like there's all these people and they were always bigger than Bruce Lee but Bruce Lee fucked them all up but in the real world that doesn't usually work like the bigger people have such a giant advantage when it comes to like striking like you're never gonna see like a heavyweight in the UFC fight a bantamweight fight a person who weighs 135 pounds just wouldn't it's just too much of an advantage in jiu-jitsu it's legitimately possible for a hundred and forty pound man to strangle a two hundred plus pound man and do it relatively easily if they're talented I I saw documentary on Bruce Lee and he had the way of no way yeah which really appealed to me I mean that is like a philosophy quite a month I'm a fighting philosophy but to be so trained up in so many things that they do not know what you're gonna do and I kind of adopted that well he had to overcome significant prejudice to adopt that perspective because when he was studying martial arts you were supposed to be loyal to your style so if you learn kung fu you were supposed to be a kung fu man for life yeah you weren't supposed to also dabble in boxing and wrestling and all these different things that he would you then he was interested in taking what's useful from all different martial arts and applying them in a sense he was really the founder of mixed martial arts which you see today and right in the UK they have Cage Warriors and the US as the UFC and you know there's this worldwide now the the art of mixed martial arts of putting all the different styles together and you could do whatever you want within the rules now I liked the attitude of that I still have a life attitude and there's obviously the fighting attitude of it and it's the life attitude of just be prepared for anything and everything yeah and in be like water like that was his other thing yeah just to go around things move through things yeah don't don't headbutt things figure out what's the best way what is the what's the best best path yeah you know yeah I just I haven't learned well I say I think I'm waiting for someone to give me a really hard time and I said now I am checking in and I am learning in my shot because I've really do you live in England yeah there's so many places and we live here and I'm always touring yeah I was touring and I'm filming and so I just keep moving but yeah I know but it's you've got to make the time special if you're moving around all the time yeah you'd have to line it up so okay we're gonna check in with this guy and that place they said yes and you'd have to take it in like you do it's got to be something that you're serious that as opposed to doubt I didn't want to dabble like um stand-up when I'm filming I still do stand-up when I'm filming and if I'm doing stand-up I will think about doing the drama you know drama and comedy that kind of related but different so I keep pushing both you've got to keep everything match fit for life mm-hmm and that's what like Meritus I can drop marathons now I just did three marathons I just dropped three merit got home from playing Australia to the train up to barrack up on tweets on the Scottish border ran up to Dunbar which is one marathon I went across to Edinburgh second marathon are you running a marathon with other people we're just running it for yourself get a backpack put my stuff in there change of clothes Wow wash kick off I go no back up and is this something that started because of that series of marathons you did yeah it's and I want to stay match fit for life because that's what I've noticed so everyone's a natural at that all animals are natural animals and there are the wild animals which we were and then there are domesticated animals we ourself domesticated mm-hmm we are actually designed to be wild we're supposed to be matched fit for life and I think as time goes on you know people get back into training or whatever they say would that really hurt so I backed off I think it hurts because you're not doing it enough I'm not sure if it's a pure science this is just a feeling for me maybe that's that I need to stay fit and running and swimming and whatever I'm doing and the less I do the more the body punishes me mm if I'm doing it all the time if I'm always I try and run every morning I almost did this morning but I have to get up and do stuff today but if I miss one then that's kind of good because they're so in a recovery time but I would just do hit training high-intensity interval training every morning and then the ability to just drop three Mathis job seven marathons in seven days you love that yeah I love to have that in my back pocket and I don't think that's that's not allowed that's not a list of things you're supposed to have but I know I can do it now and I can do it with just a backpack on well you can do it too because you have autonomy you can kind of do whatever you want to do right yeah in the earning your living when you want to go make the tire yeah but there's also the actual that's not supposed to be in the list of what is what humans do right right you don't just go from around three and three or seven and seven and I I love that that's kind of that's that's out there well there's clearly people that are doing that yeah it's clear oh yes beat everyone everything I done everyone that someone's done way more than I've done yeah and I kind of know I feel that even if I don't know that facility I have one crazy friend his name's Cameron Haynes and he's a he's actually a famous bow hunter but he's also an ultra marathon runner and when he prepares for these like big foot 200 so it's like 200 plus miles for the Moab 240 yeah 238 miles in the desert he runs a marathon a day so run a marathon every day and then he works a full-time job he's legitimately crazy and you know he's he always says that he doesn't take any days off and he works a run a math and they say running them look out really Elliot really early run in the morning run at lunch running at dawn his beautiful match in the African Dawn's I got coming up we worried about something running up and grabbing yeah well and that thing I wasn't I mean they told me I supposed to have security I was I was kind of cool that's for people we worry about people to get you around Annie I was almost I was in a mountain zebra National Park and you know if you've ever been on a safari they say so I said well they tell you to sit in this sort of shower bank big open top vehicle it's got metal bars open they say the animals they know that the shape of that they knows metal and metal doesn't taste very good so you'll be fine and there's a guy with a gun and you feel good but when I went there of course they said well you're running outside near the vehicle and I thought this right this pretty good television but okay I'll just stay close so there's something's coming and it they did I said what about how the Lions doing the Lions have eaten yesterday they're fine and they told me you know and that's what lies they come they never go for snacks Lions are kind of organized like that we ate yesterday we ripped apart some animal and we don't need to go and have a very crystal they knew they knew that I knew whether I knew where they were and that they were okay but they said the Buffalo are around and they can stamp you to death about I've hidden their Buffalo so Black Death they called them really what we call and Black Death they're responsible for assuming they're not as responsible as hippos hippos are number one but they they fuck a lot of people up man they don't take any shit have you think about Bulls like people when people try to ride bulls yeah like domestic cow bulls and they're ruthlessly aggressive animals I mean they'll fucking throw you through the air now think of them but wild and in Africa and fighting off lions and that's that's African buffalos I mean they are ferocious animals and that just I didn't know what I had to do I know that with hippos if you come in between their water source then they'll just kill you they'll fuck you up I didn't know what I have to do two buffaloes whether I have to race it go anywhere near like to that grab Mara yeah if they find you to be a threat at all they're just so powerful they just just launch you in the air there's a great video that I was watching this morning of a lion that was trying to take out a small Buffalo and the other one got behind the lion and launched it through the air it was literally flying like 40 feet in the air like flipping head-over-heels because there's the strength of this thing to take a giant cat and just with its she's whooping just flies that wasn't the one with the crocodile as well no no this was one that was it was on the side of a dirt road all right have you guys about the car busy it go too busy wild on Instagram I think that's the have you heard about the crop yes I saw though yeah that's interesting because that I feel that Buffalo there are acting like the local townspeople yes and that the I think the lines are the SS and and the crocodile is another yeah this is it this is the video so it looks like the lines attacking this one look at that boom well it's actually not nearly as high as I thought it was maybe I'm thinking I'm another one yeah that would that one's pretty good though I mean just to see it do that oh you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking of relentless enemies that's what I'm thinking of there's a there's actually a a documentary about this one particular strain of lion that there was a apparently the river split sides or the river changed its path and it turned this area into an island and the Lions had to adapt because the only thing they could eat was buffalo which is very difficult to kill you know usually they're eating antelope and other smaller things that aren't nearly as dangerous right so these Lions developed it became far larger so the female lions are as large as a normal male lion and they're hulking like massive muscles and they're just enormous it's just an enormous strain of lion that's exclusively eating buffalo and there's a whole documentary it's a National Geographic documentary I think it's really good but it's just incredible to see these things walking around them and they look cartoonish they're like the Hulk so it's hard to tell you'd have to compare them to a regular lion but there's some images of these things walking around they just look so much larger than a regular lion because they just had to adapt and I would think that if you're running around like if you're running you got to think like you're you look like something that's trying to get away well made running in that Park yeah no I was right next to the green vehicle so the big metal green vehicle was there and they just said stay close so I was one door flip away from launch myself into the it was open top so I would have been in that vehicle before they got to me I hope did you hear about that woman from she was an editor on the game of Thrones and she was in one of those parks and she had a window rolled down and she they told her keep your windows rolled up at all times she was trying to take better photographs and the cat reached in and grabbed her and pulled her out of the vehicle and killed her this is last year and then there's there a dangerous creature yeah and you just hope they're running with him yeah well I they yeah this is that a picture of it yeah oh god they have a picture of it happening is in 2015 oh yeah it just knows my facts the terrible house fire breath look at that though that is just so awful that they actually caught it on camera well she just thought it was you know she was safe she's in the car I reached in grabbed her and pulled her out yeah I threw out there running around I would have there was a guy with a gun next to he's a good shot he said he knew how to shoot things Abby I played my cards yeah sometimes you play your cards and well it must've been kind of exhilarating to there's something about it right well there was I was talking to the zebras I just I went out because obviously there looked dangerous there's holida non dangerous ones it was actually the first day and the that was about math and 10 or 11 or something and I felt you know what's your over the 10 mark and I've never got there you know if you've done the whole South Africa thing and failed and people were tweeting about me Eddie is it you know Africa kicked your ass you know you just go T ia you know this is Africa where huge fuckin con it's a big and give Africa is did you tell them hey man I was on medication man that was just in that whining so I just had to come back and I've tried three times to come back and then I came back and three times yeah I kept trying to be set the day that can we get back and do the thing but it now we won't haven't got enough money to be able do that that won't be able to set up with hurricane Woods and suddenly it's on it's on it's on and I didn't couldn't trying they go and so I thought let's just go get it done and then day five was in the hospital day six was in hospital as well for how after two thirds of the marathon base six had to go to hospital so it for what well it kept what happened they my my trail my doctor had gone away but my train that thought he thought I just didn't look good it was you know 35 38 degrees whatever you know and I'm used to look one oh sorry Fahrenheit yeah I'd say 110 115 somewhere up there and I was not used to that and so I was like I would have made it I feel but he didn't he felt he wanted me to see an extra so I saw a nephrologist I didn't even know what the word meant nephrologist is a kidney expert I thought that would be a renal expert nephrologist and it's very cool black dude and he was there in South Africa and East and East London it's called as the city so it's the big place and he's going what are you doing who I'm running for Mandela what thing and okay and he said it's it's okay we've checked out your kidneys you're alright your Bloods it's it's your hydration hydration is terrible so I'm gonna put three liters into you and you'll be paying like a horse all night and I didn't pee once so yeah you need some Wow and and after that it got better with and so day 11 I got into a national this National Park so there's no one else there just me and animals and this you know the security people and whatever with me and it was kind of beautiful it was just beautiful and that the Sun was great a sunset going down there was a rainstorm as well in the middle of it there were wild animals out that I haven't I just felt okay this is n weird place of beauty and also knowing I'm getting stronger I'm getting stronger I've gone through the barrier and I also because I Britt I've run four marathons then a day off and then the fifth sixth day I ran two thirds of matthan so I'd run for 2/3 marathons in six days which is not good numbers for your head you need five and five or something in something but four and 2006 they just didn't work and then I ran another marathon and I said hang on I've got to run a marathon and if there get these numbers matching up so I caught up the third method and then it was always day seven and I've run six eight math ins in nine days there's always one day behind so I thought last day I'll do a double marathon and that'll be a good climactic end of my South African thing what what is going on with your mind when you're doing this because you you're not listening to any music and you're in this sort of meditative state where you're just left foot right foot left foot right foot breathe and breathe out yeah it's I'm saying it's kind of Zen but it's not in that kind of like I'm listening to my heartbeat or anything it's more like I just feel it's just some sort of beautiful thing of maybe because that's what we used to be as humans so maybe I'm reaching back into some past memory we humans just used to be out on the plains and we were looking for honey wild honey or berries or fruit stuff and and if we could trap something we know I don't know what I can't quite work out what it is but I just find it beautiful and I do know you're getting vitamin D in you're getting stronger from that somebody once read my hand I never do the hand palm reading but I was at a Halloween party and those are palm readers I'll try it I'm in a good place let's read my hand and I can't know what she said except you need to get out more outside more and I thought okay I always felt that I need to be out back doing stuff because when I was a kid I live for soccer for football I used to run like a crazy idiot I love that game and then from the age of 12 I went to a school that didn't play it and I never played sports this is one of my gifts to myself accident I think from the age of 12 you know your teenage years your bones really moving and setting and at that time I was hardly doing anything so I think I my knees have never gone people say running in the knees my knees have not gone I read a whole theory about the heel of the foot which it should never you know you know sprinters or toes we're all running should be on the toes yes and and I think if the heel hits that's what it causes the nails just needs to score and it could be wrong there's no no that's that's correct that's not how people were supposed to run that was actually changed by Nike they developed a running shoe with a fat and they changed the way people run they change their gait and it's responsible for a lot of injuries I think I'm noticing horses if you look for the heel of a horse it's right up by their bum because the toes you know the hoof is the toes and then you go all the way up that leg and right by the bumbie's that's the heel it's just an enormous Li long foot you know that's never gonna hit the ground and dogs don't like cats don't do it we are the ones that use this heel thing obviously - initially - for walking to make us balance that's when we went from the chimpanzee gorilla stage into the yeah but even then I mean most people if you just give them if they're barefoot like children for example like one of the things that I was reading this book about barefoot running and how important it is to develop this and that most people that have problems from that they're really having problems because their feet don't have strong muscles in them because of the atrophy and the way they were describing a regular running shoes is essentially like a cast and that you're you're so used to being protected in this cast that everything sort of just gets mushy yeah inside of it and then you're also striking down on the heel which is a very unnatural thing and when I watched my kids run like my kids were run with me sometimes and they naturally know to run on the balls of their feet that's how they naturally run and when people start running heel first that's where all the problems coming it's just not a normal way for people to run yeah and I was also initially in South Africa running on certain Road services where they just dropped instead of doing a Tom macadam kind of covering they had just put rocks obviously some lorry had come along this truck had just dropped rocks out of the back just sort of hold together the mud in in the rainy times and very uneven surface very hard of the foot and I was I was doing these very thin sold running both in sold shoes what kind of shoes are you running with well I kept changing them now so I could the vibrance and then there were vivo barefoot ones and I'll see you running him barefoot we've run marathons and barefoot shoes well initially I was and then my train it just got so hard that my toes - look you gotta wear these and then I left it to them to choose my physio and he was Olympic level so he said right these are gonna be better for that I prefer you not to be in these so I said okay you tell me what shoes to wear I'll take care of reading the relatives I do remember seeing little South African children running on the roads next to me where they come hey we'll run with you and they're completely nothing on their feet and they could deal with these sharp rocks I thought were really sharp I was every few steps of great whoa Wow and they were just as yeah and they would just they had they were laughing and running along no because their feet had built up like it is very this very house in South Africa yeah this is weird watch this no it's kind of fun because I go right back that I ran with flags that's that's a beautiful thing and I was running in the Eastern Cape and they're looking at white guy it's a white guy doing and this is very rural area so I let's say more or more that was in the African national part that was the rain that was the the day where the rain stop happened you could see the Thunder and like that's that that's the truck there a little left you can see the thing in this guy just turned up out of the blue to track me down what do you give you I just give me a letter saying thank you for doing stuff but if I ran with the flag and I said more load to people and I led to say how are you and in in cosas cosa this guy seems like he's wearing women's clothes as well yes he's wearing it's good and I think he's a transgender guy Oh with less hair than me and yeah he's bald but he's a transient agai now do you take hormones or anything no no but I could I could transition but then I've got these boy Jetix going on I mean it really thinks it's jeans I think they're gonna find out how it works but I can't prove that at the moment but if I transition over then I'll just be on the other side of this kind of fence that we give ourselves and I've decided okay I'm gender-fluid I'm just gonna have like a superhero boy mode and girl mode like the Human Torch can go flame on flame off so I'm going when do you just do decide someday today I'm boy mode I can but I tend to do sort of block periods now but what I can paint I mean go mobile I'm doing films dramatic films I've been boring mode unless I play the transgenic you have to think about it not really no but it's easier for me to be in girl mode because then if I can if if I can deal with that and you know some people stare at you and then I have a confidence now I carried myself with a certain confidence they go no he seems to be quite confident so I just relaxed about that and I can I can actually I can control other people's embarrassment because if they don't know what to do I'd say hi how are you can I have a cup of tea oh yeah what we sell to you okay so I can just relax people by just chatting to them and then boy made quite easy for me to do cuz I just it's right boy versus Pearce and I scrub up quite well and boy do you have you but you've given thought to transitioning yep yeah yeah but you know that part of me wants to be Steve McQueen in The Great Escape pony wants to be Elizabeth Taylor in looking like at home in a cathouse Afraid of Virginia Woolf no captain Hot Tin Roof which I just saw on the plane this thing oh so these the - looks like gravity and they're going well I kind of both of them and as a kid I thought you know can I look more like Lynn the Steve McQueen because I kind of fascinated with Steve McQueen and what he went through to get to where he was and he was so driven ever you know about this yes they were great story booth you know that he was in a film with Paul Newman and he was like ninety third on the list of credits somewhere someone up there likes me if you watch it you can see him there's a knife fight between Paul Newman Steve McQueen and he's like a heavy you know young thug got a heavy guy but he's just a small player and then the second firm he's in with him is towering inferno where there are equal billing and I think Paul Newman is first as Steve McQueen is higher if you look at if you look at the names on the poster poorni one comes in from the left so he's name is first and Steve McQueen is on the right but higher then Paul Newman that's how they got equal billing no you know how do you put equal billing if you're gonna start from the lip reading from the left right but and if you remember the film they come out it is two two guys you say yeah they're both decent guy yeah these are both heroes yeah that's a funny thing with actors right that billing yeah they want they want to make sure that their name is read first well that's that's I mean you've gotta have you guys to do things I mean so many things need an ego to do yeah and then hopefully you can switch dial your ego down when you come offstage some people can't do that when it comes to billing Steve if you know about Steve McQueen and his mum was a sort of sometime prostitute and had many than that the house would and its dad was just never there and he found himself through a boys boys retreat you know because he was breaking the law and they set him off to this place and then they told him to talk these kids had a train wild horses and that was one of the first things he did and he was just so ambitious and in with your brother in in maybe us at seven because you know if you know that film at the beginning they've got you're brilliant you know that film well I don't remember it well it's a maxim said was a great film so it's got your Brynner with his coloring and but no hair but such an amazing look and Steve McQueen at the beginning they go up to Boot Hill to bury this Indian guy but Boot Hill and and people are not allowing it there's racism in the town and they both go up and they ride shotgun again to heroes but he was he was your Brenna was the top guy and probably seemed okay you see what you you see what Brenna's done you see what his caravan is man god he's got all this stuff here and he just wanted to be the top guy yeah and and he got there and it's a beautiful story doesn't end brilliantly but you know bullet is great Great Escape is great yeah he's a fascinating guy Steve McQueen he became a race car driver likes yeah well serious race car yeah and he came second in the one before there's a documentary on on l'amour L'Amour ways to 24 hour race and he didn't race in America which was I think was a 12 hour race and they came second with a broken foot he did it you know and he was just he's kind of a force of nature but he would also do crazy things I mean really crazy things which is just not we died fairly young 250 he died answer he was singing and drinking yeah I don't know what it was how do you mean and we still don't know why people get cancer my mom died when I when I when I was six and she was a nurse and never smoked and she died of bowel cancer I mean what Jesus what is that yeah nothing makes sense if you weigh and unless you put in random into the world that's my theory of the universe it's a good theory yeah if you were trand away and it makes sense after thirteen point five billion years we've had about 300 years since the Enlightenment and I just think we're lucky enough to be here we've had five great extinctions and we could have a sixth or we could look after ourselves and treat other people as you'd like to be treated yourself that great rule do unto others as you'd have done to you and that if we did if we all did that tomorrow the world would all work yeah how do we do that how do we get that going well it's better than it was yes it's better than it was even though it seems kind of hellish if anyone's pissed off with politics at the moment track yourself back if you don't look at politics um any time back in history it's always been hell it's always been rubbish it's always freaking all over the place yeah and I think transparency as opposed to opacity if that's the word you know the more transparent things are the more you can check hey that guy's lying about that yeah you can work out what's the line what's not a lie I don't know if we could have lice detect it on all the time do we I think it's gonna be mine reading mine really well I really think that we're gonna have technology within the next 50 years that allows people to definitively understand whether or not someone's being honest that would it would make it and I'm sure someone could get a bad side of that but it's showing up front you think there's a lot of good stuff on that yeah someone could say this is gonna happen though I want this to happen a lot of people's scams are gonna fall for these schemes yeah a Ponzi schemes a pyramid schemes yeah a lot of that it's gonna fall apart why the coal Ponzi schemes was a Canasta Ponzi yeah I think so I think you can there's like a there's a bunch of those little terms like Fugazi Jeff Ponzi I think the gay Z is one that people use for fake it was there was a limousine company that was writing bad checks Fugazi limousine service and it became like a thing on the East Coast where this guy's he's a Fugazi cop that means you're a fake cop yeah Wow yeah Fugazi became a big word Charles Ponzi there's a Ponzi leave that dirtbag look at them happy funny he's about to leap over his own walking Roaring Twenties just rapping people of do we tell people as you're listening please look up Charles Ponzi um yeah the pedia and yeah so - and how did he died he explode hopefully get hit by a meteor so you are running for something now what are you doing I'm gonna go I've said that for nine years quite consistently I would like to say that I was going to run in 2020 we had set terms in our politics like you always had you've had a four year we arranged into a five year but then we've gone back to the old system which is where the Prime Minister the country can choose when they have an election and it can be anywhere up to a day you know the next day after the election or up to five years later so we have no idea so yeah Prime Minister can decide you know what we'll have another election yeah in two weeks yeah and they wouldn't do that for them but you know like we had a general action of 15 2015 and then 2017 having been in for only two years Theresa May was persuaded that if you'd go for election now you're gonna win big you can win tons of extra seats and then we'll be able to do whatever we want but in fact they lost seats my lecture so you know sometimes they grab it sometimes you go in there fourth is it there's a traditional thing of going in the fourth year because if you've got all the economics going everything's pretty good okay let's go now we've got 48 but a year to spare but let's go in the fourth year and we can because we know we're in a good place and then you have to allow ethics six weeks for election campaigning them but yeah let's we do that I think other countries do that but in short our America you go that's crazy for anything that's what we've been doing for some time what are you gonna run for Member of Parliament for some constituency hopefully in England would be my think as opposed to you know the kingdom cuz there's Wales and Scotland is this a step are you gonna move further along the line are you gonna eventually that would be what Stamford MP then I would Glen the jacks I don't if you know Glenda Jackson she did this well all this swath like you know and because he went away and then came back to the creative work that he was doing to doing films but he went away for seven years so I will go away for a period of time and put my career into hibernation and just do politics just to produce but you have a set period of time where you gonna do this and then afterwards you gonna retire no I I would do it no set period of time I just gotta go off and for as long as I can as far as again and then I come back when I choose to coast and up no nothing during that time you could do stand-up if you're raising money for charity if I'm raising money for the Labor Party or my party I think that would be allowable I think my constituency members wouldn't mind that I was raising money for constituency but if I was just doing it for myself less well you can like books you'd like to write books in the Articles it's all a bit hazy but not sure if you have the same system isn't it we have a similar system yeah my friend Doug Stanhope was running for president briefly kind of as a lark and realized that he really couldn't do stand-up because if he did stand-up he would have to allow equal time for everyone else who wanted to perform who also had something like his stand-up performances were then thought of as political campaign writing performances something along those lines it was like some weird bullshit that he was gonna have to navigate that he decided to just back out of it yeah but he was bullshitting the entire time yeah I was just doing for fun now I'm gonna do it I never go in I think a lot of moderate people don't go I could always have a radical mother I do radical things with a moderate message and already done a number of things like that in my life so I'm just gonna take that in and once your goal my goal is to try and encourage my country in the world to go in a positive direction I think I've been saying this politically that I think this is our last century on earth or it's our first century I think next 80 years is for everything we're going to choose everything here we're either going to wipe ourselves off the planet or we're going to make it a fair world for 7.5 billion people where you have a right to have a fair world enough democracy and transparency enough money to live a life to have a family not everyone not billions of people living on one dollar a day or two today so I think we need to get to there because then immigration raises its head your country my country every country in the world and that's all people moving around because they haven't got enough money to live on or they have enough security because there's a war civil war and if we could get beyond that and a lot of those problems drop away so but and going into politics and talking about a global vision of the future and whatever it is slightly it's very difficult thing to do because people gonna say oh you've just asked for that how is that helping this this global vision but I just thought we seem to be trying 1930s politics again and in political areas so I thought well I'm gonna I'm gonna look for a vision a positive vision of the future and I know when I came out as transgender in 85 there was no way I could imagine anything I didn't know where I was gonna go I just thought I could need to go out there need to argue or just discuss at least try and set up a positive image version you know cuz you not sure what age you are but I think you know 51 if everyone so you know I'm 57 so remember in the earlier years of our lives it was just so out there transgender you didn't talk about it well gay and lesbian people out with transgender it was like some crazy out there place what the hell are you on about and that's what was what I came in the middle of that yeah it wasn't it wasn't an easy thing but I just thought I'm if I'm not gonna do Special Forces I'll do this civilian that is a hilarious group of choices Special Forces or transgender well I did the the civilian Special Forces but the NFI on the streets and argue people and yeah and be and it's all mental isn't it right if you're if you're in a isn't anyway the same because people are shooting bullets Union people are dying and getting blown up so I know there's a massive difference there but everything in the end is psychological and if I wasn't gonna do that I'm just gonna try and do this and I would take risks in these areas of of you know I'll go out and people say things in street or whatever they do and do that and then I'll run the math and stuff so you were just talking about knowing that you might have to be in an altercation yeah I was sure that was gonna happen teenagers are poison screaming yeah their little assholes teenage boys this get shit on me my friend Eric said it's my friend Eric crisp he said it to me once he's like you know because he was dealing with some teenage boys in his hometown and he was like the teenage boys are the most fuckin dangerous animals on the planet because they have all this testosterone no one's really giving him any guidance yet they're sort of just out there wild and they're trying to outdo each other one-up each other yeah you know and and then they're they're cruel they're cruel and they also are insecure and so one of the ways to combat that insecurity is to try to make someone else feel like shit it's like it's some weird natural instinct that people have well that it that is that's what gossipy hatred gossip is mild hatred and gossip when you say so and so they're less that you lower their stamp you lower their respect or their their value or whatever by saying something or you could do it as an action and in doing so you raise your own yes I say at least we're not them they are shithead sure less than us and that is a that is Gaughan's it's the dawn of time unfortunately well that's what you see the social currency of today's like shame climate like shaming people for this or that or attacking people for whatever various thing they're doing trying to get public shame against people especially people that haven't really done anything wrong what they're doing is they're trying to do that to elevate themselves and they see someone in the public eye I see someone who's famous or rich and they're saying that person's a fucking loser and they're that you know a sports figures in perfect example you know like some super athlete and they drop a ball you fucking loser you know and they're they're doing this to sort of maximize this sort of this like this downfall this if they see anything that's going wrong with that person's life and if they can accentuate that and pump it up it's somehow or another they think it elevates them it actually does the opposite it's terrible for them it's terrible for everybody but they have this natural instinct this competitive instinct to push down the person they think is elevated to high well I think that leads it to the trolling thing online that if you hear from behind a firewall of no one knows who I am and and and I remember there was somebody we have bank notes like your bank notes they had a woman on the back of one of our bank notes the Queen's Fair pictures on the front and then they changed it up every few years and they they took the woman who was on the back of it I think is a 10-pound there was something they took her off and they changed it and then there was a campaign we need to get a woman a woman on the back of another different note it's not gonna be that and two people trolled this I think - and saying you should die should be raped and I mean hellish stuff one of them said that'll be a woman who was actually attacking another bomb that you think what's going on in your head where's that coming from but behind this firewall you can yeah you can go to any places well so it's almost like they don't think that a person that they're attacking online is an actual person they're not getting the social cues from them they're not looking them in their eye yeah I just think it's a piss-poor way to communicate with people I don't I don't do any communicating with people online I don't go back and forth with people and Twitter or the back-and-forth I don't I don't comment on things I don't anything I talked so fucking much as it is doing this oh my god no I mean if you don't know how I feel about things Jesus Christ if you listen to this goddamn podcast that's me okay I don't need to comment on other shed I definitely don't you comment in text form back and forth with the person and try to explain myself it's not there's no benefit in it I said when I was doing stand-up in the clubs and people might shout out fuck all of you oh so you know from the front I know you're drunk you're an idiot whatever I don't care and I would not think that person really knows what they're talking about so I wouldn't go into a thing I would try and destroy them with you know you know put you know my stuff yeah but that's what's happening online if someone's coming to you and I used to not worry about it before and suddenly I was worried about I thought now actually I'm I'm not worried it's just literally like thousands and millions of hecklers yeah it's really what it is it's a heckling thing somebody the last what I did was something I said something and someone said Eddie is a fuck you and I wrote back no fuck you very witty response that's like five-year-olds as they say yeah you're a loser yes exactly yeah you he was the loser disconnect so stupid you never really feel good about it even if you get a real good zinger on somebody just like what am I doing with my life yeah there was a yeah my dad's bigger than you at that but you see that's what was going on and my dad wasn't terribly tall so I could never use what did it matter - BAE yeah and does that really work for him no he keeps bumping into doorways when he goes it's much too tall right there and so you're you guys are dealing with brexit right yeah we've got a house that changed the climate of England well it's made it's made of a toxic very what's happening over here you know it's all gone polarized like with the build the wall stuff yeah yeah and it's it's one side of the other than there's no one in the middle mm-hmm in a way if if you look at secession and American civil war that was bound to happen at some time if you go back to the Constitution 1777 that was worse having that and I think once you European Union no one's ever tried from countries that have hundreds of years of history to choose to try and learn to live together work together some shape or form this tricky thing we're trying to do it's the hardest thing politically that's ever been done in the history of the world and I think that's because I'm saying the American model with Native American lands and rolling over manifest destiny it's a different model there's a different way of things happen to different times well yeah a different time and Native Americans didn't have this idea of oh we mark this often when we've registered this land so the idea that people learn to work together is it's tricky at some point someone was going to say I think we'd like to change this or we'd like to move out so this fight was bound to happen and so it's it's very toxic it's I'm not getting to in right at the center it because you could just you know probably like you have on your news broadcast you can listen to people talking hours and hours and hours well what do you think about what do you think of it I mean it doesn't seem to get anyway right so I've worked out what my worldview is this worldview that everyone's gonna have a fair chance in life I know that automation is happening right now so there's going to be a whole load of people who won't be able to get jobs because the unskilled labor force their jobs gonna get automated that's gonna get tricky so the universal wage is probably gotta have to come in the idea universal basic income yeah basically which everyone's gonna have to get it's not gonna be a negative thing it's got to be something okay then you can go off and you can retrain or you can live your life and and then there's artificial intelligence parity by 2050 next 30 years and that's what does that mean we can't even work out what that means I think it's gonna get harder for it gets easier and so I'm gonna just I always play the long game I always do the long game so you know I came out and back in 85 and I just thought well hopefully it'll get better over time and now this we're up in 2019 and it's definitely better than that was but you can go backwards for but I just I'm gonna try and shoot for that and the the everyone have a fair chance in life and as to brexit where that goes with me you know positive negative you know I'm against it so I was just gonna find it I don't need to think about whether I'm against it I just know that I want the younger people are coming online to vote now they're old enough to vote and they 78% of them want to be part of Europe and the older people who are passing away probably 78 percent of them wanted to be it out of you it's a fear thing like yeah immigration fear of well there's a thing you got we have to be brave and curious rather than fearful and suspicious and these are the two ways I think people can go if we're brave enough we can be curious and say hi how are you where are you from and what do you do can we learn for you can you learn from us I think that is the way for Humanity to go forward or you could be fearful and suspicious go what hang on now back off outside I don't want to talk to you I don't want to know about you and that's the fearful and suspicious way and I think well you have to be brave and curious otherwise we're not gonna make it so for us in America what you're essentially dealing with a bunch of different countries that speak a bunch of different languages or as we're dealing with a bunch of different states that speak the same language but it's kind of doesn't make any difference yeah that's interesting so I thought if everyone could get the hang because English has become a like lingua franca for the world hasn't made much difference and America shows you could be completely at loggerheads whether you're saying the same words or not I think if you're not saying the same words it's easier for people to say who are these people we hate them because can't understand a single word they're saying that's easier but yeah it's an easier way to be xenophobic / racist on it and I've always said the xenophobe is just a racist with a xylophone which I got to you so we're in a political situation but it doesn't seem to make the big difference in the end we have enough ways of translating and stuff and you can and most people in most countries now can reach for English if they need to you know like some people I think Putin will always speak in Russian any any leader of a country will probably use their own language first of talk to their own country people first and then they might throw in something in English or in an interview so but we can always tell we can work out from vibe you know where most people are standing is coming in so well I think that we're probably pretty close to some form of viable translation technology like you know Google had these Google earbuds yeah the Google app yeah even the air buds if you go to Google Translate and you hit the microphone on there you can just say hello good afternoon with it and you can if it's on the French but noncombatant French so you should I haven't done it in the field I would like to get out to somewhere out in the station and actually I should test it out I'll make better the Google earbuds I think the idea is that like if you were talking to me in French it would translate it instantaneously to English you know it's probably a beta version of it now or like a clunky version of it but ultimately we're going to have something that allows you to do that there's also google lens you could I use that when I was traveling or you could take the the camera and you look at it and it translates yeah I've done languages too that's on Google Translate amazing so the Google Translate verbal one at the moment does line by line so you have to say a line Steve a line yeah I mean just think about what technologies existed 20 years ago and how more much more advanced they are now and then add that to translation and that exponential increase it's probably gonna we're probably going to lose a lot of these barriers of misunderstanding it is interesting I do think we have created some amazing positive things going forward and we tend to bank them and then we don't get a hit off wow we've got that man yeah like we can make coffee quite easily the grinder but then we just go ok and then we'll find something else to piss us off right so trying to keep ourselves happy because when we're happy enough it's usually economics when people are happy enough there's less racism less vegetables there's less everything's less yeah so whatever one's runs out of money they get pissed off I'm totally understandably but we need to make the economy of the world work and then it would be an easier place but what how do we do that how do you make the economy of the world yeah no yes that's an easy line to say and it's very difficult to work it out but I do think as you gradually learn to live together as we gradually come together I mean it's like in the European unity in America if certain parts of America or European Union having a tough time then money goes to this place is having a tough time to try and get them back on their feet so that they can come back in and start making enough money to be able to help other parts and that's that's the idea and that's a logically a model that should be able to work in the world as we as we head towards it because you know we know that wars are terribly expensive and a lot of people die there doesn't seem to get anywhere surely we should have learned this as we go back so conquer wars of conquest I don't think they gonna happen anymore quite like you know the idea we're gonna invade this thing like the old Lebanon stuff yes which I think that now it sees did the last version of that four hours of conquest and now being replaced by wars of Defense Wars of Defense or wars that are hidden behind things you know under some other Hospital tents yes you know we need to we've come in to defend these people but they didn't need defense oh yeah what was Grenadier man is instilled at what good Reagan was doing Crenn eighties we gotta go yelled attempts to controlled natural resources yeah well I think that's what a lot of these are yeah and you know and that is economic wars are supposed to and then stopping terrorism in his tracks and trying to keep these radical terrorists from taking over certain countries and strongholds but we really haven't done a good job of that when there's no political will you need to do that then people in their countries understandably don't like people dying abroad and then you know was a defense do they I wonder whether that's kind of happening that you know the Cystic all right to defend the idea that the countries that are better set up should be able to go in or should be willing to go in and defend people are having a really tough time and try to get the politics to work on that you know if someone is menacing this year when Hitler was menacing within his own country no one did anything like when Stalin was menacing in his own country no one it was about 30 million dive in the snow but no one went in now I said hey we got a you know whistle blowing time to go in and help youjust we didn't go in well we don't even go in for North Korea I mean we're in this weird position with North Korea we have this military dictator who's clearly oppressing his entire nation and this was strange to see in 2019 the limited internet I mean they have like an intranet they have like their own version of the Internet where they have a few websites you could visit yeah we've got everybody locked down and extreme poverty extreme hunger like the the ones that have escaped from North Korea I mean if they've had these soldiers and they're malnourished they have parasites it's it's an awful awful condition right now if you see when North Korea does military maneuvers it looks like the Nazis and you thought well that Nazi thing well you know I don't like the Nazis at all but and how do they get all these people doing that North Korea could do it well hang on this is just a thing if you spend all your time just marching up and down you can make that happen and Leni Riefenstahl can go and film it with low angles and make it look dramatic make it look fearsome mmm yeah that's what we're we're better off globally than we were during World War two right the world is better off the world is better off in the Western world is more progressive and more open-minded since you came out in 1985 versus in 2019 where we're sitting here today yeah so different worlds yeah Iron Man I that's why I'm a glass is two-thirds full I do think we are in a better place but there is more tolerance it does go you know a few steps forward one step back when and always yours gonna have charlottesville Nazi rallies he was gonna have like weird pockets of racism and weird thing you're like I can't fucking believe this is still app yeah you're gonna have a little those setbacks I don't know there was something like in Germany something like 10,000 people were wanting to vote for the Nazi Party or maybe it's more but you know that's a country of 80 million so let's get the perspectives right yeah it's if certain things happen there on television you go war and that's obviously why they do them right to create an outrage get on television there you go wow that's it's all over it's happening everywhere oh well no it's in this small place yeah yeah I mean sometimes well the beautiful things that human beings can do it is stunning we you know we can we so many stories are just amazing things that humans do and then there you put the horrible things that we can do that goes on forever yeah if there was a god I don't believe in a God but if you did come he says what did you guys do who are these bastards and you guys well don't you guys but who are these matter well I don't you know well they've always said the Lord works in mysterious ways so like the world I know that's five mysterious yeah maybe seven inspect I think well bo2 was a test for God because 60 million people died and at some point we think okay how many people need to die before you come and blow whistle whoa what's the guy with moustache doing get him off the board flick him off the board that was my test fit for God and he didn't come so I think it's up to us kids well he didn't come when we mean what they did the Nazis did was obviously horrific but what we did when we dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that's pretty fucking horrific as well no intervention whatsoever from the big guy no no he didn't come in I mean he didn't catch the bomb in midair going Hank there's kids down there just women down there there's disease or not soldier was a city I need to say this and I know I'm not takin the from the the Japanese I thought the Nazis were fanatics but the Japanese at that time took it even more fanatical you know when the last Japanese soldier surrendered you know what year that was it's like nineteen eighty or 75 I think it is because they said money from Google he he was on an Iowa I mean that I mean how fanatical do you need to committed still nineteen seventy five seventy four seventy five says yeah okay I give up they have an amazing warrior culture I mean thing we were talking about martial arts giant percentage including judo and jiu-jitsu of martial-arts came from this one Island I mean right they perfected so many different martial arts and it's more the Japanese than any other country yeah well I mean they I think that ties did it best I think the ties developed the best striking style and then the Japanese developed the best grappling style but the Japanese are known as more warlike that ties you never hear the Thai it what did they used to in the Thais figured out the best way to gamble on fights they figured out the best most brutal style of fight and that is they they incorporated a lot of things that other people didn't with including like leg kicks and knees and elbows and and they fought really often like they would have these like to this day they have lumpini Stadium and all these different stadiums in Bangkok they have the stadium champions and they have matches on a consistent basis and so these people are fighting from the time they're really really young like they're taking like six and seven year old boys and they're in girls as well and they're sending them off to these Thai camps and teaching them how to fight and then having them fight you know they'll have a hundred fights by the time they're 16 Wow yeah just it's with Thailand it's very strange because they're so friendly they're so smiley and friendly yet they had they developed probably the most fearsome striking style on the planet I come and then they've got a transgender think they've got they've lived in in the Venn diagrams of what's going on there that what is intersecting has so much great food I mean they have so much cool shit beautiful environment it's a weird place man Thailand is a weird place I love it did they feel Apocalypse Now there because I think they did was that Vietnam no no I think they did some of it Vietnam no they did nothing nothing it was too it was too close dates wives yeah was it Thailand I bet he took fucking forever make sense Philippines oh no that's right it was Marcos yeah because they because Marcos kept saying you want the aircraft back I want the helicopters back so the helicopters are coming then they piss off so much this isn't funny when amar cause when he that the whole regime went down all we heard about was some elder Marcos shoes yes I remember the whole thing that the Beatles had a bad time there because they were invited to a place that they didn't know about and they all right everybody yeah that's where they lost to it that was the only way the back of a truck they're holding on a tree the back of a truck okay we're not gonna - why are we playing all these places you know that's when they started getting a hold of their we're gonna do what we want to do rather than yeah so I mean I'm with you in that I am ridiculously optimistic that's good I I think that I think people I mean I'm even Pinker's logic of that people sort of look at the the horrible things that we have today and say god this world is terrible though there are definitely terrible aspects but this is without doubt the greatest time ever to be alive that we've ever seen at least in recorded human history I would agree I think communication is a giant part of that it is this is this global world which we thought it's going to be beautiful thing and then business I know it's a hellish thing in fact it's got beautiful aspects and somehow has but yes as any invention has you know like Internet hey you can teach someone how to save their life on on the Internet oh you can also teach people how to make a bomb on you know so yeah I think this is always the way every next step we get we will have some positives then we'll hit the hole the negatives yeah and then we'll go back to some more positive so yeah I've got to be able to miss it yeah well I am an optimistic person like the otherwise it just wouldn't be here but this military aspect that I've mentioned I'm flipping back to that but yeah I do try and I think I need to do this I think that's a good thing to do now I need to do that for ten nine years I've been saying I'm going to politics so I'm going next year but it might not be a general election I try and plan ahead because I can't like if I randomized this I just float because a lot of people do vow this happened and then that happened and then I was and that could and it'd be a wonderful life but I have my River analogy if you're canoeing down a river if you go at the same speed as the river they could throw you onto Rock so you could give you a wonderful ride it could be anything but it's up to the river where as I pedal like crazy sometimes I backpedal like crazy I have actively backpedal against things and sometimes usually I'm pedaling faster than the speed of the river so try and guide myself you see that whenever do these canoeing well anyone driving a boat through a river and when I look at human interactions objectively part of me has to consider that there's a possibility that we need all this negative in order to reinforce the positive that there's some component of human life that desires or or relies upon negative things to reinforce positive things that this yin and yang that we exist under that this this that we see the horrors of war and horrific poverty and all these two terrible things and horrible violence we see this and it actually serves to reinforce our desire for positive things and reinforce and push our society in a more positive direction I mean I almost think that this is when we see national tragedies and shootings and all these different terrible terrible things there's there's all this fear and anger and frustration but there's also action and the action might mean you might think there's a lack of action by politicians or a lack of action by the police or a lack of action by you know whoever we think should be responsible for mitigating these horrible situations that happen but publicly the the the social fabric of the world the way people communicate and interact I think it reinforces our desire to not have that happen it reinforces our understanding of peace and our love of peace and I think that these these bad things that we see in our world there almost propel us towards a better world because human beings are constantly striving for improvement and innovation this is one of the things that we do we want things to be better and bigger and faster and stronger and we want our society to be better at all times we never say this is good let's keep it just the way it is we never we never say that so my thought is that even this even what we're experiencing in this country we're like it seems at times that we're almost like on the brink of civil war between the right and the left and people are lying on both sides and conflating people's opinions and changing people's perspectives in order to sue their own narrative that I think that this ultimately all this angst and you see it from the outside and you look at you know what the fuck are we doing I think it's a natural part of the way human beings figure out life I shall respond to sure yeah I I think I think almost the same as you I would out to get slightly differently I noticed that humanity only sometimes gets going and does things when it's right up against the wall you know sometimes that needs these things to go on if you took a world war two scenario we went right to the wire on that and then suddenly we came back and maybe not even it wasn't even the political will on that it was just actually if the Japanese hadn't bombed Pearl Harbor we wouldn't you guys we wouldn't have had you guys in US with us for all that all the the the forces and the the money and the almonds of the tanks and the Sherman's coming in you know we needed that coming in and without the Russian people we wouldn't have won World War two and that was and they were in this agreement so I can't quite work out humanity I do think positive I do think the negatives you can appreciate the positives more I do think one thing on on the brexit bricks hate thing that's been going on there's a lot of young people are coming on saying well we're gonna lose all this stuff the ability we could travel to Europe without visas we can work there we could retire there we can get a health care there all across Europe that's certainly we cut off and we are roaming charges are gonna go out for that all that people are valuing what what they they could lose a lot more so yeah the yin and yang the you can I think I think it's going to go on this way and also some people once once we get to a good place I've noticed that a lot of people will say okay I'm not gonna be politically active anymore I'm just gonna carry on doing my life and other people couldn't sort of things that I've noticed people will get activated to get to a result may be an election result or something or a referendum or whatever it is and then they'll they will just back off they get frustrated I think if I said well they just think well that's done that's bagged and in a positive way maybe and just say but now I'm not even going to pay attention to what's going on but things will start rolling backwards so I think we're going to keep having it like that maybe the but the percentage of positive things to negative things has never changed over all the years over the last 10,000 years just as more people in the world doing more positive things and doing more negative things maybe humanity hasn't changed got brain sizes haven't changed even back to the cavemen days you know even back the last hundred thousand years the size of our brains is not moved so we if you went back to seven 70,000 years ago we would still be able to have conversations like this even though we wouldn't have the radios and the things would be more on our tribe I think I tribe is better than you're trying to actually Steve I don't know if hard tribe is better than that tribe I just think never there's some good people that driving this shit isn't that true we need to maybe trade with them more we can go to war with them but then we could die love it and surely could die and Kenny and Roger number 22 you know because those conversations were happening in a slightly different way I think all the way back and it way they weren't all just going me fooled you nice good three five-year it wasn't that they was maybe you know millions of years ago but not seven hundred thousand years ago and we only started speaking hundred first years ago so what we've developed since then I'm fascinated by us as human beings because we we were just another animal and now we are we are kind of an amazing animal we've romantic beautiful we landed on the bloody moon you guys landed on the moon which I as a child thought that we landed on the moon but in fact you go further than but they Paulo 11 they kept it quite open I think Michael Collins in the command module said this is for the world and there was this kind of feeling and Neil Armstrong it is it's a nice yeah I grabbed hold of it as a kid I was growing up you know a bit young of me it's a pretty weird thing to think that we went from not being able to talk to space travel in a hundred thousand years yeah I mean that's what they think right they think that people didn't have real language be too genetic I think it's about a hundred thousand years ago that that's when I came down and the first words we said was let's go to the moon hunter says what's your name Jack okay Jack good idea but let's put on the back burner for a moment what do you think happened it turned us into this do you ever stop and think about that well I don't think it's a bloke upstairs floating in the clouds because they used to live in the clouds and then we flew through the clouds and no one ever mentioned hey he's not in the clouds so I it's it's a randomizer think you know I think these like dinosaurs 165 million years of those bastards right and all they did was eat kill eat coal poo and and have sex that's all I did those four things four hundred sixty-five million years we've had three hundred years since the Enlightenment of human rights and democracy and stuff like that if we if we say the great Greeks did a great thing but really its last religious they have five million years of that but why did they come along when we hand all these creatures in the sea and suddenly huge ones something happened something twisted randomizing thing it's I I don't maybe we'll never know but it has happened and I just don't think a bloke did it upstairs with a big belt and now is the time that you speak and now you make handbags and now fight was with the mg42 and now now you know it I just I just think it happened and we need to roll with it and try and make humans work on this planet because then we're gonna be get a mouth soon and you could just say at the future if we got it going on mass that some but the Marshalls could say we want to vote we got our own Martian government you sure you earthlings you know they're gonna treat us the same way the arrogance treat the British yeah and then the Martians come back and attack us the much you could just see that in some sort of you know how did you learn the line or yeah definitely you know I'm I so I I despair about humanity and I and I and I celebrate humanity I do this thing actually which i think is nice I'm gonna say this this is not because I'm obviously I'm doing a tour at the moment here in you us but I'm gonna come out of this us to on the 75th anniversary of d-day and I fly to Colin normally be doing a stand-up tour yeah big it up to the whole of America are you doing any dates in LA yeah I'm at the Dolby Theatre from the 26th to 29th of June okay the Dolby that was the Kodak week I want to come out yes yeah yeah you're from yeah it's all oh no these are common and but i go to i go to normandy 75th anniversary of d-day and i do and they fought the Battle of Normandy in German obviously on one side and then French in English on the other side and so I do three shows jerem fish 50 minutes in German and then I've been 50 minutes in in English than 50 minutes in French and then we have a buffet and everyone hangs out and eat and I meet everyone and we all the German speakers the French or the English speakers yes I heard that you know that is incredible that you're doing stand-up in multiple languages yeah that's how long did it take you to learn that well I did school I did Freddie school for 8 years I did German it's over 2 years so it's but it was partly a sort of low-level political thing I just thought if I'm an English guy going to France doing in French then maybe a French kid go well I'm gonna do in English right and now the Germans doing is the Russians are doing English the Spanish everyone's going in English because you can do a you have a Hollywood career potentially or be on television in English you can also tour the world in English now you can use it as a as a bridging language we were talking about Google Translate I know French kids French kid my friend yes scene bellows has performed in Helsinki in Finland and finished kids have been watching in the second language they've been watching in English and listening in English and he's been performing a French guy performing in English oh they met and laughed in the second language which i think is amazing thing but now you could tour the world that way hmm so this is the laddie lied so I'm gonna get a Normandy and it's a commemoration of that the battle happened in 75 years again it's a celebration that now we don't go to war in those three languages anymore and you have different 50 minutes for French different 50 exactly the same ideas but the words are all of the either German French I'll give you an example I had I said Caesar I've told about Julius Caesar sit Caesar to the everything that one day he would end up as a salad okay oh this warlike guy and a French Caesar escolares jammy imaginated he one day imagine can enjoy each fini array on salad one day he would finish up with the salad in German says I had a Jaeger dak did he ever think that's an mal that he one time I was a lot and inverter as a salad and up would have so you got the verb right at the end but they still laugh at the same place but maybe about half second later split second later salad salad and that would have so you have to really have a deep understanding of how to structure those sentences it's just practice really you know anything in life you could do it if you were taken out of here you speak you don't speak anything so if they and and suddenly for some reason you were had to be in any other cup tile and say say somebody dropped a big block of heroin in do you think just as a test as a social experiment and they fill this all and you say he's smuggling so you have to go to Thai prison this is kind of extreme example anyone and then you'd be learning within one month you'd have basic sentence is going anyone who goes together how sure whether you know if you work in a restaurant you work any way you work with no one's giving you any English coming in you just have to pick up the words and our survival instincts would pick them up and then you might have a strong accent but you'd be we you me everyone we can do that so I just again used the art I can set up this artificial scenario of I have to do this so I had to learn French so I started before I did this show this vundabar shirt was his German table meaning wonderful and I started it in French so I jumped I say improvise to work I don't write anything I just go under hey chick is what's going on with chickens chickens checking with a gun dangerous you don't write your act no I just improvise it and really and I sort of workshop it endlessly until it gets it and then you memorize it well I know it because I said it last time correct so in French I was just going leepu lately put it on dodger no I'm fully Donald Trump still mmm shows you know compared thank you record and listen yeah on every show and never listen to them aha record on your phone I do know and also we have a professional set up server with sometimes not with the laughter mixed in I've just been listening back to the German shows in Berlin and the laughters very low in the mix so I'm saying these jokes okay it's anyone laughing that me oh so it's just from the microphone yeah there's a the feed there but they had another one but they've had it mixed low but yeah you need to have a second microphone on the audience and just bring that mix up right or maybe bring it right out so yeah funny but I just found doing it in another language it's a positive thing it sends out a nice message it's hands across the water can we learn when you can you inform us and the comedies I do is sort of Python ask monty python types surreal comedy and so i just need to find that audience in france that already is in germany that audience in thailand it was there you know I've played Katmandu I met a kid from Katmandu in New York on the street he said they knew comedian I said yeah what are you from i from Katmandu Wow Katmandu a kid from kathmandu what you doing here well I'm doing I'm a student but your English is good yeah it's pretty good yeah well can I do a gig in Katmandu you think yeah I do yeah so I said okay that was in 2010 took me seven years I got there 2017 how was it it was good unfortunately the local at Leicester the locals they've had these couple of earthquakes which see you know you tend to think oh everyone has earthquakes and but no they hadn't had them for ages and something they had to they bear the earthquake so they were getting over that so I was mainly aid workers unfortunately but I was there I can go back but no it was a nice setup but I played you know I went all through and had in Tokyo and I played in Hong Kong and in Shanghai and had all the the guys from because you have the people for the Communist Party come along to check you out so I'm not going specifically you know certain things but anyway you know my stuff is all the people from the comedy what the Communist Party you know the Communist Party yeah you know Shanghai China comedy party no so that comings but yeah sorry just meme angry my word oh so they come and check you out to make sure you not violating anything yes you yeah whatever I don't know I just want to do the cake so but up but it wasn't like I was gonna change I have weird stuff about Gandalf talking to butterflies and and talking about my ancient kings like Henry the eighth and and William the Conqueror and stuff so they probably apparently they stayed they stay they normally disappear after a while but anyway so it's it's good to get out and you know either as you said play the world sees you travel broadens the mind yeah I don't play very many played in Australia in England I've done gigs in Stockholm and Northern Ireland Dublin few other places in Europe but most of the time when I go on vacation I just go on vacation I just go to experience it just to have fun so just to be there um so you have you never written your act down no I couldn't I see I used to do sketch comedy like like a pop multi Piper thing and I wrote those and then I was doing a street full of for four years and that's very unwritten there's no that's very difficult to write so it's difficult to actually develop material for that so did that for four years so I got into this thing of performing like how so what would you do we we were double act initially me and my partner Rob and we did weird things like escaping from a woolly jumper he just returned to ask Willy jumper yes that a woolly cardigan we really pull over you can't pull over okay yeah I guess wetter yes weather yeah so instead of a straitjacket he said we'd take this fully sweat because think it's wet just ridiculous yeah ridiculous making a bowl of cornflakes disappear because yeah so it's best to go this is even say this guys are crazy they plan when they give us five spoons and what it was the words again these people are insane this is awful then we did sword fighting that was good because I directed three musketeers at University and so we were doing showing you how to kill someone when drunk were then when you really do it you know all these different moves so that was quite fun that I went solo and I was doing escapology from chains and ropes and then from a five-foot unicycle from a pair of manacles escapology mean escape ology as the real thing is that what the apology you guys really call it that yeah what do you call all things a name for it never even heard of that I think it Google will tell us Thursday escape artists I know there's a skate bosses eschatology does it exist was his word there's a thing called escapology live escape games world escape rooms and there's a bunch of them I don't know if it's the same thing as escape room no those are escape room yeah yeah yeah well see apology should be a Wiccan art form it sounds like it's not real off is a craft well no Houdini was an artist of that I was a I was a jobbing crafting but escaping from restraint oh yeah there you go steel boxes barrels bag things so I was escaping from ropes and chains and do you made a conscious decision to do this like on the street like this is yeah you're developing yeah that was developing because I couldn't get my sketch comedy thing wasn't going like that there's a thing called the end a festival we have Scotland yeah you know yeah so I did twelve of those in the ends right before I took off so I did three doing sketch and then about four doing Street but on the street you have this freedom when you know the freedom when things are working a bit and and it's really kind of feral no one's checking you out no one knows what you do you're just on the street right so I was useless at this and then I developed a confidence a gut confidence you know that the stomach's really important probably isn't fighting as well there's something that comes out of it there's a confidence center in the stomach really yeah there's something about stuff you look into it with Fighting's you neurons right it's like there's something everything joins there it there's something to do with it anyway I felt I developed this confidence on my own to go and stand on if you ever seen heard the film my fair lady or seen the film Eliza Doolittle that is set on cover gun it's a massive Piazza massive square Washington Square Park in New York was the quote another straight flowing place so it's a big open place and I could stand up there on my own and talk to no one and build up an audience I would set out these tea cozies which a little animal tea cozies ducks and hamsters that with weird things things that just looked like animals and put them on the floor and people thought this guy's crazy and then I'd start talking and they'll be literally no one there sometimes and I'd say good afternoon I'm gonna do a show welcome to the invisible audience very nice to have you here and I had this confidence if I just kept talking of it like you know in your podcast here you know you give talk you go on yeah it has some visible people here as well this is Jack and Kenyon's good and I would just go on and on until I built up about 20 people then I could start the show and then we get into it and if you're doing an escapology show in the end you're gonna get out you've worked out having it out and so there will be a definite end and then you can say now don't go and please can you give me some money so that's how I am my living but it did that's the ninja training of performing because I learned to perform when people didn't even want to see me right now there's normally they've come into a room and Lisa go okay who is this guy don't know but we're in the room so let's drink a beer and watch but if they're on the street they don't have to watch they can just walk off and they often did so it was a tough I have a I lost all my confidence on the street in fact in fact I there's a thing army does this you know break you down build you back up the Marines bring you then build you back up they also in in in drama school they break you down build you back this kind of idea I accidentally broke myself down and built myself back up on the streets of London so wow it's kind of beautiful that's why I was creatively born this new version that had this thing okay we're gonna talk about chickens how many chickens it take to change a light bulb well quite a lot really because you know they can't and unless I had a friend with maybe dog could help them or they could rig up something you know I just stuff and if it didn't hit a punch line I didn't care I just carried on just kept going and then the confidence things he just talks for hours so if you release a special and you've you've released calmly specials before yeah how do you develop new material once that specials been released I will do work in progress shows so which I took from Lily Tomlin who did a lot of work approaches and then she did her show on Broadway I think and I thought because I used to do the old tour and I used to tour Toto until the end we'd film it and I'd begin the next tour with the old tour and just keep improvising in the show mm-hmm because I'd only improvise on stage and I would build up but by the end of the next two it would be a different show but that didn't seem to work for people because they said we want a completely new show so now I do this WIP shows work-in-progress shows and I will go on stage and muck about just talking about chickens or banjos or do you have a structure when you start like say if it's the day after your specials done and now you have to work on a whole new special you're doing a work-in-progress show first do you how do you develop it we start with my life I did it once and I just say okay let's go through my life and so when I was so you may not know I went I was living in Northern Ireland they were born yeah I would go through so I've done this where I went trolled through my life I need some sort of structure otherwise I'm stuck I also found that one side recorded the show like a last tour force-majeure I taught for five years because I just found there were no rules on touring I could just keep going back and I did 45 countries so I could just keep on going and and I found there were certain things I've developed after we'd recorded it that we're interesting and worth keeping so I said okay well that's not in the old show I'm gonna pull that and start off the new show with that little bit which is that little piece of material which is fun about and I was trading on a matter then dog dogs were woofing at me you know how ramparts of house where dog was looking at me and this is in the show now and I suddenly thought for the first time ever because dogs have woof to people oh that yes it's beginning of time I thought what is the dog actually trying to say if the dog had Fox p2 injected into him so he could suddenly talk what would he say to me what is that woof woof well what does that mean and so it goes into he's basically saying assassins I know I'm a dog it's my job get a gun all dogs are very sure you've never heard an uninsured Joe dying in your life when they're barking they're sure they are absolutely sure that it's assassin it's not the postman it's not there's a guy with a hamster outside assassins are here alarm alarm danger Will Robinson why have you never written anything down well I found initially I started running right stand up but I would go I was trying to type it all write it so if you go into a super I'm basically I'm just like sick so I'm slowly supermarket and they're there I just thought I couldn't I couldn't write I seem to be faster if I was just add living it so you got a supermarket this guy there and you know and sure it's fruit you go in this fruit fruit fruit fruit fruit and I found that if I just did it by finding it with the words and there's fruit and some fur and you special squeeze it aren't you and so I just think all the things I could think about fruit so why is it fruit there why not toilet paper you're never going to supermarket and toilet paper there because they'd say well that's a pool shop you know you have to go there's a fresh shop we've got fresh fruit here so we're very fresh okay that's why the fruit fruits right at the front and you've got to squeeze it but how much do you squeeze it and how do you know it's that right pressure to squeeze it and what if it explodes and so I would just keep chatting if it didn't work you just move on and that's how I developed this very conversational star that I have which people say it's supposed to be improvisation it's nice it's just I am I'm always ready to improvise at any point some people if you write a thing you say well that is how that piece goes and it's locked in mm-hmm but if you improvise a thing I've noticed I came up with this thing of molten material when you first create a new idea that's it it's working it's very open in life like Quicksilver like mercury and then you could add another bit another bit another bit and you could have a bit once you put it into a pan it becomes locked down it becomes like a prayer and you can lose the joy of it it becomes a recitation and I thought so don't ever have it locked down keep it open keep it always loose so that every time you say it you're saying it a bit differently and that's the style I've developed and so I can improvise at any point in the show I can just stop it and go what are wars why have we got walls walls other people you know most animals in the world don't have walls but we've got walls and they're that good how is it you know it's raining they don't have walls they're okay I just wonder about wars is it okay don't talk about walls I love every game so if I don't get anything out of it I get jokes on the way out I get laughs on the way out hmm if I don't get in the way in so that's the technique I've developed now when you say dyslexic so if you read something what do you see I read I see it but I get word blindness we read blindness I just see other words long words I I couldn't wrap to my lashes took me a ages to say let alone to spell I just find it I sub vocalize so in my head I'm going almost say that and you know when your kids they actually read it out loud mm-hmm and I'm not reading out loud but I'm saying it in my head and other people that they can do a page you know they do this speed reading and they just you shouldn't shouldn't and they could just take your whole pages and it's stunning I can't I don't understand that either that's that's tricky so my spelling was cat with a case ceiling with an air Spade logical spelling mm-hmm my writing is all over the place bigger letters smaller letters bigger letters and they've tested me and they said I'm severely eighty to a typically dyslexic hmm so I have a huge mental map memory I can hold a lot of things in the memory in my head so that's just sort of a permanent distinction like you just this is just who you are there's no way to fix that it seems so I haven't heard of anyone this coming out of dyslexia saying now I can read much faster now I can do things I just think you're stuck with that but it means you think sideways and I think a lot of creative people are dyslexic hmm I think sideways yeah so you see clouds you see a line in the clouds you see puffs there's a train going through the sky you know it's it's a creative thing juxtaposing things on your wall you have Jackson Polk thing which is they don't lead from one to the other that can be fighting right against it or completely bonkers or ahead of it just looking at here in the room you know and linking things together I think creativity we're trying always trying to throw ourselves by in comedy by something that's weird and opposite and funny Cesar you should you know I'm going for the salad line when I said that sees a deer with a good salad and then people seems to make people offer go uh a Caesar salad and this guy was murdered murdered a million Gaulish people you know and he ends up as a salad it's not cardiac Napoleon gets a cognac or brandy but he's a salad what's that about so um yeah this is my dyslexic tracks Bay I think you get dealt these cards when you're born whatever genetic cars they are and the that the art of life is to play your cards as well as you can in the art of comedy is to relay your life in a humorous way very right and that's your own unique fingerprint yeah as you know if we all have experienced a well I seem like another comedian well talk about your own life and your own perspective it's got to be different to the next person's because no two people are the same is that what you enjoyed the most there what the stand-up yeah no dramatic films I probably enjoy the most because I wanted to do that when I was a kid I discovered that films which existed I broke into Pinewood Studios one of our big studios when I was fifteen broke in yeah like yeah illegally yeah yeah got it yeah well I I was watching a film Battle of Britain and at the end it says filmed on locations in Spain and had a Pinewood Studios Iver Heath Bucks and 70s and they remember we didn't have videos we couldn't freeze things though you have to scribble things down so I was scribbling down stuff off the end of films and I said my mysterious have his back okay what is that bucks okay bucks a shot for Buckinghamshire that's a play Iver Heath must be a town it's a weird name turn city village them to be a village or town so I got a map of the United Kingdom which has alphabetically every town and village and city they're going listed alphabetically and I went all the way down and IRA he's but okay that's where it is so I took a train for my the south coast of England up to London a tube train an underground train that too place called Oxbridge than a bus to this this roundabout and I got off I said there's Pinewood Studios they said it's about half a mile down that road so I marched down the road and I go to the big gabled entrance where all the big stars would come in and I went up and I haven't got this bit worked out so I went up and I said um I'm gonna I'm gonna be in films can I come in please it's what I'm gonna I'm gonna make I got I want to be an actor can I come in just piss off kids now that it's just what and he just told me to piss off and I thought no I've come miles this is big so I thought there must be another way in so I went up and there was another entrance that was near it but it wasn't the main star entrance it was just the kind of more lorry enters the truck entrance the bringing stuff in and I saw people going in and out there was a drawbridge a bit like where Eagles dare the film either there's someone on the gate and some people was showing them passes and stuff and other people just walking in so I thought okay you've gotta had the confidence to walk in so I did the 16 15 16 year old confidence and I've just marched in and something I was through and I was in I was in the poster yeah so then in its people broke in the universal I broke into and the thing he got a career going pretty immediately I didn't get nothing go 15 I know his well as you expect was gonna happen what was your anticipation well anticipation was as I've said in a piece of standard that I because I had to walk at a certain speed if you a certain speed I thought no one's gonna stop you so you can't creep around looking once this because they said what are you doing here you know I just thought in fact it's kind of loose inside studios and no one really knows what everyone else is doing so you can actually creeper head up a bit but I wove ran at certain speed and I sort of March I was marching down streets and up hours and past studios and and I was hoping someone go hey you kids yeah well you're marching around yeah we're doing the film called the marching around kids lead kid is just exploded can you continue much yeah I can march around can you say words I can string a few words together or I leave I marched out we're done here I've watched around for two hours and I March that I have since film twice or three times in Pinewood though and I'm gonna I want to do and when every time I go back and I'm actually filming that guy this is what and I just walk it face slow speeds down streets knowing that anyone could stop me and I go I'm just filming around the corner it's yeah it's um so I love films and I just finished my first film six minutes to midnight that I've co-written and produced in them it's set in just probability of World War two the word I grew up this little seaside town like America has seaside towns well as well from the old days when people used to go to seaside towns before they all went to the hot countries and it's called Excellencies near hastings brighton a south coast appeal and there were 26 schools there for some reason 26 schools it was linked up there was an old Delaware that had set the place up any one of these things new and one of them had young girls german girls who were linked to the Nazi High Command and they were over to learn English and make friends and be ambassadors and because there was obviously fascism in Germany and there were fascism Britain and they were making friends and and that was the idea there was going to be Hitler had this idea of linking out with British and taking everyone on and which some people will in Britain more Fords and obviously a lot of us were against and so it set around this girl school and I was shown the badge the Blazer badges all the girls had a blah blue blazer and I had a badge and it had the name of the school or Gustav Victoria College at Bexhill on C and at the top it has a British flag and then the Nazi swastika next to it and I thought holy cow I've just never seen those two flags right next to each other on the same badge so I thought there's a film in that so we've made a film Wow Judi Dench is in it Jim Broadbent both Oscar winners and myself and when will that be released rolling it out from the end of this year from fall is your autumn fall this year so your love of acting and creating films that's that's your primary even Trump stand up I do love stand up and I could do that whatever that trumped is still word I know isn't it weird yeah it's a weird that must he must love that that word exists that Trump actually means to one-up and better I'm not even gonna go there it's crazy right yeah it also means making tricks you Trump things and you can make tricks oh really yeah I didn't know that yeah we have tricks and cards and she how many tricks have you got that was tricky Dicky Nixon so that's a another person who did one or two lies and untruth yeah down yeah so anyway yes it's I love I do love stand up it well I was never planned to be a stand-up I was gonna be a sketch comedian comedy well I was gonna be an actor then I thought I can't do in my teenage years I had no sexual self confidence the the transgender thing didn't play a part I just I was playing football to soccer up till 13 so I was killed hey am i right about guy kind of fast athletics whatever then I go to a school I'm nothing and there's no girls here and I can't do this in the world body's changing all that and I just lost all my confidence and I just thought I come and I was quite small so at school it was all about tall kids you play the romantic lead small kids you are the slave and the servant so I thought okay forget this I'll do comedy I'll do the comedy cuz I love the comedy yeah and Monty Python I thought okay how do the darling I love you you're made out of cheese I have my knees on fire you know I just make up rubbish and I thought okay that's easier so I did that and it wouldn't take off my career just wouldn't you know left school dropped out of university couldn't get it going and by the time it got going when I was about 30 I thought I'm now gonna hold on to this comedy and start doing drama at the same time so I've run these parallel things and I'm going to be on Broadway the beginning in the next year it was Afraid of Virginia Woolf with Laurie Metcalf oh wow Scott Rudin production so oh interesting house is a movie yeah great movie as I said I'm doing Who's Afraid of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and yeah that's oh that's an amazing production you know I'm performing with Judi Dench in films and a Stephen Frears film Victorian Abdul so I'm getting great drama roles now I've pushed a long time to do that but normally few do comedy they won't let you do drugs he did drama you don't review comedy that's sort of breaking down though right Steve Carell Steve Carell he has he has moved it if he does I'm not sure if he's doing the comedies too much anymore but exactly where Steve Carell is gone John Lithgow also say he was someone who was very dramatic career but then you did federal for the Sun was he beautiful in and he was nominated every year and won two Emmys and no one hit six times just fantastic work yeah I was on Newsradio at the same time I was also over in the same network right yeah yeah his stuff was he's great yeah it's great actor yeah I was stunning you know he played them Churchill in the crown with Churchill a darker side of church other people don't know about which I meant well he's a guy that really has a love of theater a love of performing when he talks about it you could see like this this goosebumps raised and you just you could see is he gets excited yes III get half so you feel that I mean played such a range okay he's playing evil you just think this guy's so evil when he's playing in the character in the the in the federal for the son it's just a beautiful I watched you can't really for somebody who can't I couldn't download it in Britain but I found a place I could find it so I'm on the second I've watched every single episode and now going through the second time so it's just beautiful stuff so when you're you got into stand-up comedy when you first started doing that what is the scene like in England as it was there comedy clubs where you could go to an open mic night wait how do you we were copying you guys I think Lenny Bruce set up the more alternate version because I still think in America it's it's always stayed kind of Main Street but Lenny Bush was definitely doing alternative knows you're a lot of Lenny I love that yeah you know and I played them on stage and that was a wonderful thing where did you play him in well Lenny you know the film was from a stage that Dustin Hoffman a film that was a stage play Dustin Hoffman was fantastic movie he was so close and the guy who plays him in the marvelous mrs. Mazal that's very good as well I know that's fair to say because I'm watching that I'm thinking okay now I've gone through the club's myself but I did mine in the eighties and the nineties that's in this 50s Wow and I sort of take myself there then there's Lenny there and I think he I know Lenny and I play them I used to die oh my god that's me tell you that but I was I was doing the stand-up I see that's why I could die I put that together now that was and I call him the Jesus crisis of comedy because as a Jewish guy he died for us and died for us to give us the freedom of speech yeah he died for freedom of speech because there in the end there Oh heroin - I know but - makes you forget that you shouldn't have played in it - yeah he getting a measure that we could say what we wanted to ask them yeah the missus Mazal thing makes it a little it's a little homogenized like him like in even his struggle it's almost like it's no big deal are you are you in the latest season is yes is it three or two - well three hasn't released yet they're filming it right now both of them it's really good yeah it's it's not accurate like historically it's way off the mark there's no woman who was talking like that back then it wasn't there was no missus Mazal like now I really liked it and it's interesting she yeah like nor McDonald got mad about it he's like yeah there was no woman like that back then I would say that she there's no a there's a quickie but that's the fucking show man the Hulk's not really their guy who becomes the Hulk now enjoy it I really like no matter but I love him yeah I I didn't have was a she was swearing like a like a soldier on stage very quickly very quickly which that was I found don't know how she ramped into that and then she dropped out of it it was that was something was right and then she went to France and I went up so and and did stand up that someone was translating that was weird I have done it in French and I don't think I could've got that I don't know why they that seems just seem to be slightly shouting it's not jumping a shot going up the shark swimming around it was artistic interpretation it wasn't realistic but it was still it was that's a person who makes a living doing stand-up comedy I was willing to let that suspension of disbelief I like the the sexual relationship is always coming back the husband's almost coming back into the frame yeah and his and his fight their kids yeah but now I did watch it i binge watch that's what I'm doing that I just sit down and I just watched everything yeah and then I move but yeah Lenny how do we get them to Lenny we're talking about something else but anyway you know it's great it was great playing Lenny but oh yes I was doing the stand-ups and I was just told by director Peter Hall I'll leave the stand up to you so I had no direction on it so I just did it as close as I could to how Lenny would have done it mm-hmm did you listen to a lot of recordings I did that it's very difficult for British kids oh maybe even math and kids of today - no because he's doing a lot of hipster refugees a lot of you know the Sophie Tucker references and there's a there's a lawrence welk is it the welch well yeah we don't know those guys so what he was doing is cause there's Sophie tuck and they're going I could look up so I had to look up the some of the punch lines or that number the references because you without the references you can't get it this is a trick I do in universal humor that I take either huge references or explain my references so that you know Caesar everyone probably knows about Caesar and if they don't well I yeah anyway well as good as Lenny was it's really hard for people to listen in that comedy today it doesn't necessarily trance it doesn't transfer well you talk about Nixon and you know Nixon is notice this is a Vice President Nixon this yes haizen house Nixon yeah thing so he I worked out that all my stuff is non dateable is null I don't do any topical stuff I don't do partly political stuff so you should not date I do historical stuff because that never dates you know right Caesar is not gonna come back now Jesus changed his whole thing is much nicer though he's come back from the dead and he's cleaned up his act so I've tried to do that and python did this as well you do stuff it just doesn't really date most of it doesn't date which is a handy thing so the stuff goes yeah much stand-up does and it's also the the outer the the culture so significantly different between the late 50s and 60s where Lenny Bruce was sort of starting out and making his mark versus today it's like the things that were naughty back then the things that he could say that were controversial there were nothing today they're literally an it's a non controversy well there was one that still was was when he said how many people using the N word the s working they just went to all how many the way and I did this I used to do that on stage every night that was still as striking tense yeah yeah but the the sentiment behind it was that these words only have power because I give them forbidden yeah I mean if he could use him again again again and for the gay community they'd taken the word queer they reclaimed that yes so it doesn't have the force anymore and that is a truth he spoke he was a true analysis that he did yeah yeah it was we had some still Joe there was a unfortunately accidentally a friend of mine stole one of his jokes didn't know he actually just thought of the same premise yeah and he was that the premise was that uh homosexuality in some place is illegal and what do they do if they catch you well they lock you up in jail with a bunch of men who wanna have sex with you like and that was Lenny Bruce's line they like dig homosexuality is illegal right so what do they do they put you in jail with a bunch of men will have sex with you you know like that was his whole like and like that still would work today like if there was a place where homosexuality was illegal today and you did that joke it's a good joke it's like setup punchline it's all right there yeah I let me was ahead of it and you know his early stuff was more mainstream yeah ever believe Oh doing way way me same as Carlin you listen to Carlin's really stuffed I've heard of had yes I got it was like like it's like a typical Jack Paar Tonight Show set it was all like really like down the middle squeaky clean and he wore suits and he was a clean-cut you're seeing Carl in the early days I think I've seen once I've yeah I dunno there was one there was high in a suit there was a change well Lenny had a complete change and that thing in the film where he says you'll never play here and what's the area in upstate New York Catskill Catskills you know what I fled the Catskills yeah and I remember when I watched it first I thought oh that's a terrible thing to have but now that I know what that was it was a certain belt of you know how you're gonna think that that's George Carlin Wow play a little bit of this it's crazy for the Merv Griffin Show we never see how the Indians prepare how awful it is that is that sort of style you know he had that I mean that's what you did back then this is the Merv Griffin Show I mean it really didn't have any options that's how you perform yeah yeah otherwise they wouldn't let your own yes she did he change on a dime did he get arrested a bunch of times you know and he became marijuana enthusiasts and you know started it just just the times changed yeah and I think you can only sit back and observe for so long before you start commenting on things and then he shifted and he became and I think he was also experiencing prior like prior of course was I think Lenny Bruce was the original yeah but Pryor was the one who made it insanely personal and he was insanely vulnerable on stage and also he had a point to a lot of the things he was stealing I mean I think if there's a great I don't think there's a greatest stand-up of all time but if there is it might be prior you know that he just he had this perspective that was just wholly individually wholly him it's up ten years later yeah yeah that's the big really does change it and they're happy yeah I mean he was a look at him he's got like a fucking Steve Jobs outfit on now yeah he became he became a you know they hippie hair got longer yeah yeah Richard Pryor I think Richard Pryor is for me he was cited this I had this base of Monty Python which is what I was going to do and then I had Richard Pryor and Billy Connolly Scottish comedian buddy coming those two Billy talks too just so relaxed me swing the large groups of people and well Richard was doing it was the acting out of all the characters thing that was the one of nothing that's what I do agree and the dog says the dog is Duchess come on in hey come on two burglars yeah yeah you shall not leave yeah Dobermans yeah playing these these different voices and characters and what he could do and that was just that was stunning to me yeah he was something special look at him back in 82 that's that's literally him like on the wall back there a mugshot that's the same era could be that could every in that night yeah might have been that night there's some fantastic recordings that I don't know where they are now but they used to be able to buy them I bought them at a truck stop and they were from red foxes comedy club and they were cassette tapes and I I was on ER I was doing a road gig and I think I found them I bought a bunch of them and these recordings were they just said set up a tape recorder and he was doing these random sets at red foxes comedy club and it was a lot of experimenting a lot of ad-libbing a lot of means clearly hi on stage I mean he would get go on stage hi a lot and we just ramble about stuff and they would you would see these bits forming and coming out of that and then some of those bits eventually would be on some of his more famous albums later there's great great stuff just to see this guy who was just so if you go if you go from you know your traditional stand-up comedian from 1960 like you were seeing George Carlin on stage - what Pryor was doing in the 70s this is so different so radically radically different he took it to a different place you're talking about the scene in Britain we're interesting we don't really have much of a film industry we don't have it as quite said you know go see this huge in in America compared to what we have we have a quite a good TV industry so but we tour like crazy so there's lots of tours in 100 CDs 500 to 2,000 see to 2005 2000 series that goes on like endlessly all the time way more than used to before so that and there's there's lots of clubs and they were a lot of them will just run that Bubber pub type clubs so I believe the clubs in America which much more set up there was a bar thing the system people come out do the drinks and and and it was quite a cash outlay had to get this club going and it would be you know most nights of the week we'd have it one night a week it'd just be a function room in a pub that existed for maybe hundreds and hundreds of years because all these pubs used to be taverns drinking and it wasn't used and they said some guy would say hey I'll run a club up here I'll take the door money you take the bar money and that was the deal so a lot of amateurs running it so we had lots of club we had that 60 70 80 clubs in London that you could you could zip around that many yeah it was a ridiculous amount and so for me what the Beatles had with with playing in Germany I had with London and we all had with playing in London you could do four in the night five we're four and a night quite quite easily on the fighters and Saturday you just jump in taxis and sit between different like they do in New York yeah yeah but it was just so many clubs oh wow so it was beautiful I think it's less now but it's there's lots of open mike max now and so many people wanted to get into it you can create there's no top to the career now we're playing you know people are playing an arena I started doing arena tours I'm now doing more theaters on this one my audience has got a bit older but anyway jumping between the two like playing Hollywood Bowl here I you know in in LA that's such a beautiful thing to play and it's the Greeks got it right the left of rolls down the hill yeah played it twice now and it's just gorgeous yeah I've never played there but I've been there for a few times for a few different things I saw Annie there and I saw the what is it oh the nightmare before Halloween yeah you saw Annie the musical yeah they do the musical there they do a version of it and they do the nightmare before Halloween where they play them they play the movie and then they have a symphony and the symphony and anything at me do kind of have kids you need to say that because if I didn't enjoy it alright I'm bored out of my fucking mind no I was that was hi I'm just gonna leave that no sir and he's your chemical it always comes yeah I like everything I like a lot of things that you would think you wouldn't like you know that for the people of LA or people at the world I believe that the Hollywood Bowl is a la Park so you can actually go up there and have your sandwiches and yeah um you want yeah she's a beautiful thing I'd do that I can't drive up there cuz it looks like don't come in here there's berries and stuff but no you can pack up and go in it's a park it's still a park I love that space it's just good and I knew that Monty Python I played there so I thought I gotta play well it's beautiful too because it's all outdoors and you know la has such amazing weather and you look around you see the houses in the distance it's like this it's a special little spot it's beautiful yeah I don't Dave Chappelle's done some gigs there I think Chris Rock did a gig there that's a must be a fun place to perform too yeah it's just it works that amphitheater thing I think it was the Greek I came out democracy and amphitheaters and yeah do you still go to clubs at all I don't so much I was reading the definitive thing on Robin Williams and you know how he would jump into clubs and do stuff and go am i I doesn't that doesn't really work for my stuff I tend to get a small I can differ club like for the work-in-progress shows I was doing I was taking I was they they have the Al Murray Club in in Islington no angel in London sorta north/northeast lemma and they had you know show going on at six one at seven eight you know and I would take an hour of that and just do that again again again so I'll take an hour and I'll go out for an hour and workshop the show and mm-hm as opposed to coming on doing 15 minutes on a off the top my head cuz I find that if I find completely going scattergun just trying to find funny that doesn't really help me I need to keep crafting the stuff cuz I'm like yeah sure yeah and I also don't need if it's a if it's just if it's a comedy club they want it faster they want a quicker when it's someone you know and I'm not looking to hit the gags I'm just looking to find things and have the space to stop and go what is it about cheese right right why is it got to easiness you know I just want to Waffle around until I go okay that that's a good but I'll keep that pit right do you ever feel like like when you're doing that like Jesus Christ I got to get off this fucking subject like there's nothing there well yeah I do that but then I do this thing I write on my left hand like it's a note to self when I go if I do Pig father talking about pigs or something right they never talk about pig farming yeah you guys all pig farmers never talk about cheese again cheese jokes do not work especially in North East London you can you just get it try and get lost on the way out yeah career is over cheese's taking over my fuck my life but do you do some gigs in your girl mode and some boy my boy mode or I can I can I can do whatever mode I want now is it complete Human Torch thing I can flavor flavor so I can wear a dress or I can wear trousers and it doesn't matter and they don't give a monkey's either that's interesting it's now well they're your friends yeah yeah yes yes that coming yes so but I think they get it disappointed if you dress as a man to see girl mode there um they I don't know I don't care I shouldn't care yeah I can't be on stage great I wonder if because that's nothing to do with the comedy yeah yes yeah and I do think some people thought it was you know he's going to talk about lipstick for two hours so anyways gross it at all do you dress if I do drag diagonally I will do it diagonally diagonally yeah so it's never the front part of the the thing I will just say I just it would not be the front of the subject I might point it in passing so the front I'll talk about ancient kings stuff with banjos dogs with fighting cats anything like that and then I and then I might mention it just in passing as opposed to let me tell you about being transgender I just don't do that I talked about for the fights I talk about the fight I had which is in the street and that this guy was saying this and I said this and so we took that I've built the fight into a huge thing if we stand off stuff so I just I could make that into into something but no it's not because it's supposed to be the background of what I'm doing the essential thing if you like surreal comedy off-the-wall comedy that's what I do and I just happened to be transgender which makes no odds in these days do you find that more today than ever people are asking you questions about transgender issues because they're they're at the forefront no less actually less yeah less there was a point at least he was a spokesperson it was on and they would yes and well if not spokesperson I was someone who was gonna talk about it this right tell us all about this and I'd do an interview and if it was an hour interview about 40 minutes would be on that and then and then when they came to write it I thought I'm just writing all about this all right let's put that back a bit and then it used to balance it out when they wrote the interview out but would you rather that they just accept it and just not Brian and I'm fine with it now I after the marathon's it all changed yeah yeah because they said oh so because I used to say action transvestite an executive transvestite there was I was in the or as plain New Yorker they said article a guy was found living in one of the caves in the park in in New York and he fans I have a lot of women's shoes in there so he's probably a transversal and I went okay well that's weirdo transvestite I'm not living in a cave I'm traveling business class on the plains this is executive transmitted so I came up with that one then the action transvestite was just kind of a fun because I was more kind of Boise about things that I'll give people grief in the streets if they give me grief and then after the marathon's it came it became a different thing and everyone just went oh hey I've had some you know a member of guy this was a very interesting altercation because hardly any words in it so i'm i live near Victoria coach station in London most of the time whatever around and I was walking down there and then anyways a coach station some people are traveling all over the Europe from there and I walked up and I was in girl mode this guy looked at me he said hey is that you you you run all those marathons and you wear all that clobber and then he went oh and he was just like he was carrying me a pass he was going well okay okay very have to yeah well I that's what what my I mean I didn't have a negative opinion of you I had a positive opinion of you but my positive opinion of you elevated once I saw you did those marathons like that's a person with an iron will that's a different kind of person like you it was so huge what you did that everyone had to respect it like they knew they couldn't do it or if they could do it they haven't you know with that backpack should yes I have accomplished something pretty spectacular it was beautiful and it and I did about five things at once and it was raising money yes so I've like I've raised about four and a half million pounds when I was six million seven million dollars so that feels great yeah and that's with their help because the organization's good at raising the money and it gave me this this this confidence this health thing back from when I was a kid I used to be a lot of us were run around how old were you when you did that first one that was I was 47 so you're 47 and just decided yeah I'm off it was it was training I wanted to do something it's an adventure as well and you know I think you have to live life is an adventure otherwise life is too hard but if you look as eventually it means the highs and lows built into it and I got this this health kick out of it it was just a number that and then I could meet people I remember on the first math and I met three Army sergeants who were and they said we've heard you're doing this this one's British Army and I was just having somebody we halfway through my about my 10th marathon he said well hope we heard you're doing this and well but and they were chattin to me and you know because I know forces and I buy all of that mentality I'm very happy to chat and so they I thought well this is an interesting respect thing and they said we're trainers we train we work out the training regimes for the army and so we were very interested in what you're doing what you seem to be able to do so they just found it fascinating and I found that fascinating I could suddenly talk to service people are in a certain way a sports people in a certain way everything just shifted you know and and people from death different ethnic groups some people have weighed down on some ethic RZA's down on being transgender whatever but if you dig that then it says okay we put these two together and you're in a different place so it has completely changed the way a lot of people react to me yeah I can only imagine they don't necessarily comedy but that's fine because they respect to you yeah it's just certain different thing yeah happen and and you and I'd like to chat to people I found that chatting is very important because if you see someone in there's a blog than wearing makeup whatever you get lipstick and you go oh but if you say hi nice weather today and they go oh yes and then you're on a different footing and so trying to put you into a place of normalcy yeah well I'm trying to put myself yeah they will they will allow me indicating you normal it is the talking is the most important thing just chatting away and being boring I have a natural boringness I think maybe everyone has a little boring this I think the really interesting people probably just blow up it when in their 20s and stuff and because they just do stuff that's too far out yeah but most of us are pretty boring and then we add layers of interestingness on tops to to to reach that level of okay I think I'm quite interesting there I think I've got enough interesting going on but my boringness in in chatting I am chairing talk about weather or wood or walls or you know trees or so that introduces the normalcy yes they're boring well I won't say I won't say we've got to do something extreme now I'll just is that about yeah normal thing yeah where'd you get that jacket that's quite a good jacket on you well my company I you know just just talk about things and be human be a human being is the biggest controversy in America in terms of transgender people probably the biggest room one of the biggest is competing in sports with biological women that's the biggest one yes if you asking me for answers on that I haven't really got them I know yeah I've got good one for for washrooms as your cousin Larry's urinals as you can we call them the Rhinos mhm just check them all out and everyone just it's all cubicles and we already do that in restaurants we already share stuff the toilets we did in aeroplanes we have no bother if you just remove urinals at in theatres and places that won't be queuing often the women are queuing forever and the men are not queuing this way everyone shares everyone behaves our own responsibility I've heard of it working in a school as well there's less bullying in the lose so it's there they just check go it's regression of Technology I think it says get that your own check it out the window everyone is a cubicle just go to the loo and then use the mirrors and and then go away it's everything being for both genders yeah you just make it all even then we get outside a lot of problems some people will have pushback on that and have other reasons why they didn't like it but we don't want to be in a washroom with men though were they already are going into if they're sharing and they lose in the airplane if they're sharing it in there yeah but it'll airplane is one you know it's a restaurant person to go in there with it I think their their concern is there's you know some men are fucking creeps and some women just want to have a place where they could just be themselves and check their makeup and go to the bathroom and wash and talk amongst others I understand that it's just I've you know if you think about anything that's going to change anything there's usually something that won't remember the only reason to do this is to accommodate people who are transgender in a way that it seems like it doesn't it doesn't put them in a position where they they it can be judged because everyone's doing it it begs well if it stops bullying for in you know in schools then it's it's a number of things in there that it could make easy it just makes a whole whole area of things a lot easier do you think it was like how would it stop bullying though I don't know what it has go I mean I'm just giving you the figures of what I said well they just said that they tried it in the school and the bullying went down she his girls and his boys together it's like boys will bully the boys or girls will believe the girls but if you yeah so you have them all together they don't it seems so now I just punish the creeps which is really what you mean if someone's being a creep in a bathroom the problem is the creep it's not the bathroom right yeah yeah it's um anyway so the this is you know I haven't scientifically proved this with chemicals and whatever but it's an idea that gets to us to a better place and surely we're all someone on the spectrum of something so the idea that that anyone who is expressing themselves in a different way that that is a problem if you take about it just straight me if we all went back to how we used to think that there was just men and women that everyone had straight sex even that sex no one would talk about that people yeah Victorian age and right York with a Victorian agent no one will talk about that that was all horrible dating sex was a procreation was daily yeah whole idea of everything so if you I'm trying to get out to a practical place where people just go to loo and behave like adults even the kids seem to behave more like adults which is interesting that makes that makes sense I see what you're saying yeah me yeah that is the concern right was that we have a system in place and someone tries to change the system then people get upset the retrench and that always happens yeah I mean but also women Duke you forever and men don't queue at all right cube much less but this makes its Mexican queueing even even that outside just behaves like an arrow yeah it's just a toilet the Romans used to have it with open-plan toilets they've seen that we have made it into a problem we have made this a whole psychological problem where the robbers just sit down there and have a poo and have a chat and once they did make it a problem and categorize people by gender then it became this thing and now you don't want to change that well yeah I don't think that yeah they might have had men male/female toys at the moment times but just the fact they were more open about the idea there's bodily functions and just normal and we've you know back in the before we came in and we were just going out into the woods and in the forest and having a pool it was just having a pool and now we feel it's a big problem having a pool we don't like it without rehab but we don't want to admit that we have to pee there's the queen ever have a poop maybe never has the attitude be besides the marathon thing has the attitude culturally shifted in the UK the same way it's shifted in America yes I think the more there's more and more people are out and positive I mean you've basically got to from every group this is ethnic groups is from women this is from anyone that feels slightly out of the loop if you can have a pause and positive role models that go out there that do other things you know just something that's nothing to do with sexuality you very good at cooking you're on television for this intensity television helps you create sports star you're this you're that you want to those things people say well there's a positive role model and they are of a different color or of a different sexuality or they're you know and that just helps everyone adjust their mindset and the younger people come through and they oh that's all they know I know about this person I mean like you know in baseball you see the debate the famous documentary baseball's the Ken Burns yeah the Ken Burns one and that's black people after the Civil War black people were playing baseball and there was some guy was very powerful he said there will be no black people in major leagues at all and it was blocked from about 1890 something like this all the way through to 1950s mmm-hmm so it was actually happening and then it went backwards yeah so there was a positive role mom then well they've been buy everything haven't things can go backwards and things go forwards and I just think you know if we're trying to get to a world where everyone's living there live yeah that's really what we need right just live and let live living as long as you're not interfering with other people's lives you long as you're not doing something that somehow or another fucks with someone else yeah like who cares why would anyone care I mean I think people care because they're unhappy with themselves I think that's the only time people care and let my my issue with this that I've come across was with athletes it's with transgender athletes competing against women particularly in my field in fighting right there's been some there have been at least there was one very vocal case when we're very public case of a transgender athlete who was male for 30 plus years transitioned over for a couple years for two years then started fighting women didn't tell them that she used to be a man right and it became a giant issue and people were outraged and anger the women who got beat up or angry because they got destroyed the two of them did and then she started when she was public about it and started fighting women that were willing and knew you got to say things upfront yeah I came out that longer because I wanted to be upfront about things so yeah and I don't have the the great answers there's a you know I don't have an ounce of everything right but yeah I can see that I think one of the interesting things about it is that there are no real answers that it's one of those things where you just got to go home what do we do here and this is this is what I think one of the more unique things about being a person is that we have this opportunity to look at this unusual circumstance and communicate about it and try to figure it out communication yeah the whole thing I just need one personal thing if I came out if we started talking about it we'd get in a better place than not talking about it and just saying it's a negative when you came out to give you a feeling of relief unbelievable I mean you know scary you know because you got the secret and the secret is is I did self analysis I lay on a bed and said why am I thinking this way what is going on why do I get what are the thoughts like what what because men yeah so I here's the clearest where I can show it there was a woman on television she said my daughter she was 12 and she was upstairs she was wearing my makeup but she's wearing my heels and I told her to get that stuff off what are you doing she said to her daughter mmm it was 12 and that was from an age point of view right I just thought well that's what I'd be doing at 12th that's what I was doing my stepmothers clothes and stuff so I thought well hang on I'm having the exactly same desire to express myself in that way so I just wanted to express myself in that way and I was told like my society you're not allowed to and I just thought well you know some people are allowed to and I'm no I've decided I gave myself permission I said I'm allowed to and it's not hurting anyone else and I was stealing the makeup and after that I started buying the record cuz the police got me II got caught stealing me yeah and I go back into the shelf index and I say out by this lipstick thank you very much oh boy they say yeah it's him again with a plenty lipstick so yeah it's it's you just had this desire to express yourself yeah yeah just like some women do and some we've been doing something I don't know any makeup my payment yeah yeah and if I had a if I look very female then I would I would might wear different things or express herself in a different way but I'm I look kind of more boyish more male ish so I I have you know I choose set and close that and look and I did that way and then um and quite a lot of people are sort of going okay fair play that seems okay and you're looking fairly well put together that's what I get so when you finally came out the relief though yeah just you could just be yourself yeah just and you did and you don't tend to look terribly when you first come out you go well that doesn't work with that lit you why was I wearing that's correct but you've never had that teenage girl chance to be around exact and have your peer group say you're not wearing that are you because that's okay so then I gradually led to okay how does make it work okay that's how it works so you gradually get better at things don't buy that that color doesn't work oh it can work but if you know so but the relief is huge because you've no longer got this hellish secret yeah and then you can begin the dialogue I hadn't didn't really have a dialogue with anyone that point but on stage I could sing good I have friends that are in the closet and they don't know what to do and they in even comedian friends that they don't talk about it they hide it and I'm like God if you just let it go I mean people in this day and age the people that will accept you that's the people you want anyway the people that don't accept you you don't want them like that's their own problem it's this live-and-let-live thing the people that don't want you to be who you actually are to fit their own narrative in their own head like that's those people the crazy ones it's not you yeah it's really obvious they're a gay people it's really obvious they're a transgender people it's really obvious they're not no one's just making this down back through history as well that's forever and also I think I try I say quite often you know this is a genetic thing because I don't I didn't feel like God uh you know when I was 23 and a half I said I think I've all become all transgender now ya know it was I was four or five when I first knew and it has not moved those those thoughts that's interesting so it I think it is for most gay lesbian people have talked to I just think it's locked in its built-in it's something you get given these cards as I say and we're trying to be upfront and be positive and Express oh well it only makes sense when you look at the other variabilities the the other variables when it comes to people's personality their body shape their mentality their their ambition all these different variables it only makes sense that there's feminine and masculine variables and that these shift back and forth with certain people and that certain people just like there is some where and like where you are well you have boy mode and grill mode tonight I would imagine that you talking about it so openly and then that you're that you're just so free with it that there's probably people out there that are listening to this they're like god damn it that's me well you know say I'm the young the youngest young people around the world I have met people who are they're talking about it in school actually when I came back from South Africa my co-writer kelan Jones his he said can you go in and my daughter's in class and they've been talking about your runs in South Africa so I went in and they could talk about racism because I was running a salute to Mandela 27 masu 27 years yet spend in prison I said I could all about racism but they could also talk about being trans strategy and their or self identifying and LGBT stuff because there was some kid in this in the class who was already identifying what did I identify as a girl and so they were being positive and these kids were eight I think you know so it's it's way different to our childhood our child was it was just do not talk about do you know actually and if you mention it you're gonna get your head kicked in by your peer group so and I was all that's why I never mentioned it at school especially you know I fancied girls so I could just go in that route and did you run into girls that had an issue with it people that I know less of but if you talk about relationships it gets really tricky because yeah it reflects upon people's relationships with yourself so but it's it's cool and I've never been great at relationships that's always tricky so well you know if you've got this career thing and I worked out how I could work that and I can just keep staying four steps ahead of the game and I'm playing in all these countries know what I'm doing the four languages that dinner so I've got all that going but then then had you you never really in one place to be able to continue a relationship and then there's the being transsexual and that goes on so that all gets complicated you can't be getting everything working no so but I'm okay with that it's all good and and I enjoy things I've stayed I try to make myself laugh this isn't comedy this is my huh okay I actually just try and add labeled I go oh that's funny so I'm going off or this this weird trip I gotta tell you this but this is in later show in front of her but I talk about j.r.r tolkien I talk about the imagination we have written all these stories and animals haven't done that all the wild Amazon seem to have written any stories haven't heard of any good ones but we've written that jr. are talking and I say JR talking hey how are our talking was born J RRR RRR RRR talking you may not know this and people also get is this true and it is born in bloom bloom Fontaine South Africa you know so he's going on there and then they moved to Birmingham in England and it's a different axis of basicity ever getting smarter and then berry booming his talk that was we've got this kind of sound like this and then I said well he's five he turns to his mother because he realizes he's called Jay RRR RRR RRR talking and he says and his bird it is South African Birmingham twang and it goes both of both of all calls for those do this strangulated accent that is trying to fight between South Africa and Berlin and it's such a stupid lion to go on you know there's no logic to where I'm going and it smells great what are you saying jrrr icons are standing and because she's still in South Africa and he's good he says you so I'm spending time going into the sidebar which is making me laugh I think a lot of the others what is he Wittering about and you can't really even hear what I'm saying but I just did this strangulated accent and in the end he has to talk in a Yorkshire accent to get his mother to understand if he could cut down the number of hours in his name it becomes JRR talking so that's that's typical for my stand that where I just go off on a tangent to make yourself laugh and yeah and and it's I think it's sort of funny a little bit fast it's probably more funny for me well if it's funny for you though it's funny for people that are listening what's comedies contagious yeah and if I'm you know the personal stage having a good time then the audience should probably have a better time and this thing of its not being locked down that it's living and breathing in front of them mm-hmm they do love their and and and you put more energy into the next bit when you go this and then that and the other thing yeah so I do love Stella because it's you know you can just do it and do it you know there's no one well I was a double act I was a four-person act and whenever you if you're doubt even just a double act if you go off on a tangent then you have to look across to your partner your partner want to go with it you might not want to go with it get right keep to the script but on your own you could just go off and Lenny Bruce you know the that the gigs he did in front of the band you know that thing in the film department yes and he's trying like the band laughs and this is the people of the raincoats in the front and the strippers coming on and because when we did the play Lenny we had a live actual jazz band on the stage a real good jazz musician as hi so I was trying to make them laugh and just the way that learning it I would try to crack them out because I would go off script and and if I could do this and that was just beautiful and they said you're riffing aren't you you're just riffing like we were riffing I thought well this is weird this is it was really nice to cruise down his life and do stand-up as close as as close to him as I could even the mainstream I did them in more mainstream stuff and then then then what you know the really edgy stuff and the weird stuff in the way where Jesus comes at the back and you've got some some Pat's Cathedral that whole sequence where he's got colour pop collar pokes Jesus is here and yeah that was fun yeah I got very ill doing it how well you started off dead naked and then you've got you put your clothes on and you're talking you start going backwards oh so the play starts off dead yeah you start off dead by so when he killed himself in the bathroom yeah yeah and then as you start and you're talking to either God or I think I'm talking to a judge who was a bit like a God at the beginning of it and explaining things and as I'm putting my clothes on so you start off naked then you have simulated sex with my wife about a quarter of the way through the film um so that was interested doing that and then you end up dying at the end of the film so it just it took a lot out of me three months of that so emotionally yeah emotionally and Maria you and then you fizzle and I've never been ill - out of a show but they it just took me down I just was not well so you think it was just contemplating his existence his life and what he went through I think I think it was yeah I think part of his journey and also it was physically very grueling its mentally and physically quite really a mentally really grueling and together that that it made that I was knackered that product just wasn't drink enough water I should have you know I tend to think this is a Miami trait definitely that I will just carry on until I get it I wouldn't necessarily think okay you're going into a stress period now so let's get some good water on let's eat some healthy food and so that nothing comes in and takes you out I just bulldoze your way through I tend to bulldoze we just bulldoze through three hours dairy yeah it's three o'clock there yeah I was thinking I have no idea how long that crazy yeah it's like a time warp in here well you know you're you're good at it you're used to it I I once did a street show for about two hours without starting which was quite a beautiful because on the street there's if you imagine it there's no nothing Endre festivals you know the able to function and there's this place called the mound so there's people milling around so I was almost starting a show and I was just mucking about for two hours I was just there kind of not starting kind of starting kind of chatting kind of playing around beautiful it's I've done the most fun things on the street because no one's in charge of anything there's just no rules yeah I seen deed Chapelle do that Dave Chapelle did that in Montreal we were doing this club soda and he came downstairs after we did it I think he was like 18 or 19 and just took his hat off and started doing stand-up and had people put money in the Hat doing stand-up on the street that was pretty wild be free I see Stephen Washington Square pie yeah yeah that's um Charlie Burnett was famous for that Charlie Burnett was a guy who was one of the original Street stand-up comics in New York and he would do that in Washington Square Park and gather everyone round there's video of it that people could watch online I think he went to he might have come over to England at one point did he I think he might have he was brilliant brilliant performer really good at grabbing people and grabbing their attention and Dave learned a lot from him Eddie thank you very much man thanks a lot fun I
