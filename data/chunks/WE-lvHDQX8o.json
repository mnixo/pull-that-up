we're live guys yeah boom and we're live ladies and gentleman wanted a picture quick we're here with the Great and Powerful Jimmy Smith welcome to the UFC Jimmy Smith thank you so much to be here officially official we wanted to talk about it last time with you on the podcast we have danced around there you it's so many people Rovi were like Joe really here I go hey man Joseph Pro buddy you hinted well we danced to this nobody nobody totally new and of course the Great and Powerful Eddie Bravo yo yo yo Brian counts on the way but he's bringing wine and cheese he insists on wine and cheese he thinks he's had some fuckin fuckin cocktail party were they gonna prepare scripts that's Brian he's gotta have his wine and cheese duo Choi versus Jeremy Stephens is the main event if you've never heard when these podcasts before this is a fight companion podcast which means we're gonna watch the fights most likely we'll talk about the fights but we might not we could talk about whatever the fuck like Eddie and I have we've got this retired podcast we never talked about the fight until like the last round of the main event but Missouri Missouri Division of perfetto there in Missouri was this st. Louis that's what it is right yeah and they haven't adopted the ABC rules that's important for the judging at least I'm sure they haven't adopted those in Nevada which is real weird crazy look how good Michael Johnson looks at 45 Eddie was saying that it's racist to say that but I don't think it is I got shredded he is fantastic yeah it's a good weight class for him yeah I think you know just there was Habib nurmagomedov those giant 55s that could just grapple fuck you know beat your brains and he had enough of that I'm not sure like yes like that's that's about enough of this weight class when people remember how much the other guy talked to Dana White while he was beating my ass that's that's bad yeah he's great that's what's so funny about it is well this was supposed to be the main event on the prelims but Uriah Hall and Vitor Belfort fell out really unfortunately which is a fucking bummer apparently your riot Hall was like on death's door trying to make weight but he had like gotten sick I had heard during training he was having some real issues he's his body shut down about three weeks out a lot of people out here dealing with that fucking flu and then Robert Falls his coach died yeah yeah who's a great guy by the way if you ever met Robert he was fantastic but you know mentum just going through a lot of stress yeah and that'll that'll kill your cut - yeah Robert killed himself yeah so did his brother it's such a such a bomb that guy's a nice fucking guy love them it's such a good dude such a bummer man yeah so instead this fight which was gonna be on the prelims I'm excited about this fight though cuz Darren Elkins is some sort of a different kind of human that guy takes fucking punishment like nobody and he probably looking for marijuana no honey that no it's okay we know we didn't this this is a free world we live in California I don't drink anymore and at all nope drinking Wow no more caffeine I'm on in a minute fasting then you look good dude your face looks good I'm not giving this away yeah don't give that away Bobby that giving it up giving it up don't give it up don't give it away so how long has it been since the booze I I decided initially that I would only allow myself to drink like if I did a set somewhere or if I did you know I might at the tenth planet holiday party I allowed myself to drink but that was the last time it's been about a month and a half since I'm gonna drink interesting how you feel I feel great like it I don't need alcohol no you don't need alcohol it just gets you in trouble it makes you say so but it no more Indian the Indians out now you're smoking the peace pipe yeah yeah no more Indians Jimmy Smith you spoke to reefer every now and then funny little puffs just to celebrate yeah just celebrate but the thing to me is is a little-known personal fact I've never had a drink in my life so what the fuck do you blame your fuck-ups on you know yeah nothing I have no excuses for my behavior that's terrible none well you know you've been hitting ahead of gang I have been hit in the head that's more than once yeah speak speaking a hit in the head the world title Steve Bay and Francis they're showing the preview for it right now good fuckin me fantastic Oh googly moogly I've never been more excited for a heavyweight title fight ever freak oh he's a freakish - the freakiest he's a one-in-a-million athlete like if you think there's 320 million people in this country how many in goners are there if there's 300 I'd be fucking stunned I don't even think he's I think it's more than one in a million like the guy who's built like that he's been training three years or something there's probably a pile shudders totally was homeless five years yeah yeah that's crazy yeah crazy dude worked in a sand mine as a kid like a goddamn character in a Robert E Howard comic book like digging sand as a kid that's a real conan by the way guys did you're not a comic book dork just growing in with his anger that's pushing that thing ranked Schwarzenegger pushing the the we log the wheel forever the grinder I mean what better workout is there for a young guy who wants to beat the fuck out of people then dig in sand all day just carrying sand all back in legs and arms I mean think about how much strength is required just fucking dig sand all the time there's places that are they're called sandbox workouts or something wait maybe they start doing that but you gone who opens up a chain of sand training or something but we were just talking about before before we got on headset um guys who are comfortable who have money who have another career web a fallback it's hard to be home percent committed this dude was digging sand homeless yeah you're never more committed to winning if I don't win I don't eat man and that motivation it's as strong as powerful is most powerful thing in the world it comes to fighting the crazy thing about that dude is he has so much to learn still five years of MMA training I mean his ground game is very rudimentary he's just trying to stuff takedowns he's freakish strong he's got real good training he's got the UFC Performance Institute so he's training with real good guys on a daily basis but man I mean a lot to a lot to grow these they're all the time yeah they're practically lookouts read it Michael Johnson is Jesus Christ he's fucking shredded at 45 in Ghana fought Feb Lisa Ward oh no no no he fought our laughs key and then he knocked out over him and then they said you got it you got the title shot when he put over him in orbit everybody was like okay this is the only thing he wants to say that's awesome I mean who the fuck its and what a story and ste peas run has cleared out a lot of guys it's just that he you know you need that fresh face you need that knockout guy and then Steve Bay's chasing history yeah those things come together it's not a crazy thing to history only two title defenses it's not the entire history of the UFC's heavyweight division it's only been defended twice no one's ever done it three times then that's and it's the first title yeah first title was heavyweight yeah think about that right that is crazy yeah Michael Johnson Freddy's gonna fuck a 36 pack there's a lot of jealousy in your face what can you see like just well admiration and maybe a bit of want I want to have abs like but I wouldn't say jealousy I'm happiness rate this the drop cuz I always felt use a little soft at 55 I always felt like he should have looked like this you know I mean you this dudes lean it's fuck and he hits so hard and he's so fast I think at 45 he's gonna be a monster I think there's a big move for him I'm a big fan of this guy man you know and he hurt nurmagomedov in that fight too he's the first guy to put nermal comin off in trouble people forget he starched Dustin Poirier Kayode him Michael Johnson's a bad motherfucker the problem when you get in there with a guy like nurmagomedov and beats your ass that bad you're like well how the fuck am I ever gonna beat this guy yeah you know like this it'll move you yeah every every major move most major moves in MMA are due to a beat-down there due to usually getting manhandled by somebody who's natural at that weight class or big four that way cuz or if it's not a move that way it's a move to a new camp it's like I got a you know train for us a hobby or go to Matt humor you go to one of the Wizards someone who's gonna revamp my shit you see a lot of that you know but it's often time too late such a crazy fucking sport because while you're training for a fight you kind of have to be training for the fight you can't really take too many chances and learn too much new shit that's you know when you talk to trainers or the old school guys that's more things they say about Mike Tyson is he fought so much he didn't develop enough he just wasn't in the gym that much he was fighting every you know twice a month in his prime when he was younger so here we go 45251 45449 of the first round for trying to sync it up Michael Johnson and Darren Elkins and Darren Elkins they're here's a guy who made a big move when he went to alpha male mitts made a huge impact on him he looks way more polished weight way smoother the way he moves he really saw that in the person more sot baek dick fight that was a crazy fight because that was a fight where he was way underdog like by a big margin for a good reason he started already getting hurt yeah he's getting tagged see if michael johnson um goes after him before he stays patient I always think whenever I see a guy at 35 45 from alpha male I always think when they call them and go well we need to got 45 for you to get that call you got to be beastly because they have a lot of those guys yes I mean that's their whole team Oh Oh Michael Johnson in the end he's fast man at 45 very fast and he's range ease getting good extension on his punches yeah and that 45 is gonna be enjoying that even more a good height reach of Ed she just looks perfectly built for the air class and he has the speed a lot of people don't realize when you drop a weight class those guys are a hell of a lot faster oh and he has the speed to keep up with those guys a lot of whom don't yeah and I think he's probably gonna be even faster at 45 oh no he surfed and leg went out on him oh this is a good fight already oh he talked to me Elkins hasn't really figured it out he's waiting on him well he's just a step slow for sure and just not not nearly smoothest Reicher Elkins relies on his ability to take tremendous punishment and his heart and his endurance or it just never stops at this pace and if you start to slip oh sweet left hand yeah problem is that's a tough thing to rely on in this business the way MMA is now I'm a tough guy well welcome to the club yeah he's like 500 tough guys in the US tough shit we got tough girls yeah unbelievable fucking Holly Holm how about that fight I'm out of punishment that she took against cyborg crazy she kept getting cracked so Eddie Bravo that's it for now for for alcohol that's it that's it that's it that's it I think that's a good move man I'm happy for you thank you it was doing nothing for me what problems you don't mind me asking was there something that prompted it was just like no no I just found myself going every night same thing I get home after training and I'll have a glass of wine and watch some Netflix and there's been a lot of great shows lately so I've been finding myself drinking like three or four times a week and then you know I go to the airport and I'm bored I'll have a couple glasses of wine and then they just just one day I thought man I'm turning into an alcoholic over here what's going on I was drinking because I was bored yeah yeah so I thought too old for that shit man yeah I mean it's just bad for your body man it's just yeah there's no need for it I like a glass of wine with the meal but man every time I've gotten drunk the next day I've just been disappointed with myself oh shit Brian County ladies and gentlemen with wine and cheese like some sort of a party yeah how you don't have you know Jimmy Jimmy Smith just met Barry Houston the first time la la la do we need a wine bottle opener here Oh Eddie doesn't drink anymore and I don't drink you this only half yeah only this side of the table doesn't drink we're just gonna watch you get hammered you never have why anymore I'm getting older but I got some good wine Jesus Christ everybody's complaining about getting older not be able to handle booze we're watching Darren Elkins and Michael Johnson here it's in the first round and so far Michael Johnson's looks smooth as but up to 100 real 5-band that left hands finding a home oak it's taking it on the chin now L can still in now once again this is one of those maybe ABC it's 10 8 9 ABC you probably go 10 9 right they haven't dropped new rules do you think that would be 10 8 though nobody could be I'm saying I'm not saying it is I'm saying with the new rules that they're just a lot more common maybe it's I think the actual rule and please someone out there correct me if I'm wrong if someone clearly if they went to aspects of the fight who we just hit with another left hand and he's certainly landing the significant strikes well and he's the aggressor yeah so you could certainly has a clear advantage and I would like to see rounds like that but Jimmy I think we need a better score system I think the 10-point system from boxing is goofy I just don't think we need it I think we need like a hundred points core system that takes into account submission attempts takedown attempts defense takes that into account leg kicks knees elbows punches all those things quantified the the impact of those techniques how hard they're hitting how close the choke is how close the armbar is how good the defense is you know like all those things should be taken into consideration and I think we should have more than three judges I think you have a three judges as fucking foolishness why three people I think you have way more of a likelihood of having some bullshit decision if there's only three people I think if you have twenty experts look or people online little cheese keep talking I'm listening 20 experts maybe you know maybe even open it up to people online like have a select few people wisdom with a crowd people you really respect how about knock out only anime and if it goes the distance and they're still not a knockout they get each they get too cold cocky try the back basically coldcock crazy that free-kick at the enemy who would that be knockout only come on be so ridiculous you'd watch it wouldn't you yeah you seen that game in Afghanistan where they horseback in teams and they've essentially have a goat a dead goat and the this side and they play with whips and the side that can get the goat into the goal is the winner Oh take down the horses die in that game oh and goats I'm sure plenty of goes Wow Elkins with the takedown here this changes things we're going back to this goat thing by the we're gonna my analysis sorry the exciting part but I thought it was dare until it first Oh hammer fist by Elkins here yeah he does chemically telling who Elkins does first watched in the UFC forever and you're gonna compare Andrew till got here I'm saying obviously Ryan so how dare you get dare until a fucking fight Jesus Christ he's scary he is scared was just watching the cowboy fight I was just watching it yeah do you know Vinnie I'm sure me a lot this week I'm sure he's like you know I watch UFC all the time but there's a huge in watching fights and studying fights and I have been studied I'm supposed to do basically all night tonight but I'm here dude I was thinking about what he want you when I knew that you got the gig feels like like if I had a call Bellator I'd be fucked yeah like I just there's too many people I don't know who the fuck yeah exactly yeah yeah Jimmy you want a little manchego cheese I would love some cheese that's fantast delete cheese but he won't drink your fuck I don't think it looks like he's in shape I'll tell you that much which one Elkins or no I'm talking about Jimmy okay mom shape kids got some arms huh he said jiu-jitsu black person man for real like bitch poor ha yeah I went back to training this week rose the first times crucifix look at this mounted crucifix for elegance and oh look at this Elkins gets the back three minutes to go oh shit oh shit magic Elkin spoils the big 145-pound party for michael johnson would not be the first time it would not be the first time you can't fucking sleep on this guy such an animal he has a better body though fucking Savage god damn that dudes a savage so if the punches and came back man holy shit holy shit Darren Elkins is a fucking Savage whoo he got teed off on in the first I didn't want to come back yeah Bryan you missed the teen off part that makes this finish so extraordinary it's just yeah yeah count this guy out he's such a fucking mutant he's such an animal look at this takes the back I was like oh I didn't want to get too excited I was like yeah he got his back but I don't like it too excited here is this gonna get crazy that was a high level move cuz some people would have jumped on the back and kind of just volunteered to like be a backpack yeah yeah he pulled him back he didn't jump on him he pulled the poking into his hips sometimes people they feel when they jump on the back they want to be on the back but on top and they're trying to force being on the back on top but it's way easier just to pull them back and you're on their back but you're on your back as well some people feel uncomfortable there cuz if they spin now they're on your guard but if you have a high level rear naked choke you just take the easy route pull them back and just finish him off your back finishing is a very hard thing to defend against cuz I see a lot of guys who defend for a long time look at the hips if they showed again when he had his hips all the way and what happens that stretches your core out and so it's you're nothing yeah can't you can't curl up and protect your neck and the wrong side the body still squozen even hold can you keep it it works some people don't need to switch it yeah some people can really hold that thing well I think for him it was just like he had it he's arching his back he had it locked in he was gonna give up that spot and try to switch legs fuck that's amazing guys are getting really good at spinning inside a body triangles there's there's there's technique to that really yep yeah what do you do if you can get there choking arm on the other side like in a baseball grip mm-hmm and which side is the body trail on it doesn't matter now you just got to really focus on putting your shoulders on the mat and you're controlling his arm okay he still has the body triangle on but inspire you're holding the wrist and you're turning around boom and then one big explosion and you're in the garden so the holding the the two on one on the arm the choking arm is big yes the bay that's huge that's huge otherwise he's gonna be all over your net when you do that you freeze them yes somebody was gonna come up with a technique to beat that or to try to mitigate that well the technique really am not letting it happen in the first place because in in the very beginning in the very beginning attempt planet right away I was so into body triangles and doing D subs I wouldn't serve well it's it's just a neck crank okay yeah yeah but calm teasing comb D sounds but when any time I would put on a body triangle I wouldn't even think about a rear naked choke anymore I'm like that's too hard I'm just gonna get on my side put you on your side and just connect my hands around your head somehow anyway and then I fall forward and I crush at the D Seb old move on remember beasts yes beasts never rear naked choke anybody he'd always get to the bat put a body triangle on and go D SAP on him he didn't even know how to do a rear naked choke he had gaping holes in his dam anyways anyways um what ended up happening was we were all about body triangles in the beginning and it was they were so dangerous like if someone put a body trying on me I know I know I'm done if what what if all you think about is a neck crank instead of the rear naked choke you just focus on the D sub you don't need a rear naked choke it's it's done ski so in the very beginning the first defensive move when someone takes your back is Oh was always don't let them put the goddamn body triangle on that was the first move that's everybody's first move don't let it get if he's got one if he's got your back don't let him get the hooks if he has one hook don't let him get two hooks if he puts both hooks you better not let him put a body triangle in and then but you're also protect against yes of course of course but there's things you do like what but what you end up doing is as soon as someone takes your back you put him in like a reverse quarter guard you you trap one of his legs and you'd escape from that that way there's no body triangle ever gonna happen so if that is the your first move it's in your DNA where someone takes your back and you take it leg out the mix because you're already worried about that body triangle then the body triangles become very hard to get really really hard so when the guy who's back has been taken if that is his focus on stopping that it's very hard to put it in so what ended up happening for a tent planet is we went away from the body triangles because I saw the damn I'm not gonna focus all this time on the d7 there's gonna most of the time we're not even getting the body triangle so we got to focus on a rear naked choke swith just the leg hooks and just like Marcela Garcia so we shifted away from the body triangle and I wanted everyone to focus on just good old-fashioned traditional rear naked choke with both hooks in and get really good from there and the body triangle in the D set that's like extra don't rely on it but what ended up happening is everyone's defensive first defensive move didn't it wasn't attack put up attack one of his legs and put it in reverse quarter guard we went away from that because there was the necessity wasn't there anymore do you follow me am I losing you no I understand what you're saying Sony shows how complex jujitsu is and you're constantly having to make these adjustments and my own glass positions now we're going way back because of EBI overtime where we start guys on their back and in our shootout overtime rounds the game has grown so much just from getting good at those rounds just in spending a lot of time at dissecting the author the armbar position and the rear naked choke considered any other positions that you would allow people to do other than those two those two good enough yeah that people would will suggest why don't you have a mount one or it's nice and super crazy basic something that everyone could agree on if you're gonna have a shootout in jujitsu it's gotta be rear naked choke or armbar that's it yeah you know what spiderweb is like you get a guy inside position you you hook one of the arms and he's defending okay guys defending it but you start from there he's hooked in the back is we start with a seat belt in with two leg hooks and you're sitting on your butt we start right there ready go have you seen combat jujitsu no dude Eddie Bravo came up with a great idea of all time combat jujitsu it's regular jujitsu but you get to smack the shit out of each other so they're open palms to each other things it's similar but it's only on the ground it's only when it goes to the ground so on the ground well Wagner Rocha right without no roaches got a stop a guy yeah TKO and jiu-jitsu and he's using his palms like bas Rutten used to in pancrase just fucking dropping him down slamming him home Wow yeah and it opens up it makes jiu-jitsu more realistic because there's certain positions that you're so exposed and if the guy smacks you in the head it smacks you in the nose it smacks me in the eyes you're just not gonna stay in that spot or you can there's gotta be guys that are training smacks they're gonna get really good at it guys gonna be able to take guys out what's max yeah most 99.9 percent of the guys that are down for combat jiu-jitsu I got a long less if he wanted it all of them have MMA experience only one guy only one guy ban at1 of my brown belts he he's the only dude who never even thought of MMA never even thought of it and he wanted to do cuz his guard is probably top three in the world I've never seen a name we talked about him last podcast with the Hindu low team banner you know so he's the only one and he got he went against Wilson Hayes who had in combat jujitsu he's automatically ranked number one right you know what I mean legit black belt Demetrius Johnson possibly the greatest fighter ever you know what I mean now he's he was in combat jujitsu because I watched the EBI in Austin I was one of the color guys you know it's fun and I didn't know what I was looking at as much you know obviously that was on an invitation it was so incredible because I watched those guys and I'm telling you from my untrained eye I couldn't even see when their words happen to dudes like they were doing things that didn't it looked like he was doing nothing and I was like like what happened what do you get him on like what would eat at mine I couldn't figure it out and then but but the one thing I noticed that pure jiu-jitsu practitioners those competition guys who are amazing that can do things there they there because there's zero striking it's true that you get in you get in very bad habits if you ever try to get into an MMA fight yeah well you see that a lot of times you used to see that more often with leg locks right guys go for leg locks and they'd be in a weird position and they'd get smashed go old-school Ian Freeman and Frank Mir remember that and I was like one of the first times that happened Tim Sylvia cafe Dantas who's deeper which one was which one is deeper they're the same same historical same historical genre Bruce it was a less popular fight look but why aren't so elections are not used as much because you are you can get punched in the face no it's almost always giving up position get a leg lock you're almost always sitting back okay to get a little so I can sit up and punch your head through the ground it's also you're always hitting your legs and two arms usually to offend yourself guys are just punching you in the face what you're doing that and yeah Ian Freeman fight Ian Freeman was locked up in a heel hook and Frank mirrors cranking on his heel and Ian just steps in and just starts flying at him off his jaw walking Hanson rain Osato yeah that was an amazing one holy shit yeah yeah there's been a gang of those where guys were over committed yeah and we had to learn I mean the risking their whiskey but the the state of the leglock game these days is way different than those guys that we're trying to pull off leg locks back then even Romina Sato even that level he was considered one of the best leg lockers back then but the level today in leg locks is way beyond that yeah it's way beyond what with with the guys that at DBS have done I mean they've taken the leg lock game I mean it's it's beyond Sambo John will be here tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. oh he will yeah we're doing a podcast early did you did you have you I was talking to Jill about the last Abu Dhabi and he told me a story I was laughing my ass off he said they did the rules meeting and they said well we want from everybody so no controversies you want three distinct taps and every goes I need to walk out of here you know like what we're talking about you don't have time to do this anymore that is a heel hook that is even even three of these you know you're risking an ACL because everybody look each other like we're all agreeing to not do that like all the people were like okay if I tap let me go dude fuck this rule shit let me go and yeah and chose look I got caught there's one and the guy let me go but like why everything in your knee it's have seen a horrible shit I've seen oh I've seen dudes get their shoulders wrecked with Kimora's yeah yeah no it's all true it's all true but but I'm I know where you're coming from with the leg lock thing people have gotten had the mean spotted leg locks but wow man it's not as common as you think well you know though it's good to see him out of the wheelchairs recovering I don't he got hit by a train man which is crazy I mean most people would be dead makes me want to cry wow dude it's it's just walking we shot warrior together and the last thing he said to me we had a scene together and it was this as a week later he got hit he said he goes I hope I can put my shoes on when I'm always won oh yeah it's good to see him guys think that was he was worried about he was talking about head trauma he said he worries about it you know and then he gets hit by a train a phone he should man everybody should fucking worry about it I mean it's something that has to be taken in consideration I mean it is what it is yeah but fuck yeah he's a good guy he is a game he's a very good guy and one of the most important figures in the history of sport when you break down what he was he represented like a powerful wrestler that embraced submissions remember he caught that far side armbar on George st. Pierre like he was one of the first guys that was like a real strong wrestler that had very high-level submission skills he was a huge leap in the sport yeah he beat hoist Gracie on the ground like like top level athlete I mean like a stud athlete I'm glad he's okay and it's nice to see him walking around Boston and it's good man all right so we're gonna go to Camaro Iceman in a meal mech I love this fight nobody wants to fight us man nobody he said everybody's running from that dude that guy is a smashing machine I mean he is a fucking tank of a human being but this is a meal mech I talk about leg locks he got his way into the UFC by knocking out toki neo he he smashed him and some other organization wait isn't he fighting the valhalla guy yeah that's a mailman oh yeah Emile MEC is the crazy Viking guy he's a stocking animal his he's so shredded and stupid but tomorrow I'm on top of the food chain wrestlers super athlete just a tank of a man who everybody's running from just running from nobody wants a piece of him when you talk about like top 10 guys he's the guy that nobody's mentioning there's there's a special thing I think in MMA and combat sports period is there are guys who are great and then they're guys who are frightening when we're nobody and another good example is talking yo-yo even when he was a fringe top-10 guy you know eight people like I don't want anything to do with that dude I don't have a GSP who's better but won't hurt me like zucchini will rip your leg in half and you have no idea was doing man I think he did some bad things in the OSI he definitely held on submissions but I feel like he got a bad deal when he got fired when he got kicked out of the UFC the the submission that he held I watched it and I say that was not egregious and it was a normal thing for anybody else yeah it certainly wasn't certainly wasn't his worst it's just right it was like the fourth time that they had said hey don't the other ones were horrible other ones were worse it was a straw yeah to me it was a so Jake Shields fight was like fucking crazy yeah Shields look the wrath was like duty keep scout you have too many held on to the Camorra it's tough it's tough to under yeah and then Jake Jake hit him after he yeah he hopped him with the Kimora cuz he wouldn't let go of the Kimora but if you go back and I mean I'm not giving the guy an excuse but you want to find out about his childhood his childhood was horrific yeah he was working on a farm when he was like a little boy is a giant scar in his chest because he got slashed open and they just tried to like tape it up and glue it together they never brought him to the hospital I mean he would literally would eat pig slop like he had no food and just worked on a farm was you know and then as he got older made his way into Rio and then found Minotauro school and started learning jujitsu and just a tank from farm work yeah from Glen boy having to work needs a fight in Ghana this is he's scared as well as scary you know I'm saying I mean a kid that's growing up in that horrific environment like that who knows what kind of who knows but definitely was in danger and fearful from the time it was very young and it was in a position where he was struggling for his life like for survival well in a way that weak bitches don't understand we might have know he obviously provides impulse control in a lot of ways well like if you look at the Avalon fire that he had in Abu Dhabi where they're rolling out he's hold onto a hill hook I was hard and and like the ref stop stop stop and he won't stop yeah and Avila is freaking out but there's also that terrible situation where they restarted him with him and it was done yeah but you never can do can't do yeah you can't particularly with heel hooks no you cannot say ready set go because you gotta assume that the guys securing that in the middle of a scramble you got to be in motion right there's also you can't just start him because he's gonna rip it but the thing was about the mental state is you know they stop and Adlon is furious cuz you wanna let go of this heel hook and like tolkien's trying like hug it out and they're trying to explain to him no no you were supposed to let go and it was almost like he didn't quite get what was going I took a wife you watch that yeah took a while for them to explain it to him like like you know you could also make the argument that he's playing dumb I don't know I don't know that yeah I don't mean but if that was my student that was he was tearing apart like that I would I would say this guy's playing dumb he knows he's not supposed to rip your leg apart like that that that ref what's-his-name with the Jake Shields fight you see him you're watching him it was a Steve Massa gotta fight like you don't see him taking into his eyes like that you're a ref you know his eyes are all red who's crazy oh that was awful critical there's no excuse that was awful that was awful he did a seminar because he's top team and I was top team in Long Beach and Carlson Gracie and everything and my coach calls me and he says um I wasn't in town at the time he goes all toki Nia is doing a seminar I should come by after this leg lock seminar or whatever I remember thinking I'd want to learn the leg locks I don't know if I'd get on a mat with that dude like I want to be show me stuff but if you say I'm a demonstrate come here I'd like Gracie Bubba dummies dude yeah you bring this dummy and go show me on that guy a little it's different though when it's just a straight grappling match yeah come on you're not trying to no one's trying to break anybody's bones here yeah but it's a little bit different in MMA when your opponent has no problem trying to put his fist through your skull through your skull fight he would love it if he kicked you right in the head and broke your fucking horrible yeah he would love it and no one would ever talk shit on him but if you crank a heel hook and you tear their tendon a little bit you know then you're the fucking bad guy but it's also he doesn't I think it's to stop when you're when when the guys you know what I'm saying you break the tie they're trying to break my skull I'm trying to break your town yeah what's the difference but the guys but but once again the guys who hit the ground the rest of stop and they're still trying to hit imagine a guy that guy it's the same thing you got to stop punching when the referee gets in what period yeah but what about what about in situations like Dan Henderson and Bill fighters know when a guy is fucking done yeah he shit Bisbing so hard for sure Dan Henderson knew he was done but the ref was like damn I got a free shot check this out yeah boom it makes highlight reels that's okay it's not exactly if you don't respect that the stop of the does this make you feel uncomfortable about your own body when you watch these guys yes because they basically wear what you wear or they wait in reason I'll never altima be happy that's that's cuz you know that's exactly right and I would never wear clothes I would always be yeah shorts like that I would have like a hoodie opened up all the way that's right walk down the beach with no shirt be that guy a hundred percent look in his back pocket that was all dog-eared but he really never read it that's true that was to help you you want to help you in these moments and this you'll appreciate this he taught my Bobby Fischer last time yes that same documentary yes Bobby Fischer against the world you have to watch yeah yeah but remember when the guy says imagine all the things you did as a kid after school and before school and imagine all of that filled up with chess study and that's all you did so you can complain yeah I'm not that guy but you're sitting here drinking wine and cheese that dudes in the gym you are correct like all the stuff I knew that doesn't have anything to do with getting yoked I get to do all that stuff that's easy I mean that's all yeah and why aren't I is good at grappling six and Gracie think of all you did while Hickson Gracie was on a mat and just training you were doing other stuff one of my all-time favorite grappling characters not just because he's the all-time greatest fantasy but also because he incorporated yoga he was so outside the box he's doing what a lot of jiu-jitsu guys are doing now incorporating yoga MMA guys in court the nutrition - every night together I think yeah the first time I'm doing will tell Fargo way back we wanted to do push-ups look at this jump around look at this look at each other do these guys these these guys who was the last guy meek fought that's a good question that guy it's I think you pronounce it Mac I think it's Emil Metcalf he's a he is a straight-up Viking a hundred percent and you've got a West African warrior over who from Nigeria you got what's gonna be interesting is if Quebec and stuff that takedown can he stuff the takedown came out drunken munkey for a second it came up as and low oh and full guard Oh komaru that's not good well turns the crush on his right side how much how much does he burn himself out here does he go for it or does he let it go and this beast is on top of him drop it this might okay here what wall remains are harder to finish he's how's his arm in our morning it's a lot of hard to finish right now I would say it doesn't have it by now yeah he's trying to put all his weight on his right side okay so all depends like his his left side you know how good it squeezes oh he's tightened down hard this is a great position this is it yes that's correct you know how to finish it it's deep he's under that chin man don't look good that's not good oh he's way lighter now way lighter look at all that air see all that air yeah he's gonna giving up he's popping out right now get us and the meals gonna try to step up oh he's trying to get that kymaro's I'm gonna hold him down and now oh oh I don't like that interesting are komaru taking him to the cage interesting he's got a pass to get the head and arm won't work from garden okay yeah maybe with that fence there's something there you know what I mean it maybe puts enough energy into it if he could just pass one leg and hold this position being get to half guard and just keep this upper body yeah good question Jamie see if you could pull up Iceman's wrestling pedigree I'm pretty sure he's n-c-double-a all-american yikes and more than that I think maybe two years I'd have to remember go over my notes look at that he wants the wall stepping back up I'm stepping up though Jiri had an Olympian in Daniel E gali who went to Canada and then won gold medal in 2000 he's trying to take the back as far as I know there's not a lot of great wrestling out there three-year all-american d2y a three-year all-american division - all right cool and what about what University University of Nebraska at Kearney ah same as Ellenberger that's one for the Chamorro look at that look at this oh boy interesting interesting interesting interesting Louie's got it in low he's got a nice and low and really turn his hips though yeah and the fence is getting in the way a little mini mo case defended it nice still controlling that wrist Oh doesn't want to let it go interesting can't get that arm over going basket yeah there's a lot of muscle feels it's a lot of it's a lot of it's a lot of hold a lot of tension on the muscles well you've been wrestling for a long time you used to them we're talking about kymaro and Nigerian wrestlers I mean where is uh is a meal from Iceland what's what's Viking Norway what's the plan was Norway the flag was not Denmark Norway I think Sweden where where is he from though is he's from I'm gonna find out Jamieson look at this this is a battle baby this is a battle you got a couple of tomorrow Oh establish established that domination Norway Norway Norway bunch of fucking tough people in Norway these guys the nails painted I like the his toenails I painted I appreciate it very much when a French rig they're painted the den worships they don't know huh sure he's probably a druid and druid what it's a male witch what I don't know what it is it's more your calling believe somebody was into magic and Emile MEC back up oh you know max standing up yeah but here's the thing you can't keep Usman off them the question is whether or not Oh Smaug can continue like this pace and keep doing as close please be breathing pretty boathouse house MEK gonna feel once he gets free you know you're burnt out here who's gonna be more burnt out I mean we're we're likely looking at the end of the first round where kymaro controls them and does you know most of the control but really didn't get much off to keep them square want to keep that in front you okay who's a meal mech training with I was just gonna ask that like to see who's George its width or in Valhalla haha nice right I watched Star Wars today how was I mean it was like a Disney Star Wars movie yeah looks like they everything super diversified the characters are all black and Asian women and there's women their generals the women are running things it's like yeah the game of Thrones no no no Oh little after the bell action there it just it was okay like get off was a fun movie it was fun but it's like it's like Disney got Disney fied it's like they just boiled all the bacteria off marks well it's just it's just you know it's I don't I like a strong female character but I don't want to think that this is like a calculated move for you to create a strong female but because you want but I don't want to notice that I know you know I'm saying somebody told me that about the black mirror somebody complained they said oh all the fucking heroes in this season's black mirror all women like if you watch the black mirror and that's what you're concentrating on your asshole is that funny it shows amazing nobody gives a fuck it's women the lead or men lead it's just a phenomenal anxiety I want to turn it off halfway anymore I put I haven't seen this season but this season is the greatest ever it's amazing it's a metalhead it's crazy here we go don't be getting out and see if he's going right to head kicks but here's the think this who's smart get tired does he get tired after all that grapple fog doesn't look tired - doesn't look tired doesn't look tired is Mac tired Oh front kick to the body Mac I like the fact that he's still throwing kicks even though he got taken down and dominated on the ground he's trying to set something oh it another hard kick to the arms not fun not fun to take those if you're holding ty pads don't you have to be careful about catching the top your foot on those elbows oh that's not thinking about that yeah that can suck once again if you're thinking about it yeah he's thinking about slant on that shin into those fucking forearms and making them useless oh he hurt him with that spinning back fist damn he heard of elbow that was a very nice minute back fist very good on us there oh oh doctor under that hand get out of there son go here we go all right somebody's gonna oh now something a little bit oh oh there he gets there he gets it get out of there get out of there MEC interesting though ooh saman does not want no part of that fun l stand I don't think so I'm not enjoying it nope doesn't want to be throwing bones with a Viking that's a long history of fuck with people up is where journey that wizard e2 should have kept it hmm interesting how to score this right because loose bomb when he gets it to the ground he's been not able to do anything yeah he rolls him but he's not getting anything off and it's mech who went for the submissions in the first round clearly loose maan does not want to stand with him he's trying to trying to bring this as well that stand up without giving up your back yeah he doesn't want it he doesn't want less stand up too high and get hooks in okay so it's about guarding your hips and standing up asses it's also why you see he's got his right hip pressed nice and square just trying to keep that left hook or the right hook rather from getting in and he's back up again that you're staying trying to separate those arms a lot of battle in here a lot of fucking physical war this is gonna be in a lot of ways like who's going to be the fitter fighter yeah and again going for that Kimura come on gotta watch it that's the commitment to the history he's going to it going to but it's too close to yeah yeah too close the fence and doesn't really have anything going on with his legs he likes it though he's holding it that's his shit he's a muscle dude that's a real muscle move yeah it's funny you know it marcelo garcia doesn't use chemours to do anything with that come more if he gets that I find that amazing he does take it does take a lot of commitment with the hips to get them yeah get a come on you fought too right yeah yeah yeah what do you say Kimora's I think what Marcelo means by that um is that Kimora's definitely work yeah there's no elaborate systems around yeah as chemours are fucking huge oh yeah but I see what he says cuz when you're gonna go with someone who has twenty thirty pounds on you Kimura not gonna work these elbows from the bottom and also that's a guy was saying with all the options I have I wouldn't say he's got a lot of other options not sitting there thinking just about the Comoros a lot of options every time he attacks because risks a lot so I think it's just the harder way to go with all the options he has to spend time working on submissions and only time all this time that work on big guys jokes yeah North County all the time he just wants to get good at stuff that works on bigger guys if it doesn't work on bigger guys he he doesn't want to spend time and he had a leglock game too he said Rodriguez yeah I remember slammed it was dark dirty if you wanted to him remember he garden horrid yes my bigger I'm stronger lock him down yep get rid of his mobility and don't think more I remember that quick that was a submission yeah okay mech on the bottom here man starting get cut up too yeah well he got some good elbows off from the bottom and then kymaro start smashing on him he was angry when you're on top of somebody for this long though is that scored oh yeah yeah yeah you're in the dominant position and also your strikes count for more so when it comes to significant strikes you strike some more significant basically yeah and clearly with the seasons on wants to keep the fight to ground clearly mech wants to get up and he can't so it shows dominance of position it shows the ability to execute you around very Inca West yeah I've been looking forward to somebody challenging us mine but so you see some vulnerabilities in the stand up yeah see a little bit of that you know and mech being a strong dangerous guy but you also see us months strengths his ability to keep fights going down now what kind of cheeses do you get raw cheese you one of those yes is it beautiful that is good cheese magic that is raw cheese I don't know you don't know it it's a it's a beautiful do you get it at Whole Foods it's the best money I've ever had thank you mama I don't play around when it comes to chance you do not I don't play around in general mmm have some good goddamn cheese you ever have a good vegan cheese no they exist yeah they're cashew cheese you can kiss my ass with that stuff really yeah it's not to stop reinventing the wheel what is it there's me crazy they make it out of cashews and stuff but is it uh like a valid something dramatic actually I'm kidding with you aren't I don't know you're serious my wife eats a here we go round three Dondon Tom do you say get the fuck out of my face with that shit when you see you eating it take that copy to stuff out of my fucking mouth interesting both guys look pretty good in this third round Eddie you're a vegan my mouth no Eddie looks Eddie doesn't age well he especially now off the booze he doesn't matter he's 85 years old how are you 47 damn man you look young thank you you really do Oh nut shot boom toes caught it China he's doing that weird drop thing that never works you know what's funny is a lot of people like complain on line you know whatever you know fans are like wow that wasn't a bad shot a lot of times the ones that don't look bad slam the cup right into your nuts and they're the worst the grazing shots awesome the worst ones they shift the cup kind of squirt one more problem yeah you gotta get those goddamn compression cups like diamond MMA they have that compression short with a cup that keeps everything locked in and tight that's what you want holy our boys scoring with Oh hit him with a hard shot to the body and a good right hand behind it it's interesting because if you look like who did damage clearly you smart got off some of the damage in that first round but you can't discount on all this don't don't go back to the ground I want to come on let me see the slugfest hammer look at this hammering with those elbows Travis Browne oh oh going down son probably but not gonna be able to get up here we go again he's working for that hidden on choke again but again he's stuck in full guard seems rudimentary yes password hasn't been there yeah it seems like he's just kind of trying to hold that spot with that left arm trapped but he doesn't really have a real option Meeks an animal though he is an animal but animal but he's fucked here boy he'll just that pressure didn't that didn't want none of that didn't want to be staring up which old-school switch old-school rustling switch em good luck yeah get better hey who smiles just got such a interesting very interesting ouch that's gotta hurt so you see you see how strong loose mom's wrestling is but you also see vulnerability yeah definitely see vulnerability and stand up I don't think it's gonna be as hard for him of your fights now tell you that he'll be able to get a few guys that'll step in and he's fighting a strong guy but he isn't fighting a tricky you know a guy that's gonna a lot of also throw weird stuff at him because he's reached a few times those takedowns and the guy hasn't had me casting out the speed to really make him pay for it you know somebody else low him versus Mike Perry would be very interesting him versus Mike Darren till would be interesting that would be horrific stand up for Darren til is a wizard he's gonna be I think if I don't know what his wrestling's like against it got like tyrunt or something but I don't know how he stops that but if he does have great takedown defense I think he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna walk through that division not walk through well you saw it almost immediately in the cowboy fight he was on so many levels yet higher than cowboy when it came to stand up yeah distance control and then consequences for his actions I hit so fucking hard yeah that's what everything at 2:01 he's a huge guy he's a huge guy was able to get down to 170 oh my he's 24 years old and he's super technical too it's not it's not just big right he's big and real technical and he stepped into a big fight late notice and acted like this is my this is my moment a lot of guys mentally fold and he did not very confident there's no fold in that guy you know Vinnie Sherman Vinnie does Muay Thai commentary for a bunch of organizations and he's also a fight hypnotist really interesting guy and you know he knows a lot about the Thai world and Thai fighting and he's always talking to me about dudes and when he found out that tail was fighting cowboy he was very excited he called me up and or sent me text messages about it we went back and forth quite a bit he was like this guy is something special he's something special so it really prompted me to go watch some atilla's fights and I was like holy shit yeah he's monstrous and you know and cowboy was like I ain't watched tape on him I heard he likes to strike good I loved striking he's like I think this fights gonna be fucking crazy how tall is tell she's tall there's like six - I think yeah you see some big fucking guys show up standing up so dominant performance by Usman in the fact that he got in the second and the third round to do really basically what he wanted took some punishment on the feet but here oh the full mount now and steps right back in half guard yeah yeah you see the weaknesses you see where he needs improvement well the big one to me is a stand-up hiss tent he's he looks like he's thinking you know I'm saying yeah like when things are going down he's thinking and his instinct is to reach just go okay region yeah guys I thought oh really make you pay for that yeah I want to see him versus a guy who can really fucking bang that's why I think that he's bummed out I'm you know max bummed out but uh I feel like seeing Guzman against a guy who might be able to stuff those takedowns and maybe have a little bit faster hands and Mac mecca's tough and his stand-up is good but this is a real strong dude that doesn't he doesn't have like anyone overwhelming feature to his game whereas a guy like Mike Perry can blow your fucking brains through the back your head you know I mean that guy hits so goddamn hard he's so ferocious I'd like to see him hurt but I don't think he'd be it's gonna be able to stop that takedown this guy's got some fucking wicked wrestling interesting though he learned a lot tonight tell you that that's a fight like that's good for a guy like him and we got to see him in vulnerable positions did not like to stand up interesting and he was in trouble coupled a couple times these guy who's not SuperDuper slick on the ground and he was still like oh yeah you moron again guillotine so yes especially the guillotine like right away I mean what if he had gotten locked up like that with a guy who's like a wicked finisher yeah yeah Christian Bale is the best actor in Hollywood as long as Daniel day-lewis today is making sure you know what he's right there with a love love Daniel day-lewis but Christian Bale he here's here's a trivia question what was the one movie he was in when he was younger well he was in two movies he's been acting since he was six and part of the Sun thank you sir thank you okay there's one more Henry the fifth with Kenneth Branagh he's a little bit but that I love that you got that I love you I'm already impressed my history dog UCLA oh you're on the green history why I was all right I was already a fan when I listen to you on Brogan's I want his fucking guys but you didn't know toad do I love you for the history trivia Jews thank you sir God yeah I'm so happy that you with the UFC now a happy Br here we try to get you from their years four years yeah man he's as knowledgeable there's some guy's junk commentary right now we're just saying there's a guy who's doing on this fight that we don't know who he is who's this guy playboy what is his name is Paul Felder's but he wasn't great guy I when I saw I watched him fight a lot including live and I he just looks like such an animal so I and when I met him I expected this kind of real kind of antisocial our rough guy and he's the exact opposite theater major very intelligent just a just a good sober dude you know super nice guy great guy and I just as tough as it gets come on loose Mon clearly Nana's decision I'm very impressed with both those guys yeah fuck yeah interesting fight though I'm glad that fight happen got to see it but you're right whose mom's gonna get more people you know I haven't meet that guy which can be good for you you don't want people running from it he's gonna get guys that have been willing to fight him now because he's got a strong presence in the top ten I mean he's number ten now winning this fight probably keeps him in that area because mech is probably not ranked is that hooved where is he am I looking at it to the left perhaps I don't know whose mama knows you guys are saying people are gonna want to fight him now yeah I think so more before ya know he could be the mom no well there are some vulnerabilities in there yeah no one could be garlic could be I think he's very good don't get me wrong but I think that Emile's without real fast hands showed some real vulnerabilities yeah like you know if he was here's a pretty like okay let's put it this way if Kelvin Gastelum could really make 170 be healthy like if he if he got Mike Dolce on speed dial and said Mike let's work this out this is let's just make this work out baby come on yeah you know seven-year Union we both know 70s where it's at and if they actually did figure out a way to get a good meal plan drop him down the way like Michael Johnson looked you know Calvin's got way better hands I mean wait and Calvin's tough to take down he's a real good wrestler he never gets fucking tired his endurance is phenomenal and his act hard to get underneath and tastes nasty southpaw and that fucking right jab straight left behind it is surprising it's got snap to it when he cracked Bisping with that chair when it was like hey and you see Bisping's head snap back you're like there's some pop to that dude's punches he stopped Vitor that way same way yep he's a motherfucker that Kelvin Gastelum he is he I would love to see that I mean obviously kelvins campaigning at 185 now and maybe he's gonna stay there now he wants to go back down 170 I would love to see that fight yeah that's that's what I want to say I want to see Kelvin versus kymaro whose mom I think that's a real good fight because I don't think kelvins ranked at 170 right because he's been fighting at 85 right right now he's not so he goes down to 70 in aus Mons top 10 immediately he's ranked you know if you have be too smart and it's a big if because Guzman is a hell of a fucking wrestler and 185 has some monsters monsters monsters do fucking cancel this fight that Whitaker Romero Yoel Romero is gonna fight for the interim title against Luke Rockhold which is lovely that's February right no when is that uh no it's February well what I'm saying but he was already on the card he was supposed to fight uol was for ensign oh okay so he was he was our least in camp for that date which is he what's wrong with Whitaker what injury did they announce it I don't think they announced it I don't know yes I'd bet it's his knee his knee got fucked up in that fight with you well Yoel sidekick Disney and and hyper-extended it and he came back and he said my knees fucked in between rounds and still stuff to take downs and still beat him standing he's tough he's got yeah but he's got an extra he's got a lot of Terran there's a lot of Tears going on in that knee yeah so he's gonna have to figure out what the fuck to do about all that your knees and your head and I made for sport for combat sport that's not at all yeah man it's it's a how tough real bomber when guys start having knee injuries repeated knee in trees like until they get that ironed out and settled in it's like it's always suspect that shit's always given out and then your training changes so then your ability inside the Octagon changes so many things changed meanwhile any Bravo's over here hope and dudes get their legs ripped apart he is but how baskets was a guy was right about to break through and that happened but hobbies knees were fuck oh no I know Alberto crane fight he couldn't stand up king of the cage man yeah well he had a blow knees yeah I commented to that fight did you you're drunk yeah it was my last show we went off me and Eric Apple did it I gotta see that Apple but I'll crank great jujitsu guy and how were your baskets great you just dance for the king of the cage title yeah well and hobby was like about to break it I was supposed to be like him he just it just stopped from the injury if he just let go and just say look I'm injured I don't stop this fight his career would have taken a completely different path and is his mental toughness his ability to endure and fight with that ACL and it kept blowing out during the fight yeah he just kept giving out so he must have chewed up the whole inside of his fucking leg his meniscus and all that shit but still went on to be like a really good fighter in MMA and a really good fucking sub man submission grappling yeah yeah find an e bi a bunch of times with those knees didn't he run into some health issues recently cancer he does believe he got on the Gerson method who is a hobby Vasquez what's the Gerson method a lot of juicing like coffee enemas does that make sense okay a lot of energy animus something like I don't know something like that what kind of look is it worked it worked with cancer yeah he had : colon cancer okay so that makes sense with the enemas fuck man so he beat it that's beautiful god it's 50 you should all have like I had to get my fucking calling up your butthole I got a clean but they stick a tube up there they can't move did you like wrap your legs around your arms like this here is a private letter come there that's a private that's the private questions you like get up he smell like how long he's right now showing you my doctor smelling cologne he was a really nice guy anything wear gloves yeah so it's done Joe to a guy the other day that had mint breath over shit breath his breath smelled like shit and so he was eating mints but it wasn't good enough that means it was like I was it was you know what it was like man it was like like it was confusing it was like there's two signals that were clashing with each other you know what's what's awful for the folks listening home that aren't broadcasters I'm not naming names we're not gonna name a names to broadcast with somebody whose breasts things cuz they turn to you and you have to stay close to them to stay in the two-shot that's a problem you can't go nah you can't react at all it's wrong and it is I brush my teeth like religiously when I'm doing camera stuff because I'm in someone's face talking to him and I've been all the receiving in that and then like this I need you can't make a face you can't do ya after shows when you take pictures yeah guys that's gotta be guys sometimes you're just like god dammit I don't know what's going on they say when people's don't eat a lot like if you sit in it yeah is that real like if you so there are different things I know with chronic halitosis apparently it's the sulfates on your tongue whoa there's there's so so typically I guess the suits of the chemicals I guess the sulfur though everybody has different compounds in their mouth and for whatever reason I don't know but you there they just sense what you're smelling is sulfur is is a derivative of salt or some kind of a sulphur and it's because there's a chemical in your mouth and they can actually address it with hmm yeah and ptosis can also be from bad from liver disease so if you have liver disease you know sure yeah liver disease make sure that's what ways the Chinese diabetes answer disease got the breath Wow wow that's interesting that's one of the ways they check yeah whoa and then of course it can be an abscess behind your tooth and all that yeah that's a big man that's to die had a cracked filling and they took the filling out and the fucking smell came out of my mouth I was like holy shit cuz the the filling had cracked and there was an infection I had a wound up getting a root canal and so as I'm getting this this thing like opened up they break through this pocket where all this puss and rot is yeah oh dude it was so nasty on awful it like you could hear it like pop through and then just this fucking shit breath like this breath my father's from he was sleeping wife said you have to go to the dentist so why does your breath is so out of control and they've been married for Jesus alright so check this out this is so apparently he had an abscess a sack of bacteria in the back of his mouth well when they when they I guess took the tooth out of the filling out and they popped by accident the sack the nurse through that's I never have the balls to tell someone their breaths to tell me your breath stinks I'm gonna tell you I would want you to tell me that's one cool thing about black people they'll tell you it's a fucking pussy I once got a head from a girl they would she was she would come over and give me a massage she wasn't very good looking but she was down she's gonna give me oral pleasure long time ago a girl's pussy can reek and I'm not gonna but okay but if you're a girl and you you have a problem you have a yeast infection and if someone doesn't let you know you're not gonna get it treated like there's a problem like it's true it's delicate it's a delicate Saul was gonna get a rational reaction thank you medically I feel much better that's not gonna be you isn't that weird they'll get mad at you if they're pussies right well there's a girl that I was in New York I was a young man and she was very sexy and I feel like the Incredible Hulk Isaac should be playing a man with a hat and I remember this weird thing she remember with a hat on I picked her up and she goes good thank God I thought you were gonna be bald I was like it was like 20 Thanks Thanks whatever to ball guys and she and I we got to business and then she began to give me oral pleasure after she was I've gotten her kind of naked and she had hairy but she had a hairy back like you know some people can be super dark there and it was first that it was fine first were first very girl it was girl fur but it's still a problem bro because the hair fanned out it started with the back and it was on the old rum purse still skins and that was very hard for me to keep it I could I had to avert my eyes the only no what was the instant to laugh would be like no here's what the instinct was no no no wasn't I just kind of there's no way I was gonna what do I say yeah yeah there's no good way carry on your back and your rump I mean you know I I just I I just dealt with it I did pull out a medical book on one girl though I liked her a lot so I how does she ended up being my girlfriend I showed her that she had a B vitamin deficiency Wow and that's why I was there was problems down there oh wow she got all into vitamins she was a vitamin freak from that point on and you know what and she was from I knew her in college and I said to her friend I said what happened with her I go you want me to be honest so I said her breath was so bad I could smell it when we were standing at the elevator and she screamed she went oh my god we will always felt that way and they were friends there and I said none of you told her her life is she'll never find somebody if you don't tell her I couldn't tell her guys will tell you quick like a group of guys like Joe you gotta take care of this now I just felt you know I would thank you I think it's important Paige Vanzant loves that jump and switch kiss she does that jumping roundhouse to the fighting by the way his word yeah and Paige Vanzant and who is Clark what is her first name ooh nice leg kick Jessica Clark is that it you just make that up no he said it was like tenth of a joke to it Wow Paige Vanzant is throwing 1/4 wild leaping in shit Casey Halsted head instructor 10th planet Las Vegas is working with her with Clark Paige Clark ain't it funny how I feel bad about telling that story about the girl with the hair on her back in my head it was it was 25 years she's not listening to this don't say you outed me jerk Paige loves that jumping roundhouse kick Paige is busy here yeah but she's she got tagged like several click there yeah this girl Clark has some clean striking good counters yeah now see that was a problem we were talking about the trip the cyborg Holly Holm fight she would get in quick and I love that counter every time Paige is in trouble on her back side control not good what do you wanna do here stand up right away or what if you feel on the bottom your Clark either get garter get up lizard Brian your general you want to do here win drive your fist into her face here kick her ass oh look it's brav I needed you brother ooh standing arm triangle Paige Oh jump to full guard right there yeah yeah yeah yeah right come on you mean what's her name Clark yeah Clark yeah she has an arm triangle but it's much more serious as long as she's in trouble yeah three to go she's in trouble and she doesn't have the best guard now you want to be on the home yeah she's off no no she's still not nearly as bad plenty of space because her elbow yeah just not the elbow from one cross your neck if you're like this you don't extend your arm here you want to be here here's not as good you want to be on the phone but even that somebody's real strong it's not gonna see she wants her right arm to under hook her neck or head but here's the thing she's got to get out of this half guard and she wants to be on the same side as the choke he had his leg in the escape and dontist put him out yeah could you do the impaler you know Eddie you still use that that knee to the chest jet like that knee that that escape where you're holding on to your own knee yeah it's not good enough my guy knows that in Paylor move and he gets that knee to your chest and puts that crash down I like that all day I think the time you spend defending that you're getting your ribs crushed yeah it's so much pressure on you and if you make the decision to try to defend that and push that away you're gonna give up more of the choke and how do you get Tony Ferguson like prepared I mean weird question but with that kind of wrestling and that with the same kind of pressure how do you deal with that kind of pressure with cousin we've been working on that since prepare for Habib really necessarily fighting khabib yeah we don't there's no schedule but that's my prediction it's gonna happen I think that's gonna happen so we've prepared for that you you know when we were working on the Rafael dos Anjos fight we were still thinking wrestling and you know cubs in the mix we have to be working on countering back it's not gonna be easy well it paid off big in the Kevin Lee fight right same camp Kevin means wrestler good passer loves to take the back has a good rear naked choke the same thing yeah it's so Paige is in a lot of trouble here she's just defending and fighting for her life here off the bottom and the Clark has not really advanced any further than this one position where she keeps trying to get this head and arm choke just can't quite get it would you Eddie would you like to see her like in a situation like this which keeps going to it over and over to go which would you like to see her just try to get out that half guard first exactly you know keep the position you know keep that head on the ground keep her arm trapped but you gotta pass the guards just let a nice elbow get to the chopping block okay slice it through now now begin an abduction because Paige went after it okay that right left legs in play oh yeah but almost out oh no she's gonna try smash now half guard is the same whether you're whether you're whether you're trying to pass it or whether you're trying to use it there our submission from half guard and our submissions when you're passing effort they're just hard to pull off it's always easier to get around garden do you remember he's always easy to get around guard first Eddie's always he ghen Machado's version the twister he had a different version but yes yes he asked me to show it to him one day and I was like I was a purple belt and I couldn't believe a black belt a legend like Higa Machado wanted he called me over and wanted a basically a private on the twister yeah and he remembered it wrong and came up with a whole different version so he called it the Higgins twister and only like three people can do it and it's amazing though yeah it's amazing man I'm Ryan Greg he's one of his black belts he he's the best at it it's a crazy I wouldn't know how to show I wouldn't know how to do it right now Oh interest it's weird very strange what what would you know he say that only a few people can do it what's the separating thing like what keeps them from being able to do it it's just so unorthodox and so crazy it's like a some kind of pro wrestling but it's almost works it's legit it's almost like from half guard right like on top in half guard I don't remember that's it just twist the body in a weird way it's kind of nice so in a regular twister you would be underneath with your half guard locked around the left leg and you'd be pulling on the head with your hands clasped together but his was from the top position right it is that Hagen twisted he interest her oh here we go they didn't say that says half guard back take two twister oh this is different that won't that won't be it this is it's got to say hey are I G a n Higgins twister Higgin Machado twister he had his own he might not have ever put it on YouTube probably highly likely did it might be up there someone might know it just came from it that's search that's why I was page gets to take down Jo you can still go back to it might I like I like boxing some dude yeah when I started recently beautiful yeah what Scott Rossi window is where Scott out these days he's teaching at HQ in the daytime daytime and nighttime has a school in Culver City right and or is apply this to Culver City yeah right on that you go there look you're in Venice you're you're near a lot

boxing so much so hard it's so hard it's so fucking hard you mean physically like just tired I had a fucking spar learning how to like slip a jab don't you mr. I'm kicks yeah of course I do so once you take more time I'd like to where's a good school there's got to be a bunch near you dude we anybody who can't find a good MMA or karate or anything school in MMA and oh it's crazy yeah this is the spot I mean how many goddamn jujitsu schools are there Eddie how many 10th planets are there just in LA I'll go to Temple in LA the Southern California area that doesn't say me I went to yeah how many how many 10th plants are there here including San Diego it's not like probably ten isn't that amazing it's crazy some days it's amazing it's crazy it's an almost 100 worldwide guys man amazing that's why Kimberly - tag ballin you earned it yeah for sure work hard you do work hard and you're innovative thank you sir you're both you're an artist I don't think anybody gets by in this crazy competitive world unless you got both you gotta you got to be working hard and you got to be thinking hard you gotta be creative but you also got to be disciplined oh oh now we're talking now we're talking armbar now she's fucked page fucked yeah she's like eight out of ten fucked if you pulled your totally fun now she's fuck the arm bar option under the armpit or you pull it across and get the regular triangle Paige is doing right there is a good move punch her in the face yeah punch her in the face get that arm we're gonna take a man to the arm now fucking toughest time a lot of times but she's got a puller head that's all the full rack of shit wrap them wrap it up wrap it up wrap it up that's cotton I ain't gonna tap man I'm telling you this girl doesn't go to sleep she's not tapping you gonna have to put her sleep damn Paige is toughy show oh are you oh no look at all the time 37 seconds to go and she might make it out I mean I'm all she has an an I'm so impressed with that girl I mean how many girls are as hot as her they're that fucking tough both adorable okay someone's maybe that's cuz I'm an old man it's a quick now no not as good she's dropping bows dropping the heart bows oh why isn't she pulling the head that's what she hasn't really committed to it no notnot pulling the head she was trying to do the legs up she was trying to pull with the last was it there was a Ben Saunders fight he forgot Brian Baker and a fight that I called him he was doing like 10 different moves and he end up losing that fight and and at the end you know he's in the Middle East transitions or whatever and I think my broadcast part of the time goes man this is great transitions I go the problem is nobody taps to a toehold triangle armbar wrist lock it's the one you commit to and too many guys you know five transitions look his transition yeah but the one that gets you is the one you commit to you all the way 100% and he didn't do that enough to ended up rounded up going in a decision but if he chained to one and one stuck you'd be impressed by it right it's all matter of whether or not once did what I didn't see I didn't see that commitment to that one you know what I mean like I think she had the armor and the triangle was kind of halfway with all of them I think she just need to pull ahead yeah if she just grabbed the back of the head and just counted come in your triangle yeah I told about you have faith in your triangle too many people go triangle it doesn't work in two seconds they go to your bar unless I let the guy breathe against and commit to your triangle when you deal with someone letter Paige Vanzant it's the difference between trying to put someone to sleep and trying to make someone tap you can't try to make her tap you got to try to put her sleep I really think that's what you got to do with her this little girls with savage she's a little beautiful savage but she's down two rounds none to me yeah but she still got those crazy switch kicks man she's super athletic with that shit too she goes from the outside and then she commits to these wild jumping roundhouse kicks I gotta run I can fuckin fuck my family well you gotta do what you got to do I know how about you stay for ten more minutes I will all right thanks know what that wasn't a hard sell either did you went right for that you just gave right in Wow I gotta stay here okay yeah you just got to tell your family they can wait it's got the wait on the curb yeah you're in the air Fidel was safety records you know no Guatemala fucking beam it's got that flu for ten days dude we got a fire roll I got a Jew attitude Jimmy are doing a podcast I was coughing stay away from it done now we're down for I was down for I was down for two days but you know why because I saw it coming oh there's that jumping roundhouse kick I saw it coming and I was like you know what this don't feel normal this feels like a little extra so you slept yeah I just stayed in bed got the beautiful thing of being self-employed my son got it fuck his friends got his friends mom's got X yeah my youngest got it she got over in a day like a little Wolverine my kids eat a lot of probiotics man I got a meeting by okay and different probiotics and taking probiotic little snacks fuck it makes a big difference so important you take too many of those she's not about healthy food have you heard of Sheila shot it's a yeah the tar from in from the Himalayas it it's loaded with trace minerals sounds like it's from Himalayas no we taste like garbage yeah supposedly it's a shit she's got to be careful with that over and over and over again going to that well with that jump and round kick because if a girl's got a real good right hand and she times that shit take my right after ya take you right off your feet and you're gonna get fucking hurt because she's throwing it and she's fully committing to it meaning like she throws her arms into it so her hands are down her chins up in the air like it's on a flagpole and it's a beautiful technique if it lands the problem is she KL Beck Roxy she just tried to go do it again like that well is tapped she's going to that well Allah hands it down to it she you know when she Kayode Beck Rawlings with it was so sensational I think that's become like her shit you get hooked on it and they hooked on that feeling I've seen all the time yeah oh Clark is much cleaner with the striking she's doing like basics technical basics and she's got a good timing with her right hand Clark's definitely had two rounds oh for sure for sure see it goes again she's going to it again and he watched when she does it that left hand goes right down to her hips it's a fucking I love danger she might be it's good every now and that but it already just makes her pay every time she comes close with us if you're doing that against a man who Oh she almost landed that flying name hey dude she could land it but what I'm saying is she's making it very obvious that that's her go to shit she does it so often it's an unusual move see she's trying to do it right there she takes his big step and then she tries to jump and throw around it I mean who the fuck does a jumping route she's just two in a row right there who the fuck does this that much yeah here Rodriguez no more than her Hemi then she does it more than him she doesn't more than anybody it's like her go to shit is a chomping switch kick like that's crazy I don't even care of that lands just looks good to get Oh left hand behind it though it does look good at least she's doing something yeah well man she's going after she's behind yeah she's going after she's trying to win by knockout Paige Vanzant it presses the shit out of me and again just keeps cute as a button yep you know cute as a button oh shit fucking barbarian yep good athlete good movement of shields fight last night no patron saint at the broken arm right now she does what she told her corner after the first one which arm which must be the left right yeah yeah yeah the left she's holding yeah yikes Wow that's probably why she keeps doing that that's probably why she keeps doing it yeah it's definitely the left see how she's extending it she's not punch it with it wow that's crazy ouch yeah wow that's fucking nuts man she must get kicked with something oh shit still games still going out still going for it toughest fuck dude well that makes sense now why should you tell the well with that jumping round kick that's that's what she's got from the left side oh damn oh okay to the body it's a good scrap what's her name like parks fundamentals man yeah that's one really good yeah so I'm thinking oh it's a right arm interesting it's a right arm Wow Wow she goes right to the right remember Rich Franklin chuckling yeah clicking you know it's like turn it yeah and Kayode him and you want a broken arm and split his lip open remember that horrible injury yeah you guys

Tim Sylvia Frank Mir yeah yeah and didn't and try to keep fighting remember every boo and Herb Dean it was so much like and then they saw the Republika okay yeah we had it pointed out in the replay too yeah we had to say slow it down slow it down what's that that's a broken arm like that thing is not supposed to bend like all right what was your worst on air in terms of like oh fuck moment Cory Hill and Anderson Silva those two leg breaks yeah both of them I think Cory Hill worse because the referee didn't see it and so I threw my headset off and I jumped up and I was screaming stop the fight stop the fight because the referee was in an odd position and the leg he kicked the legs snapped I saw the leg go rubber I saw his leg go down I saw him go down and then I forget who he's fighting was on top of him hitting him and the referee wasn't it wasn't was on it he just wasn't aware he was in a bad position you know he's looking at the punches being land and he didn't realize that the leg had been snapped those two were the worst there's Cory yeah we did one it was over there and Cory he'll rest in peace he died a few years bearing that in Ghana knock fucking oh so that's the UFC performance Institute I went there two weeks ago when I was in Vegas holy shit is that place impressive yeah I mean have you been there Eddie yeah fuck man amazing dude towing trained there no I had a meeting at EBI mom oh right the UFC oh nice forced force give they gave me how amazing is that place dude it's incredible it's one of the coolest places I've ever seen I was like oh my god I want to live here dude the screen where you can record your sparring and it's like an NFL thing we can write notes and circles and all the shit on and give it to your coach it means they're recording it in 360 degrees so they can look at you from any angle yeah it's fucking incredible it's so cool and then they have all these different recovery stations they have a cryo machine that goes down to like 240 degrees below zero and then up to a hundred and seventy degrees above zero you can go hot cold inside the Machine like which is what the fuck's crazy they're like three pools of different temperatures for like we have they have two pools that are different temperatures one really hot want to run really cold one yeah that's like Ruiz and there's one two you're late that's my video oh okay then there's a treadmill to your left in a pool and that's Angela Hills on that one right here while I'm filming and she's running there she's yeah and treadmill running on this treadmill that left's lifts and lowers and you could watch your running form on these little screens they good see I think I think I cut to the screen she was joking around butter but you check out the the screen and you can see like your form to make sure that your landing ball of the foot first you know with proper running form the fucking whole place is incredible they have sleep pods that you get in there like these lounge chairs and it's like some sci-fi movie with this big egg comes down over like a Darth Vader yeah yeah yeah the sleep pods so you lying down there it's playing music and shit dude off the charts I mean they have everything so last week I'm on your podcast and I can say it now you were talking about the performance center well I've gotten a tour of that when I'm Dana White everybody yeah so anyway amazing yeah we were hoping that we were gonna be able to imagine to time the podcast but things take time paperwork man it takes takes a minute yeah and hey congratulations to our boy Big John McCarthy John called him he'll be very good what good he's the new to me oh really yeah yeah he'll be great at that he'll be great at that I think he's gonna be awesome at that I'm trying to work I didn't know he was living in Vegas yeah yeah he moved got tired of flying to Vegas all time for fights so just fucking move to Vegas that's the kind of guy Big John is he is man but he lives out in the burbs he's not like on this trip going to fucking Hakkasan every night yeah I think he'll do a good job man you know he'd be great he'll be great he's really happy about that person yeah he'll be great you know I mean you talk about a guy who's seen literally every major fight I mean he was the go-to guy for over a decade like every big fight had to have Big John McCarthy as referee you know after a while a lot of guys have gotten like some of the calls for some of the big big fights but yeah he's the gold standard and the guy knows so much about the sport and he's a legit black belt he's not gonna ref anymore no he's not gonna ref anymore a while but he always could go back to it do you know he's got 2 or 3 I might be at least two fake discs in his neck and then I think it might be three and then he just got some shit fuse two down yeah that jujitsu is a motherfucker yeah there's a motherfucker in u-joints man and you're back you hear about so many people I got this thing I want to show you and every grappler should get one of these you should get one for the gym it's called an iron neck and it was created by this guy who is a former football player and he created it to deal with CTE he's like a lot of what these guys are getting they're getting from their head getting snapped and he's like and I think you can mitigate a lot of with neck strength but a lot of the different things that people create for neck strength this is him show me how to do it we got one here so you strap this thing on your head you pump it up it's like a Reebok Pump remember those pumps where you press that it gets real tight to your head and then you're pulling on that bungee cord that black core is 50 pounds of resistance and so I'm pulling back and he's like straightening out my posture and then there's resistance and turning the ban phenomenal I love that thing I love it how often do you do it whenever I want to I have it I have one in my house and have one here so I do it all the time I did it yesterday as part of my workout yesterday I start to start off my workout with it I put that fucker on and I go through a whole series of Stevie Wonder's it was like you have it on your head and you go like this and what it does is you know was real big on it Aaron Pico he loves that thing he said it turned his neck into a weapon hmm you know and for me I I had some pretty big problems with my neck for a while I think from two things from not tapping and two from head and arm chokes because I always I was doing a lot of head and arm chokes on this side pressure on that side always using you know always using your neck you know your neck becomes a part of your game and I never really strengthen my neck other than training and this this has made a big fucking difference is that Johnny answer so does that like a fat guy who looks like Johnny Hendrix it's not Johnny Andrews sorry fat guy you know really fat bro you're not fat you're not you're not ripped like michael johnson but you're not fat I'm just talking shit but that machine is like one of the best methods I've ever found of strengthening your neck stabilizing your neck edit that out let me call that guy fat sometimes you see things you just talk yeah it comes out of your mouth you don't mean I forgot I'm off you listen buddy I'm fat too but this machine actually is not fat at all but this machine is fucking phenomenal I just I'm a Magi Infanta bit you can either have it on a bungee cord or some people put it on one of them cable machines like I'd imagine if you were some Francis in Ghana Oh fella you would want even more resistance oh that's in Austin they're doing that the the on it Jim I'm a big fan of this thing think every grappler in particular because how many people have fuckin neck problems oh I mean it to not have MS weird yeah it is and I'm and I think this is a great machine but I think there's a bunch of other things you should do as well I'm a big believer in shrugs I think for for grapplers just protecting that whole area building up all that muscle in the back area you get them fucking Overeem traps remember Overeem when you have to bream yeah those try believable they started at the top of his ears and we dropped down yep you know what I got recently that I'd like to recommend is you know I have something really wrong with my right shoulder and I like to sleep on my side so sometimes man I wake up in the middle of the night my shoulders sore just from sleeping wrong on it and yeah it sucks putting all your weight on it and after a while fucking and I got the flu like you did to I got it last week for a day I was in bed for 24 hours and man my shoulder was killing me from being sick in bed so I got this pillow that's for people that have acid reflux it's it's as sloped pillow and there's a hole in it where you could put your arm under and you sleep on the side I'm in love with this it's cocina it's called med Klein Madeline it's fun and you could see both both sides and there's like this snake pillow that goes through it so your arm is feeling beautiful there's no pressure on it and you're on your side I'm look at that that's that's a weird-looking dude I'm telling you I'm in love with this thing man it's incredible no Shannon yes I think maybe that's a big part of my shoulder problem maybe I'm thinking cuz I've been wearing yeah just like I sleep on my side and I know that you're not supposed to you supposed to sleep flouting her back but I cannot sleep flat on my back I gotta be on either side I'm always switching one side to the next well when you you started lifting heavy again after you got those cortisone shots you said your shoulder was feeling amazing yeah and then you told me you were doing bench I was like roof like bench is one of the worst things for your shoulder I should have never got a courtesan the shot that was the big mistake right there I got talked into it by a doctor I wanted I went into the doctor to get a prescription for an MRI mm-hmm and I told him when I you know my shoulders been just doesn't heal it's just constantly bothering me and he did a couple tests and he said you don't have any tears but what's wrong is you're the tendon that's connecting your bicep to your shoulder its thrashed but if we put a cortisone shot in there you'll be fine and I grew up a big football fan and I always thought cortisone shots what an athlete takes you know for to play the rest of the game but he's gonna pay for it afterwards but just to get through the game give him a cortisone shot right I thought it was just a painkiller and that's what I told him he said no it's a big myth it actually heals the tendon but I said really said okay so he did it he said don't do shit for ten days I didn't then it actually did it felt amazing and then I started lifting again and I started lifting heavier than ever and then I'm about uh and dude like all the time I started doing your little uh that routine you were talking about some Russian said that you're supposed to do the the same body parts like not just once a week but like you know every time you go and hit the same body parts just don't hit him that hard mm-hmm yeah remember that pressing the groove yeah so that's what I started doing but then I started doing working the same body part every time I went to the jet the gym I did chest hard every time I went to the gym back hard every time I went to the gym I was doing a complete body workouts it just slowly morphed into that and I always wanted to go to failure and then within two months the pain started coming back and then it just slowly progressed and now it's worse than ever so I'm an MRI yeah I am I am I am I just got the prescription for that last week all I got to do is go in now I'm gonna go get that checked man it's such a common injury yeah you know so massive shot a prop but that pillow though is helping yeah that pillow is huge I'm gonna get one that's interesting awesome all right we're about to hit the main event Jeremy Stephens just showed up oh shit Jeremy Stephens he's a tough fucking out in a hundred forty-five pounds yes that's a big 45 er I mean he's fucking big for that weight class and he's coming off of that fight against who the fuck did he just fight he had a real good fight against a veteran where he kicked this shit out of his legs I want to say Jim Miller no but that would be 55 to 13 first regular finishes is amazing yeah yeah right by knockout second go some knockdowns in UFC history he's an animal yeah so he beat Gilbert Melendez most knockdowns in UFC history crazy that's incredible he's fucking animal remember his KO of dos Anjos yep stunning stunning uppercut Oh neck snap an uppercut he's a fucking animal Dennis Bermudez that flying knee against the cage Jeremy Stephens Hannie Jason that head kick whoa he's got a ton of them man that's his thing it's a fucking animal I'm excited about this fight too cuz du haut choi brings it and he's got a clean right hand that right hand comes down the pipe like a piston isn't he going to the Korean army though for a while no no that's chan-sung Jung the Korean Zombie he went two years in the Korean he came by that this guy's got we have compulsory service so I mean maybe yesterday I'll do eventually wow that's a bummer for guys that are like world-class fighters they should think they should give him a little break you know let them put that shit off nope two years baby sacrifice do ho choy here we go baby it is a it is a I mean if from a a ruler standpoint it's actually a great idea I make everybody go to the army for two years right it's not a bad idea if you wanted still patriotism and people to and an understanding of like what it means you have a country you know what is what does it mean to have an armed service if you're just some soft fat little pudgy fuck like me sitting back letting the soldiers do all the work you know if you actually have to go and do it yourself you're actually over there well they got to worry about is North Korea that's it no one else is messing with them well China China is on the side of North Korea that's part of the problem that's a part of our problem with no technically at war most people don't know yeah they sign a ceasefire they never sign an armistice so then there's no peace treaty they just will stop fighting for right just in hell fuck happen Hawaii the other day yeah with us Kevin Slater's Instagram I was like what there was a fake nuclear or a fake missile warning that a missile was coming in and they said it was not a drill like how is that a wrong button kind of thing like go through a few people before it goes out to the whole state option exactly to like say hey I'll call you back I'm driving you know it gets one of the two or three options you can just press that is one of them hey an intercontinental ballistic missiles headed your way Hawaii it's like oh here's weather here's missile and you hit the wrong no it shouldn't work that way should be anywhere near like that the whole state Lee McFarlin was on her Instagram I was like yeah parent same shit I was too unbelievable people were fucking cry and then freaking out apparently yeah I'm her friend lives in Hawaii you know that's a state that's been hit before if I can literally all right so you gotta think mean yeah a memory of Pearl Harbor this people were alive back then plenty of them Jeremy motherfucking Steve hands dum-dum-dum this should be war I am very excited about this certain guys who don't know how to have a boring fight and Jeremy Stephens is one of those guys yeah he's one of them he's a fucking animal and he's looking forward to this fight too stylistically and a lot like the Gilbert Melendez fight yeah I was another guy yep I want to see if he goes right back to that same low calf kick he had so much success with it in that Melendez fight I mean that essentially took Melendez out of his game plan real early he looks like such a wolf with that crazy beard number one boxing didn't let guys have beards well fuck without it people were bitching about Canelo's hair when he fought triple G interest long experience too long it softens a punch yeah I don't buy that at all seems so ridiculous that was like something that they they used to say like you used to have to shave your beard no still it's a big pal Oh duo choy Lin is too hard leg kicks in a row I just can't imagine it realistically softening a punch to make a difference and I mean I kind of slice beard is yeah that thick hair oh there's a nice one by jeremy duo choi it's tall for the weight class man five ten and a half 146 ohm nice this is a you know people complain about weight cutting all the time when you know we've talked about in million times but you see the guy how big these fuckers are you see why they do it I mean it's crazy if you can do it it's worth them what's interesting is what California is doing you know there's a bunch of guys like Marlon like Marlon Maurice they essentially they're not saying that he can't fight 135 again but they're saying dude you're 145 pound fighter who's killing themselves to make me 35 another one by Choi so du haut choice having no right hand over the top by Choni by choice oh shit he looks clean yeah chins up yeah yeah oh he's relying a lot on his ability to read punches with Chinna maybe maybe how do they decide if someone misses weight in a certain weight category two or three times then automatically well that's a good there's no there's no hard fast rule in terms of like how the UFC approaches it it varies depending upon the individual circumstances but with California Andy Foster who's the head of the athletic commission in California is in my opinion one of the best in the world he's real proactive he's super on top of things he and he's instituted a bunch of different weight classes they they've added 6575 there they're adding more weight classes which i think is critical I think that's the future I really think we we spent way too much time with 20-pound gaps in-between Oh jeromy's davis tags him two in a row yeah oh and then a good leg kick as well I think we spent way too much time with a minimal amount of weight classes with these eight weight classes I think we could use more and what they've decided is that if a fighter is a certain weight when they weigh in they can only be a certain weight more when they fight so they're weighing guys when they weigh in and then they're weighing them right before they fight and guys like Marlin he gained a shitload of weight I think he gained 17 pounds sorry if I'm wrong but I think it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 17 pounds which they were like get the fuck out of here with that so what happens when you show up the day of the fight and you're 20 pounds over what do they do I don't think they'd do anything yet I think they're recommending you move up so the real problem would be what what would happen if Marlin mirai's won the title at 135 pounds which he's world class I mean that's that's a real it's certainly a possibility not out of the realm he's gonna be fighting is if everything keeps going well for him the way the al Jemaine sterling knockout was he's gonna wind up fighting for a world title and I think it's a great fight if you win a world title at 135 then your 135 you won that title right right right yeah I mean he made it right but the UFC and you know also the California State Athletic Commission even Nevada now they're trying to do something which I think is important to do something about these fucking heavyweight what where she talked about this fights fights crazy yeah it's really good well somewhere they were talking about if you if you if you missed weight you weren't allowed to fight at that weight class for your next fight I don't remember where they were they were talking about doing that though smart - that was yeah that was a plan I heard that's where you come on commissioner a george lockhart or a Dulce or someone who has a wealth of it Jeremy Stephens could take it too that's the thing about he has a tendency to come forward when he's hurt he just wants to throw more he wants to get you back yeah he's not a recoup and figured out kind of guy he wants some payback he's a fucking Savage that's why he's so fun he's looking for something though he gets creative in there though I mean he'll ooh snappy jab by Troy ooh choice got some clean technique man oh yeah firefight and good footwork by Troy to who he goes to the body goes the body with that left hook and he invites him in by keeping the hands just low enough to bait Jeremy Stephens in but he's reading the punch it's really really well he keeps tagging that fucking left leg of Stevens that last one was strong who is a fiber to right of course ma'am an event that's a weird argument right like woody like when they changed the main events to five rounds not just world title fights right main events I like that yeah more rounds the better yeah they should have more five round fights definitely get you thinking look you'll you'll figure out who the fuck is the best fighter because oftentimes things start getting weird around the fourth round but fighters make the argument I've heard this argument before like you only have so many five round fights in your body yeah and when you're using them up on these fights we're trying to get to a world title like by the time you get there those fourth and fifth rounds are there they're taking a toll on you we could we could potentially see guys with shorter careers because of that yeah well also think about what goes into a camp for a five-round fight I mean it's five rounds harder for eight weeks ten weeks are you starting to get into I had this camp for a five-round fight so the camp itself is harder to and you only you know you only have so many those in you yeah there's no there's no arguing that it's like boxing you know used to be 15 rounds and they went you know those last three yeah really a killer well I think was that doctor koop him that was the fire great boom-boom Mancini what a fight that was and that was another weight cut issue yeah that was back when they used to make them way in the day of the yah-hoo front kick to the face yeah referee community say did he really yes he did goddamn which referee was that I don't I that I don't I don't remember his name I know he took his life oh man already got suicided to the body Oh Oh Jeremy Stephens with the right knee left knee throws like he stole something from him Jeremy it throws hey makers he ticked he tagged him with that right hand who the fuck is more savage than Jeremy Stephens not many Oh switch elbow pulled by Troy nice look like a jab then turned it over and a leg kick of a strong leg kick by Troy well and a lot of people would hesitate at this point to throw that many leg kicks when the guys got a right hand like that and he's not hesitating no he's like barely prepared well to avoid it and to counter make him pay in that long long stiff jab of his helps to get a little reach advantage as well Jeremy's about I think Jeremy's five eight and a half so he's inch and a half taller maybe two inches taller Oh beautiful timing with that right hand snapped his head back Oh nice jab to there Jeremy Jeremy getting that timing down Troy's taking it well though yep well he took it well in that cups Watson yeah he took a hard leg kick there too now he's so tied start an eternal walking him down he's walked him down switching legs and looking for those big shots throwing throwing some off-speed punches to close the distance I think a couple of check less would be good for him choice coming in once again with that head straight up but Stevens just loves walking forward man well he's such a fucking animal yeah I mean he just loves these firefights that the opportunity to test who's the tougher guy and especially at 145 this just might be it I was good good leaping shot staying with the left hand Wow what a fuckin right hand is an animal 200 that guy's fucked dad I'm a beautiful play it all oh man that's beautiful whoo what a fight too huh but as soon as that tide turned as soon as he felt like I can walk through these punches it was over yeah fucking animal guys a savage he's such a savage Jeremy Stephens great stuff and fuck that was awesome whoo and he could do that to anybody that's the thing he takes it so well and his that attitude that he's got that fucking ferocious attitude now here's what's real impressive hmm you think about choice war with Cub Swanson and you think Jeremy Stephens just smashed him that's not it to me that he got front kicked in the face kind of was almost like a crescent kick took it on the side boom right hand boom snapped him back with that one that was the beginning that was beginning that was the head snapper that was it and that went over the top he caught him right on the temple and his legs going oh look at that Jesus Christ that's the big one oh my goodness boom that was great boom good job fuck hell yeah good stuff man it's good fucking fight well boys Stephens always gonna be that guy didn't do that leg toss big over at right head mm-hmm what was it King mo Seth Petrocelli do you see that one he cleared his legs and bombed him and out I mean Eyes Wide Shut was crazy now he fought max Holloway correct Stephens yeah probably and I feel like max Holloway beat him in a clear decision see if you pull that up I think max Holloway beat him on the way up to the title you know it was a good fight too for Holloway he really avoided all Jeremy Stephens stuff yeah there you go my son max Holloway decision he animist but that was in 2015 little over three years ago to December of 2015 interesting you know gotta think with a KO like that he's like one maybe two fights outside of another possible shot or a possible shot at max now that Max has the title I like that I like that a lot very interesting but once again always fun to watch he's fuckin always watch him you always watch him so much fun so next week is the big world title fight the heavyweight division and what it was the undercard looked like Jamie pull up the full undercard for Francis and Donald versus T pay Miocic I think this is like the most important heavyweight title fight that I can remember I don't remember a heavyweight title fight that people are biggest one in a long time yeah because let's get on steep he has a history side yeah he has the I can be the greatest of all time or amongst them and yeah I think you turn it down or so scary yeah yeah the last time I think I was this interested in the fight was Junior dos Santos versus Kane won yeah here we go so we got ste paid versus Francis as the main event Oh Daniel Cormier versus volcon owes Damir that's interesting let's volcon like he got a quick ride to the title you know I mean he beats OSP in a real close decision knocks out sir kun off then knocks out Jimmy Manawa whenever is like holy shit three fights in and then boom next fight is fighting Cormier it's just the way he was able to knock out Manoa and Sakura off people like listen let's see it and also I mean it's division where there was room for that new guy and he was you know the right guy we've seen a million times the right guy at the right time right guy at the right time and by all accounts in the gym he was one of the only guy that was sparring with Rumble on a daily basis yeah whose rumbles main guy which is that says a lot oh yes it does rumbles talking about coming back as a heavyweight check out the shot right here oh no I didn't show it that was before yeah the one big one the big the leg toss they showed the big shot but they didn't show it set it up here is boom that was nice yeah and then the side nope no more yeah stands up Chuck sent us right just because they know you is the lefty through the left leg or his left arm on the right leg fuck yeah man I feel like he's at the top of the heap now so who else we got here interesting the big fights the two big fights obviously the life of you a title in the heavyweight title which is really rare that you have I'm so out that mixed with UFC most of that card I don't know any of those fighters like the bottom half of that main card I know Thomas Almeida that's it yeah there's so many guys man Rob font Thomas something is it good yeah that's me again that's very interesting Rob fonts a Boston guy - he's one adela grottoes guys that should be a lot of fun so Jimmy Smith when's the first time they have you working well I'm doing the pre and post for 220 okay in California yeah Fox yeah and then they have they've they've offered me a couple and I've accepted them but they haven't announced yes I don't know officially okay but soon soon I'll put it they just color I'm assuming they just trust you all right you don't have to do any bullshit like test shows or anything like that cuz I've heard of guys I've heard you guys doing test shows they try people out not that I'm aware of no I'm answer me yeah I mean obviously you know what the fuck yeah it's I would imagine that though the real hard gig has got to be finding one them play-by-play guys that doesn't annoy the shit here's that's a real job like that colors colors easy doing play-by-play that's a real job do a lot moves anchor what's that but the difference in color and play-by-play is is we're specific to a particular sport and we can call grappling and combat sports and whatever play-by-play guys do I'll do basketball one week and then hockey and this is nice it's it's a job but there are a lot more of them you can go okay he's good at basketball in soccer you can see a body of work before they jump in color a lot of times it's we need a guy who knows a sport and there are only so many the control yeah it's a very different job very different skill set but people get real angry if you don't know MMA if you're like a play-by-play guy and you say some goofy shit and you don't really know the sporty forgive you either they don't if they don't think you really know the sport I really love the sport those two things are critical yeah you have to really know it and really love it although otherwise they're like fuck you people hated me when i when i commentate show the big Jeremy Stephens haymaker I sucked oh my god well I was terrible you think of it as you know what you were really good at you were really good as the guy in between the rounds that was explaining who won the fight like when you you and I people don't remember this but we work together it would be Goldberg and me and then for a bunch of cards you would be beside us guy yeah so he had but Eddie had a real system like we talked about it and I was like how are you doing this and he had a like a really well thought out system where he had a line down a piece of paper and he had a bunch of categories and he had all these different things where there was takedowns or and so he marked all these things on top of watching the fight he wanted to know like we'll be able to look down on it like you know he landed all these right hands he yeah I could look at the end of the fight they go to me I have to talk about what happened in the first I gave him the second cuz remember that second he had two takedowns but if I didn't write it down I would forget ya so as I'm waiting to go on I'm revealing that first round I'm you know it's it's a lot easier to see what would actually happen because you forget or anyways I do I would forget unless I wrote it down the funniest thing to me or the most frustrating news is they wanted me to do scorecards unofficial scorecard you know whatever just like you did and I would do it and every time I never wrote down a number without explaining what I was talking about I gave it ten nights close round but I gave it cuz of this this and this and people would always act like you just threw out a fucking none without saying what was he thinking I said what I was thinking I never just wrote down nine ten I always said and here's why here's you may disagree but here's my logic behind what I'm saying you can disagree with me fine but the people that I just write down a number that explain it's insane post fight interview once I said congratulations to Randy Couture's that congratulations Chuck who was it Joe Silva goes dude he said congratulations Chuck I said what what and I went up to Jonah that dude did I say congratulations Chuck he goes you go yes I'm like oh no I can talk about this because we joke about it we joked about in belt of it but uh Jen Brown one time we were in and it was alive it was a live piece it was just to the house so it didn't go out on air or anything was just for the house Jim Brown football Jim Brown no no Jim Brown Jim Brown doesn't stand up stuff for both we were in Nashville Oklahoma and she said we had been in Kansas the week before she goes hey Kansas and the place she goes to our producer she goes oh you know that they really didn't much and she and the guy goes you said Kansas we're in Oklahoma I love Jambo Dyke yeah for weeks it was what stay to engine we just met forever but it was just an in-house piece it didn't go out on TV I was the last lucky over a thousand fuck oh man the brain just doesn't work perfect you make mistake sometimes which drives me crazy is I have a very good recall for fights and for scenarios and positions of people been in and ways guys won but occasionally there'll be a guy and I can't remember its fuckin name and it's like weird it's but it's a guy that I've seen fight I like Jorge Mazda or someone like that but I see a fight a hundred times like how fucked like why isn't that one coming out it's like the brain is just not a perfect vehicle it just doesn't always work right it's like a Range Rover they look beautiful the Range Rovers work most of the time I have a friend who has a Range Rover and I asked him I said hey do you like that cars like yeah this is my second one my last one was a lemon I fucking knew it he's like it's a great car it's me when it drives was amazing it's but that's like how a brain is it's just not always good so you saying congratulations Chuck and then leave and you're like oh watch fights not necessarily yours of course but I'll watch somebody calling the fight and I'll know when they spaced on the name they'll start going you know that pause and you're watching you go he's based on his name dude it's almost a basketball football whatever yeah I'll go I'll know as a broadcaster I'm like he's space yeah he looked at his notes yeah got the name back but he's based on the fucking name happens all the time my big fear is that I'm going to be interviewing a fighter after a fight and then I can't remember their name when I congratulate them the biggest fear bro I know that's not just you do that mine too before I go out there I will write it like if it's a dude I've never seen quite before or maybe one by first-round knockout I've never seen a fight before I'm on bullshit who is this guy he might have come from you know CFA or something like that and there I'll write his name down I'll read it I'll say it back I'll repeat you you might see me walking to the stage to the cage and I got my earpiece in I'm saying you know buh buh buh buh buh buh buh I'm saying his name I don't wanna fuck it up you are not alone though do that fear is huge question to you about what to ask and and we'll be on air immersing this we time out interviewing fires is a literally the hardest part of the job to prepare for and then you have time to ask him one maybe two questions that said no everyone has their own question in their own head that they want to ask and if you don't come up with something entertaining or creative you know people talk shit on you yeah it's also very important this is where I tell people that are just trying to now for the first time and then anybody any young people that are thinking about getting in MMA commentary you're that you're not the show like you you are you are just trying to extract information out of this person like your question should be just to lead them I try to have as little personality and those things as possible I'm just trying to just give you the platform yeah just trying to give you maybe a path to take your answer I saw some beautiful things happen in the fight I want you to express what happened in your mind or maybe there's some adversity that you had to go through I want to know how bad it was but I don't want to be there I'm just I'm just the guy that has to say those words yeah I hated post-fight interview I never enjoyed that shit the flip side of that though that I've run into personally um you know overdoing it too is if your question isn't a you know hey great performance tonight man if it's too open and a lot of times they go yeah you know what if you don't ask him something a little specific right those just kind of go yeah yeah yeah you know if you don't say oh great you know they're tired they're out of breath yeah so it's that you want them to go wherever they want to go but also if you don't ask something specific enough sometimes they'll go yeah it was shitty with some of the dozens with a translator and forth but honestly sometimes it gives you more time I always try to talk slow and give them something I trust I what I'm saying but I even then I still sometimes I fucked that up you know it's just it's one of the weirder jobs yeah I never liked it I never liked that at all I never really liked commentating either I try to get DC when DC was doing it cuz DC was doing a few of them like we were doing it and I go oh that's your job now bro he's like you're doing that Joe Rogan get in there I go no no no man I mean you're doing a good job I like sitting here I'm just gonna sit back he's like fuck that because he was doing like the fighting past prelim ones unless you're in the industry you'd be surprised how many people don't realize that there's a play-by-play guy and a color they just see two dudes talking yeah they don't know I didn't I was a grown-ass man when I first got offered the job for king of the cage I didn't know the difference I just thought yeah there's two dudes two old dudes talking to they're just chit-chatting I didn't see the system in the and the honor there's a problem though the problem in MMA is that the color guy is the martial arts expert yes and the weight isn't foot but the play-by-play guy is this the news guy is just the guy but the play-by-play guy in sports is kind of calling what's happening as well he's saying you know they're moving the ball they're doing this they're going this this formation but you're calling a fight especially when the fight goes to the ground that play-by-play guys not really saying anything right yeah he could say he's in the mount in the mount taking big shots in the mouth you don't have to be an expert a little bit but he's basically he's like like when golde golde and I had a great rhythm cuz Goldy like kind of laid out window especially when it would go to the ground he would lay off and he would just sort of like you know he would set me up like he'd say and he moves into the mount position or he would say you know something like that and then he would lay it up for me and then I would elaborate on the progression of techniques and where they were at yeah that supposed to be one that's the hardest motherfucking job ever I didn't know so I get this job but Bret's men he takes over the production part of king of the cage and he wants to use me as a commentator because we went to the producer and I went to John Jacques Machado Academy he knew me as the MMA fanatic guy and he asked me if I wanted to commentate and I said yeah fuck I'll try it I didn't know shit those first king of the cages he didn't know that what that was a difference between a play by planet color guy the producer didn't know the difference because once I started really listening to the broadcast in the UFC I started listening to the opening and how they open shit like oh there's two jabs here this guy's this guy is just a news Telecaster and this other guy is the expert didn't even really realize that I thought they were both experts they just talked I thought I thought there were two totally different jobs so that yes exactly once I realized that I talked about I said hey listen there's two jobs going on I don't wanna be the play-by-play guy I want to be the color guy he said do both you're gonna do both I go all sports don't have guys to do both you have a color guy and you have a play just the two the producer guys wanted to defer that he'd never done sports before so he didn't understand he just said dude you're gonna do both both of you me and don the dragon Wilson we're winging it he was so bad what's it homage apparel sand up to these days I have no idea I have no idea but those are some of the worse shows ever for commentary some shit for pride 210 pride time with the hens oh and Sakuraba sure got head-butted by Wanderlei show you you were saying that Enzo that Sakura would never gonna submit hens oh yes that's one of the biggest blunders ever Sakuraba has whippin in there standing and I said I'm in the commentary yeah I said that may work at his gym but that tends Oh Gracie it's never gonna work on him and then boom he breaks his off on cue there was a guy ed West ed Wild West was fighting and he had never knocked anybody out really good strike but like you know hitter packing on striker and I literally said man Ed's Lynn and great but not a knockout guy and he instantly knocks him out first one of his career right there he did that just to make me fucking look stupid it's almost like the universe is punishing you for hubris like you're pretending you know more than you do seriously going probably will that was you don't know there was this one fight Fernando Vasconcellos fought this one guy and he schooled them one of the great guy Richard you never really did it fuck reason king of the cage member that he was and that he in a fight that he won cuz he won I think two straight he was he had good hands and he wrestled and he had a guy he passed the guys guard had him in north/south and I said this position is called some people call it north-south but if you look in an old judo books it's actually called the tea bag and then I just kept going and Don the dragon eggs I never stopped [Music] taken seriously moms and bud loved it the territory trouble cop the owner hated it he hated it but love with the producer loved that every now and then I would say some crazy wild shit but Terry hated and the director no no no Terry loved it what am I saying the director Steve he hated it he was begging me to stop because I was directors tend to be yeah nobody but the owner didn't care he loved it so anyways I sucked regardless but I'm a retard know where we want to be I'm not born to commentate that's not my thing I look like now when people offer me jobs like I'm like I don't want to commentate I want to just enjoy the fight just said Dana when he forced me into doing it don't you remember when you and I used to get free tickets I don't want you and I want to watch it I just relax you and commentary because I would get free tickets from the UFC this is like when the UFC first started going to Vegas yeah and Eddie and I were like do you have season Vegas this is crazy we gotta go and Dana White somehow or another found out that I was a fan so he started sending me he's like hey we'll fly out we'll give you free tickets like fuck yeah and so we started going and hanging out with them and I started doing commentary because when we'd hang out I'd be like have you ever seen Sakurai you do watch pride what do you watch overseas like if you've seen any of the Sciuto fights I'm like you gotta see this guy and I start telling about this guy and that guy and he should go is my favorite man yeah oh yeah amazing amazing fights so I started talking about all these crazy fights he had never heard of and he's like do you want to commentary I'm the next thing he knows like oh I don't want to do that I don't want to work and then boom I did then 18 shows for free I was sitting alone for a type of show all by myself VIP front rows I didn't come here to be by myself we saw some classic shit though if you really if you think about like the history of the sport like the history of boxing is an amazing history right but boxing from 1994 and boxing from 2017 18s not incredibly different yeah I mean there there's there definitely I think in all sports the fighters get better and better but you know you're talking about like Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield and then you look at like what we got today for heavyweight it's like arguably as good if not better back then right but not an MMA you've seen giant leaps and changes in the sport I was telling something I said Jack Johnson has more in common with a modern heavyweight then and then a mixed martial artist does with a mixed martial arts in elite you're a hundred percent right by a lot 100 percent by a lot Jack Johnson might be able to beat yeah a lot of some stuff yeah he can compete of course sure yeah you take I mean you go to teach him anything if you put him in there against some you know top thirty heavyweight that you know nobody knows guys are like not that athletic not that good kind of okay he'll fuck a lot of people up and then he would start making his way through the ranks my favorite Jack Johnson story of all time he gets pulled over speeding the the the the cop says you're speeding it's 50 bucks he gives him a hundred bucks he goes I'm gonna be coming back the same way in about an hour just take a hun awesome cuz I'm gonna be speeding again bitch yeah and I'm gonna be fuckin a lot of white chicks unforgivably blackness if you haven't seen that documentary he's he's one of the best routes of fight shirts the Galveston giant its roots of fight shirts with him was wingspan on the front of the shirt there was I I used to box with a guy when I hadn't when I had a gym and he was our boxing night he had the history of the heavyweight title memorized Wow so you give him any year and he would tell you he's one of those guys I had to memorize every president for what you in order when I was a history major it's kind of thing you just never let go once you have to do it you're you're screwed right you don't want to unlearn yeah yeah you can't once you once you once you're stuck and then they in the 90s was fucking right no winter in it the UFC was huge and there was no fucking internet huh and the first taste of MMA and you know to get any kind of fights you know like Brazilian fights you had to go to these specialty video stores like you know Japanese stores were yeah they they you rent taped TV shows and the commercials and it would take yeah they was on the commercial you'd watch judo and on TV from Japan there's a place in Little Tokyo where I used to go Little Tokyo here in LA and when I was in college when I was you see I started doing jujitsu and I should go in there and the guy didn't speak English and I went to the front I'm trying to explain him what I'm looking for so I knew I had to go to like a Japanese store and I literally said I sell it since you don't stand me and I said look then I said rumah no sato and he goes oh and he points to this wall and it's just covered covered in Sciuto and pride and pancreas and then we pulled it off TV and I went in there like every two days to get three more and so I just you couldn't find him anywhere yeah Tokyo that the card for the video store was in Japanese I could read it and there was Brazilian scene you know Federico lepen de and Rowley these are the two promoters in Brazil that valid mega fives and Allatoona Serge Alberto le and Federico LaPenta were the two Dana White's down in Brazil in the 90s before the internet and I remember my first taste of MMA news on the internet was that Todd white my training partner were both purple belts he was a cartoon a cartoonist at Nickelodeon and at Nickelodeon they had a they had the Internet there so when everyone was gone during lunch dude we would we would do drills at Nickelodeon in their gym that an awesome gem I would drive down there and he would take his lunch in the gym and we would do jiu-jitsu and then if like five or ten minutes left over we would like sneak into the offices and go into the internet and all I wanted all I wanted to see was the Abu Dhabi combat Club remember that that was the first news there was the only place really that year again who's from these resilient shows that was a website MMA yeah anime in the 90s was alive and well you know you know there was a heart that was a big hardcore movement but there was no internet yeah that's huge I mean Wayne and I mean we talked about last time you know weighing in on a bathroom scale in Cibola and out of desert somewhere and it's just you just wanted to do it you just you wanted to be part of it you didn't you know it's it's hard to understand you I got paid 150 bucks for my first fight or something and and you JIT well first I didn't get bit neutral grounds fuck that my first fight man I fought somebody from submission factory when Leary landless is old camp and my coach was Fabio me huh he called me and he goes he goes it was Friday and he goes what are you doing Sunday and I went nothing and he goes you want to fight I'm fighting in the back of it was like in the back of a club someone that set up a rally actually really big cage and I went yeah sure and they lined this up against the wall and I was next to this dude and they went you're about the same size you and him like they lined us up I was like how big you were because they didn't have scale anything and they go you and this dude and I went okay and I was a 13th bite out of 13 fights and I got in there and they said all right Stu five-minute rounds because the rounds were all weird back then people don't remember it was like three three-minute rounds two five-minute rounds or whatever that you know Kincaid's lot of times with two five-minute rounds yeah I don't know why so I get in there and I remember thinking to myself I didn't train for this I've been doing jujitsu nine months so I'm just giving everything half of the first five minutes because I don't think I have anymore that and the I wonder what I'm gonna do and the bell went off that dude fucking sprint it at me and I hit him and knocked him down and I gotta been Fabiano's farside horn barber oh oh 29 seconds and that was my first fight and I was like okay alright fine my first coach he was one of the famous he was a Brazilian hopeful like after hoist every all Americans that were in digit so we were we were we'd like the Brazilians more than American jujitsu and we were white we would be on the Brazilian side and any MMA fight because you you you find out real quick that style is thicker than blood yeah you know you don't care how about well Minotauro beep Bob sack you're right you need go out yes oh shit knee popped out Eddie Bravo has what I believe is probably a bucket handle tear of this meniscus and his meniscus will pop out and it locks okay just - mess straighten it out sure all right let me know if you need anything what do you do

leg up like this I fucked up can you pause this a break we won this back I want you I want to play this video for you guys cuz I I call this video the thirsty white people video like back this up this is one of them testosterone videos Thomas keep me soon give me some volume okay no take it from the beginning go to the hall and yeah and give me some volume like pause it for a second okay now give me some volume so we could all hear this is the thirstiest white-people video ever these white people are gawking about what's the gentleman's name Frank Frank Thomas is a big-ass football player who's a baseball player whatever the fuck use whatever hit a ball but here's the things sorry big ass professional athlete yes but happens to be an african-american listen to how thirsty these white people sound when they're talking about him go ahead play it okay do it again so people can hear listen this partner it's what's your secret I wish my husband did Jesus Christ new Jetta take eugenics I wish my husband did she's standing right next to him just begging for the white people commercial ever oh that's a gay friend no she said or hunk she said or no that's her husband she's making him feel like shit look at him and this guy's your bench-pressing and shit and throwing dick at all the white chicks in the gym guaranteed how does he not the Arab literally backing that pussy up into a catapult launch it Adam I wish my husband did money look it says smash see that in the text and the text message it says smash they're talking about smash and pussy that's what that's what dude stay when they say what happened oh I smashed it that's what they say it says that in the thing it says smash what are you smashing yeah god damn it that's a thirsty white people commercial smash you want to stuff now that's just what I'm curious about you and then at work is it effective I mean it might work probably bullshit but but what's not bullshit is the love that those white people have for that black athlete more like a hunk she's got a husband and then the other lady is saying I wish my husband did slow down thirsty white people slow the fuck down well there's a replay oh boy yeah mekin come on interesting interesting Oh see right there that's spinning backfist he got tagged showed some good goddamn wrestling now then all entertaining fights to card all around yeah it was a very good card very hard very good card very interesting I'm so curious about next weekend I mean it's only six days away from today yeah I'm so curious what do you think about the switch you guys were talking about the wrestling move the switches you think how important do you think that is to train in an MMA how do these huge I think it's very important to know for sure it's just one of many components but it seems like an important move you'd think you'd see it more well Russell's use all the time wrestlers but in MMA yeah I know it's a wrestling me but in MMA you'd think you'd see it more you see once every four years Yeah right you don't see that I didn't see it at all until a few years ago it's like wrestlers just started doing it yeah like you don't think you'd see it all the goddamn time yeah mmm it's good move so I just you know it's in our warm-ups and everything I just wanted your opinion yeah if is it necessary you never seen so much I think it's okay idea I was gotta be right yeah I teach you guys all time I think it's great personally I think it's gonna move tomorrow ooh spawn talking mad shit I wish I could've heard what he I said Paul felt it with a beautiful pocket square and a nice watch look at him handsome that's a nice suit looks good it's a big launch kit again though can you wear it again you could wear it you can wear the suit again yeah as in then nobody there cuz Bruce Buffer has a different outfit every show he can't he doesn't wear the same one twice well let me just tell you David August makes all the suits for the commentary team on the UFC he makes my suits and hee hee tailors them to you perfectly see that one that's on Paul or if you see the ones on me I'm a slob man I would never bought those suits on my own I'm too stupid yeah they had to bring somebody in but since then I had him make me some stuff as well yeah I had him I hired him to make damn Darren tails number seven one fight with cowboy and he's number seven above Neil Magny which is crazy that's interesting but yeah so the UFC makes you a few suits I got a couple different color suits nice like three or four different once in black shirt anymore well I have black shirts but now I have like real close real black shirts of black like an adult I never wear black shirts because so much shit every time I totally I throw away I had black shirts to go with everything I fucking threw all the more people at home by the way Eddie Bravo outside as I pulled up thought I was Joe mistook me for walked up to me like I do oh hey Jimmy I was like he fucking thought I was just and he goes thought you were Joe dude and I was like with an old Bhaskar so yeah I don't work fucking black shirt I'm so sorry thank you that's fucked up is that your ball before me I was fucking freaked out yeah but it's cool man apologize that's all right no no it's just an illustration of the natural my mom got us confused one time I'm not even fucking joke oh no I told you I was at my mom's house she was making me dinner mom she's amazing cook she's Greek you guys have to come over and have dinner sometime so we came I went to her house she's making me dinner and we're watching the UFC she turns around she goes oh this is one of yours no mom that's Joe Rogan and she goes she fucking pause she goes man he looks like you as a thanks mom I think the Sheikh fucking 50 times a day the Internet I'm gonna get this from my own mother but I still eat the food you got I forget but one of the things about you do you don't toot your own horn it's like your general like universally respected thanking with people that know the sport you know which is why I was campaigning to get you hired by the UFC years ago I'm like this guy's the shit hasn't stopped fine Schwartz I'm excited man and I'm excited too for Big John I love John and I'm excited he got that gig I hope that really works out well for him and I think it's gonna be interesting I understand completely kind of the step and then I don't recall a referee ever doing comedy he did affliction he did the first affliction show but it's a different perspective he's seeing it from an angle that no fighter or coach is really gonna see yeah and so I think it's great cuz any you know any fighter is gonna be compared to all the other fighters into it a referee he's just gonna have a different perspective and I think that's a good choice if he does it with John or if John does it with Mike Goldberg and John are real good friends first show is Micah that's brief I'd only utiful don't quote they're real good friends so that should just be real easy yeah Mike's easy to work with he's crikes easy to work with uh Morrow was - both guys were easy to work with they're very different but both guys were easy to work with man I was I was impressed with both them yeah myk's myk's a sweetheart look we need more work for a lot of guys but yeah what for what we do there's not a lot of guys that do it you know this Paul Felder who I think does a fucking phenomenal job and I would have loved to listen to him tonight if we weren't yapping but he does a great job he's a smooth smooth guy very smooth I think Dan Hardy does a great job you know Brian Stann was one of my favorites I was bummed out Brian left yeah he prepared better than anybody Brian Stann will pull out shit about training and all these different weird things you didn't know about preparation and other what things that fighters dude that this guy did that was unusual and like whoa his preparation was top of the food chain it's a full-time job people don't get that you know in terms of like you know when I'm not doing commentary I'm studying fights all time because I'm not just watching them I got to sit there and study them which is a totally different job what's fun is Joe never done her shit myself Joe would just walk on and just crash with no preparation maybe a couple of thoughts couple notes but he wasn't preparing at all hilarious too easy all the things I do live you think about how much stand-up I do live yeah then how much podcast I do live like this before the podcast true that is true yeah well you know the thing was they they wanted to have like some sort of planned out interaction between like that's one of the things that people would freak out about like when we would do the beginning of the fight and goldware bolt Goldberg would say like Matt Hughes fights Frank Trigg for the UFC welterweight title you know and this is an important fight he wouldn't know what the fuck I was gonna say know what he was gonna say I didn't know what I was gonna say I had no idea but I knew about the fight yeah my point was like it's better to be in the moment and really care about this fight and care about what I think is gonna happen and not have anything planned out I just wanted to be able to go this is what's critical in this fight and we're gonna know early on whether or not you know the fights gonna go one way or other based on a couple of parameters and I would just go into those things and and then after it'd be over I worked out yeah but for you man no I don't need the Godfather a hundred percent but but but what I what I tell people don't write down you'll think about what did I write down rather than the I tell people I go never play-by-play to you of course but I go color don't write down notes or don't write down here's what I'm gonna say because we're gonna start thinking about what you wrote down you sound fake and you'll sound fake it doesn't work have a couple bullet points in your head yeah you know what you want to hit just know the two bullet points and you'll get through the open and it opens you know I think the two most 15 seconds the two most important things are you got to actually care like this has to be important to you like wouldn't like Frances like I'm thinking about Frances is deep a all fucking day I'm gonna think about them all day tomorrow I'm gonna I'm bored and I'm in the middle of doing something else I'm gonna think what the fuck is gonna happen next Saturday night yeah so you got a care it has to mean something to you and you have to know what you're talking about so you have to understand the sport you have to have a deep knowledge in it you have to really care and then it should just sort of work itself out like if you've thought about it and you like okay here's what's gonna happen steep eights got to get the clinch he's got to figure out a way to he doesn't want to stand on the outside with that guy you guys got these crazy long arms and you can't make a mistake one punch puts you into orbit so you have to you have to be real careful with your clothes in the distance you get a clich off and then that I think if if you go into it that way if you really understand fighting and you really care about what's going on it's just a matter of expressing yourself the two things that separate the men from the boys in commentary and I'm like this is this is the honest truth to me is number two and I will always text like you or Anik or something when there are a lot of knockouts early in a fight I'll beg how's it going because that's when it's like we have to fill all this time because you understand in TV is they've booked a two-hour TV show or through our pay-per-view whatever is they got to fill X amount of minutes period doesn't matter what happens so they either use fights that they've already used or Jimmy get up and interview the spider and we need five minutes like right now so that's when the tap dance is a lot of early knockouts you have to fill a lot of time that's tough the second one is when you have a 25-minute snooze fest and you're going oh I gotta think of some those are the two parts that are really challenged our interviews are but it turns in commentary those two were tough when there's literally knockouts or long boring fights that you have you've never heard of the fighter just a whole car was just a bunch of guys rookies back in 2001 2002 just and man it wasn't fun 25 fights in a fucking nightmare it used to be all fucking challenged let me off again I got 200 bucks a fight in the fucking thing yeah you remember the hit man show where they pretended God Bablu and chill but there was real fights there were real fights but they were like hey we're filming a show start the beginning it's fake so they got around the MMA rules by saying that it was like fake yeah moving this is famous it's a movie it's a famous thing here in California for the listeners who weren't around MMA wasn't legal so what they did is that they pretended they were shooting a movie and they remember that the cards for the fight said like hitman the movie yeah remember that and on the back it had the fight card on it it was a real fight card but they pretended that we're filming a movie yeah and so the cops showed up and said oh yeah then who wins the fights if this is fake and they that's why that night they just chose winners even didn't matter who won and so for a while those people had goofy records until they limited him this is a famous cow do you remember how the cops showed up and and they had to like oh yeah this is fake jail wins or whatever I forget in one but they just raised his hand even though he didn't win and so - so the cops wouldn't wouldn't bust everybody but that's yeah the famous hit man show hit man the movie I remember that back in the day did back in the day listen we should get we got to wrap this up but I just want to say that it's been real cool to be friends with you all these years while you were working for Bellator it always meant a lot to me that you and I were never weird even though we were both doing the same job for other organizations we were both really cool I got you tickets to UFC before we hung out a bunch of times you did the podcast bunch times and we would text back and forth all the time I would text him with about our fights are going on he went crazy UFC fights are going on so like during the fight sometimes I text and Jimmy we'd be going back and forth it meant a lot to me that we were tight it did and it means a lot to me now that you're at the UFC I love it well they're very happy I wouldn't be there without you I wouldn't and I'm I'm happy everybody knows that I mean it's like you know it's it's it's it's meant a lot to me that that you didn't you reached out to me when I first left Bellator and you said keep your head up man you're the best and I didn't know you knew who I was and that's where things started and it was the first time I realized man people outside this bubble actually have any idea who I am and you didn't have to do that and it's meant a lot for years and it's I'm just thrilled that it finally worked out and won the same spot man I'm so smart amazing dude man I really appreciate you are too man and you're really fuckin good thank you it means a lot to me because I'm a fan you know I like I like watching fights and you call them fantastic thanks man I appreciate an ad Bravo you're pretty beautiful - you're awesome - it like your face looks so amazing when are you getting your knee surgery that's a good question you said February Tony's got a fight coming up so I'm gonna wait till after that's over oh did they schedule something what the fight for Tony he's gonna they're working on something okay so you wouldn't be able to hurt it here first what are you you just let something out the back no Tony's a fighter he's always working on a new fight so if you have your knee fucked up you just won't be able to demonstrate techniques is that what it is if I have if I think I'm gonna be an unconscious for four weeks there's no no AC I went to a party five days after my surgery how much's okay good I just put a knee brace on five days afterwards I've never had ACL surgery so I was just thinking if you have crutches if you get a cadaver craft it's so non-invasive it's fucking amazing HIPAA tell is the best no I've had both the the cadavers the best the problem the cadaver is exciting some people say I've never heard that I mean it might happen - Benji erratic he got a cadaver yeah but I think he just got an infection I think he I know that I know exactly would happen because the doctor the knee doctor that did it he I know him he's my doctor he said that was the last time I did a cadaver cuz it got infected and and it was really bad so ever since then he stopped doing cadavers he just sticks to patella I have both this ones patella this ones cadaver this one was way quicker healing way less invasive and neither one of them give me problems today but I think I think if I had to do it again I do cadaver hmm interesting I'll look into they also use a thicker tendon because they use the Achilles tendon this is a big fat rope hmm they they stick that bad boy in there it's 150 percent stronger than your your natural ACL dam maybe I need to do that I would do with it 100 percent no I would do it if you want my guy gentleman who did both my knees he's amazing he just did my buddy's shoulder too he's amazing and he's out here he's uh he's actually Simi Valley and he think he has a place in Beverly Hills - he does a lot of pro athletes can't do shit till after that fight so it's gonna be a couple months right but if you if you just did it it did the surgery you would still be able to coach them you just wouldn't be able to do certain moves and maybe you could bring someone like Marvin or you know one of your best guys yeah you know what you're right I don't think you should put it off you're right I'm looking at a whole different way now yeah I should just fucking do it do it just do it because that's six months that'll take to rehab it happens before you know it but if you put it off that six months happens before you know it - yeah another six months later you still have a fucked-up knee and you haven't gotten surgery it just went out on air yeah look like it was gonna pop back in the last two times it happened it was really hard to pop back in and I'm thinking man what if it gets stuck like this shit you won't be able to roll hard for six months but the reality is you'll be able to do a lot of stuff before then especially when you're showing drew you're drilling and just showing yeah there's no resistance yeah you'll be able to do a lot pretty quick as long as there's no resistance on your name you'll be able to do a lot like three months in and you'll be doing I'm sure you'll be doing a ton of rehab you'll be on the ball with that shit you know you're you're gonna be you're gonna be very oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna to get back to work I hear you dog
