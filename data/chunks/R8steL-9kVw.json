the girag and experience so we're approaching like the place we're going to do the afternoon you know landing spot which is just kind of sky deck overlooking the jungle and I wanted to take my shoes off as I walked up this so I just fucking did it I took my shoes off didn't worry about the mosquitoes and that felt great just feeling the grass and the mud on my feet it was a short walk so there wasn't any crazy shit going on in the in the brush or anything I had to worry about we get up there and I go to lie down and I had taken again I had taken the most watch you might had taken at any point ever so I'm more blasted than I have been the whole trip because I got eight ounces instead of sick and I go to lie down and I'm pondering this idea of choice a lot and fears and you know feeling pretty good because everything that's happened I was passed these tests and I see his little ant crawling towards me to my right hand side and I look like oh fuck there's an ant coming and so I totally broke my train of thought stood straight up and then I look back that hat and i just realized holy shit i just let that little fucking aunt have the power over me to make me sit up lose my train of consciousness and completely move on his behalf and it wasn't like a deadly poison his aunt it was just an ant and then I thought to myself how many other these little things that are truly ants in our existence fears worries paranoia's relationships that you feel crunchy about in a certain way or crunch like something that's uncomfortable to you in a situation or that you're projecting and your simulator is worried about these little things that went in reality are no more than these ants which are harmless cause you to make to choose actions that aren't in your best interest you know and we because we give them power we give them the power over us to make us move they do have power and they could do just as good I mean they can have a show you did it from your fucking living room 12 years ago and look at you today and if let's say that they somehow co-opted us and we sell out right there's some someone somebody also replace Mike Jones he's waiting is in austin texas you say you're the number one but I've got some statistics I've got the documents right here and show you're a liar jank you're a new world order puppet he seems like he's out there where for the people he's not working for the people he went for MSNBC ladies and gentlemen you don't get to MSNBC unless you sell your soul to David Ickes reptilians that was awesome I've never I never heard you do that that's that was amazing I've known that dude for a long time Alex Jones in 1999 i did a DVD in austin texas and alex jones and i put on Bush masks I was a bush jr he was bush senior and we we were these outfits and ran around the Capitol and it was called the live from the belly of the beast it was right before bush senior got elected and I've known him for even before then I've known that guy for a long time my theory is that Alex is a false flag operation really yeah is that really a real theory kind of i'm half kidding half serious yeah well you say that because you're trying to fuck with me what are you trying to do right now is co-op my mind I'm sitting here in Los in taxes i'm smoking cigarettes i'm drinking whiskey i'm getting fucking crazy i'm trying to protect people from the government there's black helicopters their flight over my dodge charger that's fucking funny Tom Rhodes don't piss on st. that's not the bathroom yeah that's not the bathroom he's in there I've done that a lot having bingo has caught me so many times trying to go into the closet and a hotel room to take a piss that you go well that's the amount of times you've woken up and found me how many times have had pissed off my own shit I never knew about it twat member I do it all the time the humidity I guess I'm trying to marry who told this story but somebody opened up their drawer and they pissed on their sock drawer they opened up they went to their dresser and they pull their sock drawer open and they just pissed in there oh my god the fuck did you think your sock drawer was the toilet I don't know I'm sure you've done this dog peed in the corner of Allah hotel room are we talking about we saw you go through the wrong door thinking y'all gonna win you peed in the corner of a lot of hotel know a few of them just being plastered like you know ya could assign dinner he thought I was there how many times bingos caught me doing that versus how many times she didn't wake up that I did that and didn't know I did that that's those extra two shots well Lorraine says it's over Doug Stanhope you say the fuck is I was plastered in Ireland years ago and I went out the room door I thought I was going to die was just drunk and a half awake I just needed to pee and then on the fucking hallway naked I was banging on the door my hand girlfriend get cummed what the fuck are you doing out there i'm the motherfucking door we already have this on a podcast Hennigan did that right there my manager and Henry Phillips both have stories walking out thinking they're going into the bathroom walking out naked and the door shuts me them and they're both naked in the fucking hallway go and then you instantly become John Ritter I've abyss here there's no way that's not comedy you know what are you very sober k how many people know I don't have identification you do like a 20-year bid in a hotel you work in the hotel for 20 years somic dudes coming down naked how many dudes come down naked in your entire career holding their cock and balls is going believe knives that's what I am Brian well he went into a like a locker a housekeeping door that was open grabbed a sheet or whatever put it over his dick I walk down to the hotel and they just gave them a key he didn't say ID or anything ideology is that I mean I I don't remember who said it but it's it's the enemy of free-thinking mm-hmm you you get in these ideological clusters and then anything outside of this thing these predetermined patterns of behavior that you've to subscribe to anything becomes forbidden it becomes you can't even entertain it you can't even approach the idea I'm you see it with everything you see with atheism you see it with you see it with any isms with feminism with the Men's Rights you see it with with people who subscribe to the right people subscribe to the left any variables that don't fit into their equation that they've already subscribed to they don't want to be labeled as that other side and any time they don't want to be labeled they start ignoring any evidence or any ideas that don't fit within this really ridge description that's exactly right I mean that is you hit the nail on the head joe i'm just weird exactly right where people get locked into these ideological paradigms and then from that point on basically their perspective is modified more by emotion and rationality more by you know their feelings rather than real information you're the only person that's ever come in sat down and said oh this is good i'm getting a cortisol rush she said you getting a cortisol rush from the feeling of about do apart actually i could have gone a little more detail but as we do yeah you know so that feeling of anxiety you know that like you get before you go on stage I mean you're a comedian i'm sure i'm currently familiar with that you actually are expressing a chemical called dane orphan and this is an endogenous Kemel in your brain and it binds to something called the kappa opioid receptor it's kind of like the counter of the endorphin which binds to the MU opioid receptor so the and orphans are the feel-good well its nemesis is the dynorphin which is that anxiety like feeling so but here's the interesting part that anxiety like feeling that you feel before you're you know going to do something like you're you know really that you care about or that's kind of anxiety provoking for me public speaking does it I get it right before I'm going to do it you know give a talk or something or do a podcast in front of you know 500,000 people um so that dynorphin binding to the kappa opioid receptor what it does is it up regulates the new opioid receptor so that after you get that anxiety feeling you have a better endorphin rush because you up regulate the new up your receptors which bind to the endorphins to feel good ones and you actually become sensitized to them so there's a biological mechanism by which having that anxiety actually does you good so it's it's kind of like a stress at first but then later on your you get you feel better and you're more relaxed
