hello freak bitches I'm doing everything I can do possibly um cryo machine you name hyperbaric chamber everything I could do I'm looking for the edge cuz everyone said they get they got it champ I'm I'm broke they got money too so imagine what they got in I'm scrambling to get everything I could get you know me need to get to the next level I know I know I see it I see it I see it any man and I'm me like many other people were rooting for you thank you chair it just it's frustrating when I see you getting close to these fights with guys like David Haye and what happened when the me said he was gonna fight you I went over to England champion they showed me number love they seen the true character of who he really is and he ain't really a good dude he's not he he's a businessman but he's also like a you know he's a he's a weird dude man you know man you know I shook his hand we said we had a go would be great for a great fight when lose the draw for either one of us and everything was said and he I did everything they needed me to do and then he just dead dead uh he fell was looking for another deal and not truth of the matter is I heard this from inside that he was like he's too dangerous you know that's just the bottom line which is what they all he's a fairly small heavy way y'all smash them up that was the easy one for me that was a layup a mosquito let's team in his eyes I'm from Brownsville I got one thing I could smell when you when you ski I'm from the same neighborhood as Mike Tyson ready Paul I know when a man scared I went up on him Joe I looked in his eyes I seen his lips he was trembling he was scared I could smell a little old this is a layup this is a layup champ that's the easy one champ yeah what is he way he's not a heavy I could see me just national we're gonna move straight there's a lot of momentum in your side it's just a matter of getting a fight sign to do you know in the heavyweight division right now is pretty exciting there's nothing the face done the big the face done I'm just saying for browning those people to act like they had they were gonna grab the bull by the horn and not be able to come with a deal you know the Hat I think they have a couple days until we go to purse bed like if that was the case that we should just wait the purse but I'm ready now brem said I'm ready now I don't want no more delays I don't want to play with this boy I'll not call my boys I don't play with this man is young man what a family I don't want to play with him I want the bell to ring cos he in my way I understand but he's in my way right and there's nothing like people who understand like you could call me crazy but that's what that's okay look my mind and my mind this is like already written destiny I was a lot of shape I was dead and now I wanted to kill myself and now I came back with nothing behind me but the people the people said everywhere I go he's in my way he's just like a tornado coming he's a road I'm a terrible part he just said my way cuz I kind of bigger picture champ all the belts I wanna people around the world yeah all the belt chef I want people all around the world to be like you'll hear my story I got it I don't have a great record I've got like six or seven-month five six losses who knows I had ups and downs I've never been considered a great but I fought guys who will tell you on the low man he get busy X Linux Lewis they'll tell you guys who know me or who boxes acts Chris Berg they say you know what Shannon never read that never really seen Shannon they never really seen Shanna honest I'm not keeping really never see me they gonna see me when this fight gets done they're gonna see me they're gonna see the real shit gonna say wow we didn't know he had all that talent we didn't know let's go check this to go see it for real this is a lot of suffering paying champ and a lot of love too cuz they're all around the world they saying let's go champ a feeling of positivity and they said you know what champ we behind you man the people said that's not happening in boxing champ and that and that is another reason that's fueling me they believe the box you look at a state of heavyweight division it was flat before me champ Cisco was doing nothing but sticking up division for years grab hold grab hold come on champ you the heavyweight champ of the world you're supposed to be the biggest prize in sports you're supposed to be out there doing interviews you supposed to be Muhammad I want you to stay around people around kids around the world supposed to know they were angry champ in the world when I was out there trying to campaign and the image to this day you ask somebody who's the heavyweight champ in the world they don't even know nobody knows nobody knows now white guy yeah but ask them now who they don't even know nobody knows nobody knows now you go around and I see people call me one thing champ yeah they say champ when you fight in exactly so that's without that's what I'm talking about bringing back the energy to the game [Music]
