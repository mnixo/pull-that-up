like skiing I think in Montana I think a Bozeman Montana I love both yeah just cuz the mountains and the beauty you ski though I do but reluctantly yeah I always ski cuz they like it it'll mess up your knees man I fucked up - that's what I'm saying some it wasn't even my fault man this lady slid she was a newbie she didn't know what the fuck she was doing and she was she was trying to put her shit on she slid right into the trail right when I was coming around this corner I'm like god dammit I knew if I hit her she was a goner yeah that bitch was gonna get broken up I almost though I went around her and I wiped out and I got a fracture of my shin actually really yeah I've got what's something called an insufficiency fracture it's like where your my shin bone hits my cartilage it's fairly lucky really because it just requires like six to eight weeks of doing not much so no running for me I just been hiking with my dog and I lift weights it's not you know it lets me know every now and then like hey fuckface settle down but I've been doing yoga but doing a lot of my normal stuff I can't kick the bag but it's not bad it's not bad as injuries go it'll heal up I skied once and I almost took out four kids oh Jesus yeah like literally would have killed those kids I was I couldn't stop I couldn't stop no you're a big guy I'm a big guy so I was going at these four kids and their parents were screaming so Mike and I just wound it up like rolling down the hill and so I was like alright I'm done like that I don't ever need to ski again because the key is to stay on those green ones stay on the easy bit I was on an easy one the easy baby ones are so much better ever my kids off my 11 year old is a fucking psycho she's I wanted you double black diamond she does all the black ones all the black diamonds those are so hard man they're so spit when you like fucking she's probably 80 pounds I guess yeah it's not that bad you fall like nothing happens they bounce right back up but you're also so low to the ground and you're made out of rubber back then they're all they're all like flexible and shit when you're old bro you bet you hit the ground your backs like what really bothered me was my head when I wiped I went around the corner um a winner to try to get away from this lady I tried to turn around her and my skis went up and when I went down I hit my head pretty fucking hard and I had a I had a helmet on for sure but still even with a helmet on you're my bell got rung like I was dizzy and I was a little confused and disoriented for like the rest of the day I definitely got rocked like it was a fight I would have the doctor like checking my eyes of the flash life do you have you gotten concussions before oh yeah okay okay but then but when we got him it wasn't a big deal anyway oh goes hey go back in I probably been hit in the head a thousand times I don't even know how many times have been hit in the head from all the days of sparring and fighting and I don't know how many times it's been a lot but that was a big one like recently I haven't had a recent head injury or a recent bang of the head that's called success you don't need yeah I mean I'm okay everything's fun but it's very touch-and-go man very touch-and-go I still want to get checked out because I got knocked out in a football practice and this was in college at the University of Arkansas and I played outside linebacker can a guard pulled and hit me right here in the temple I was out I woke up in like ICU and I still get headaches I'm always gotten headaches on my life but you know watch different programs ago they go hey are you having headaches maybe you should go in and see a doctor and I'm like you know what maybe I should get another MRI you know what's really crazy how many years people have been alive people gonna lie I mean we've been human beings have been around for a quarter million more or more years depending upon who you ask and how long have they really known about chronic traumatic encephalopathy encephalopathy how do you say it like discovered it well her I don't know if he's the one that brought it to life yeah and he was the one who's mean explaining how all of these football players have it you know what's really interesting I saw an article about him that was kind of shitting on him lately encephalopathy that's it chronic traumatic encephalopathy neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries fucking name and my parents threw me in football when I was like eight years old since I was taking hits look at this symptoms may include behavioral problems got that mood problems got that problems with thinking definitely got that symptoms typically do not begin till years after the injuries check CT often gets worse over time and can result in dementia why is the guy getting shitted on who's that oh there was an article recently that was saying that he is profiting off it's most likely someone trying to discredit like if you noticed all the negative Bernie Sanders ads that are articles that have been written lately like really crazy ones like saying it was calling him a climate change denier list which is 100% not true yeah you know there's so many little here it is from scientists to salesmen how Bennet Omalu doctor of concussion Fame built a career on distorted science yeah I don't know if what they're doing it's a Washington Post which is another one that they there were also the ones that ran that thing on Bernie with climate change denial goddamnit media anytime so much horseshit going on in the news I can't watch it anymore it's it's just reading it and watching it it's like so much of it is biased and distorted and they're trying to paint a perception of someone instead of just just laying out the facts in an objective way it's just so much of that going on now it's just I feel like it's a very unfortunate case but I feel like one of the things that's happened is because of subscription models for newspapers things like Washington Post New York Times they have to be outrageous like sometimes in my Google newsfeed I'll get a story and I'll click on it and then they'll say to subscribe go here oo I'll fuck you mm-hmm because so they got me to click on it with the click bTW shit and I bet you know one out of a hundred or whatever will follow through and give them their credit card information and subscribe but they're almost starving to death someone told me that the New York Times only survives because of their podcast now oh it's the daily yeah daily is I used to listen to it a lot but uh it's a thing where I think news when we watch news it's it's more salacious than entertainment news I remember you know they they're all about the headlines and here's what I'm like they just had this democratic you know the where they went against each other at the debate and the next day on the news all they showed was the same five clips of Elizabeth Warren going after this person Bernie Sanders going after that person and they have 24 hours to at least tell you the good things they said on like yeah give me some policies or sup but no they just gonna show you those five clips yeah and that's and that's what the debate and then they go on we don't understand why everybody's mad because you're only putting five clips up that we're all the candidates are mad at each other the news is a big part of the division right now and I feel like it's worse like entertainment news is supposed to be like Brad Angelina Jennifer Aniston but now you have polit politicians Elizabeth warning Bernie Sanders like they're doing the same thing that we did in entertainment knew you're a hundred percent right and I think they're doing that because it's a business and they have to stay alive it's ratings but I would love it if one channel existed that didn't do that one channel existed that was 100% unbiased these are the facts as we know them you know some old-school Walter Cronkite you do that nowadays I'd survive I can't I don't know because it's about rating question to this question can you it's like we're so personality-driven these days everything's personality driven it's so hard it's hard to trust people you know it's like when you see these hit pieces that are written about Bernie Sanders and you know it's horseshit that's where like when you know something's horseshit that's when you go oh wow look what you're doing and then you see a bunch of other news articles that are similar and that are on similar left-leaning publications or similar establishment connected publications and you go oh this is like a sort of a concentrated effort to try to minimize his campaign but even when it's bullshit somebody's gonna believe it a lot of people you know a lot of people believe that well it's a certain number are gonna believe it what's really interesting to me is that Bernie Sanders just keeps winning right he keeps winning he won Nevada he's won three in a row and they're trying to bullshit us and pretend to people George he's got a chance he's got zero chance that guy's got zero chance how do you see it all playing out Bernie Sanders 100% the only way it's all going to happen is if they give him some fucking CIA injection into his coffee one day his fucking chamomile tea give a little squirt and there's our I mean the guy already had a goddamn heart attack which is crazy that he's doing this well he had a heart attack on the campaign trail I mean bro this is like look if you have a car and you're you're driving it over to the guy's house who wants to buy it and one of your cylinders blows he's still like that's a good car I'll fucking take it like that guy you know he needs that car that's how much America needs Bernie Sanders so motherfucker had a heart attack running for president they're like so what he's alive let's go but what's interesting to me and I you know we were talking about it at this benefit you did you came out and made this statement about Bernie Sanders he was losing at that time he was not the front-runner and after you said that he became the front-runner I really believe you had a lot to do with that something to do with it but that's all muscles whether they attacked me hilarious they did exactly what I said you can do about a person I said if you take all the worst aspects of a person and ignore everything else just magnify those you can paint it very distorted perception of someone and so they're like good let's do that to him let's make Bernie Sanders look like a piece of shit for using that well also the fact that you use the most wishy-washy endorsement ever what I said is all probably not wrong I'm run with it I like might vote doesn't matter if you say this this is very important if you get in your politics from me you're fucked I'm not the guy listen to Kyle kolinsky listen to Jimmy Dore listen to the people that are really paying attention that listen to the hill people that are really on top of it where it's their business it's not my business my business is stand-up comedy and Cagefighting and then of a few other things I'm a comedian like you you know this is where we talk about shit but I'm no expert but what I like what Bernie stands for socially I like what he stands for socially you know when you and when he made his when he explained how he was going to put a very small tax on Wall Street speculation on each one of these little transactions less than a penny and explains that over time and all these transactions that's that's a valuable thing and that could contribute and that could what could potentially pay for education and healthcare and all these different things I don't know if he's right you know I know many people say he's wrong and I would like to see a real honest debate not a debate on television where you have to cut every seven seconds for seven minutes for a commercial and you have these people that are these moderators that are you know steering this thing no I want to see the two of them like him and someone who opposes his ideas who actually understands the economics of it and discuss it in a long-form discussion like a YouTube video make a youtube video everyone would watch it have Bernie Sanders sit down with someone who's an economist or a mathematician or someone who understands it and let's find out if that really would work and how it would work same thing goes with education same thing goes with health care how are you gonna pay for these things is it feasible is it possible to do this where's the fat that we're gonna cut how much taxes are you gonna raise and who are you gonna raise the taxes on and how is it going to be done and where's that money gonna go now do you believe that if you're Bernie Sanders you have to talk about that information because we have a president that then give any information III feel now politics is imma give as least information as I can so they can't use it against me works obviously because you have a guy like that in a white house so if I'm Bernie Sanders why would I tell you how much everything's gonna Trump the personality overshadowed everything else his personality overshadowed all of his shortcomings so because of the fact that he could say things like when he was talking about China you know you could go to China and you ever see that video which one where he explains to China or you could say listen motherfuckers have you ever seen that video no pull that video up because it's one of my favorite Trump speeches it's like this is what people love about DOM shit the fact that he would say this think about who Obama was right Obama this like articulate statesman who you were proud that that was the representative of America he spoke so well he was so measured so educated Donald Trump is not that do you feel that some American people since Obama was like that felt like he was speaking down to them for sure okay dummies yeah don't be so only smart people yeah that's always the case you know but I don't think he was ever speaking don't know he's very measure I don't I don't either but some people get upset about that listen oh he doesn't speak his mind he doesn't say what he wants to say people don't like him because he's a liberal that some people don't like because he's black to some people that don't like him because he's young there's some people don't like him because he went to Harvard here it is listen to this so let's play this cuz this is one of my favorite Trump speeches ever I drop a 25% tax on shine and you know I said to somebody that is really the messenger the messenger is important I could have one man saying we're gonna tax you 25% and I can say another listen you motherfuckers he does not give a shit he doesn't anything people keep saying he's dumb he's not dumb he's just not concentrating on the things that intelligent people concentrate on way it's concentrating on money money he's constitute cells ego yeah he's not concentrating on I mean when when he's talk he's not talking about the Glick the great literary works he's talking about not talking about great philosophers or great historians these are not things he's concentrating on his whole life he has a sharp mind but his whole life he's been concentrating on Donald Trump and Donald Trump kicking ass and Donald Trump's name and Donald Trump's ego and filling that ego and cheating at golf and doing all the things that he wants to do whenever he wants to do them that's what he concentrated on it doesn't mean that he's dumb and that's what people get distracted that they get confused I agree with you on that but but what I'm surprised about look and I don't care what side of Fincher but what I'm surprised about is some people believe he's doing things for the country's best interests not for his own well he's definitely doing things for his best interests 100% and also probably doing things that he thinks are for the country's best interest as well I don't think all of what he's doing is just for him because you wouldn't be President if you did that that doesn't make any sense because it the the beating that you take in terms of like well it's also your ego boost but he's also getting rid of everyone that opposes him or so I mean well that's how he runs all of his companies exactly so that's how you would run a company and you can't look has 70 fucking three years old right when you're that old you don't change you know you know I mean the way he runs companies to expect him to do any different once he became president it's kind of silly like that's how he's become successful I mean that's why his fucking name is on these giant buildings all over the world right it's like it's this ego thing and the way he does business I'm the fucking boss listen you motherfuckers we're gonna tax you 25% that's his attitude that's his thought some people love that shit oh no I know a lot of people are attracted to this the strong man the strong confident man who tells everyone to fuck off and they want to align with them because most people don't have a voice in life they don't feel like they don't feel like they're they feel frustrated they they owe money it's a lot of poor people which is really ironic right because using you know his policies don't even fuck about poor people he talks about the working people and that's he doesn't care enough to get them to vote for him cares about him in that way because they they are very valuable to him but whether they latch on to them so because they don't have that voice that he has it's that right you like people are very tribal they want a leader of a team and you're seeing that with Bernie Sanders you clearly saw that with Elizabeth Warren so many women were clinging to Elizabeth Warren they wanted to call Bernie Sanders a misogynist and this and that and what they were doing is they're just team Warren I'm on team Warren they didn't want to paint an objective opinion of him like well he's got some good policies and he's got some questionable economic theories and I don't know whether or not they're accurate but this is why Elizabeth Warren stands out to me and as a mother and as a woman I think you'd be great to have a woman in the White House and I'm biased in that direction people don't say that no they don't say that they don't say that they're tribal they're on Team Warren fuck everybody else and that's how people are but it's just then you're not making any progress you're just as bad as the other side like you're blaming the other side for doing that but yet I see to me Trump is so right like for that for that party he's doing his own thing we're now Bernie I feel like I always feel there's an overcorrection me to was an overcorrection I think now Bernie will probably get because that's the left answer for overcorrection yes I think you're 100% right and I think that's what's going on I think a OC and a lot of other people are also part of this sort of philosophy of overcorrection which is probably good I think we need that I think people go back and find we need to find our fucking equilibrium and that's what that's what humans do you know look things are getting better man I'm a fucking rock-solid optimist I think I think even the me to shit what that is is it's I mean I have a bit about and I can't really talk too much about it without giving up the bit I've heard it it's like fucking hilarious there is hilarious but the the thought process behind it is that ultimately the direction is moving towards bad things and I think that's the same thing with even woke culture like I'm a critic of woke culture I think a lot of it is ridiculous and I think a lot of his tribal it's the same kind of shit it's like people decide they're on team ultra progressive and you know and then everybody else can go fuck off and they want to attack those people and force those people to comply it's like a thought war mm-hmm and that's what's going on but when you look at the tenets of what culture but cut out all the horseshit what are they trying to do they're trying to have less homophobia less racism less sexism they want more inclusiveness they want more people to have opportunities that's great that's all great it's just they're going about it in this militant psychotic way when wearing ski masks and professors are hitting people over the head with bike locks and everybody's losing their fucking mind they won't even let conservative people speak at universities in a debate that stuff is wrong but I understand what that is that's just rabid tribalism and it needs that's an overcorrection and that needs to be called out and it needs to be it needs to be stopped because the only way to really find out who you agree with is to let both sides talk this the only way and then this idea that this infantile like perception of people including young people that a lot of people on the Left have is that you don't even want to hear people with questionable ideas speak because then they're gonna radicalize young people and they're gonna people are gonna get drawn to them well that's a very egotistical perspective it's like I can see they're full of shit but these young people are not going to be able to and I'm smarter than them and I want to stop them from being able to speak I don't like when people get mad when you have questions yeah about what like if you ask a question to a different party or a different movement and they don't like your question they get mad at you and then they like those fools but it's because it's people that don't understand all the tenets of rational discourse you need those you need do you know what The Four Agreements are you ever heard of Don Miguel Ruiz the for agreement it's a great it's a great book and it's really simple it's a small book it's an E read but though the four tenants are first of all be impeccable with your word always do your best don't take anything personal and I think the other one is like don't have any expectations I think that's the other one here they are okay I'll make assumptions that's what it is okay they'll make assumptions always do your best don't take anything personally and be impeccable with your word now if you just apply those and a lot of people like how does this relate the way this relates this is a philosophy on just going through life and all of these tenants be impeccable with your word don't take anything personally don't make assumptions always do your best these are anti tribal tenants this is a way to not get sucked into this like really biased tribal perception that a lot of people get sucked into and they get sucked into this team mentality and they get blinders on and they can't see things for what they are we have a real problem with wanting to be in tribes and it's just a part of our DNA it's a part of our nature it's how we survive to the 21st century I mean we survive by teaming up and and having this loyalty to the people on our group to fight against the invaders want to take our women in our food it's all it's all fine I mean you can that goes from politics to even religion yeah that's your that's your tribe yeah if you question a try yep then they all come after you I mean it's with everything man it's what everything it's with sports teams it's with the part of the country you live in it's with the style of eating it's veganism vs. carnivore it's it's like it's fucking everything we do we break off into tribal groups man you know it's like people weren't too American cars only and you know people are only by electric guns yes with everything man yeah no one should have a gun everyone should have a gun I mean it's and by the way those people that no one should have a gun or the everyone should have a con they're the same person they don't even realize it they don't even realize it they just needed the right amount of the right amount of influence the right of the right people around them the right positive the positive reactions from those people around them all the the debate that comes from one side versus all the debate that comes from the other side so much of the mindsets are similar so much or that absolute mindset whether it's absolute left-wing or absolute right-wing it's so similar you know what I hate is I think we're at a point of the country where everybody wants to think their problem is bigger than your problem yeah and then it so it's like well I'm gay well I'm black and gay well I'm black gay and this you know so it's like it's a thing where everybody you we can't acknowledge there's problems yes but we have to say my problem is bigger is bigger than your problem so you need to listen to me yeah it's like no let's just say everybody has problems and let's address them yeah rather than you you being the big problem and also kindness and understanding yeah those two things are so giant and whenever people just start attacking people you realize okay there's no kindness there there's no understanding there and that's why you're doing that if you had kindness and understanding you temper your words you take a deep breath and you go well I assume she's just trying to do her best or I assume he's just trying to get by just like all of us and that kindness and understanding goes a long fucking way because as soon as you dehumanize someone as soon as you say you know hey he's on the left fuck him he wants to take away your money and turned American to Cuba fuck you you know like that yeah that kind of nonsense yeah it's uh I read a book called never split the difference have you read that one it's amazing bro it's about an old FBI terrorist negotiator and he he basically the book tells you how to talk to people like he took that that tactic they use an FBI to bring it to real-life business and everything how to talk to people where you can get them on your side and just certain questions you ask where instead of them helping you that well it turns it from me asking you to do something to you wanting to do it it's brilliant like it's a game I used it in in real life everyday yeah how do you use it well it's about the how question okay you know for instance you're negotiating a price on something somebody says I want to do the Joe Rogan podcast studio and it comes in at twenty thousand dollars there you go you know what how can we make this where it's not as much is there how can we how can we or this price so instead of you going hey I need a lower price and they go no it's 20,000 you go how can we get this lower now all the onus is on them to try to figure out your problem so you're basically putting your they're trying to figure out your problem for you instead of you figuring out the problem you fucked up by telling people this cuz then they're gonna go uh we can't and then you stuck it's like you put you're playing chess here I know but they they just like check I just forgot about like how many millions watch this now now people gonna be taking shit away from me now they really are you did that motherfucker you went with the house yeah I mean but she knows I rest now every time my wife is at the house and I'm just kind of chilling I go how can I help you oh Jesus Christ what are you doing why just get out what I would ask that she always goes oh nothing but what I'm doing nothing and don't ask her there's always something to do oh I get it you know what I mean yeah it's a thing where if somebody you're just putting the onus on them and it's a light never split that there it's it's a game-changer man yeah that's interesting yeah there's all sorts of weird techniques that people have used in negotiations interrogations interrogation techniques are very interesting how they catch people lying by repeating what they said back to them and having them repeat it again mm-hmm and then because he talked about that - okay yeah because he had to do that like when he had to know over the phone though if they were lying so he had through the book they go through all these cues you could do and he goes I want everybody know this is not manipulation this just teaches you what to look for and how to basically get along where you're not fighting with somebody on something because when you're when they have your hostages you don't want to fight with the captors right you know you you have to talk to them in a civilized manner to get these people out that is some high-pressure shit man having me like you're dealing with you know Isis or some shit you're trying to get hostages back you're trying to communicate with them and trying to figure out how what's the best way to do this without using drones while you use Jones everybody's gone yeah not anymore they're pretty good now when they took out al Baghdadi no that wasn't out Baghdad soleimani okay they only killed one other person yeah they're good at it now it's scary well it's look it's gonna get scarier they're gonna be able to get drones down to like I mean they used to call them they these to talk about the precision of drones but really like a lot of times you're blowing up entire buildings and killing a ton of innocent people like the numbers of innocent people that have over all been killed by drones is fucking staggering yeah if it was a cop if a cop had done what drones had done you'd be like that guy is a fucking psychopath and he's just trying to kill people like the the decision that a cop would make there's a bad guy in this building so I'm gonna blow up the whole fucking building like yeah yeah you're gonna do what like there's weird decisions that you're allowed to make in two cases one war and two when it's not human doing it per se it's a human piloting a drone well I mean what was that movie with the it was these animals these mechanical animals killing everybody and the movie had that it was like this dog type of creature it was a big movie I forgot what the name of it was me yeah it's it's they have all these robots now it's a robot I think black married the black mare episode yeah oh you're right it was a pleasure there's a black mirror episode is one episode yeah but man like these robots they're jumping over things like like the Mafia can just like by robots now to go do hits for people that kind of money I think more like more like the federal government money that's what's fucked up about the government like they're using our money they don't even have to give you like a sheet like say if you pay taxes and you know you make a good living you probably have to pay us a hefty sum of taxes they don't send you hey Michael we used all this money on education we fix the streets with this money that you said so you should feel happy that you're contributing to the stuff they'll always fuck you pay us yeah and if you don't pay us they wesley snipes you they just send you to fucking jail they Lauren Hill you they just send you to jail they don't even let you take it off they don't say hey fuckface you owe us three million dollars you have to pay this off and this is how we're gonna force you to pay it off and Wesley's like look good I'm just gonna I'm sorry I'm gonna go back to work I'm gonna make that money give me a you know a couple years to pay it off and I'll pay it off no no fuck you go to jail so you can't even make any money while you're in jail so now you're more in the hole when you get out so they put you in jail but that doesn't take any money off you still owe all that money Wesley Snipes had to do like us more than a year in jail oh yeah well so did Lauryn Hill I believe Lauryn Hill did a year in jail I mean these taxes man fucking taxes that's the only thing were you owe money they put you in a fucking box they don't do that with anything else if you owed money on your mortgage you just have to pay it mm-hmm you know if you all you had credit card debt you just have to pay it but if you have IRS debt fuck you yeah you're going to jail they make that it's like they're thugs man they make an example out of you see and by you saying it you better watch out I pay my taxes I always happen I think that shit pay your taxes I'm not I'm I've never ever tried any sort of manipulation to try to pay lower taxes I don't think about it I'm very happy that I get to live in America I'm very happy that we have this incredible system where you literally can be a person who's struggling and go on to become incredibly successful do we don't have a caste system in this country it's not perfect it's definitely not equal there's definitely people that grow up in terrible environments and an impoverished crime ridden gang ridden neighborhoods and they're way more fucked than I ever was growing up however you can go from a kid like me who's on welfare when he was young and you know when I was a little boy and didn't go on to become someone who can make money in this country you can you can have an influence you can do something I'm proud to pay my taxes I never complained about it I mean it's a staggering sum of money when you really think about it but I'm proud to pay it I think we all should be but I don't know what they're dealing with it why well I tell you this my dad pays all wisely did three years three years three years and no money you're making no money and bro when you're like 52 like how old was he when you went away there was 2010 so he's probably your sentence in 2008 and he went in in 2010 how old is he he's now 57 okay so he was like 47 so when he was 47 he got out at 50 Jesus Christ that's all those are important years my yeah ma'am just doing push-ups um playing cards and here's the thing you don't get fucked with the IRS my dad pays all his taxes but they messed up on his taxes and they thought he was Jordan Peele they did Jordan Peele oh well did way last time by the way how much time she did three months Oh hmm well I think what was going on there was Wesley was a part of some wacky group that was saying that you don't have to pay taxes because it's unconstitutional do you sometimes go for it the same way people get locked in a thing in the earth is flat you talked to a couple people that are very convincing and charismatic and articulate and you're like really next thing you know your tax protester is he was called Oso his tax process approach deal in the pokey maybe so so DNA test come it's crazy right that is absolutely perfect like if there was ever a michael yell movie that guy is playing your dad for sure 100% that's crazy I know like it's not even a little different that's exactly the same exactly he looks exactly like your dad amazing the only thing that's different is the beard yeah like you take away the beard that's the same purse that's fucking stunning it's crazy that's a that's a double ganger bro yeah that's a real double ganger I mean bro I've never seen one that good no it's my I was just looking through Instagram and I was like

done ahem duggan done stand-up comic fuck yeah very funny guy yeah his yeah she's pregnant listeners hey girls congrats on all the pregnancies yeah guess what Caitlyn's burgers - I bought a crack baby

your lipgloss is on fleek it's Kylie's [Laughter] hell of a keeps the stubble on yeah like Jose Caitlin ones Avalon issues all the Caitlin's at one day why Kyle Dunnigan one I think right is that what it is his Instagram handle Kyle Dunnigan one funniest guy on Instagram and that's just one of them I did I check him every week just to make sure just to make sure every missed in it he does a great Bill Maher that Bill Maher hey did really fuckin Haiti did you bring it up to Bill bus I did Bill Maher didn't want to hear it didn't want to see it got angry and I go oh come on really I'm like bro he does a great Ray Liotta - OH Bill Maher like the opportunity hadn't seen it we were all talking about it did you feel like he had seen it I never said he just for some reason thinks that like he has a hard time with people making fun of him which is come on you're a public guy I thought the true meaning of Christmas would you like to hear that okay so you were told that God put a miracle baby in a virgin but the truth is Joseph got Mary pregnant okay and they stone women who had premarital sex so they came up with a lie a lie so big that stupid morons like why is he voiced that yeah that's dead-on yes what you do would you like to good lie they stole it from pagan religions December 25th virgin births Google and snowflakes did you really think that God would put his baby in a thirteen-year-old girl yes Mary was 13 and then just leave her to fend for herself he's God wouldn't you at least get her a ride yeah that's dead-on he didn't like it dad but she didn't get a chance to play it 91 he's very forceful and he accused me of not watching a show Solaris I told him some episodes that I watch that that was 10 years ago is he one of those days I know I don't need another fan like okay I like your show was that but I'm sure it's gotten more awkward with somebody else in here what was that oh yeah okay no more yes anchored oh geez I ever happened on the pot I don't know can we move on to greener pastures oh go back go over awkward things these comedians they don't like being poked fun of it's like mmm that's weird like if it's good you know well you know what's funny is a lot of Roasters people that are great at roasting do not like to be made fun hmm of course it's so true yeah that's well I'm not gonna man but I know like three then you make fun of them oh you know that expression about hose about the girls to complain about girls being hose or the biggest hose right everyone knows that's a fact that's a Fed that bitch it's just such a fucking slut like mm hmm hmm it's like your run-up to it's like the girl when you first start a date the first date she goes now I'm not the girl to sleep on the first day and then that every dude knows oh I'm about to sleep with that girl on the first date yeah when they have to tell you when they go out of their way to tell you about yeah they go out right away from the beginning let you know that's a weird thing that girls have to do right because every girl knows that every guy wants to fuck I think if a guy picks you up he wants to fuck and every guy knows when he picks up a girl like she might not want to fuck yeah it's just might not happen this is just dinner yeah it might not ever happen might not ever happen but you know what I always say like like two women like you control it like you only do you're the goalie yeah so if you if you're Harvey Weinstein convicted doughnut jail son and that's just in New York he still has a good tried out here oh he's got a done a bunch of trials that's just one have you seen how much he is aged no that's like eight months like me and my wife were watching him on the news last night we go I saw him on a red carpet a couple years before and he was like vibrant and just the stress and the guiltiness and everything he's just beating them down I don't think he'll even make it to jail I mean I might kill himself told my wife that lat because yeah you're gonna die in jail well he's probably depressed so deeply imagine going from being the toast of the town posing with Oprah on top of the world go on the red carpet everybody loves you everybody thanks you when they get their academy award have you ever seen the compilation of all the stars thanking harvesting uh-huh and then many of them went on to accuse him accuse him later of being a monster but meanwhile they're just praising him well it's but you don't you have to play that game fuck don't you I don't know I guess if you but any act about this yesterday Owen Smith and I we're talking about this yesterday we were on the podcast we were talking about like how much I'm so happy I don't have to go on auditions and I don't act and I'm not I don't want to be a part of that anymore that's one of the reason people think like God why is everybody Hollywood so fake because they're all trying to get cast in something it's true they're all trying to get accepted by producers and casting directors and and executives and so they're all just like hedging their bets like playing it safe like a guy on the first date just a bullshit artist just like a fucking slick guy with loose morals on a first date trying real hard is this him getting arrested and how long ago was that where's his fucking Walker looking perfect now how come how long ago was that this was yesterday guy who's walking yeah he was all I think why they have to cuff him they think that fat fucks gonna kick anybody's ass I like it what's up with that no cuff him but isn't it weird no it's great the cuffing thing is weird when you like if someone's I guess if you because fucking toothpick legs belly let that meatball belly to name running but here's the thing it's like I guess he's accused of violent crime so you have to cuff him right if she was accused of murder and they're convicted you gotta cuff him what happens to him if he goes to jail does he get Epstein like do president III know we any kids if you mess with any kids yeah I thought so he doesn't look like that anymore that's probably two three years ago right oh that was when he initially got arrested yeah I about to say that's not him well I know he looks that was one of the things that the court artist there was an art that drew him throughout the case and she was saying that you could see his deterioration is physical deterioration over the course of the trial have you seen him lately no did you oh you got to pull up the video of him like yesterday it literally him walking out you know he looks twenty years older I wonder if that Walker shits real you think that worn-out shit was I don't think it's real but I think it became real whoa don't get done that's right I think it was yeah look at that look at just his face yeah I think it was a thing where oh let's play it for the court and then he just got so broken down through the process what she deserved mm-hm and it just took a toll on a man look at him this is the video you just showed is like two years old it was made when 18 May 2018 you got him now look he's lost most of his hair yeah he looks so old and tired he's probably not getting any sleep he's fucking beaten man and he was on top of the world if if there is karma right if Karma's real that's the Karma cuz this guy was on the top of the world but he was like forcing everyone yeah Sarkis Dirk so you want to be a star it's like demonic yeah I know come on in now karma is like Tamas saying do you want to suck my dick I don't want to I don't but I don't want to all right come here get over here you wanna make you a star I'm sorry sorry I don't tell anybody about this like whoa and then sign and then his contract had it in there you heard about that okay like they had a disclaimer in his contract not only didn't have a disclaimer for one count of sexual harassment two counts you get you have to pay up this amount three counts you have to pay up that amount like he would lose money based on how many different counts of sexual harassment he had so they were negotiating depended upon him being a predator like they kind of knew what what do you mean kind of if they they knew he knew if you're putting in a contract you know well that's the other thing how many people are also liable here oh my thing is when of the agents go into jail the ones that kept sending all the actresses to the guy than when they knew they know everybody's an actress can say hey Harvey Weinstein raped me and then the agency says listen you want this job or not like those those people those people but if you're an agent and you've known Harvey Weinstein for four or five years or ten years and you know he's been doing this but yet you continue to send actresses right to this guy you have some type of responsibility to yes but here's the question did they think that he was just a pig and he was trying to talk those girls into willingly having sex with him which many did or did they think he was a rapist because he was both of those things apparently yes he was a guy who had sex with girls who were willing to whore themselves out to be in movies and he also forced himself on women who did not want to have anything to do with him so he had both of those things were going on but you don't think the agencies that were sending all these big actresses in they didn't know they knew the both types a they had some girls willing and some girls are saying they're rape you don't say in question you don't think any actress ever go went back to their agent go I'm never going in again I got raped and then that and then that agent was like alright I'm not gonna send you any more but hey over here go into Harvey well I like the way you're negotiating here because the way you're saying it doesn't give a person out you're saying you don't think because no one's saying that they don't think that no one's arguing that they don't think that's you saying you don't think that so you learning from that book yes very clever I wouldn't say it that way what I would say is if there's a high likelihood that they at least suspected he had forced himself on some women and there was probably some rumors there was a hundred percent likelihood they knew he was a pig there was a high likelihood that there were some stories about some things that he had did that were probably criminal high likelihood I don't know how many people were privy to those stories I don't know how deep it got in whether I mean like if you're an agent how many actresses do you actually get to send to Harvey Weinstein how many you know I don't know I'm sure I'm sure whoever he wanted to see right but I don't know what that number is I don't know how much they actually knew well we can be pretty sure of at this point is there's no way all these women are lying oh no I know they're all I believe look I know sup hit talks about the time he threatened to murder Harvey that's a great story like this is right after a Gwyneth Paltrow was Harvey Weinstein made an advancement on Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt confronted and said I'll fucking kill you you do that again so this is the thing Brad Pitt knew right so if Brad Pitt knows and he's one of the biggest movie stars these agents know this he / Paltrow he approached Weinstein outside of a play premiere in 1995 and he told him if you ever make her feel uncomfortable again I'll kill you but this is a night look Joe this is in 1995 25 years ago bro so you're telling me that these agents and the industry we are I didn't even know the guy but I heard these stories write this woody said is that he touched her inappropriately and invited her to his bedroom she told her then boyfriend Brad Pitt about it see that's what I think most people had heard and that's gross but it's not crosses and it's not great see that I think most people knew about that shit and Brad Pitt was willing to kill him over that which I love yeah yeah but yeah I just think it's a it's a thing now where like we talked about earlier it was over correction with me too that was well deserved and now you're seeing these guys like Harvey and get actually money's not gonna get you out like money geez the Cosby's yes the were like he's I think he's the tip of the of the monster pyramid you know there's Cosby because he they they did this thing about him where they said he's probably the most prolific serial rapist in history which is like holy shit and he was doing it on the set of The Cosby Show yeah like he would invite actresses to oh I want to make a guest appearance on The Cosby Show yeah yeah it has go to his trailer they wake up covered in jizz with an empty teacup what the fuck it's like this is not the part of one it's gusting and then they probably like jet happened did that really happen you imagine if America's dad raped you and you're like that this did that what like you probably if you were an actress and you went to him you were probably thinking okay this guy is probably exactly like he is on TVs mr. Huxtable is gonna be nice to me and you know he's just a nice guy he's just gonna you know try to help ya and it helps people out I would think when these women woke up they didn't believe yeah it happened this probably I'm making my sock yeah well they say that that's one of the things that happens with rape victims is that they sleep with the person willingly afterwards and it doesn't mean that they weren't raped but it's almost like they are trying to erase the shame of rape by going back to that person actually willingly having sex with them it was one of the arguments of Harvey Weinstein apparently had used is that these girls had willingly had sex with him after these encounters and and then you know they tried to show that but psychologists talk about that and they say that this is a coping mechanism that some victims actually wind up using which is just I mean the mind plays crazy tricks on you right and when you go in to someone who's America's dad like Bill Cosby you think he's gonna help you out and give you that little boost and get you going in your career and you can't wait to be there with academy-award going and I just want to thank Bill Cosby because he gave me my first break and he's always been into a beautiful mentor figure to me and a father figure and meanwhile empty cup of tea and you got a headache and your pants are off you're like what the fuck yeah man I don't like the argument that that people make like when these like you know the actresses think Harvey Weinstein is stuff like that it's like you have to he paid for the movie you know you can't be like your argument that they're not really there's not really victims because but or or the argument that you know oh it took 20 years to say something I you know it's that stuff happens where you just don't want to say anything you know look it's a whore business Yeah right and people whore themselves out in one way or the other there's men that hoard themselves out and said things that they didn't really mean because they wanted to keep working so they praised people that they really probably despised there's probably a lot of that going on yeah you can't say just because all those people kissed his ass that he wasn't really a monster monster yeah but but a lot of people use that argument you can't you really can't it's not valid it doesn't make sense it's it makes sense that it's distorted that the whole thing's distorted and gross even more gross maybe than just a simple he met this woman then he tried to rape her it's even more gross like they work together for long periods of time and her career success was dependent upon his acceptance of them I mean that's like the ultimate state of power right if you're the head of one of the biggest most prominent movie studios in the world and you bang all the actresses and everyone knows it but also if you go against him he'll call the other studios black in black ball yeah that I think if it was just okay he runs this studio yeah and he did me wrong yeah and I okay we're not gonna work with that studio he would go out of his way to call other people to blackball those people yeah and that's where that's where you're petrified because you know like we're comics but some people are actors and that's what they do that's what they want to do so it's a thing where you know if that's your thing you have to play that game it's no different than the Comedy Store like I'm past that prime of hanging out there because I have a family but that's the game you hang out in the club it becomes a fraternity you know and then you get past you know that like you got us invest time in that Club you know in the Comedy Store and that's what everybody tells me you know and it's a thing where are you not past there no no no but my thing also have you auditioned no that's how you get past yeah but I heard it's a you know they like to pass like people that invest time it's like how come you never just texted me asked me to get you set up for an audition I don't ask that up I didn't even know it's how you ready past no I'm they're seeing you there oh yeah I perform there a lot but those are promoter show promoter shows yeah yeah be careful because they're probably gonna eliminate those okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is a lot of people that go up that are not really common standard mm-hmm and someone will come the first time to the Comedy Store to see a promoter show and one of the promoters goes up and eat shit for 20 minutes in the middle of a star stack lineup and you're like what the fuck that I just say well they put a girl there trying to bang on the line up a little bit yeah now now I'ma get heat right you're right heat from who the girls that are well I'm not talking it's some I hate that I said that I know that it's gonna show back it's true though but I've said Mike because my friends are some of the promoters you know oh yeah I put it on the show yeah you know I look like there's a lot of these weasels and all lines of work it's um that promoter thing is a weird thing because you know yeah you had your issues well it's everybody said they're yeah and that but the big issue is the quality of the performers a lot of those guys that are promoting these shows that really are not professional comics they kind of like are sometimes comics occasionally do it so they'll insert themselves into these star stacks line I was like just D'Elia and Jess on that can always and they'll get up in there and do 20 minutes in the middle of that that's just Comedy Store hates it do you like I was with Jim Jefferies is on my podcast this week and he was talking about he doesn't like go on The Comedy Store cuz he's so used to performing in front of his own crowd hmm that he actually gets kind of nervous going up at the Comedy Store cuz why it's good for you exactly exactly so my thing is but it's must be different from you because any time you're on the line up your fans show up there so you're always playing home court now well there's some home court to it but there's also a bunch of people over there see D'Elia do you ask people that are there to see Jeselnik and Whitney Cummings and Ali Wong and whoever that yeah that's true is there that's true you you get all those things yeah you're winning people over for sure is it as easy as no one knowing who you are no it's it's it's it's or is it as hard rather there's no one knowing who you are no it's not it's harder if people don't know who you are then you have to really win them over but you know I did that yeah I've done that forever like I know what I'm doing like doing stand-up at this point is really about being honest about the material reps putting in the time putting in the effort putting in the focus and then grinding you got a grind you got to trust the process do you ever get nervous before you go on or is that you're really yeah get a little antsy yeah yeah get a little fuckin here we go here we go yeah I like that man I like being nervous when I used to fight when I wasn't nervous as I've had my worst performances always won got to relax because you got to be on edge man because that it's an unnatural state right going on on stage in front of thousands of people is an unnatural state you should be a little on edge it shouldn't be like waking up or going to the gym or anything normal it should be weird there should be where every time I go on stage it's fucking weird you know it's like it's the closest because I don't fight but like gladiator like you're a gladiator walking into an arena except they're not cheering you on at the beginning they want to make me laugh you know with you when they see you there but you still got to make them laugh you gotta you gotta crush it well I so I have all these things that I put into my head before I go onstage not just about the material itself because I have the over the last three or four years I've altered my preparation for shows and one of the big things is index cards I take index cards and I write down all my shit but I'll spend a whole hour just writing on index cards and then in my hotel room before that I will write and it doesn't even have to be about the material that I'm doing sometimes it is sometimes it's not but I will write for over an hour I'll make sure I do that so I have two hours of solid writing the day of a show and that's just to keep everything going that's like every I want everything poppin and it's sharp and I wanted to be I don't want to be oh let me think about my bits right before I go onstage no no I'm thinking about that shit all day long and then I think about people getting babysitter's I think about people dragging their wife than why I was like he's funny like I think I want all those people to have a good time man I think about people paying money I think about people saving money think about people taking trips and driving in their cars and getting on planes and coming to see me like I get jazzed up man I get fired up I want to do a good job I don't ever take it for granted I think just people paid money they put invested their time in me I don't want to let them down no that's great because it's almost like by you preparing like that you've already done the set five times before you even hit the stage so you're like where's so many people just alright well hi what you gonna do oh I don't know I figured out what I'm up there they're not paying all this money for you to figure it out but here's a difference when I do the Comedy Store sometimes I don't do that yeah you work out you know and one of the reasons why I don't do that is because I am trying to experiment and I'll do things backwards where I'll do like my closing bit first or I'll do punchlines first and try to reinvent the the beginning of it like at the end and I do that just to try to figure out if I'm doing a bit the right way because you don't really know I know the beats I know where there's jokes and know where it's funny and I know the premise but I don't know if I'm doing it the right way I need to find out and there's a lot of guys that they'll come up with a premise and they'll start working it and they never change it it gets a few laughs and it could have been better but they never allowed it to grow they never will loose they never opened it up so I'll get baked as fuck I'll drink I'll have a couple shots of whiskey now onstage to just ramble and sometimes that's not my best set but sometimes destroy a groove and then you catch this new part of a bit that's way better than any other version of it's been before and then it becomes your closing bit and that's so it's a it's a gym in a lot of ways it's like there's a there's a whole process to it but that shit doesn't happen in arenas yeah you know when I do in arenas you know I got music playing in the green room I'm pacing and shadowboxing I stretch I do yoga I do cardio the day of that's another thing I do before every show I always do cardio want to blow off all the extra steam I don't want any bullshit in my head I want to look pump it out sweat it out stretch so then so I've covered my mental bases I've covered my material I've covered my brain preparation I've covered my my gratitude I've covered all those things cover all those things so that when you in when I go out there I'm still nervous wow that's that's amazing like I just love what you're what you're doing with this podcast what you're doing with stand up like last time I was here I it changed my life and I and I'm telling you changed my life in a good way because you know I I said I didn't work out and I never got so many shirtless pics of dudes saying go dude you know when you work out you don't have to get big you could be shredded so they were sending me your your audience was sending me workouts and it inspired me to start working out and so I started like going to the gym and I tried out you know I do a lot of research so I tried different things I tried the ones where you run around jump up and that wasn't my thing run up those boot camps and all that stuff okay and I'm 45 that shit yeah That's not me I'm a college football player I'm a high school football player I need weights and organization okay so I did research but nobody just does weight and I found a place called lift society it's changed my life literally every day you do glutes I mean you do legs one day you do chest one upper body one day and it just rotates in the and you change workouts every week it goes from 12 to 10 to 8 it's just like college football it's just it and it's and the thing is you control you you have your own rack so they only let like 9 people in the class and it's one trainer so it's almost like a personal training because you're all doing the same thing and nobody's in your space and it's all weights it's not it is jumping around grabbing a rope but throwing balls it I just need my weights you know what I mean do you do any cardio no mm-hmm don't you want to do a little cardio do a job I don't know I don't mean I've lost like way little and soft for weight loss it's for heart health well but when you're doing squats bro your hearts crowd [Laughter] yeah sure especially doing the high reps yeah we're doing 12 reps right oh five sets of twelve and then it goes for three man I don't know it's I weigh a little more but I must I'm a lot more shredded that's truffle yeah I lovely feel better 100% ah see there you go like I actually I don't have muscle legs but my legs are strong now you know how to leave it like you should be able to touch it like the first time I came here you could touch my leg it would touch my bone like literally squishy yeah it's tight you have muscle memory which is interesting isn't it yeah like but your body goes oh yeah we're playing football again yeah yeah well that's why I don't go super heavy because I was so hard for people that have never done jack shit that's the hardest for people never done jack shit to get in shape because everybody's like what and the fuck are we doing whereas with you your body's like oh we're getting big again yeah we know how did we get strong again we know how to lift weights we did this yeah unless yeah but I'm not into the jumping its but the body's so interesting man what a crazy looking like I went years especially when I was doing jujitsu I went years without hitting the bag or doing any kicks and then one time someone asked me to explain something and I like like how do you do that thing like I've heard about a spinning back here come on I'll show you how to do it and I went over to the bag and I'm like part of me was like do I really know how to do this like I haven't done this in years it's like a false memory like is this real do I really not and then I start doing it and then my body is like oh we're doing this shit again it just clicks but it's weird because it doesn't seem real like it's like when I'm about to do it I'm like we're gonna fall my ass right here do I really know what I'm doing like when you don't do something for a long time your body has to like kind of go oh yeah I remember this you have to do it a couple times you have a memory like I have a memory of it but that memory seems fake of a lot of memories in my life that seem really fake really oh yeah oh yeah well life is weird right and my life is very weird my life is weird every left everyone's life is weird life is weird mm-hmm where these weird monkeys that are clinging to a rock that's hurtling through space there's no roof above us sky is infinite and it's weird you're gonna live a certain amount of time and then we're gonna dime we don't even know what the fuck happens then but Dee okay so there's that and then there's famous weird which is really weird and then this famous weird that's I've lived so many different lives like so I have like these lives in my back my past where I'm like oh boy is that real did I do that stuff wait wait now I'm getting lost you have sorry art style martial art okay okay gotcha yeah binding but even stand up man like there's moments before I go onstage was like do I really don't really do this yeah like this it's a weird freak out when you're about to get introduced in a in a fucking sold-out arena and you're in the back and you're like is this real you do this like I feel like I have a false memory of me doing this like I know I did all that stuff I know I did all that preparation but then you got to kind of trust it and then you know they go ladies and gentlemen Joe it all falls into place yeah like you have to trust the process but you got to do it a lot to trust it that's why stand-up is it's so critical to do the reps you got to do mad reps and I fucked that up in the past before man I've done that in the past where I was only working like one or two shows on the weekend and that's it that's all I was doing for a few years a couple years and my performances suffered they did they weren't as good you have to do a lot of reps more that's what that's what I love about they end up it's it's stage time it's the great equalizer yep you know what I mean like I I know comics I said I've been doing a fifteen years but there's stage time maybe five or six years right look guys it's because that's the thing Russell Peter said it doesn't matter how many years you do it it matters the stage time yes because stage time makes the e that's not true this is why it's not true okay because you need reflection time - so the time in between that stage time is critical as well it's not just the time you go on stage the time you think about that as well you can't just get ten years where the stand up in three years you can't know will you ever be able to do it yeah because you're not gonna grow enough as a human and also your your your values and your your perception would be distorted because you'd be to stand up centric one of the things about stand-up that I found you have to have other life experiences and I think my other life experiences enhance my standup yeah I think I think he was more talking about the people that's ya know I don't want to say that Grubbs everybody's equal no no they're not people that do it just for girls like that I know lots of communities that just County for 15 years but really you're just doing it for the girls you know I don't have to mention any names I know a lot of those dudes yeah those guys suffer they suffer they suffer because they know they know they could have really pursued it as a real art form they could have they could have appreciated the unbelievably fortunate position that you are in where you have an opportunity to be a professional stand-up comedian and I think a lot of those guys they probably never had real jobs yeah like if you had like a real job working on a construction side or doing something hard driving limos and you know work in a fuckin shitty office sitting in a cubicle every day suffering yeah and then and then internalizing that suffering and realizing I don't want to fucking do this god I wish I could be a comedian god I wish I could be a professional you know Greg Fitzsimmons and I we started out exactly the same time like a week apart from each other Greg and I have been buddies forever and one of the things that we talk about is when we first started in Boston we never thought about having a career we all we thought about is man if I command if I could pay my bills doing stand-up like having like Greg has won multiple Emmys he's had showtime specials and you know headlines all over the country he's and we were talking about it like I never would have dreamed that would have been possible it wasn't even a dream yeah the dream was make a living that's it just make a living yeah that's what I was saying it was so inspiring like coming on this podcast because it kind of was a domino thing after doing this because to me this podcast is very inspirational to people and it was the moment I was on here like I so I did this whole lifting then I'd listen to the David Goggins book and I was like oh my god this dude's crazy and Abby's like and I did the mirror thing like he said like the first thing on my mirror is WTF Oh work the fuck out right so that's the first thing I do in the morning and I go if this dude can go through all this I can wake up and workout in the morning and then comedy's up there and then sell a TV show which already happened this year that's gonna be announcing a couple so it's thanks but it's a thing where sometimes you just need to see it firsthand yeah because once I saw which you've done live I've seen it on on YouTube but what you hear and you feel the magnitude of it it was like what the fuck am i doing I need to really start pushing harder and I need to really focus just on comedy on podcasting I built me a podcast it like it was just so inspiring and then it just dominoed into more and more things where and I had a lot to do what your listeners like saying jiu-jitsu gyms reaching up to me cuz I said I want to try that you should try it you're built for him I told me not to because my knee I have knee problems right what's wrong with you knee again it's meniscus I know I never got to fix mmm so get it scoped but like the shirtless dudes in the hole the hole judges it bother you right now you need yeah yeah time well I squat and stuff it's fine but I couldn't imagine somebody like I I did one of these classes where I just jump around a little bit and heard it that's why you ever get an MRI I did they said it's just it's just you know rough like it's grinding on each other so they injected it with the gel so channels I can't remember what they threw it hyaluronic acid so they did that that probably give you a little bit of space yeah a little yes so it feels better but I know I couldn't take like yeah man smite punches me or hits me out that right man literally ah but yeah but you don't have to get hit jiu-jitsu is not about getting hit it's just grappling okay yeah no no I'm good okay yeah all right I don't think I could handle that like I don't have to baby steps yeah hey I just started working out again I can send you to someone who can inject some stem cells and Tunie that'll help you a lot do you believe in stem cells so 100% yeah I've had some significant results no the fact results that are shown on the MRI I had a full length rotator cuff tear in my right shoulder that they were thinking I was gonna need surgery on I got some stem cells and less than a year later I had two stem cell injections in less than a year later I got another MRI and it was gone have you have you heard that means the tear disscourn it's gone it's it healed up PRP and something called exosomes exosomes and PRP fixed my shoulder I've done PRP on my knee one that can help no it did help look for like a couple years but have you have you done NDA I guess no not IV no of don pills I've done the pills and we've talked about having the IV lady come down here when I say lady nid not NDA Oh what did you say yeah her that's the shit I've never done but I take the pills but I've never done the intravenous or heard the interview I want to I want to try it but the only thing that scares me I have a doctor for it so he's like oh you got to try it you gotta try it yeah and that scares you well the tightness of chest when they do it oh yeah he goes to your gut apparently yeah ten minute version the 10 minute push version really is painful no no well he says it takes like three four hours yeah the three four-hour one is easy apparently the 10-minute one is the one wheeler Jesus oh come on bro we'll do it together hold your hand oh hell no I'm just scared my I'm just scared much like I'm scared of that anything that because my friend's name is dr. Shaw and he's amazing like he's the type of dude where we'll just go to lunch and he'll tell me all the new stuff that's coming out right and he he owns this place called neck cells it's awesome but will lunch right next door and he'll just break down it everything anything dude nad it restores cells hmm you know it makes you it won't necessarily keep your life you won't live longer but your cells get younger and they they work better your heart I'll pump blood better everything will be better but you have to do it five days in a row five days in a row five days in a row for max for five days in a row for often what he said like once a year once a year just five days in a row yeah that's it yeah but it's like three to four hours man like it's 750 Miller milliliter yeah I think you could do it in ten minutes if you can cut it out know how much you can know I bet David Goggins are doing stretch for two hours yes I every night but every night I want to know this routine like he I know how could you stretch for two ow he just does it he doesn't have a job first of all he made I don't say I'm sure i wanna say his numbers but he made an ungodly amount of money on his book and he doesn't even own a car he was I'm a black Jew I don't spend no money on no car so he runs everywhere like his video his wife has a car and he doesn't buy a car he's and he's not spending any of that money look he's he's the real deal like he's not posing that's that guy all day long 24 hours a day you know and he's honest about every step in the way he goes sometimes I get up and I just look at my sneakers I look at my sneakers like a half-hour I don't do shit I just sit there feel sorry for myself like I don't really want to run but then it's that fucking bitch you're gonna run run motherfucker then he goes and then once I run then I feel it he goes and then when I run I get mad at myself for not wanting to run earlier so I run more like he's honest about like his vulnerabilities in his weakness he's honest about who he is but it's also there's no no question he's gonna get everything done like he's he's a complex individual and I think because of the fact that he's so honest about all that stuff it makes him even more entry like he's honest like all the pictures of him when he was drinking milkshakes and he was 300 pounds and yeah he loves showing those to people he's like that was me who's that was me I was a fat fuck I was a fat fuck I was lazy he's like the first time I went running I ran like a quarter of a mile and I was gassed out I sit on the side of the road like but do you believe like in that book he thinks everybody has that in them do you think everybody not to that degree man cuz that book was insane well I think it depends I mean everybody has that in them if you choose to act the way he acts but a lot of that book is insane and you learn cuz I read the book as well you learn from that book and the audio Bush book I would actually recommend because in between chapters he talks about all the different things that happen and actually elaborates in a more extensive way makes you go holy shit like his life was hell his father was a monster and he did not have a happy childhood by any stretch the imagination was horrible it was he it was filled with torture and racism and strife and struggle and he felt sorry for himself and it was terrible but all those demons now he has those motherfuckers locked up pushing the wheel you know that iron wheel at Kong Dome there in his head now pushing his wheel he's got those motherfuckers working for him now those are they worked for him like he's in control and so that fuel is not everybody everybody doesn't have those demons like the person that's gone through the kind of life that David Goggins has had is the type of person that has those demons and all of those long distance motherfuckers they all have demons oh yeah yeah friend cam Haynes he's got a ton of demons he'll tell you he's like you would not want have had my childhood it was not a happy childhood and those people that like you would think that you would think that having a happy childhood is good and that's what I'm trying to provide for my family and I know that's what you're trying to provide for your family but and to be there and be loving and to be playful and be supportive and all the good things that I wish I had when I was a kid I want to provide that to my kids but part of the reason why I'm Who I am was cuz my childhood sucked that's what it didn't suck as bad as David Goggins it didn't suck as bad as people that have been raped and didn't suck as bad as people who were continually molested and beaten and all those things I didn't you know I want to compare with someone who's had a real victim it's just mine wasn't good yeah but there wasn't it wasn't happy and that drove me that drove me I needed I needed to prove my value I need I don't know my dad I needed to prove myself worth I needed to prove that I was worth something I didn't feel like I was as good as other kids I felt let I felt insecure always always growing up it wasn't until I started being good at something that I realized you could get positive reactions from people from being good at something and then I became obsessed with being good at things and so that became my life it became I I know what to do now I know how to grind so do you think when people have a great upbringing for them to be successful it's actually harder it's harder it's harder because you have everything it show me the man who's the son of a great man show me a great man who's the son of a great man it's very rare it's very rare most men who are the sons of great men struggle in the shadow of their father most of them and I think because they because the kid doesn't have to struggle the kid doesn't have to struggle are with you also you're comparing yourself to someone who is exceptional and you're always in their shadow there there's it's the only time it's different is in sports occasionally those father's mentor those kids and those kids derive a bunch of self-esteem and a bunch of positive feedback from that parent if the parent does it correctly like a Leo Gracie who's the founder of Brazilian jiu-jitsu want one of the founders along with Carlos Gracie one of the things that he did with his children and he had of an allele was a great man and his children are fucking assassins I mean he developed literally an army of the greatest martial artists the world's if ever the world's ever known one of the things he did when they compete he would give them prizes if they're lost he didn't put any pressure on them he understood early on that putting pressure on kids and making like this is your whole life they crack they break they just can't take it anymore and then they want up doing drugs and they escape but they give up he made it playful he made it fun for them and then when things were terrible and they lost they felt awful he would give him a toy he would buy them things and he was like you you know you did your best it's okay like he no pressure no pressure like that and I don't know if that would work on everybody but goddammit at work on his kids yes his hoist Gracie Hicks and Gracie Hoyer Gracie the Elson like thumbs I'm the greatest martial artists the world's ever known all out of one man all one man's child children and because this guy had this philosophy I'm not putting pressure on them and keep being loving so it can be done so most people are not gonna do it because to him probably when he was coming up he was punished for obably I don't know I mean it's hard to tell I don't know I don't know what his life was like was hid with his father I've never read into it but I think that it's it's really hard to come from a happy loving life and be exceptional and then be charismatic guys like Joey Diaz right where's the Joey Diaz come from you can't make it Joey Diaz in a lab he's a savage yeah and the shit that he says on stage and how funny he is bro you got to have a hard life Joey Diaz found his mother dead on the floor while he was on acid when he was 13 years old okay and his dad was already gone by that point he was adopted by his friends parents like Joey Diaz had a hard fucking life I would never wish that on anybody especially my children but that is what made him the animal that he is today that I mean that you read David Goggins book that struggle made him who he is Mike Tyson terrible childhood became this ferocious combat sports athlete but probably one of the greatest heavy one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time a legend right why out of pain at a suffering out of understanding that you don't want to ever go back to that place again you what you have to find some way out I think that's why some parents you know they call them the helicopter parent or the the the dad that's always at football practice that's yelling at their son you know like I think they know that too so they try to make sometimes parents try to make it more difficult on their kids I think those people are usually living vicariously through their children and they usually were bitch athletes huh and they want their kids to be good yeah are you competitive what your are you a competitive dad what do you mean in what way I I don't know sports I make a real concerted effort to be happy for everybody okay everybody the other team to say that was really good wow she's like when when my daughter's play sports they played basketball and soccer and a bunch other shit I always make I always go out of my way to say that girl on the other team is really good like wow look how good she is at passing like no judgment like no like fuck that team we're number one that's nonsense yeah I mean my some of those parents do that shit and that gets me upset my dad little girl knows how to hustle look at her go like I make an effort to praise everybody see I would be like that but right now my son is too and I get mad when other two-year-olds are bigger than him like I'm that dude right now like but I want him to be the biggest the best and the biggest I don't here's a guy he's gonna be a big kid some no grow later I hope so how big his wife she's five five nine so you're gonna have a big kid I hope so but right now don't worry about a feedom give him help me I'll give you some but the doctor was like well he's on the smaller side and that really messed up it's so now what every time and I hate that I'm this guy every time I'm always a culture he told your kid I know but dude no but I won't be that after I know like he's very athletic he hits a golf ball like a beast already at two o Joe yeah you got another Tiger Woods coming pull do me a favor you have to see this Joe lightly yeah pull up my Instagram go down about six rows it's sad that I know exactly but it's a photo of him it's a video of him hitting a golf ball out of the like over a fence really and this was six months ago so he was like he was just turned 2 Wow and we don't eat it I don't force it on him I want to put that do god he watches it on TV cuz I like watching golf sometimes so he watches it it's him you see it yeah I mean it's amazing we take him too sometimes he'll he has a ass to play so if he asked me he'll go I want to go like to range so I'll take him to the driving range professional golfers sit there and watch them really coaches coaches will hold it okay no no no go back a couple more go back a couple more there's it's right where is it where is it where is it no yes that one right here watch this over the fence and watch him hold and watch him hold it dude that's incredible yeah that's incredible for a two-year-old yeah he like he got some fucking airtime there look at that thing go yeah Oh was it easy so the hole looks a little so big cuz he's a little so little yeah Wow look at that that's nuts over the fence dude and we didn't even teach him see if that's incredible you didn't teach him how to do that no he watched it on TV and I've never Moneyball ha to play golf I'm never play golf that's crazy yeah you watch golf you don't play golf I went Tiger Woods you remember when he won this is about the time like six seven eight months ago when he won that he came back and made a big win and I was like oh let's watch it so he my son started like golf golf gosh so we grabbed a golf club my father-in-law plays golf but he comes over sometimes but my son just took to it picked up a golf club we bought him some stuff and he just started hitting balls that's crazy it's bananas but that's really crazy yes if he can do that with twisting the torso and he knows how to rotate his feet yeah that's one of the things that kids get stuck when you teach them martial arts they don't rotate their feet right because the way to get torque is you have to you have to pivot on your the ball your feet he's doing that instinctively already got it that's a maze always mirroring so I was saying these coaches are like hold is he of like - they're like ok let me know when he's five cuz they can't they can't coach a kid - they're five I guess that's some kind of golf role or something he's gonna be a wizard by the time he's five take him to miniature golf and work on his putting skills and then by the time he's five yeah I'm sued I'm being retired about 17 years talk about gravy train invest much money in golf like that's something to really I have a friend and his daughter is playing golf and he got her into golf specifically because he said that's a great way to get a scholarship if you if you could go back and play what sport what would it be me it's golf 100% pool I wish pool had a professional league I wish that me like a little I mean it does have professional league but it's not they don't you can make any money well I'm talking about money like if you go back and play one thing to make money I avoided golf because I get addicted to games and I knew golf would take eight hours it takes two I would see comics that would really get into golf and I'd see their their comedy slip off because they were paying too much attention to golf and I was like I'm good and you tired you walk around the course all day with the fucking bag clubs cuz comics are poor in a golf court you know you're playing in public courses and I would see these guys they would they come in son Burt eight hours of drinking and and not gonna ball around and then they'd be tired when they did stand-up and I was like oh I can't fuck with this that golf bag is heavy well also I have a real addiction problem with games like it's a real issue I get very very very addicted to games so I can't I can't fuck with golf I know you love those shooter games right I love quake quake is the one for me but I love playing pool too playing pool was a huge part of my my youth when I lived in New York I played in tournaments I played every day I would go to the comedy club this is what I would do is my mourning day I would get up around noon usually I go to the gym work out go to the pool hall hang out play a little bit go to do my comedy show come home from my comedy show go straight to the pool hall that's I won't bring my pool cue with me to the to the shows I leave it in my trunk and then on my way back from the comedy club I would go straight to the pool hall I play all night so were you good yeah it was good okay yeah I could play like I'm a B player I'm like we call a B player like I have won tournaments before when I was playing every I mean not like a big tournament but I played in some professional tournaments I never did well but uh you know I beat some people that were pretty decent players I never beat a real like legit pro but I could have played professional if I really put the time and effort into it like I got clock and run out like I can break and run out of game at 9:00 got you I can I think I'm the most have broken to run I was I think I broke out four racks in a row and I think I ran 70 balls playing straight pool it's not it's not top of the food chain but it's legit I can play a little bit which we call shortstop that's we look at all a shortstop player but I could I mean this is when I was in my early early 20s if I dedicated myself to it I had the desire and I had the interest to try to play professionally and that and the difference between someone who's an amateur and a professional is really just about time and focus and desert but there's no money in it yeah if there was money in professional pool like golf money I would want I wouldn't want problem yeah a hundred percent like I love it my thing is I wanted to be professional football player until I got all these concussions now I look at my son and everybody goes are you gonna let your son play football I'm like no don't I can't no I was like my son fight for sure I would never let him play football no those are car wrecks happen and every time you each other hit each other in a head exactly that's exactly the way to look at it it's a car wreck cuz like even when you get knocked out like it's not nearly even occasionally it is but most of times not it's not nearly the kind of force that a football player is hit all the time and you get hit like that in practice you get hit like that in high school you get hit like that in college you get hit like that in all these games and it all adds up man it all adds up and a lot of these guys by the time they're young like they said Aaron Hernandez when he died when they checked his brain he had one of the worst cases of CTE they had ever seen I think they said it was like of a almost like his brain lived like 50 or 60 it was aged so much in a short amount of time did you watch that document I haven't watched that documentary it's insane but also when you when we go over the stuff that's in CTE mood and all the other impulsive bad behavior all those issues like that was that guy's life yeah those stuffs what he did and how much of that shit came from playing football all of it a giant percentage of it a giant well even football when you get successful it brings on the wrong kind of friends so even if it wasn't his head money and fame brings different kind of people in your life too for sure and also you're being rewarded for being ultra violent like your your your success comes from being ultra violent you know that's a thing that happens with fighters like you develop skills to hurt people right and then as you get better at hurting people you get more accolades you get more success and then you delve further and deeper into this world of being this ultra violent assassin and then you know you that becomes your identity your identity is you're the guy who smashes people mm-hmm you know and it's it's all that's a it's a hard train to get off to once you're on that and that's your life and then also new 3637 and then you can't do it and you can't do anymore or you're not doing it well and you're getting you're becoming the nail and out the hammer and you're like fuck what am i doing with my life and then with each fight that you have when you're slipping a little bit you so I'm just gonna fight till I'm 40 the real damage is those ages 36 37 38 39 40 fights those that's where the real damage is coming because those are the ones you're getting Kayode those are the ones are getting rocked all the time you know your you lost the step you've taken a lot of damage maybe knees are gone maybe your back's fucked up and truth is people people have a tough time quitting well I like it I look I I see football players I used to know a lot of football players that would interview them and different things like that it's crazy that all your life you're glorified as this one thing and then once it's gone it's it's hard like I remember I couldn't play college football anymore it's like what do I do now you get it some type of depression where you like for sure this is what I was this is what I trained all my life for and now it's gone now what I do well one of the reasons why do so many different things is because I don't like banking on any one thing a hundred percent I don't think it's wise it's not good for me either I like being I like being interested in different stuff you know that's also like well I have all these hobbies I have all these different things and I'm interested whether it's playing pool or archery or hunting or any of these other things that I'm interested in I'm not just interested in them for the end like with hunting the end is always the the excellent meat that you get out of it and the fact that you're eating this organic wild game that's the best food in the world that's for sure number one but it's also the difficulty in the pursuit allows me to express myself in a different way allows me also allows me because I'm not that good at it I mean I'm better at it than a regular person but in terms of like I have friends that are like world-class archers and bow hunters like my friends John Dudley and Kamryn Haines those two guys are two the very best bow hunters in the world and they're my mentors they help me out a lot but I like sucking at things mm-hmm cuz you can learn about yourself you learn about yourself from concentrating it's not something that's ingrained in my psyche in my brain it's something that I have to concentrate on and practice every day and I think there's a real benefit in sucking at things yes even if you're a you're excellent at something find something you suck at and get better at it it's it's really there's real benefit to that for to being a beginner it's it stimulates your mind in a way that when you've already achieved a certain level of success or a certain level of some high level of ability at something where you've been doing it most of your life you sort of like you get accustomed to this feeling of being really good at something the real growth isn't sucking the real growth is in like that's why I like yoga I've been doing yoga for like fucking years I still suck I suck like most classes I fall out of poses I don't however I mean I occasionally make it through the whole pose without sweating and shaking and straining but I never made it through an entire class without ever falling out of any poses I've never done that ever ever I've never had a one class where I made it to the end but I see these old ladies doing it right next to me rushing yeah crushing it little ninety-year-old old lady just fucking holding her feet up in front of her and they some people they've done that kind of shit a long time but the real I mean it's great for them don't get me wrong the real growth in things is sucking learning learning like how do I do this what do I do because then when you can do it it's all the more gratifying it's all the more gratified but also it opens up new pathways in your mind when you learn learning things whether you're learning a language and I'm talking about my ass there cuz I don't know any language uh but this is what I've been told is that it helps you intellectually when you're learning a game like chess that's complex when you're learning archery when you're learning things that require all these moving parts to come together that's why martial arts is so good you're using your brain because you're thinking things through you're also using your brain because you're managing your emotions you're also using your brain because you're managing your discipline and your will so you cuz you don't want to quit and then you're using your brain to try to harden your body and condition your body and get it to the point where you can actually do jujitsu effectively yeah and then you also have to get discipline so that you go to the gym all the time so you have strength in order to execute these moves and you have cardiovascular endurance in order to survive the rounds all those things are not just good for jiu-jitsu they're good for life like my talk when no instructor said something to me when I was really young and he said Taekwondo is a vehicle for developing your human potential and I was like oh I get it so this is just a thing I'm doing and the better I get at this thing now I understand how to get good at things that's what it is so when you do something new that you suck at whether it's yoga or playing golf or anything the growth is in learning the growth is in figure out what do i how am i holding it like this yeah okay does here hmm like you learn and in learning there's something that happens to you like your your mind expands the synapses fire you see things better I I'm so disappointed myself because I I said when my son was born I have a lady that comes over in I tell her just speak Spanish till you know three days a week so and I said by the time he's two or three I'm a no Spanish too cuz I'm a learn it when he learns it goddamnit I don't know one word of Spanish besides a lot right but I'm upstairs the other day and this lady is talking to my son in Spanish and he's answering in Spanish and I have no idea what they're talking about wizard off plans great for them man oh it's so good but but like my I don't know my parents didn't didn't like why wouldn't they teach me in the well why wouldn't my mom talk to me in Korean she wanted to Americanize me because people made fun of her so now it's except like it's cool to know other languages now before it was like oh you know they would do this to my mom you know the Asian to my mom so my mom was like I gotta Americanized you as soon as possible I don't want you to have to go through that and I feel cheated because I should know Korean I should know Spanish I lived in Texas and Miami and I'm just this dude that doesn't even I lived in Miami for eight years and don't know Spanish and Texas like I'm pathetic and I said my daughter was born I go you know what by the time she's three i'ma learn Spanish and she's three months I haven't taken one class but I am though I am gonna start you know why don't you do what do you listen to when you're in your car you driving her books books just listen to Spanish doesn't listen to things on like one of those rosetta stone I'm gonna do it um you know what last time I was here do it I started working out to it next time I come I'm gonna do my whole interview and speak you know Tom Segura is doing his whole special in Spanish I didn't even know that dude spoke Spanish Maisie Lewin you should see him and his mom his mom together doing a podcast in Spanish it's fucking hilarious his mom's hilarious his mom farts so loud and he caught her like she was farting like in the house and she would they were laughing at it and so then he filmed her when she didn't know and she sit in front of the kitchen and she rips this fucking tremendous fart yeah listen to them play play some of it cuz it's hilarious to legatos other thing nice yeah normal no time normal normal pedo NSA Polk Atticus hasta con el yunque no love at William I can't see he looks like a bro ya know it's interesting people talk shit around him in Spanish and then he'll let let it go for a little while and then he'll just respond in perfect Spanish and they're like oh yeah he just signed it to deal Netflix but is mission one in Spanish dude I could have done one in English and one in Korean you screwing me out of money over here is there anyone who's doing other bilingual specials was there anyone different I mean I'm sure there is but I'm sure Diaz does Spanglish shows so he'll do like half of it in English and have it in Spanish and he'll let the people know like he's doing some shows in Miami and and he writes down there in Spanglish so he's letting people know a lot of ways gonna be doing is like Cuban flavored stand-up well in Miami they're all the radio stations they are Spanglish most of them yeah there you go hola como estas all right coming up we're gonna and then they go like that's all I know that's all I know is all like almost awesome you can learn I will okay oh well get aggressive no no no last time I was here I started lifting weights and everything so now next time I come I'm speaking Spanish Korean Oh beautiful you got a podcast studio now rolling I'm telling you it's inspiring dude you are inspiring oh thank you yeah I may be happy to hear that but I think but but what I love about you there they are all about like the positivity you know I know a lot of times they can leave some comments and stuff like that but the people that reached out to me and I don't read comments put the people that directly DM me it was all like dude this this this this disa for sending me workouts and I was like this is great man this means it's a very very happy this is what it's about that is what it's about that makes me very happy yeah yeah man I think he put it out if you put that out there that's what comes back you know I think when you have a negative message you know you're gonna get a lot of negativity your way yeah people that are real negative all the time their fans are all negative I mean it just goes hand in hand doesn't yeah it does my friend you know I have a friend he you know he hasn't broke her anything but he's a comic but when he goes up he goes I don't know why I always get heckled like literally every time I go up I get heckled and I go well you're always yelling out the crowd you like like he's mad he goes up yelling at the crowd if they don't laugh at the beginning what fuck you guys like about people that are inspiringly think about Goggins right yeah Goggins his message has changed so many people's lives and it's it's he's changing their lives a lot of it just by explaining what he does so he puts that energy out there people attract that energy and then they respond likewise they respond and turn you know that's what happens in this world when you know and then there's always people that are hating on him fuck you pussy you know you this you that you know you didn't do this you didn't do that like you ain't shit I'll fuck you up if I find you crazy people also one of the reasons why they be one of the reasons why they hate people is they don't like being they don't like measuring up to someone and coming up short when you see a guy like David Goggins and you realize like I don't have that kind of will I guys just don't have that kind of will like this guy's getting up every day and running marathons he's doing broke the world record for the amount of chin-ups you can do in 24 hours but he's not asking you to do that like like this morning the perfect is a 430 I woke up and I always have coffee at 5:00 and and I wasn't always waking up before 3:00 at 4:30 why after I read that book yeah exactly oh yeah I wake up at 4:30 now every morning and at 5:00 I drink a coffee and I workout at 6:00 at 5:15 I was like you know what maybe I'm not gonna end in WTF oh all my mirrors like work the fuck out and I was like I'm gonna go because of that book I'm still like drinking that kool-aid man like that's good kool-aid so it's changed my life like when I say I did this part changed I like 4:30 every morning and I go and I fall asleep around 9:00 every single day that's my schedule that's beautiful yeah that's a good schedule and in since the last time I've been here I was like look I hosted a lot but now I'm just gonna invest in and stand up in I know you're at acting but I want to just I want to support my goal by the end of this year's be able to 100% fully support my family just don't stand up you know just touring yeah well the acting thing is fine if you love acting like this look I was watching this show last night that I'm addicted to the outside of this HBO show I've heard of it I haven't seen oh it's good when there's this one guy plays the lead detective he's such a good actor he's so good he's so good that it makes you want to act it makes you like oh god damn that would be a good like acting with someone like that where you it's a real craft like there's a fucking dance that he's doing with those people he's acting with I really enjoy watching that and I'm like maybe maybe I could do something like that maybe I would be interested in doing something like that because like there's not like the the prejudice that I have about actors is the because of the worst ones that have worked with or the worst ones that have met are the worst ones that I've known that are just really annoying and self-obsessed and they're doing they're doing nonsense they're like they're like terrible comedians but they don't have punchlines you know terrible comedians are all about themselves and they just they dominate every conversation talking about themselves and what they're doing what they want to do and how they're not getting booked anywhere else because these people don't like them because they're fucking jealous cuz dude you know they're people right you know I just gotta just keep movin with those people they'll stick to you like glue they'll ugly cheese they just they just start sucking blood out of you well because they're always blaming other people for their downfall yes it's like well you know I'm not getting cuz this person's gotta or I don't understand why this person is doing it yeah I was here way before them and I was like well that's the problem yeah you had an opportunity yeah that's a problem you fucked something up and you don't want to listen you don't want to listen and something some of them are good at taking advice but most of them are bad most of them when you tell them this is what you're doing wrong yes not wrong yeah most people don't want to hear their own issues you know and because they haven't been saying it to themselves like there's not a fucking person on this planet that'll criticize me harder than I criticize myself I do not say well get up in the middle of the night to take a piss and I'll be like you fucking loser like your shit together like I know I've done a lot of crazy shit I know my life has been pretty extraordinary in terms of like amount of success that I've had I fuckin I'm I'm still never happy never happy with anything anything I've done anything well you always can you better oh wait that's why oh and the people that like like I don't understand I hope nobody takes this wrong way but I don't understand how you could be in something I don't care if it's comedy or working wherever you and you haven't shown progress yeah how do you stay in it how do you stay how do you stay and what are you doing wrong you just floating by yeah how you're not getting better they're not yeah but there's a lot of people you know there's the people like that in everything and I remember that in pool there was people that never develop the proper technique and I would watch them play and I mean years and years and like when I started I sucked in the beginning and then there was people that also sucked with me now years later I became a good player and those people stayed the same yeah they still fucking say them put in the work yeah so when I would want to play with them they didn't wanna play I'm like why don't you want to play they like you too good I'm like what do you mean I'm too good bitch we still I started out after you like how come you not any better like what's going on here well what's going on is they didn't really concentrate on evaluating what they're doing and looking at it from like a technical perspective looking at it like in like your mechanics are your mechanics off like the way your son hit that golf ball he is already on this crazy path where he understands physical mechanics mm-hmm some people never get it some people there's guys you go to I'm sure I don't fall golf but I'm sure if you went to a public golf course there's guys right now that are 50 years old they can't hit a ball that not like that I've been playing their whole life yeah they don't do it right yeah some people just don't learn but I also though I think in like I'm a fail fast person like if I'm not good at something I don't stay in it like I'm that's me I feel oh yeah I felt how's that possible because you learned and got way better at stand-up well yeah but I didn't but I did okay my first couple - I was gonna get myself three times I said if I go up three times I did that was what I said because I I'm from that mentality fail-fast you know because I don't invest time and something I don't think that's gonna move forward for me you know what I mean so I first time I did stand-up was the Miami improv it went well second night the I opened up for the Wayans brothers well you were first night you were already a radio personality yeah in Miami so I had a whole I was home team right and then Wayans brothers they were in West Palm Beach home team kind of and but after the first time I got off stage I called my mom and I was like this is what I was born I love it so much I'm at home I'll just be staring off in the distance and my wife walked by I go comedy like she knows because she's talking to me I'm not hearing it and that's how much I love it so much because it's it's the only true art where it's just you and the crowd and what I love about it is the stage is not prejudiced that's a it may be political getting on that stage but once you're up there it doesn't matter if you're funny if you're funny yeah and that's that's why I love it because we're in the industry you know we're what I do you get a lot of nose man no no no you can't do it but to have an outlet that same night to go up and get 300 yeses yeah it just keeps you in the game you don't need someone to approve whether or not you get to work yes yeah yeah like you don't have to eat you don't have to get picked out of a lineup of people that are trying to play the part of Bob like are you reading for Bob come on in here Michael so I see you're a comedian and you were one on the first season of Fear Factor okay that's my credits thank you so you're in Justin to Kelly in Fear Factor yeah that's my two credits come on in and okay you're you're reading for the part of Bob remember bob is gay did you know yes of course I do and we're not playing it like okay we're not yes think mayor Pete maybe I don't think like the next-door neighbor on three company well maybe some direction I mean who's losing a famous gay character sitcom oh willing grace right Oh jack yeah just jack yeah yeah so I did it right yeah if that's your example you do it like that well if I'm going off your the cast injury I'm going off your cue so if you say you how to do it don't they want to see you like what your take on it is yeah yeah but no they give a description mmm okay so by your description Will and Grace I did it right yes so nobody can get mad okay bob has PTSD okay um yeah he's he's ready to rock and he's drunk ready go [Laughter] but I mean you're not you're way past this level but you gotta admit I mean comedy when you're up and coming is like that too oh we have you're trying to get stage time on these places you know so you're really on auditions all the time too yeah in a way you're also trying to find your voice on stage yeah how you do it yeah not totally sure just the right way is that the right way how should I be going on but that's also why it's so exciting no that's why I love it I love it and there's also one of the things that's so exciting about stand-up is there's really no one way to do it you know like if you play golf they're kind of one way to do it right you learn how to do it correctly I mean there's there's variations same thing with pool same thing even well not jiu-jitsu jiu-jitsu pretty eclectic there's a lot of different influences a lot of different styles but with comedy man you could be Steven right or you could be Chris Rock yeah there's just a lot of dance was so great about it it's the best yeah it's the best I got the Comedy Store when all these different what I love about the Comedy Store and what I don't like about LA people is they debate about spending $30 on a lineup where the rest of the country is spending fifty to a hundred dollars for that one comic like that just bloat that's how that's how the people in LA are so just not thankful there isn't that normal there's so much different there they say much tan yeah they take it for granted like I mean when you have these kid look I just did Salt Lake City and wise guys I love Salt Lake's Club oh my god dude right yeah they have to I did one it was my first time there I haven't I I did a while ago but it's my first time really there and man those people appreciate every joke yep they appreciate the experience where a lot of times I'll see to me a comic crushing up there and people on their phones people just yeah they don't know I don't know I just can't worry about that I know but I'm I'm not on say I'm just I just they're disrespecting I get mad when people disrespect the craft like I'm so in it like that it's like you should be paying attention did I get angry at people yeah you can't concentrate on them though just gotta do yourself yeah it's like your dumb friend who yells at the crowd yeah I don't know same shit yeah don't worry but but I'm in the back watching so I don't like dude this I need to be watching yeah well you're definitely gonna get a lot of self-absorbed people in this crowd you get a lot of are you I find that more at the improv not necessarily these days cuz most the times I'm at the improv it's my show yeah but I feel like that's a more Hollywood crowd in some weird way you know one of the things it's the comic store it's really shocking how many people come from not just out of state but out of the country over here I'll come to those lineups like I've run into people all the time they're like yeah we were doing comedy tourism we flew in from Scotland I'm like what you guys flew in from Scotland good hey yeah yeah you motherfuckers won't come out there so we came to you wow that's crazy but I feel like right now comedians that that are really killing it they're rock stars dude like rock stars I just saw jo koy sellout two shows at the Forum yeah and I was there and when he walked out it could have been Bruno Mars it could have been like same applause same everything and that's what I love is that this industry right now is on fire but the people leading it to and I like I've only been in at nine years but they're giving you know like what I think that's new yeah oh nine years ago when I started it was all about people Baxter talking shit about people now I think podcasting has changed the game now people are having I don't want to call them cliques but you got your people you know and those people that are in that clique they help other people yeah and I think it's that thing where with you with Tom with bird with even to Leah Theo von it's almost a British job in Bryan Callen I think it's a thing where people are like oh everybody can be successful yeah it's not just one person that has to be successful yeah a lot of people can be successful yeah and you get 350 million people in this fucking country so I want all of them bitch they're all for you well it's also - there's a brotherhood in a sisterhood yeah angst us and our friends that you are dealing with a very small number of people that are professionals at this on earth like when you go to the comedy store if I run into Anthony Jeselnik and I give him a hug it's not just he's my friend it's also he's one of maybe a thousand people I came on earth yeah maybe it's true maybe my and might not even be a thousand it might be five hundred like legit world-class headliners that can sell out of theater how many of those now I would say less than yeah I mean but it's not even just without sellout of theater I mean there's a lot of people that can't like my friend Owen Smith who I think is one of the best stand-up comics on earth he's so good he's so good I tell everybody I'm like that guy he just spent too much time writing on sitcoms and on movies and people just didn't know but when you go see him you know he's working with me tomorrow night at the improv or the second show he's a murderer man he's like as good as any comic alive as good as any comic alive he's one of the best on earth what do you think it is because you've reached that that that the peak can continue to grow but what do you think that when you're a comic and all of a sudden you just pop well I find out I think today it's the Internet to get it today it's the Internet like a YouTube video can make you one YouTube video like Angela Johnson that nailh bit that bit made her ear yeah yeah yeah Russell Peters he got famous off YouTube clips people seeing his YouTube clips and a lot like jo koy also it's like hey our people are represented yeah because like for a lot of time like who the fuck was Indian that was a famous comic nobody Russell comes along hilarious Indian you know and make it fun of all races and people like holy shit yeah I and then it starts with that and then like what I love about Joe it started with Filipinos and now everybody join it and I think like when I watched Joe's journey it was like Chelle he was already in full stride of like killing it and staying up then he got Oh Chelsea then at work when Adam Carolla so everything kind of exposure like you said I I today it's kind of like American Idol there's a lot of Kelly Clarkson's but Kelly Clarkson won the first season of American Idol mm-hmm Carrie Underwood won whatever say so these are great singers you just need exposure you know exposures everything podcasts the beautiful thing about podcasts is every first of all comics unlike in the past like say if you were the host of The Tonight Show and you were Jay Leno and then David Letterman was the host of his show you guys weren't competition I guess that shit's on the same time to fuck him fuck you know everyone's backstabbing like these two have deals like if you would go on one of those shows you couldn't go on the other show oh maybe it's not as hardcore but yeah yeah that's so dumb it's so dumb but I had to do that back then because there was only one host of The Tonight Show and there was only one host of this show and one host of that show I mean all told that all the people on television that did late-night talk shows there might have been six six people and how many comics were there hoping Jay Leno had a heart attack so they could take that spot hoping Conan O'Brien would drop dead hoping hoping yeah right now it's not like that anymore now everyone can have a podcast and everybody does each other's podcasts and everybody tells everybody hey go see Michael yo hey Jo koy hilarious hey i saw chris d'elia thing on that murder and I saw you know I saw Anthony Jeselnik crush it in the main room and people loved it they're happy that that other people are successful so you you see that to that that's only happened in the last like three or four years it's like I think it's about five five years about five years yeah I think it's all a part of this might be even a little more than five years but the part but the point is it's all part of this transition to the internet because the transition to the Internet is a transition of opulence like this where we're all blessed there's there's abundance there's no scarcity like they used to be scarcity before it was like oh there's only a few spots if you want to get a sitcom you and I show up in the audition room and I'm looking at you and you look at me and we keep playing for Bob yeah you gonna play gay are you gonna play yeah yeah oh good luck with that choice yeah each other and get weird there was a lot of backstabbing weird shit in those days and that stuff's gone you know everybody's happy they see each other and also they support each other on the road they take each other places like they do shows together and one of the things that I realized early on you know you make less money if you take people on the road with you and you pay for their flight you pay for their land you pay for their meals you have so much more fun it's way more fun man way more fun it goes from being depressing like I've done the road by myself and you're sitting in the hotel room staring at the fucking TV bored counting down the time to show and then you're working with some dick shit some ass fuck from fucking Pittsburgh that sucks and just like God's local guys terrible and you call your friends bro where are you you know I'm in Baltimore Oh use any good though it sucks like yeah wish we were doing a show together and and then I realized somewhere along the line that I for my own mental sanity I'd rather take a pay cut and just take guys in the road with me so I started doing that I was doing that early on I was doing that like the early 2000 so stayed with people in the road with me and too much to the it was a problem sometimes like club owners were like we would like to book the opening acts I'm like yeah yeah like we want to use our local guys I'm like I don't know them and then a lot of those guys step on your material to like say if you have a bit about your dad oh yeah a bit that's real similar about their dad yeah well it's a thing where ever since I started like once I started headlining always brought my own people and yeah it is a bit and I don't make close to the money you make but it's it's a thing where I know the investment it makes me a lot better on stage because I know the whole show from start to end is gonna be good oh yeah you know I've had horrible experiences like I remember one time one of my friends couldn't come and man host is just I mean literally 20 minutes of silence and then it's like alright here's your headline this is angry angry go up their money I think also just being around the comics at the Laugh Factory improv and Comedy Store it's a thing where now people before it's like oh if somebody crushes you know I don't want them to crush but now people love to go once they want to be a part of the great show not be the only funny one and the show you know it's so insecure that not wanting anybody to be good here's the thing just didn't you get into comedy because you liked it yeah so bring people that are funny dude I brought Joey Diaz with me from the start I know I had some rough shows early on where I was like I gotta get better does Joey be up there murdering then I'd go up after oh so good you know but it made me jealous I had to step it up yeah but it's also like I wanted to laugh like I want to have fun you know not only did I bring Joey in the road with me but this is during Joey's drug days I brought a second opening act case Joey didn't show up because Joey did instead of not booking Joey mr. book and re so I brought book re and Joey so if Joey showed up great we have three minutes so if Joey didn't show up got a two-man show but I always had an opening act that way Wow did he ever not show up a couple times okay not that many but it was always touch-and-go yeah he'll and sometimes you just leave on Sunday I told you I'm can you say the nicest human being I love on earth I love him to death it's my brother every time I see him man it's like yeah yeah he's just so nice I love him I love you so much and I love him and I've seen him on his full journey you know I've seen him from being this guy who's like fresh out of jail was a fucking criminal when I first met him I could tell but I knew so many guys like that from the pool hall and from fight gyms and I was like oh look at this real guy hanging around the family store I'm like what's up man and Joey and I we hit it off like that like immediately like immediately and then to see him transform to being one of the best comics on earth it's uh it's so satisfying to see him go and sell out the Chicago theater Chicago theatres 37 other people he said that out like instantly he's a murderer he's so good it's so good no one no one on earth makes me laugh harder there's a lot of great comics out there but Joey's special to me he's special and the thing is nobody can duplicate what not at all not at all no it's amazing but you know it's also he's he's a product of the Comedy Store like a real product of The Comedy Store like that the freedom to take chances and to be loose and wild like that's that's where all that stuff's from when you first met him was he like that like on stage no he had to learn how to be that way on stage off stage he was hilarious though he would hold court in the back I'll get the back parking lot we'd all be hanging out back there and Joey Diaz just be telling stories we'd be falling down laughing and he would be good on stage he would do well but he would tighten up he would worry about being cast in a movie you you know that was always the thing like he wanted to be in a movie or a show or and you know that that kind of pressure of worrying about people what people care that's constricting and then somewhere along the line he just stopped giving a fuck he just stopped giving a fuck and when he stopped giving a fuck you just go up there and destroy and it was a quick transition it was like he went from being like kind of good doing okay but really funny offstage to figuring it out and if you ask him he just stopped giving a fuck he just realized he goes I realize all these motherfuckers aren't gonna help me yeah like they're not gonna help me fuck down they're all idiots and they'd come and go the agents would get fired and you realize like I was like fucking thinking mm-hmm and he figured it out you know how long did it take you to get to that point cuz I know like you were in acting world and but when did you get to that point well I started doing stand-up first I did stand-up in 88 and I never planned on acting I got in acting just because of stand-up I did a MTV half-hour comedy hour and from there end up getting a development deal and I want to being on a sitcom and I didn't really like it and I was ready to quit but I had already gotten a lease so I was out here and I already had an apartment yeah I was ready to go back to New York like a hundred percent what didn't you like about it I didn't like the actors oh they're the actors on it I didn't but now the actors on the show some of them I was friends with I enjoyed their company but there was a bunch of ones that I met that I did not like I didn't enjoy the circles I got to go out with comm with actors rather go out to dinner with them they'd bring their friends like who's this fucking liar you're bringing this crazy egomaniac narcissist liar and we'll have to sit here and have dinner with these people they so many of them are so crazy and again this is low-level people trying to get into acting like open my curse if you go to open mics you'll see the occasional Jam like wow that guy is probably gonna make it and then you'll see oh this person's fucking crazy there's hanging around this industry and you got that with acting too and I just I didn't like it I didn't and I also didn't like the whole thing of needing people the auditioning thing that you would get in LA would develop a type of person that was just like very guarded and fake and very they were trying to project what they wanted you to see rather than be who they were I enjoyed New York I enjoyed Boston I enjoyed the East Coast it was just those are my people so I didn't like it but I had a lease so I stayed and so then I got on this news radio show and I was on that for five years and then after that was over okay I'm done with this acting shit okay so would you say is that the time where you're like oh I tried a little bit after that I did a little bit of it I did I did some auditions and I got a couple of development deals to do my own show but they were terrible and then Fear Factor came along I was like oh this makes sense I'll do that did you like it the whole time or no no no but it was money there's my crazy money yeah it was also it was the biggest show in the like in the u.s. at that time - at one point time it was yeah and we did 148 episodes there was so many episodes and then we came back and did six more it was it was a good way to make money and not need need Hollywood anymore and that's when I really realized that I act anymore that was where it was right the only thing I acted at all after that was my friend Kevin James he's just cuz he asked me to and we got ease I did zookeeper and here comes the boom but I only did them for fun because I was his friend and and then podcasting and when podcasting came along then I was like in the beginning was just fun like I didn't realize what was even going on until many years in I was at the Chicago theater the same place I was talking about where Joey sold out and I was gonna bring something up and I go I go so this happen how many guys listen to the podcast anyway yeah I was like whoa like I did not expect that I didn't I don't pay attention to the numbers so I didn't know how many people what download how many years in was this other pocket three or four four four four so six years ago and I was like holy shit cuz for those years in the beginning it was nonsense first of all we'd get barbecued out of our fucking minds we're half the time I didn't know what I was saying while saying it was a real problem um you know we didn't take it seriously didn't think people were listening it was a fun silly way to get really fucked up and talk with friends and no one was thinking it was it was like comedy in the early days yeah no one was thinking this is a curse it's almost like in a green room you're just talking you're just fun yeah I enjoy people I do I enjoy talking to people I like hearing how people think I like hearing people's perspectives and so the beginning it was like a lot of that just hanging out and making each other laugh and talk to shit and saying silly things and then that one day I'll never forget how many people listened in the podcast not roar and I got nervous I was like oh no like what is this like what's happening here like then I started thinking like oh this is like a major part of my life a major part of my career and I wasn't even realizing it was so there's like four years in Wow yeah and then I started getting guests that's when I started getting guests on like somewhere around four years and I started getting guests and then like all these different people come on but no don't ask people to be on it and then people who had heard about it and they'd be on and some people still a podcast like what are you doing yeah like a radio show on the Internet like who's listening like yeah that's not so many people and then it just became what it is now but it became what it is now I'm just like it had a mind of its own man and I really think that sometimes I really think that I know that sounds really stupid because for sure I keep showing up but for sure I pay attention for sure I try hard and for sure I work at it but I think his things like it wanted to be made mm-hmm it sounds crazy but no I get you I get it needed it like you not even know if it needed it it's like there was a place there was a spot that was open and that spot was open for like honest conversation open-minded conversation and an inquisitive conversation and letting people explain things over long periods of time and then some of those people just like Brian Greene who was a physicist who I had on the other day I have to listen to his podcast two or three times just to try to really grasp what he was saying mm-hmm that happens all the time talk to brilliant people you know Aubrey de Grey was on yesterday who's an expert in anti-aging technologies so we were talking about all this stuff and I'm just thinking like Here I am talking this guy spends his entire life trying to extend people's lifespan to five hundred plus years and he's in the middle of this right now and he's running this Institute in Northern California that's designed or does designing all these different specific methods of extending life and they're experimenting and doing all these different things and raising money and like this such a weird path I've gotten on but does he really think he can do it oh yeah he can do it 500 years yeah they're on they're on the road to that yeah with stem cells and a bunch of the different biologics that they're experimenting with and all sorts of different and as the technology increases and grows and then CRISPR which is a gene editing tool and a lot of the other things that they're probably going to invent over the next three or five three to five years he believes is gonna be some giant breakthroughs see that's legitimate so is it more of the the benefit is the generations like the like two generations after us are gonna benefit heavily no I think we're gonna benefit from it you think so it regenerative regenerative rather meaning you're literally gonna not just stop aging it's gonna regenerate to the point where it's gonna let your biological age even though your physical age your calendar age is sustained the same you're gonna keep getting older that way you but your biological age it's gonna go backwards yeah because what they're doing as a treating they're treating aging like a disease they're not okay they're not treating it like an inevitable aspect of life they treat well they're like well what's causing aging well breakdown of the body due to normal stresses and just overall use but okay well what is the difference between someone who's five or six versus someone who's 50 or 60 well the body's ability to regenerate tissue about body's ability to recover and you know all these different things that are going on inside the cells and what what causes that like what is the mitochondria what it would how does how do we get that to function embarrass NAB this stuff yeah hundred percent that's one aspect of it yeah that nad is one piece in an agenda MoDOT mandala of different different methodologies and they're they're gonna they're gonna be able to come up look just think about what they can do now versus what they could do 50 years ago 50 years ago if you blew your knee out you were fucked yeah you were fucked my friend Steve Graham the good buddy mind he used to be on the US Ski Team and his knees are destroyed he was on a ski team in 80s and they cut him open like a fish giant scars up and down the sides of his legs and they had a stitch things together and bolt things down and it's just a mess in there just a fat mess and nowadays I mean both of my knees been reconstructed yeah I have two reconstructed ACLs they work great you know there's no issues I mean I can do literally everything I do yoga kickbox different things with reconstruction knees and I mean have you seen the way I kick a heavy bag there's an enormous amount of force that's on those knees no problem at all and when you think about what they're going to be able to do 50 years from now they're gonna make you an 18 year old you're gonna be able to regenerate tissue all the things that are happening to people's disks where they get degenerative disc disease which I have which your disc gets smaller and actually your your spinal calls actually compacted more and you have to like try to mitigate that with spinal decompression a bunch of different things they can be able to inject stem cells into that it's gonna read regrowth or they're already showing that right yeah yeah yeah we're on the verge but my point is like how the fuck did I wind up talking to these people what how does you know I didn't really pay much attention in school how am I talking to these people how did this however always happen how are presidential candidates coming to me trying to get on the podcast so I can help them spread their message like what the fuck happened I mean I really feel like it sounds like wacky woo woo but there was eye opening in the universe it was like an opening and somehow or another I was the one who step through that opening and I'd even know I was doing it while I was doing it and this thing the seeds were planted and this thing just grew and then I became responsible for taking care of it well yeah I think because you did it started out organic to 100% you didn't started saying I'm gonna do this because I know ambition yeah zero that's also a big problem with other people that are trying to start podcast so I got a conversation when Jon Lovitz about it's like you know nobody wants to pay me me me any money to do it I go they're not gonna pay you in money if they don't make any money and he goes well they should just pay money that way they can do it it'll be good I was like okay he's telling me you have a podcast network I go no I don't yes you do put me in your network John I don't have a network I do not have a network I had explained to him but his his thing was that somebody wanted him to do a podcast but I didn't want to pay him they didn't want to pay him what he felt he should get paid for a podcast I'm like they're not gonna make any money until it's successful yeah the only way it's gonna be successful is if you do it yeah and 99% of them aren't successful but yeah there's so many of them yeah there's 900,000 podcasts there's 300 and what thirty forty fifty million people so what does that mean that means like one out of every three hundred people as a fucking podcast yeah is that real yeah that's great yeah sounds right that's crazy wait there's nine hundred thousand podcast yeah that's crazy I mean they're international ones too but yeah yeah for sure that sounds pretty close to right it's even let's cut out let's cut it in half because of international okay so let's say one out of every six yeah it was 500 one out of 500 people has it that's how crazy is now saying I was insane I know that is probably accurate my wife's friends have podcasts I got stopped by a black lady at an airport 80 years old she goes I saw your podcast it's just amazing the range yeah I'm like how do you like I cuz you know me I'm expecting a certain person like I just really old guy come up to me in a restaurant and he looked like he was deep in his 80s and it was just I just really want you to know I enjoy your program is like a very thoughtful program and you really you have an interesting way of looking at things I was like you you watch it Wow yeah yeah I want to ask you about and this maybe I'll talk about the Dante Wilder excuse he came out with yes today what he's unfortunate do you do you think is there any validity to that if there's look I put up do you know what a it's called a was it called Atlas PAC yes I put Atlas pack on my back all the time and I put a 45-pound plate on who so it's about 55 pounds and I go hiking through the hills and after I could still do whatever the fuck I want okay and I'm just Joe Rogan I'm not on tape fucking Wilder the idea that Deontay Wilder with a 40-pound outfit on that it killed his legs walking to the ring that's crazy talk I don't understand why he would say that I mean maybe it's true if it's true he said he had it on like 20 minutes before or 15 minutes before he went out it's possible look it's possible the dead tired him out it's possible see I'm not like I'm no fight expert or anything so I just don't know if there's validity in it well who the fuck would let him put that on if that was that heavy that it was 40 pounds and it got to the point where it actually wore his body out as he was walking to the ring well he tried it on the night before they said and he liked it so he's like I'm aware well he makes the decisions it was his yeah that's a crazy decision no that's not what happened no I mean it might have war I mean you just got beat up it might wore him out but the real big thing happened in the third round mmm when Tyson Fury he he put that jab in his face and hit him with that beautiful overhand right right on the ear and dropped him equilibrium went off after that is that calls equal yeah hundred percent okay because he was he was bleeding out of his area so that's a significant injury it could be a ruptured eardrum when you get hit on the ear like that like a lot of times your eardrum ruptures happens all the time and when that happens you don't know how to stand up right your body is all wacky it's not moving correctly and that's what it looked like with him and that's what I was saying when I was watching it I was like his equilibrium soft I'll go this what's going on then eventually the commentator said it as well but his his legs weren't under him but also he was getting bombed on oh yeah who's getting bombed on and Tyson Fury was hanging on him he would wrap his arm around his head and lean on him with that 270 pounds so he's carrying all that shit to like an Tyson Fury did something that had never been done before and then he bullied Deontay Wilder he got on and he came in heavy and a lot of people thought he came in too heavy but I think one of the reasons why he came in heavy is this is part of the strategy he went to what's up you got something did not have a broken ear German parently a minor laceration to his ear Wilder did not have a broken jaw someone speculate nor did he have a broken eardrum he had a two centimeter cut on his ear that took seven stitches to close defeat the Fuhrer was the first a wireless professional career that's interesting so even though he didn't have a ruptured eardrum he still took a significant shot to the ear which often times fuck's up your equilibrium and any shot to the temple to the ear a lot of times it fuck's up your balance but look he got bombed on oh yeah and he entice and fury figured something out in the first fight that in the twelfth round Deonte did not like it when he came after him he said he doesn't fight well backing up he's awkward on his feet and so instead of letting Deonte come to him and he was boxing like he did for most of the first fight he fought the second fight the way he fought him in the second in the twelfth round he became it just get glued to his face run right after him hit him on the right hand and he bullied the bully you know and you know I don't mean Deonte is a bully like in a bad way I mean he's that his style is he's very aggressive he said one of the most ruthless punching knockout artists in the history of sport if not the number one I mean the guy has 42 knockouts which is insane like his really good time that maybe has 41 40 I think he's got 41 knockouts 42 wins one by decision and one draw and now he has one loss Tyson had less Titan went to the decision with a lot of people okay you know whence a decision with Mitch blood green went to decision with I mean you can go down the list there was a lot of people Tyson obviously one of the Great's and obviously a brutal knockout artist but Deontay Wilder has that touch of death it's crazy I mean he dropped Tyson Fury twice in their first fight and the 12th round it looked like he was fucked but do you think they should have stopped it at 7 or earlier I think it's better for his life and his career they stopped it he wasn't gonna come back I don't think he's gonna come back he's getting fucked up and Tyson Fury was gonna not gonna stop punching him in the head either he was gonna keep doing it Tyson was pure and clean and literally unharmed and looked fantastic I mean he'd been hit a couple of times but no problems yeah there was nothing that rocked him nothing that hurt him you know a few punches bounced off of him but he was puttin it on Deontay Wilder I mean he was putting it on yeah if that is true that he had it on for 20 minutes and that it really wore him out that's it that's exceptionally silly on the part of his management tool to happen that someone didn't see that that his trainer didn't see that it didn't recognize that that was gonna be a big problem because I'm getting calculated well I I think he just threw it on the night before and goes up feels good didn't really think I'm gonna be in this thing for close to thirty five minutes before I get on you know he has to be back there twenty minutes then the walk-up is like three or four minutes and then you'd walk him into the ring he got carried around while you're walking in the room yeah yeah you know that's good point it had an effect I guarantee would have an effect but it uestion is would it have enough of an effect that it would fuck his legs up to the point where he couldn't recover maybe maybe it's valid the only the only comparison I have it like I said I know nothing about boxing but if I hope my son is thirty-five pounds I'll hold him for like ten minutes I'm tired right baby but I'm not a professional boxer your arms are tired would you be tired now my kid might not know Veniero's eighty pounds I walk around Disneyland with her on my shoulders yeah I can you know I could see but then again I'm not fighting after we I could see it having an effect how much of an effect is the question it's just silly that they let him do it I mean if I pick that thing up and I was his trainer be hey hey hey feel this now think about how long we gonna have this huh fuck this mm-hmm let's just go out there norm on me guarantee you next time seem he's gonna be dressed like Tyson yeah just come out in the truck yeah just trunks a fucking small towel around his neck like Tyson used to do that was so but that was so intimidating the way that dude just came knocks he just came in like what let's do this and just storm towards that rain you would see death coming down that I like oh my god what if I signed up for and would I read a Tyson's book and I interviews like man I was like yes so he was scared yeah every time I walked in a ring he was petrified yeah it looked like it man well once he got in there he you know he put himself into the position that he's been many many many times just that he was the destroyer but all the lead-up to I mean anticipation fucks with everybody's head yeah I think Deonte would be better than ever for the next fight the question is if Tyson Fury fights in that same way and stays on him can he beat that Tyson Fury because Tyson Fury was just boxing his face who if when this does have it who would you pick out the gate on this one you have to pick Tyson Fury yeah cuz I think he won the first fight Deonte knocked him down twice but not only did he knock him down in the 12th round but Tyson Fury came back and won the remainder of that round so you could almost give that round a draw and then the other round when he knocked him down you got to give the Deontay Wilder the remaining ten rounds are not in dispute the remaining ten rounds went to Tyson Fury so if you just look at it on paper he should won that fight although most people weren't upset with the decision because Deonte almost had them out and it's like it's exciting let's do a rematch no big deal but then in the rematch Tyson Fury just took the judges out of the fucking equation that was bombed on them it's really unfortunate that there is a question of whether or not that big stupid suit was wearing his legs out because if that really is the case that bums me out man that's what he said but I was thinking it was a joke until you told me that it was like he wore it for 20 minutes then I was like home yeah well that would be different that's different that's real weight you know just put it on you walked out there for 30 seconds yeah this 40-pound thing on yeah well I wouldn't advise it no yeah it's not good but he had it on for at least 30 minutes I was if I'm guessing from the walking he said he had it on 20 minutes before the fight he had to do the walk up he had to give him a ring in it yeah and he said when he took it off he knew that was the game-changer he got to thank Deontay Wilder coming into that fight has flatlined every single opponent he's faced except for Tyson Fury Stu Verne he didn't flatline him in the first fight he's beat him by decision beat the shit out of him but in the second fight he fucking murked him so he was probably thinking he could murk anybody he always do is to touch him the way he did with Luis Ortiz same thing in the first fight had a tough first fight with him second fight mercs him with one punch I think he just had this thing in his head that that's what he does and he's going to do that to Tyson Fury too and he never believed that Tyson Fury was actually gonna fight that way there's gonna jump on him mm-hmm Tyson said he was gonna do I know but I told him the game playing like I'm telling after you really said you don't believe a word you're saying that's what he said he believes it now he believes it now I'm real excited I'm excited I'm excited for the third one well they were talking about him fighting Anthony Joshua Tyson Fury fightin Anthony Joshua first and if that does happen I think he beats Anthony Joshua I think Tyson Fury is the best heavyweight on earth and I do and I think the only person that could beat him is probably Wilder if Wilder can recreate the success of the first fight and catch him do you think fights are because I remember like after Tyson stop boxing or after you know he lost I kind of lost a lot of interest in it because I grew up with like Sugar Ray Tommy Hearns and Marvelous Marvin Hagler and I felt like I don't see fights like that anymore well they're they're possible today I mean but you used to see him all the time an Apache amazing fight anytime Terence Crawford fights I'm in I love that guy but don't you admit phenomenal back then it seemed like every fight was a great fight or is that just getting older reminiscent yeah there's some great fighters now Earl Spence tune yer of Vasili Loma chenko I mean it's a great time for boxing so yeah really great friend Lucic is now a heavyweight it's a great time for boxing yes and before you crowd jumps on me like I don't know anything about boxing so I'm not saying anything because I I'm not a boxing expert I know I know some stuff about boxing cuz I'm a fan but it's not like MMA like if someone wants to talk to me about MMA I can give you very educated mm-hmm you know opinions on things and I can dissect things with boxing I have some opinions but you know there's other people that are better at it yeah yeah it's a good time though I like it I'll get into it then I'll get into it man no I'll let you know when something bigs happen when there's a big one you know we do this fight companion I saw her yeah for UFC fights we should do some of them for boxing we've only done it for glory for kickboxing and we've done you should do a boxing one I know we should shit on it for that fight we want to went crazy we would know what fucking crazy that was a wildly knocking down the third round I screamed everybody in my house was like what the fuck is going on I know it's I I I think they should have stopped it in the fifth or sixth a could have done that too yeah but just he's Deontay Wilder make one point one punch he could a one swing in right hand and next thing you know Tyson Fury's got a flashlight in his face you can't believe it what huh it's over what happened that's what Deonte does to people when he hit Luis Ortiz and the spray of sweat flew off his face and Ortiz crumbled and you know this look in his eyes like what just happened that is here by God lightning bolt says true that a lightning bolt come out of the sky like people can't believe how hard he hits but the key to Tyson Fury's victories he didn't let him hit him just jumped on him and Tyson Fury has a unique style like that big motherfucker he's six nine he's so big so big it's so long and he's such a good boxer man no one in the heavyweight division has that kind of head movement oh he's such a character yeah it says he jerked off seven times a day to build his testosterone did you see that no see you say he's gonna wanna settle gypsy Lube he's got his own Lube that he beats off with he says beating off seven times a day increases his testosterone I don't know I don't know if there's facts behind that I don't know that might be conjecture hey where was that special that I saw of you you have a special oh yeah yeah yeah it's on Amazon Prime blasian that's what it's called it's called blasian and what's crazy is it came out probably about eight months last time I was on here but they just released it on DVD so my mom thinks I made it last week on DVD at Best Buy and Target and my mom saw it at Target that's hilarious your mom still buys DVDs yeah I was like who buys DVDs and you know comedy dynamics was like yeah a company wanted to put it out so I was like all right cool but what out but the main thing is I'm gonna be in New York I got this new tour new material I'm exhausted that's what it's called it talks about my two kids the family all the things going on in the world and I'm at Gotham comedy club March 7th and that yeah it's the diapers in the bottles now man is that March it's I think it's March seventh day I'll put the wrong date on there but March 7th and 8th fix that shit I am I am you put the wrong date on the fucking bag oh my goodness on the largest podcast in the world March 7th and 8th 7th and 8th Gotham comedy gonna try buy tickets for the 6th and they're like what maybe they could squeeze you on 6 - no no it's my son's birthday I gotta be there probably why you subliminally accidentally put that do thinking about that number oh man I can't miss my son's brain oh no of course not so Michael yo.com for dick beautiful so this special that's on Amazon like why did they release it now on DVD they said comedy dynamics I guess there's a DVD company that invests in a couple specials a year and for some reason they vested in mine and thought it could do well so and I was like who buys DVDs and they go oh it's about three billion dollars a year still whoa yeah and I'm like okay I'll but most of those like action movies and shit buys DVD people live I don't have a damn that sucks yeah where's that though rural America whoo even rural America has internet and if you have a satellite the people at satellite you can't really stream Netflix and stuff with satellite unless you have really good satelite like how good is good satellite now that's the red box and like man told blockbusters hang in there that's like the original oh yeah they got rid of that no no no I guarantee that no they got rid of I know people that do it use it they got rid of it I get look at are you just guessing no I know I I thought I read an article that said they got rid of that like five years like three or four years ago no I haven't why would look hey give the DVD if you want but I just don't know one person like my mom didn't even buy my DVD that movies delivered right to your mailbox free shipping no late fees is that net yeah DVD combo Netflix calm wow that's crazy so it mixing it in there so the the two facts they said comedy dynamic so it's about three billion dollars a year in Aquaman made seventeen million dollars off of DVDs whoa right really yes a bunch of ladies finger blast themselves to Jayson Benoit as this pausing it's the most paused movie ever it abre they just pause it when it's flexing nobody ever finishes the movie that's the most-watched to movie with a vibrator have you guys li 212 million DVD blu-ray and rentals account for once only three point one point three four percent of Netflix revenue Wow two point seven million subscribers as of last year they made 212 million just from DVDs last year and that's just Netflix just wait winning that's just great that's not even Tony that's running yeah yeah there's money you better Hey Joe you better put out a DVD quick yeah middle America Netflix don't want if they put my shit on DVD I'm sure you can read a girder strange times on DVDs I don't know yeah it's some people are still doing it but I think well that's one thing that I am curious about though like what's the best satellite downloads you can get like what's the satellite download like if you're in the middle of the country you can get satellite internet when the upload is terrible but that's definitely now everybody has good internet Elon trying to fix that problem with yeah he's filling the sky above junk anamur amateur astronomers getting pissed they think they're seeing UFOs just elan satellites what is um have you ever had a test or do you have a test yeah you let it drive yourself on the highway I hit it but I keep my hand the steering okay I love it I never didn't worry no I know it's amazing but my friend was like yeah man I had a Late Show in San Diego and I just let it drive me home I had my hands on the wheel but I wasn't really paying attention I was like that's not crazy that's correct I pay attention but if you are kind of tired it's a good way to just chill out put your hand on the wheel and just let the car do most of the work does a lot of the work so it changes lanes it's already yeah it'll change lanes will do everything yeah you just put in your address and even when you get to the normal streets it'll turn and all that stuff there's a thing that you can get that I got that haven't used that's like some new higher level version of auto drive I haven't done that and I don't necessarily know what that does specifically different than motor I had before but it was a new update it was like four grand so I was like all right let's see Aeon showmen yet no first of all I told Alon I was gonna buy one of those things because he came on the podcast he was telling me about it I was like alright I'll get one I'll get one and I got it and he was right it's the most amazing car I've ever driven most amazing car I've ever driven by far did you get the SUV or the car I got the car okay I got the model SP 100 d which is like the top of the food chain okay S series yes four doors rims everything dude it's so fast it's so fast it doesn't even make sense you you hit the gas it's like you you know there's no gas you hit the accelerator you hit that electricity and you're gone hey that juice you hit the juice and you are on a roller coaster ride it just pins you silent completely silent you like holy fuck there's a holy fuck moment where I take people in my car and I stomp on the gas I'm like you ready like I took Tim Dylan I drove him from The Improv the other night and he got my car you ready he goes yeah I go what the fuck man is that for seconds is that that boost ludicrous mode ludicrous mode 0.4 seconds zero to 60 is insanity it's so fast it's so fast but that's only part of the car the other thing is the comfort it's beautiful it's so smooth and so easy to drive and the dashboard once you get used to having this fucking huge like bigger than any iPad yeah as you say your main navigation screen that navigation is way better and the voice prompts like you can say that like say you you want to talk about a restaurant like like Felix is my favorite restaurant LOX at Los Angeles in Venice I'll say navigate to Felix restaurant in Venice an otoscope and just show you on the thing and like all the sudden is there only gets so the voice commands are so good and it'll just take you there and it'll take you on autopilot if you want and it's it's fucking madness you're living in the future in was LA I my dad you know he's a nuclear physicist and he goes you will never see I mean you'll see the 30 the 44 years I've lived the technology we've seen from not being around to being around yeah he goes they'll improve it it'll get better but all the stuff that was made in that short amount of time that you didn't have the Internet yeah cellphones you know you'll never see that again in a while but it'll be better it'll always get better like you now you have cars that drive themselves new things you know it's crazy man just to think about like because my dad they had a car same type of car just went a little bit faster they added a CD or a 8-track little bits a little bit of right oh now to see the player yeah Oh to take play you know but still a car we go from that to all cars gonna drive self yeah well they have a new Tesla coming out the Tesla Roadster that's one point nine seconds zero to 60 top speed of 250 miles an hour and the range is 600 miles so go 600 miles now getting recharged and it looks dope as fuck it looks like a little spaceship like a little spaceship fucked a Ferrari it's the dopest looking car on the road it's not on the road yet they're still developing it I want it like my thing is not speed like I could care less about speed like yesterday I was literally driving I was like wow I'm flying I was going 58 miles per hour like I'm not about speed at all slide but I am about like I don't ever want to go to the gas station again so I'm thinking about it in the future to get a Tesla or some type of car that where is your house have a little plugged oh yeah we yeah house came with it you know that one are you into the solar thing yet on the on the top of the roof yeah where you yeah well my house right now the I was gonna get Tesla panels yeah but I can't get Tesla panels on my roof cuz the pitch of my roof but I'm getting them on the side of the okay yeah where the lawn is the don't completely open grid yes okay well what if the shit hits the fan son no no you want to keep that refrigerator running you know you don't want to have to fucking try to kill a squirrel in your neighborhoods and you know what it's not I mean look it's a lot of money but it's not as much as you think not to like my friend just did a roof for like 50 grand you know and he'll never have to pay for electricity yeah and you actually sometimes get money back from yeah remove the grid it's uh it's a unique time one of the things that Tesla or Elon is doing that's really intriguing to me that I'm have guarded skepticism not guard its guarded optimism I should say is neuro-link do you know about that I've heard it I heard the podcast when he was talking or I've heard something about him but I gonna drill holes in people's heads and put wires in there yeah what no I'm not for that what what is that where's that gonna go if that gets implement and it will where is you know isn't it you're supposed to be able to like if you think about some it's almost like a computer you'll see it yes be able to download yes you'll be able to access information much quicker it'll increase your bandwidth access information I don't totally understand it I've had to explain to me multiple times but I'm fucking stupid so it doesn't all get in there but what I'm thinking is go back to the iPhone one right and then think about how clunky that little piece of shit is and that was only ten years ago now look at your iPhone whatever that is or this one this is 11 yeah I got a letter too they're fucking amazing yeah they're amazing but but but like it's not gonna get any better there'll be more features but it's not gonna get any better well it's way better in terms of its ability to download things yes like that and then like step a step better how about this the new Samsung phones there's a Samsung Galaxy S 20 asked as 20 ultra that's just about to come out it has five G so the speeds are spectacular for the internet where five g's available and it has a 108 108 megapixel camera that's insane but a hundred times a hundred zoom hundred so that means like you could see some shit that's a hundred times smaller than what you'd be able to see normally okay but why do we need that why do you not need a grandpa but why do you need we need horses horse freedom hey but what do you have treat it well and we have a wonderful relationship that for them what are you gonna take a picture of that you need to zoom that I can't see with one zoom damn okay like how about you some shit is going down how much you're at the Comedy Store you see a fist fight down the street and like these two people are beating the fuck of each other oh my god zoom the shit in okay and you can film it okay from way way way far away reason to have as many megapixels you have now it's not it's fine it's not right for modes now no it's not now a picture that I have in the bathroom of the hooker with hurt it out no I've never been to your bathroom oh there's a picture in the bathroom that I took when I had a flip phone when I was filming fear factor we were in downtown LA and this lady was walking by she was eating a meatball sub she has a wig on in sunglasses it's like I its Lydia's like I hired her to pose for this picture because it's so perfect and she pulls her tit out she goes you want some of this baby and I just snap a picture of it she smiled and she took off and then that picture I put it online in text America which eventually became what Instagram is today and then we found it online got sent it to a printer and it blown up and now it's a framed picture and you would swear I hired someone it's perfectly framed there's like a fucking 18-wheeler behind this lady she's walking with a meatball sub with her tit out I took that a little one megapixel camera it's perfect it's pretty good okay so why do you need a hundred of them this is better this is the concept of the neural link potential app I suppose always an app that they they don't really know I don't think this is just like a concept but it what people linked on here is that a little menu pops up and it says learn skills as though you're in the matrix like maybe download a skill or upload a skill to your brain and now you can the problem with that is everybody that's that's the problem that's the problem - no that's the problem then everybody can do things they don't put any work into you take me that's great yeah just fucking fly across the country you don't even have to traverse though no place where my sister after she's died okay let me put it like this did anybody can do stand-up comedy no you can't well if you have a sport you ain't teaching people shit creatively artistically good look I think you could teach people how to be Dave Chappelle no no chance no but you can't with that but I still do it that's gonna be good for us cuz that all that shit they still can't do that that's true good luck bitch gotta put in those numbers but what that can do is help you download information I don't know what that is gonna be but I know Elon Musk is way smarter than us well it happen in our lifetime yes I think so well you will you do it I'm not gonna be an early adopter yeah it's like people that got the first fake tits those ladies got cancer yeah yeah I'm saying do you know girls getting butt cancer now are they really from fake butts I didn't know that yeah I know I know some botched butt cancer yeah yeah they were the one that I was watching a clip off a botch the other day this girl had a fake butt and they were just trying to fix it and it's just this disaster this poor lady they it was just it's just like the surface the moon was just all dented in fucked up and you know what it is it's the Kardashians man they've ruined it it's well I think it's I think it's every every generation or even century you can go back to the old days where the most of the the body that's hardest to get is the most popular body Kings were fat because they had a lot of food right peasants weren't but they won to be fat right because it showed a sign of money yes and then it was I believe the 50s it was all about rail-thin no but no boobs just rail and then because that was hard to obtain you know because most people aren't born like that now the Kardashians it takes money I guess for a lot of women to achieve that and money in money the amount of money where you don't have the disposable income to do it right so not a lot of people can do it so it seems like the most popular body for women is the body's the hardest to obtain it's never like a normal body is beautiful it's always like no we need very large butts well it's also what you see in media right that's why a lot of women thought that it would be really good to be rail-thin because they saw models because designers closing clothing designers like models to be real thin because then they're like a hanger like there's no weird big tits and big ass that makes wear clothing not stand out that's just about the hanger but what change because it's still like that as far as my yeah with model clothing what clothing so what changed what changed is social media yeah social media there's a lot of but girls that are just online I had a proud moment the other day my nine-year-old we're at a restaurant this lady walked by and my nine-year-old she pulls that meat she goes daddy she's got diaper but cuz that's what I call it I call it diaper but when those girls get fake butts because it looks like they were wearing a full diaper he doesn't fit your legs that doesn't look normal but she goes daddy she's got diaper but I was like yes that's what it is it's diaper but it looks like a diaper their legs are really skinny so crazy because giant dump in your diaper like you just shit your pants and he's just walking around waiting to get home it's a mess but you're right though it's unobtainable on up typical to obtain yeah it's also completely exaggerated right like giant tits small waist enormous ass giant lips yeah that's the saddest one cuz that doesn't work no you look like a fish oh the lip one is such a bad move and you're you're ruining the thing you kiss with it's like your fucking lips what what is than that guys do though that I I can't I was thinking like as if guys did have like big dick implants there were all every guy we're doing a dick stretched out but guys can't have even toupees those guys can't have like if a guy has like fake eyebrows girls like what a guy who fake lips imagine of a guy got us in the gay community to do it though yeah yeah yeah there's certain silly gay guys that get their lips done I've seen gay guys you're talking to him it's like super distracting like just okay so they do with uh okay lip injections yeah they're doing the same thing that a lot of women are doing but the it's just the lips are weird because I think people saw that the tits worked and no one cared like obviously you see a lot of girls with fake tits and no one seems to mind and guys think it's kind of but it did they did mine the first like three or four everybody would have kind of make fun of him but now it's like it's so it's acceptable now what do you play music what are you doing well there's this video that's been going around I was gonna ask if this is like a new thing or just just like the internet got it but like it's a wigs for men but like it's gone viral online a few times over the last few months oh it's like shaving a guy said and then gluing on oh I have seen a wigs you know sweaty that must be whoa I see so is it new though or is this sort of just being redone I don't know and I read a comment because I saw this is gonna stay see that the thing they're saying that duh you replace it every six weeks or something like what happens at week five tries to grab it your hair looks like it's that good Wow no it's like next-level that's amazing damn but see me next week before would it say before what was that before well show it where it said before because before where's before that's after before would before that buddy there you go so there's his hair keep it rolling and it says before oh so you had some hair oh there's ones that the person is completely bald and it looks like that after they're done I've seen the ones with black dudes I've seen black dudes get that and it's real weird like they Oh yeah yeah looking like that it's a straight-up wig yeah oh my god how's it look so they shaved his head let that go let that place stop moving shit around there's like a highlight video shows lots of guys getting this done so you can see lots of versions I want to see that part we were just looking at go back to that part we were just looking at where they're working on the glue does that happen that guy has one too yeah that's so good oh my god it's so weird and then well the stem-cell treatments that they have for hair loss are very interesting that oh shit is actually working where they're actually growing hair back through stem but you have to have the hair to grow back believe that's that that's the misconception a lot of people have about it if you don't if you've lost the hair it's all gone if it's all gone it doesn't come back if you have a little didn't can yeah that's a girl's not gonna like that so like guy's a fake shit I dated a girl when I first moved to LA she has shaved head she wore wigs all time I didn't give a fuck but imagine if I just started wearing wigs everywhere my wife feel like what are you doing my guess my new look things like this that I've noticed have popped back up and gotten famous again like they've already been around the 80s and 90s but like because people weren't online or it just didn't go viral in that way it's snuck back in and people like oh look at this brand-new thing and it's like it's not new at all I didn't even know women had fake hair - I moved to LA oh we just do weaves I didn't I knew nothing about it so first time I looked at what a girl out here when I first moved here I went out like you know she was in bed and I went out to the living room and I I thought it was an animal it was her hair like I didn't know that they did that and then I started working for eat they had a wall full of hair for all the girls a wall full of hair so they would like for different girls they would they had color that matched their hair yeah each girl had their own like row a hair and when you'd like when you're from Texas what you like in Texas I never saw that and I was just shocked that it went to that the great I didn't even know that happen well I think girls are doing that in Texas too they just didn't tell you well that's a common thing that we've no I I don't think it's what at that time I don't think no because I think it's more of a TV thing mmm what's definitely more of a TV because they're like oh we need your hair longer you're shorter thicker in Texas they wouldn't do that yeah maybe nah that was weird I wonder what's happening to people the people are losing hair like we're evolving right if you go if you look at all the other primates none of the other primates as they get older lose their hair but we have less hair than all the primers Yeah right so our whole bodies are losing hair and where the weird thing is like we definitely came from them if you pay attention like we play this guy put this guy on the images on the podcast before what his name ruslan shiev he's this Russian wrestler who is a gorilla he's a gorilla man and he's a fucking savage he just throws people around like ragdolls but you looking at me like oh well clearly this guy is in a different stage of evolution than some of us you know he's like he's more more savage but as people evolve further and further I think we're gonna look like aliens I think we're gonna lose all our hair and I think we're gonna grow big ass heads because you don't need the hair you know you need the hair that Elon Musk neural link is gonna change the way our brains function we're gonna do everything with our brains we're gonna be communicating through those things the the 50 or 60 enough that you know just like the iPhone one versus the samsung galaxy s twenty one hundred and eight megapixel camera if you came out with that camera and that phone 10 years ago they accuse you of witchcraft yeah who the fuck are you what is this how'd you do this in you know a thousand years we're probably all gonna look like that you know what I know you're big on aliens I just don't believe it I mean we talked about this last time believe it at all I believe this other citations life forms just don't believe they've been here I don't think they're coming here no I there's no reason to come here we are offering nothing what are you talking about what are we offering Joe well if you're that far people travel to go study small mammals in the Congo do you know that yes they spend giant chunks of their life to go look at butterflies we found a new frog in South America and the nationally grad Geographic Society will give them money we've gonna document this frog people are curious and anything that's going to be intelligent and innovative anything that's going to invent technology the only reason why you invent technology is because you are curious and if you are curious you're not going to stop being curious you're going to continue to be curious and if you have a fucking whole planet filled with predatory Apes that have thermonuclear weapons and they want to control various patches of land that they've designated on maps with lines and they put stupid fucking fences up and they nuke each other and they fucking fly planes and drop bombs out and they have other planes that they fucking operate remotely with these little joysticks and drop bombs on people we killed terrorists and some of the people that run the country are terrorists and and then you have for the stock market like what the fuck are these people doing the stock market's what is that a bunch of numbers that are bouncing around they're trying to speculate what's going to go this and it's based on confidence oh my god these people are crazy and then they have the ability to some video through the air and it reaches their phone on the other side of the world instantaneously like whoa this is really heavy stuff these fucking crazy monkeys down on planet Earth are weird we should study them of course they would study us there we're sending rockets into space we're invading other other planets in our solar system to try to colonize if they're coming here yeah that's basic to them all that stuff you just mentioned is oh shit bases who is it - so you know to get here they have to have technology we haven't even know they don't know they have to have technology that's slightly more advanced than us we will be able to unquestionably travel to other planets within a hundred years or 200 years let's say three let's say 300 okay so it's comparing us to people that live in 1720 right that's not that long okay so it's like we went back in time to visit people in the 1700s we would be fascinated and we would be very interested if we found a planet somewhere 300 years from now that had people on that planet that lived like people lived here in the 1700s we would be blown away I just think it's the most unique and interesting thing we've ever found ever in life I just don't know with everyone having a cellphone can take footage why don't they have like real why don't multiple people have the same footage of the same thing like it had they do there are some sightings particularly the Phoenix lights that happened in the 90s that many many people captured we don't know exactly what they are they don't know what it but this a lot of people captured these lights that are in the sky now my take on the Phoenix lights and a lot of these things is usually that there's some sort of a military aircraft are working on mm-hmm but here's the thing they don't have to visit all the time if they only visited once or twice these unique experiences that have happened once or twice over the course of human history or three times or ten times or a hundred times what are the odds that anyone's going to capture it especially if they're smart about it especially they're smart about how they come especially if they have some sort of cloaking apparatus or they have some ability to understand whether or not they're being viewed or observed and know knowing how to hide or how to camouflage the ships but of course they would be interested in I know that's the least plausible scenario that they wouldn't be interested in us the the thing that kind of the thing that was interested in me when you interviewed snow his he's been through everything and he found no it's noted he found no evidence but he hasn't been through everything first of all he's only one man and he was only working there for a short amount of time okay it's not what he had access to last but it's not like he's working there for hundreds of years and deeply diving into the subject of UFOs and has access to and not only that like what does he have access to is access to the NSA files and like everything's compartmentalized you know that's one of the big problems that the military said the NASA does not have access to what the Navy has access to which doesn't have access to what the Army has access to like they don't always cooperate and just so for him to say that he didn't find anything about UFOs that makes sense like he probably even looked a little bit and didn't find thing about UFOs that doesn't mean there's nothing about UFOs it just means that he didn't find anything okay okay there's a lot of information out there when you think about one person that's gonna scour all the government records understand the 1950s to present about what they've discovered and what they haven't so you so area 51 what do you think that's in there do you think they're now you think okay I think at one point in time is what well it is for sure one point time what they use to work on secret military projects what aircrafts and that's where the Blackbird came out of that's where the stealth bomber came out of there was a lot of that stuff that a lot of people mistook for UFOs I think the real question lies in the very small percentage of unexplained sightings so if you look at UFO sightings you take the pie of UFO sightings I would say there's a not me they say what they're talking about that's been solved is someone in the neighborhood have 95% of those 95 percent can be explained by swamp gas ball lightning ball lightning is a phenomenon that comes when depending upon tectonic pressure the earth can release this lightning that of the ground that travels in a ball shaped pattern and zigs through the sky and then vanishes and disappears they don't totally understand how it's being created but they do know it requires some pressure in the earth something about tectonic plates and possibly different atmospheric conditions but it's a real observable phenomena that's actually occurred on planes before like it's flown down the done the passageway of a jet at one point in time yeah and people multiple people observe this ball lightning and they thought they were being aborted by a fucking UFO or something it's a weird even I've seen it no it's very weird phenomena you see get get a video on we should probably wrap this up tune it's three hours and 30 minutes [Laughter] get that get get a video on ball lightning because they have observed this in film this it's really fascinating that's that's responsible for a lot of UFO signs but you said there's that five percent that actually be out of that five percent four percent they just haven't figured out how to explain like let me see this see like that is ball lightning okay hovering in the sky and sometimes they'll fly around sometimes not only do they hover in place but they move around so lightning crackles and then this thing will hover in the sky and then sometimes they actually come out of the ground you know this is bad comparison probably but it's almost like an ash you know when you this is a bad video see if there's some you know I understand but the problem is there's all this other people talking in it there's different videos with ball lightning that I've watched it's pretty interesting shit man ball lightning is weird because it's uh it's see like there it's okay it flies around and it looks like a fucking UFO see and then disappears so okay that's a weird one that's a weird one that kind of looks like it would be an alien spacecraft and then they get videos of it and you know it looks like a ball flying through the sky oh my god but it's just a very rare atmospheric occurrence huh oh yeah yeah but I think if I was an alien species 500 years more advanced than we are I would be fucking fascinated by earth and that was that's all you need 500 years from now with the exponential growth of technology like we're experiencing on earth 500 years from now if we don't blow ourselves up or if they're different than us like maybe they evolved different and they don't have the same battle for resources so they didn't develop the kind of territorial behavior that us apes have if they develop something more complex and a different sort of cooperative evolutionary mechanism they could be very different than us but still way more advanced but interested in us okay all right will you ever see one in your lifetime always said I always if if I ever do smoke weed I'm gonna smoke weed my first time with Joe roughly how do you not want to smoke weed huh are you curious oh of course what are you scared of nothing so why don't you do it well I said if I ever smoked weed I'll smoke it for the first time we're just not on air I'm not Elon Musk or anything well I'm not scared of it at all well I just interested not curious I mean it the curiosity does not like knock on the door every day and go oh my god I guess we should just set a date aside three years from now think about it for three years no I've already decided I'm gonna do it okay when huh next week you camera off the camera no we know do you got a driver yeah I got a drive home I wanna do the other day another day a hundred percent okay hundred percent maybe we'll do it and we'll meet aliens aliens visit you tonight no they're not leave now you know what I'm here I can guarantee you nobody's coming today that's they're gonna get him now like this motherfucker needs a lesson from space you see this Oh last question who's gonna win Bernie Sanders the truck you know Wow everybody thought that Donald Trump's fucked and that Hillary Clinton was gonna beat him and that no one was concerned yeah all these people like he doesn't have a chance Hillary's gonna be the winner and Hillary's gonna be the winner that same shit could be going on with Bernie Sanders and Trump and people got to be real careful about that these people that think that Bernie Sanders can't win I don't think you understand what's going on in this country people are fed up with the system they're fed up with this idea that they work so hard and they they give their money up to politicians and the politicians don't really work for the people they don't they don't can I tell you the most annoying thing a politician says well you know I speak for the American people I'm like no you don't know no not a chance there's not a single human that could speak for all the amid look out for the interests of the American people and I think Bernie Sanders definitely does do that I think he's looking out for the interests of the working people and I think he wants people to have a better life and do better and I'm all for that and if that means I have to pay more in telling people think oh you're a socialist I've heard people say that oh you're fucking socialist bro like first of all he's not even a socialist he's a Democratic Socialist it's a different thing he's not necessary and we should all give up our money to the institution and then the institutions to decide how it gets divided and you shouldn't be able to make more than X amount of dollars that's not what he's saying he's saying is it should work for the people and what he's saying is people should have health care what he's saying is there's a there's a lot of things that are already socialist ideals that we use we just forgot about it like the fire department yep the fire department you don't have a at fire department that puts out your fire we pay for the fire department it comes out of our taxes pays those those very brave men and women and then they come and they put out your fire that's a socialist idea public schools are a socialist idea police are socialist idea fixing of the roads there's a lot of things that your money goes to the idea that you we can't extend that and to have a better life because of it and to have free health care and free college education and to eliminate student debt I don't know that that's incorrect I don't know that he's wrong yeah I just think it's a thing where our government to me and I'm no expert but it seems like they throw so much money away why not if you're gonna throw it away do something good with it you know and it seems like we had to throwing it away that exact that would be actually doing something good with yeah he's got crazy ideas and if they're right it's revolutionary mm-hm and that's what he thinks he thinks he can enact revolutionary change - free healthcare revolutionary win pretty much the whole yeah because it's gonna take out the drug companies and there's a lot of money a lot of money a lot of money that's a big problem yes that's one of our biggest problems is the amount of influence that not just the drug companies have but a lot of industry has on the way politicians decide how to spend your money yes and that's what he says but it's that's that's one of the things he's saying that makes people scared and that's why the the Democrats are scared of him too because they're all getting paid as well yeah it's not like this is a Republican thing only no listen this is a fucking this is an established institution thing but it also proves that like with Michael Bloomberg spending all this money that when he goes to Super Tuesday he's gonna get 13% of their guesstimating about 13% it's just and he's gonna pass up a lot of people that have been campaigning it shows you how much money you know even can play in in our politics by being on every five minutes yeah you know he's not gonna win blowing on no he's not gonna win it's gonna be a tax write-off for him Jamie will be telling me about people getting paid to say things for him more than just like spending lots of money on like the people posted online like the memes and by making all sorts of accounts like went after all of the not on a top but like Instagram accounts like the influenced me me accounts really and there's some money strategy yeah give him some money like hey what will you do to post this and they are not posting the conversation instead of what they're asking a post which that was the strategy it's like these weird strategies they have think-tank spending millions of dollars to get that done thinking it's going to you know you know what I do like about Bernie Sanders he's the exact and now don't take this wrong the exact same energy and vibe that Trump has on it loud says it like it is to him whatever his thoughts are so really if they go against each other it's almost the same person I'm not talking policies at all I'm just saying this characteristics you know where Bernie's not gonna back down from Trump and Trump's not gonna back down against Bernie and all these people going well I don't know if Bernie's electable it's like there are no rules anymore can we just say him not being electable yes we did ones three primaries in a row that's what I'm saying yeah it's just it's just for day I'm just I'm just waiting to see how it plays out I'm the one where it's like you know let's just see I want to see who the Democratic person is and and then we all gotta roll with them if you're on that side its Bernie yeah I think it's gonna be Bernie unless he has a heart attack at the CIA gets them with that fucking election well you know you know what it is it's not about Bernie it's if he becomes president who's the vice president because Barney's old no no and I'm not wishing anything yell but that vice president pick is it very important especially after the heart thing yeah it's very important and a lot of people are saying he should get Elizabeth Warren because you because his age is more dangerous than she is useful okay like I don't know well don't trust her after that whole Pocahontas shit all the Indian stuff where she said she was Native American and turns out she's like 1/100 of a percent or whatever the fuck it is but is that be small in today's instance oh she was a Republican for most of her career yeah and she turned over and became a Democrat man maybe maybe she would get the women on their side I think but she's also an established Democrat you know that that takes money I think be more likely that he would get someone that we haven't heard of okay well it's very important we realize president because I'm just saying remember Mike Pence like I already knew the fuck Mike Pence was before Donald Trump made him our vice president you go on the street and ask people who the Vice President is 99% of them won't know Mike Pence's yeah all right I think the real battle is Bernie and Trump that's a real bad no no no I got you and I don't think the vice president's gonna move the election but I'm saying because well because he's all had the heart problem yeah you know the vice president is more important than like an Obama vice president I think that's also Gabbard makes the most sense because she's also like him she doesn't accept money it's the same same sort of renegade philosophy you know slightly different politics but you know there's a I think he has a lot of options he's probably looking at him right now especially if he keeps winning it's like that Joe Rogan let's bring him up no chance no well when you do note it after he wins when you go to White House is just just bring your boy right here because I want to go to White House with you the last brouhaha after he put that video up and everybody got upset oh he'll have you I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna see that regular politics the way they've been practiced for all these years in this country with like these two bullshit choices are gonna go away and I think it's gonna be harder and harder for established people whether it's Republican or Democrat to to keep doing that song and dance and having people buy it and that's a good thing that's a good thing
